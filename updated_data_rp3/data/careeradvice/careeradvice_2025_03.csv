1jog1vl,Confused on what to study. Need advice,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm a 19F in my first year at the University of Waterloo. I‚Äôm currently majoring in Public Health, but I‚Äôve come to realize I genuinely don‚Äôt enjoy it‚Ä¶ like, at all.

Before starting uni, I took a gap year to try and figure out what career path I actually wanted to pursue, but I didn‚Äôt really land on anything solid. I ended up applying to Public Health mostly because I got a full-ride scholarship to Waterloo and just picked something I thought would lead to a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù job after graduation.

Fast forward to now ‚Äî I‚Äôm doing well grade-wise, but I‚Äôm super bored with the program. I don‚Äôt feel any real interest in it, especially when I see how passionate some of my classmates are. The thought of working in this field long-term makes me lowkey dread the future.

What I‚Äôve¬†*always*¬†been drawn to is finance and computer science, but switching into either of those at Waterloo feels basically impossible from my current program. I also really don‚Äôt want to transfer schools and risk losing my scholarship ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full ride and honestly a huge deal for me and my family.

So now I feel stuck. Is there anyone in tech or finance who started off in something totally unrelated? Any tips on how to pivot from where I‚Äôm at? Are there any programs, minors, or certificates at Waterloo that are a bit more accessible but still lead to those kinds of careers? Maybe a way to combine both interests?

1jofjlf,I feel ‚Äústuck‚Äù in my first job out of college,"I‚Äôm honestly just mentally exhausted contemplating what to do with my situation to buckle in. 

I started off in a job straight out of college semi-related to my career path (degree in finance and accounting, started in internal audit). It wasn‚Äôt my #1 pick but I loved the manager I interviewed and I was shocked when they came back and offered $15K more than what I was expecting when I was entering the workforce. I took the job not knowing the monster I was walking into. Two weeks into the job, my manager who I adored left. I was super bummed and basically spent the first two months without a manager trying to navigate my first job out of college without a mentor. Meanwhile, I started to learn more about the director and senior director of my department - none of which were good things. 

In the absence of a manager, I was reporting to the director who is in another country with a 7 hour time difference. She very rarely ever reached out, gave me any direction when I asked for work, or even had 1-1 with me. They finally hired a manager three months in. He was great, and I had a mentorship. Unfortunately, he saw the incompetency of the director and senior director and was with us for only 6 months. Same story with my manager in a different country - never reached out to help or see how I was doing. Only ever spoke to me when she needed something. I have had very little work the entirety of the time I have been here and the lack of guidance from management has been a nightmare. The irony is that management makes us fill out time sheets (mind you, we are SALARY and not an accounting firm). I am currently waiting on a 3rd manager (mind you a $150k job at my company). This will be three managers in the one year I have been here. 

All of this being said, I can‚Äôt sleep at night. I‚Äôm miserable come Sunday and throughout the week. I‚Äôve tried to spend the free time upscaling at work (studying for CPA) but I just want meaningful work. I‚Äôve asked and been denied so many times and recently had another coworker leave for the same reason. How should I go about approaching this? I don‚Äôt want to leave the company as it is a growing company with pretty solid pay. This is where I feel stuck. I feel like if I wait it out until another department has an opening, I can slide in. I also feel constrained due to the solid pay. But I‚Äôm tired of waiting for the role as I have had little to no work in the last two months basically without a manager. I know ideally you want 2-3 years experience on your resume for your first job out of college but I just can‚Äôt take it anymore.

I am in a bit of predicament. I currently work as a sales executive at a job in which I loathe however I have luckily found a position that is aligned with the degree I am pursuing. 

Now the issue is the new position start date is in June and we are at the end of March early April. I have a good amount of cash saved for expenses so I was considering leaving in April and taking most of May off to vacation a bit and catch up on school. I have 80 hours of unused PTO, I am curious.... how should I use this PTO? 

My thought is to put in my two weeks within the next couple days and use that PTO for the 2 last weeks of April. Would this be too risky?

1joea44,"Should I just quit? Hostile work environment, a manager that doesn‚Äôt actually know what is going on, a complaint to HR made (and not followed up on with me), only to hear about it from my boss 2 months later","I will try and spell this out the best I can, please bear with me. 

I have been at this company going on my 10th year now. Ever since I got reshuffled to this new team, I‚Äôve been receiving different instructions for the same task based on who I ask and sometimes what day of the week I ask. A coworker showed me how to complete certain steps for a migration, then after a month went by where I was unable to work on this part due to a bad configuration, this same coworker did a recorded call and screenshare that contained none of the previous instructions he had told me. There were 3 of us as his audience, and at the end he said ‚Äúfeel free to reach out if you have any questions.‚Äù  I rewatched this entire call two more times to make sure it wasn‚Äôt something I had missed, and then reached out with a few questions. I was immediately met with ‚Äúdid you watch the video?‚Äù followed by some suggestions, including the way I was noting things down was ‚Äúconfusing me‚Äù and to use a spreadsheet. I assured this man that I wasn‚Äôt confused by my notes. 

When I had to take my pet to a vet appointment that had been in my calendar for weeks, another teammate (we‚Äôll call him Jim) thought it was ‚Äúsuspicious behavior‚Äù (?!?) and he let everyone on our group chat know. He claimed I was ‚Äúmaking mistakes‚Äù working the evening before, and this simply wasn‚Äôt the case- I had a workaround for some tasks he told my manager we were unable to perform unless conditions X, Y, and Z had been met. I pointed out we could just create a ‚Äúdummy object‚Äù to enable us to proceed on with further configuration so things would be all ready to go for when the ‚Äúreal objects‚Äù were created; I‚Äôm not sure why but he didn‚Äôt even respond to this suggestion, but rather said ‚Äúmaybe you should just do what we tell you cause we spent a year making sure this was set up correctly.‚Äù  I was able to confirm later that the ‚Äúdummy object‚Äù would not cause any issue and indeed would‚Äôve been extremely useful to create and then delete. 

‚ÄúJim‚Äù has seemingly had it out for me ever since I returned from a leave of absence, and indeed before that (he would call me up just to scream at me for being an idiot).  His behavior has been outright hostile, and after a couple months of wrestling with the decision, I decided it was time to file a complaint as I had repeatedly brought this kind of thing up to my manager and his response was ‚ÄúJim will be Jim.‚Äù

HR is supposed to respond to all complaints within 5-6 business days.  I filed the complaint near the end of January, and after following up with each new incident that happened and asking if they were going to contact me, to just forget about it but please keep it on file.  Then I find out that they ignored my request to speak with me first before taking any action, as my boss said to me in last week‚Äôs meeting ‚ÄúSo you filed a complaint against Jim?‚Äù  I was caught off guard but basically said yes of course I did, I‚Äôve been bringing these issues up to you for months and nothing changed. Jim even had to apologize to me for his comments in various group chats that served no purpose other than to point out some mistake he felt I‚Äôd made. 

Long story short.. nothing has changed; I got my access to one of our main systems that we support revoked by Jim, my manager approved the request without reading it. When I pointed it out to him he said he would get it figured out.. it is now some 3 weeks later, I still have no access yet in my PIP he has an item for me to complete which REQUIRES access to these systems.  

On the first iteration of this PIP, which I only received 2 weeks ago (note that I returned in late September 2024), my manager had a list of issues that were supposedly my fault. As we met, I could tell he didn‚Äôt want to hear any rebuttal during the meeting‚Äî fair enough, he‚Äôs busy. So I took my time to very thoroughly prove that 9 out of 10 issues listed were most definitely not caused by any action I took. When I asked him about this a week later, he said something to the effect of ‚Äúnot much I can do about it, it‚Äôs like he said she said at this point.‚Äù  This infuriated me. 

The thing is, my administrative access that got revoked was to a system that is undergoing a major migration, and now I‚Äôm left with essentially documentation. With the complaint, I have a feeling that Jim told all my other coworkers about it, because I have not heard a word from any of them over the previous 10 days or so. 

My mental health is in serious jeopardy right now, and I still don‚Äôt have a clear answer on why my access was suddenly revoked, so I‚Äôm left to assume that they believe I would be logging in and *purposefully creating issues with the application itself.*  The really stupid part is that I still have server access as well as admin through another method that I‚Äôd prefer not to share, in case Jim somehow comes across this post. 

I am sorry for the length but I could go on for days. I‚Äôm fed up and about ready to give them the equipment back and say ‚Äúgood fucking riddance‚Äù to this team. None of these guys even come to the office when they‚Äôre supposed to be in, and the group/team chat is very cliquey (manager jokes around and puts heart emojis on others‚Äô messages, but mine go completely unanswered, that kind of thing).  I bring up things that could be automated and am met with silence. I automated a very large portion of the work for a couple environments only to be told ‚Äúwell you missed a day of work (I was sick) and these scripts weren‚Äôt tested (yes they were).‚Äù

I am at a loss on how to continue. Each day is eroding my self confidence and morale, and between my manager‚Äôs lack of follow through in getting access restored and then being isolated seemingly because of the complaint to HR, I **know** this is a losing battle. I do have a resume prepared and may even have a line on a new job, but wtaf?? Should I just quit?? I have plenty of savings to last me at least a good year or two. 

Edit: I was placed on a PIP last year because of some mental health issues that were causing mistakes. Since returning I have been taking diligent notes and keeping my task list on point.  If anything needs additional clarification please let me know. It was another cruel day at the office and I‚Äôm typing everything from memory the best I can.

1joe2kz,Seeking advice on pivoting from Tech Support to Technical Writing,"Hello all,

I've been working in Tech Support for the better part of a decade, am quite good at it. I have been at a state agency for the last year or so but I absolutely, positively cannot deal with inbound phone calls anymore. When I switch jobs, I'm good for about a year before I get burnt out and start resenting people who call in before I even pick up the phone. 

Recently an opening came up for Technical Writer at a similar state agency, exact same pay rate/scale, it's a lateral move. I am paid quite comfortably for tech support, especially considering the type of calls I get. This is easily the cushiest tech support gig I've ever had. It's not difficult, I'm paid handsomely, it's fully remote, there is often a considerable amount of downtime, but it's completely devoid of fulfillment and I'm falling into the same trap of burnout and wanting to move on so I don't self-sabotage. The biggest difficulty is the fact that a phone call can come at any time and could be any person with any issue. Some of them are literally resizing windows for grown-ass adults, some of them are stressed out, asshole executives who are entitled and belittling. I probably have some low-level form of PTSD from my years of doing this, but the whole thing is... extremely unpleasant.

With the writing gig, I'm not sure if it's fully remote, hybrid, or in office, but the prospect of working as a writer, getting paid for it, interfacing with SMEs and pulling together documentation that is worth reading, that is a bit closer to fulfilling. The biggest thing I'm looking forward to is not being subjected to the randomness of a call queue, getting to write for a living, but I also recognize that there will be deadlines, there will be asshole SMEs and coworkers just as entitled and unpleasant as some callers are, failures, limitations, probably not a lot, if any, down time, etc. 

At any rate, I'm just looking to see if anyone might have a perspective they'd be willing to share. I'm putting the cart before the horse a bit, I'm still waiting to hear about the final round of interviews, but I'm highly confident I'll be selected as the applicant pool is small, I interview well, and my resume is stellar. Having a partner who is a hiring manager at yet another state agency to help guide me through the process doesn't hurt either.

I mostly use programs like bluebeam, partnerpak+ studio, Autocad and the Microsoft suite of products. 

Currently, I don‚Äôt hold a degree, although I occasionally use Autocad in my work. However, I lack any formal certification for Autocad, which means I don‚Äôt feel comfortable putting it on my resume as a skill I have. I‚Äôm in my early 20s, so I‚Äôm considering pursuing a bachelor‚Äôs degree in construction management or obtaining certifications from colleges specializing in those programs. I have a large interest in product development and design however I don‚Äôt really want to go the engineering or architecture route, at least not yet. 

While I don‚Äôt plan to leave my current field, I‚Äôve heard that certifications, even major ones, can be largely ineffective in helping out in the hiring process. I‚Äôve seen some post on other forums argue that a degree is a more valuable investment and that anything else is a waste of money and time. I‚Äôd appreciate hearing different opinions before making a decision.

1joc596,Bad Manager,"Need help building my confidence to do what I ultimately think needs done. 

Some background: I work as a building maintenance supervisor for a luxury multifamily management company. I started back in July of 2024, I left my old company because greener grass or whatever but have since realized I was dead wrong. 

At first my manager was super cool. Very charismatic, knowledgeable, even keeled, etc. In the past few months, though, our dynamic has morphed into one where I'm constantly being questioned, the goal posts are always moving, and there is little to no human interaction anymore. I can't remember the last time she even said good morning to me or was satisfied that a project was completed on time and within budget without questioning every single aspect of it. I could go on and on but I think it's pretty clear. 

The last straw came on Monday. My father passed away unexpectedly recently and in a manner that was fairly traumatic for myself and my family. Dad passed on a Friday and on Monday when I went to her office to tell her what happened and coordinate my time off, she didn't even bother to stop typing or even look up from her computer at all. No ""sorry for your loss"" no ""arenyou okay"" Nothing. She just said (with an annoyed and impatient tone) ""okay, just put it in a calendar invite"". I came back to work today to find out she spent the entire week I was gone talking shit and telling my coworkers that she didn't believe my father had died until the obituary went up. 

I am at my wits end and have lost all respect for my manager and my company but leaving now will completely screw my resume. This is the first time in my career I have ever been in a position like this and I'm scared this is going to completely derail my career track.

At an animal shelter but apparently where I‚Äôm at there is. To begin, when I interviewed with this place I was in a room with 3 people that would chuckle after talking to me. When hired on, we discussed my schedule which seemed okay with all of us. Then I started working and no one was there to train or give me a tour around the building so I knew where I was. Very unprofessional right? Gets worse. The staff start calling me a N***** and a F***** when I wouldn‚Äôt stop what I‚Äôm doing and do something for them. Then an employee had told me to go to this room and pour bottles of bleach into a bucket and fill up bottled containers with more bleach, mind you, it‚Äôs a small room with no windows and they kept shutting the door on me when walking out. They came in the room and pour the bleach out on my feet and said ‚ÄúI know you were trained to do it this way but I want you to do it my way‚Äù and demands I do it again. That‚Äôs when I started video recording everything I was doing because people weren‚Äôt gonna believe what I was going through. You can hear on video them calling me these names and talking to me with an encrypted communication where everything didn‚Äôt make sense. 

I made a tik tok about it which got a bit of recognition and the next day of work, no one talked to me anymore. Which was good for me but then they were demanding I did all of their work and then walking away.

1jo9jc6,Thinking About a Career in Archaeology ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Reality Like?,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been really drawn to the idea of studying archaeology and possibly anthropology.

I'm trying to figure out if this is a realistic and stable path, so I wanted to ask people who‚Äôve actually worked or studied in the field.

A few questions I‚Äôm hoping you can help with:

* What‚Äôs the job security really like for archaeologists or anthropologists (especially those who don‚Äôt want to go the full PhD route)?
* Is it actually possible to build a career in CRM with just a bachelor‚Äôs and field school experience?
* What does the work-life balance look like in field-based archaeology jobs? Would I have to move away from Florida?
* Are there any non-academic paths that still let you do meaningful work in archaeology or anthropology without endless schooling?
* How do people handle the seasonal/contract nature of some of the entry-level roles, does it ever lead to something more permanent?
* And just being honest, how much of the degree is actually fun, and how much is just grinding through gen eds and theory?

Starting from the beginning: In 2020, I was fresh out of college and looking for a job (really any job) because I graduated with an Exercise Science degree and did not want to go to Physical Therapy school anymore. I got a job with a Medicare company in sales/marketing. I hated that job, but I got a promotion in 2021 and was good at my job and a hard worker. It‚Äôs hard to remember but I think the salary was $39,000. I was desperate to leave and to break into true content, digital, or product marketing. 

In February 2022, I finally found another job with a reputable technology company - it was an entry level product marketing position and the compensation was $62,000. I loved my manager, the hours were flexible, and I was doing really well at this job. I worked with a lot of people on the digital marketing team and learned so much from them, and I discovered that‚Äôs really what I wanted to be doing. My manager knew this and was so supportive, but I was nervous to make the jump over to a different team. I went out on maternity leave Jan 2024 and returned late March early April 2024. April 2024 there was an annual salary review and I got a 2% raise - now making $65,000. While I was gone, the marketing dept went through a restructuring and when I returned my manager told me it was the perfect time to transition. She set me up with the digital marketing director for an interview (informal) and I told him my passion and skill set. There was a new team that was being formed at the time with positions that my company had never had before. I was moved over May 2024 - no title change or compensation adjustment. We were told that HR was slammed with all the changes but that they were coming and everyone would be evaluated. Time went by, I assumed this new role with completely different responsibilities, and nothing has changed officially with my title or compensation. Dec 2024 I reached out to my manager and their supervisor for another update and to ask if when the annual salary review came around, would the % increase be based on my current salary or the benchmark salary for my new position. I also asked what that benchmark salary was. They told me the benchmark for my new position was $108k, but that years of experience and location would also play a factor.

I‚Äôve always wanted to be financially comfortable and live a great life while also loving my career. I am just concerned that being stuck in a 9 to 5 forever will not provide me that but I also don‚Äôt want to be a dreamer, I am trying to be a realist. 

I feel even though it is an unpopular opinion. Perseverance in your own startup business of any kind is far more likely to reap the rewards eventually of lifelong financial freedom than a 9 to 5 job in the creative sector. It‚Äôs hard to become rich when someone else chooses how much you make. 

With freelancing your earning potential is within your control. Whereas in a 9 to 5 you are capped at how much a company is willing to offer you. Thats how I see it. So a lot of thinking to do and I‚Äôm in two minds. 

Any advice is welcomed but please stay respectful of my choices. Thank you. ",Antidotebeatz,0,0.4000000059604645,1,1743435988,2025-03-31 15:46:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jo6bmt/ive_been_stuck_in_low_paying_jobs_for_a_while/,3,2025

1jo57rg,Bad First Job Experience - How to Leave,"Hi all‚Äî

Started my career as an attorney not too long ago. My firm has been a total nightmare (I‚Äôve lost 20 lbs in a matter of months from stress). Started looking for a new job expecting it to be a long process and immediately started getting offers. I‚Äôve turned down a few for various reasons, and now I‚Äôve got a decent offer. Not perfect, but I know no job will be perfect. 

Honestly though, I think what‚Äôs holding me back the most is the fear of finding myself in a similar situation as this. The people seem fine from the interviews I‚Äôve had, but the firm I‚Äôm at also seemed fine when I interviewed (maybe I‚Äôm bad at reading people?). 

Everyone in my life wants me to take this job, but I‚Äôm just so terrified of getting stuck there. I‚Äôm at a point where once I jump to another job, I‚Äôm going to need to stay there for at least a year to avoid raising alarms on my resume. 

I know‚Äî ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù are a killer. No one can tell him if it‚Äôll be a good environment or now. I did get a chance to talk to someone who used to work there (they stated their reason for leaving was the commute and wanting a different area of law), and they said they enjoyed their time there. I‚Äôm just so scared.

At least here I have a support system (my bosses are awful but the other people I work with are great). I also just keep hoping it‚Äôll get better.

1jo4gg1,Help!,"I am a full-time nanny originally from Brazil, and I relocated to the United States approximately three years ago. Prior to my move, I was on the verge of graduating with a master‚Äôs degree in Psychology. However, I made the decision to pursue a different path. This year, I will be turning 25, and my wife is currently working toward her master‚Äôs degree in Psychology. After much reflection, I have decided to return to school.

While I no longer see myself pursuing a career in Psychology, after completing career assessments and considering my interests, I have identified several fields that resonate with me: Human Resources, Nursing, Social Work, and Teaching. However, I do not see myself pursuing teaching, nor do I believe I am suited for a nursing program. I am more inclined toward working within a corporate environment and pursuing a 9-5 type of career.

1jo43zh,I Lied on my Job Application and now I have an Interview..,"I blatantly lied on my job application, and now I have an interview. Which is also on April fools day.

Here's the story

Before you dig into me, here's exactly what I said on the application form:

'For 4 years I brought in big money clients, I ensured optimal satisfaction through precision pincer movemtns elite-level verage distribution. I also polish gold cutlery GRRR rar! My role extended beyond service‚ÄîI expertly navigated high-stakes corporate disputes and brought honor to my dynasty. Long live wu tang clan.'

Yes I know there is typos, I Intentionally left them in.

I wrote this under the 'job experience section', and obviously, I was not taking the application seriously whatsoever. Purely for my own amusement, I was having some backwards fun and I thought 'the odds of me actually getting this job are slim - so I might as well mess it up and blabber a bit'. I Screwed up the application yapped some nonsense and then forgot about it for a week and didn't expect a response.

Then to my absolute surprise, I got contacted through email by¬† HP themselves about the sales internship role inviting me to schedule an online interview to have on Tuesday Extraordinarily, despite putting absolutely no effort into the hiring process. So here I am now.

Quite evidently - what I wrote - is a satirical story.¬† I am absurdly exaggerating my job experience and personal skills, remarking that I solved corporate disputes all while working as a front of house waiter in a small hotel in my home town¬† that I worked at over the past 4 summers and now - it seems like - they actually believe me.

I can't figure out what they think of me, all the email communications were professional and I stayed 'serious tone' with them. But I'm having trouble reading into what they think of me, it's like trying to read a brick wall. They genuinely see me as a good job prospect?

TFor some basic background: I'm 19, an engineering student in Glasgow, Scotland. The job I applied for is a sales intern position at HP (the technology company). I've never worked at HP before, and I don't know anyone there. This is just purely random event.¬† I got bored and wrote some outlandish statements, because I couldn't be bothered to write about how tedious waiting tables can be. Everything else on the CV and application is correct and true.

Look, I would absolutely take the job seriously if I got it, I personally would love experience in a role like that. Working in a prestigious place like HP I would be insanely grateful.¬† But it's not like the rest of my CV is outstanding. The only basic sales experience I have is working for M&Co (a closed down British clothes shop) as a store associate for a few months in 2023. But I do actually have good social skills. And I am actually relatively proficient at¬† customers relations when I'm in my zone. I know it would be hard but I reckon I could build the natural 'charisma' that a job in sales would require. I'm just not sure I have the confidence to convince them I at least have the potential to be great in sales.

I wrote such dumb things, I just don't understand what to do in such a peculiar event? I can't really tell if they are just tagging along with the joke or I'm in some deep professional¬† corporate shit by accident. I did not take the application seriously at all, why on earth would a recruiter believe I would take the job seriously (Not that I'm complaining about getting the interview) - DDoes HP not want serious, professional, corporate-like employees? I don't even have a LinkedIn profile ffs. Can't wrap my head around it. Has this joke backfired on me? Did they not realise I was joking and think¬† was joking, think I'm some sort of gold polishing leprechaun high stakes lawyer or someth.

It's more confusing than anything. Feels like the plot to some weird TV show. Feels mad like I'm about to be caught and exposed. Like I'm Mike Ross from suits type things.

Basically, how should I approach this? Landing this job would be HUGE. Should I clutch the interview? Act professional and informed in the interview?¬† Should I just ignore it and pretend like it never happened? gaslight tf outta them? Do I have to come clean and tell them? How do I actually impress them and actually finesse the job? It doesn't help that I have no idea what to expect of them in the interview. I don't know if they'll be uptight and serious and corporate about it or pass it off as some silly joke. Am I just the luckiest applicant in the world?

Basically am I overthinking this chat? Do they actually care about what I wrote? Thought it was funny? or maybe they just have better things to worry about. That aside, I do want to make the most of this weird event and take advantage of what I can. It would be MASSIVE if I could convince them that I deserve the job anyway. Does an unusual situation like this need an unusual answer? Should I be concerned if they actually believed me?

Reddit - r/careeradvice . I need your help. Any and all of your advice and reassurance is greatly appreciated. I want to hear your perspectives and ideas on this. Thank you so much.

What's the game plan from here though? Do you have any advice on pulling off a comeback and snatch the job form this position? What's the winning plan coming into the interview? How do I even prepare for this kind of thing? How do you guys see it. I want to turn it from being an unusual awkward strange corporate explanation into a positive productive and engaging conversation. Make it into a 'getting a whole new employment' type things. How do I turn this around to my advantage and make the most out of it?

Once again. Thank you for reading, and for all your suggestions. I put it to you, the brilliant people of Reddit Thank you in advance for helping me solve this.

Am I cooked?

TLDR; I wrote some false statements on my job application thinking it would be interpreted as a joke, now I¬† have an interview. How do I get the job even with a dumb application?

1jo3aw4,Should I look for other companies or should I try to make it work?,"I've been in my company for a year and a half, 4 years of experience as a software engineer. In my current team I don't do what I love since we're doing mostly frontend stuff and my focus has always been in backend, unfortunately my team doesn't have any backend work so to do so I'd need to change teams and department.

I've talked to my manager about this, and he was apparently fine with me changing teams, but it honestly feels like he's holding a grudge ever since and I feel he's being more passive-aggressive.

I'm also very unhappy now and not motivated at all, since the change of teams could happen in October at the earliest.



My company has a policy for mid level engineers (I am one of those) in which they have to be promoted to Senior within 3 years in the company, it is very competitive and I feel my manager is not pitching very well for my promotion since he's also not an experienced manager. My company also pays really good money, constantly above the market.



Given all this, I don't know what's the right move, I want to be patient and look long term but I'm also lacking motivation for these next months to come doing something I know I definitely don't wanna do.



Honestly the company seems great, people stay for long, they pay well and engineers in the department I want to move to are being rewarded and have really cool stuff to do. But I also think it's going to very extremely hard to pretend I'm motivated and do a good job during these months.

In college I worked as a legal assistant, I did things like sitting at the reception desk, filing, running documents to court, maintaining the office space, etc. Salary was around 31k. 

When I graduated I worked in the nonprofit sector with adults with autism. It was an hourly role, $15 an hour, but only for direct face time with clients. Travel to and from didn‚Äôt count and any notes or supervision I did was billed at $7.50 per hour. The program was designed to help build life skills amongst that population. I would meet them in their homes and help them with things like getting groceries, maintaining a home, finding a job, etc. It was a very tough job for very little pay, and I left that to work as an administrative assistant. 

The admin job was stable‚Äî good benefits, 401k, PTO, and $41k, which seemed like a lot of money to me at the time. I took it because they told me that I could eventually transition into business analysis or project management if I wanted to. I was promoted to a ‚Äúsenior‚Äù administrative assistant after 4 years (with the promise of a higher salary later) and left shortly after because I was afraid of being pigeonholed. In that role I did things like managing the office, planning events for the department, running weekly project meetings, managing calendars and schedules for executives. 

My current role is in software implementation for a small business. I make $55k, work remotely, have ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù PTO (not really unlimited), and health insurance. No 401k. I‚Äôd consider it to be project management, though thats not my title. I‚Äôve found it very challenging because we have very little in the way of support documentation, my manager is too busy with their own work to really support the team, and projects run fast. It‚Äôs my responsibility to coordinate with all vendors / stakeholders, implement the product, test it, and train the stakeholders on it. Typical run time for a project is 4-6 weeks, and there is lots to track and manage in between. I have found it hard to keep up and feel that I‚Äôm performing to the best of my ability, and I‚Äôm burning out fast. 

Considering a project management certification, but I hear that tech is not the greatest industry to be in anymore, and given that I don‚Äôt really even have a technical background, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs the right track for me to pursue. I‚Äôm also so burned out that I don‚Äôt know if I can dedicate the time to that right now. I‚Äôm in an intensive outpatient program right now for my mental health and am already dedicating 9 hours of my personal time to that each week in the evenings.

1jnzwpb,I am [21M] very confused regarding my Career.,"I am currently in my final year of graduation in Bachelors in Accounting and Finance and will get my degree by the end of May or by June. I am done with my final sem exams and I expect my CGPA to be above 9.0 because my previous semester were all 9+ and my exams also went quite well,

I want to build a career in finance and it has been my goal since first year (mainly in wealth management, investment banking etc)

I didn't do any internship cause I was preparing for entrance exam for Chartered Accountancy (CA)which I failed because I didn't prepare well, and also I don't want to do CA and it was my mom and dad for whom I gave an attempt. 

Now I don't have any idea what to do ahead. I am so confused between various options 

1st option is apply for Universities abroad for a Msc in finance or Msc in wealth management or similar post graduation degrees (this is the one that I want to do but I am very confused whether it is worth it and is it sensible because this option is kinda expensive for a middle class family like mine)

2nd option is stay in India, prepare for CA Inter (this is the one that my parents want me to do)

I have some universities in my target (which are not that reputed) but I read somewhere that masters in finance degree only from a reputed college or university has a value. 

Please help me out and also please suggest any other options that I have right now 

Also if you could suggest some extra courses that I can take during my 2 month vacation right now

1jnzq0w,Significant Career Change - Finance to Floristry [F25],"So I am a F\[25\] living in East Coast QLD, Australia, and ever since leaving school I have been dissatisfied with my career choices. I was super lost in high school and when I sought help, I was given bad advice time and time again because no one truly understood what I wanted. 

I headed the general advice given and went into a law degree, only to drop out less than a year later. There was nothing a law degree could do for me, I didn't want to work within the industry/related industries and I had no intention of joining the police force or a law related business. I hated the topics and saw it as a waste of time as I was accruing debt and stress for no reason. 

After I bombed-out of uni I just started working and earning money. The first full-time office job I got into happened to be in finance. I have no idea how I landed a decent-paying, highly-skilled and super sought-after role in a well-known company at 18 years old with zero experience...but I did. And so henceforth began the cycle. Shitty corporate office to another. I have taken so many varying roles within finance companies I can do it all by now. I know so many people in the industry and would consider myself an absolute gun at interviews and emails. I have no qualifications outside of a year 12 certificate, but I have nearly 8 years of experience within the finance/loans industry and I have hated every second of it. 

I could climb the ranks and enter a leadership role. I could spend time and money furthering my education in the field and work beyond the ceiling I've reached with experience alone. With so much in front of me, I feel trapped, stagnant and frustrated. 

You see, I am naturally a highly creative and hands-on person. My whole childhood I was praised for my artistic skills and visions. My unique way of thinking. I gravitate towards creative scenes and have niche interests and obsessions. My dreams are so deep in a world I have always edged the perimeters of.

I have a traditional family who have all followed traditional paths and all done very well in their own rights. They are unconditionally supportive but they don't understand what I want fully. While at school they did their best and tried help pointing me in a direction that they thought was right. I don't have the know-how or family experience to help me with my aspirations. Really, I am clueless in how to step out of my comfort zone and make the first steps in an industry I have a natural knack for. 

To keep it simple; I have a goal to startup, run and own a luxury events business. Specialising in weddings. I have vast visions of the grandeur I want to accomplish. But starting at square one is difficult. I would love to begin with floristry. Basic retail-level bouquets to commissioned art installments. I have no certifications and no work experience. 

All I have is passion, a very specific eye-for-detail and personal hosting experience. I have at-home floristry experience: bringing home flowers and foliage and arranging them all throughout my mums home. Arranging flowers from my grandparents gardens for their country catholic church pews. Gifting bunches at every occasion possible and a constant lookout for what's growing on the side of the road. Every manager I've had has had a colourful desk or blooms for their wife. I always go above what's necessary for parties etc. and I love organising events. My partners house has never been so flower-ed and neither has his mothers' kitchen.

So I need help...

How do I start a small floristry business? Is it as easy as making an ABN, hooking up with wholesale flower markets, and start taking photos with prices? 

How do I advertise? Is a good Gram and Pinterest account enough? Is TikTok really the key to fast-tracked brand-awareness? Do I need a good website at the beginning? 

Do I start slow and simple and side-step gradually? Or do I throw in everything I have and make it appear as if I've been a working professional of 20+ years experience? 

Should I reach out to florist and/or events companies and ask for casual work? What do I tell them? I fear just having ""passion"" and a ""trust me bro, I can do it well"" approach isn't enough. 

I want tips, information, online forums/groups and anything that can help a girl out. 

I just turned 25 and after years of working my way up the corporate ladder, I have never felt so unfulfilled and fearful of the future. I am open to any kind of advice!

1jnxbps,Are my feelings valid [Colorado],"I wonder if my feelings are valid on this one. I am hired as an executive administrative officer and senior office manager for this company. I have an MBA degree. Like the other stakeholders I send emails to, they put a salutation in the name, ex: 
Sincerely yours,
Name, MBA

So I am just 3 months in the job and I do this as well. 

One morning, our department manager called me to say to take that MBA salutation off. I found it weird because in my previous jobs, I put it in my name. All the people I correspond emails with- vendors, clients, and even our co-workers in our different locations, Canada and Asia, they will put their salutations too such as PMP, MBA, CET, PhD., etc. 
So, I took mine off. 
I am concerned and am a bit offended. He is not my boss, my direct supervisor is in Canada and he never minded it. 
I told my husband this and husband thinks that dept. manager is mean. 
That is why I ask on here. Is it wrong for me to feel bad about this?

I live in California, in a HCOL area, and this pay is pretty bad considering that, but I don't have many options as I am early in my career. Even though the pay is not good, I do like my supervisors. I think they lead my team well, the training is pretty thorough for the most part, and I get along very well with everyone on my team. 

One of the company executives has taken notice of my performance and reached out to me encouraging me to apply for a position on a different team. The supervisors of that team caught wind of my performance and they want me on their team. The pay would start at/around $30 an hour. Still not great for CA, but that's a good raise to me and would make things so much easier I think. 

Here's the catch. One of the supervisors of that team has a bad reputation. Multiple people have warned me about her. I have heard the team overall is struggling/very behind, and the training isn't that good at all. There has been a high turnover rate the last year on that team. The executives at the company are aware of the issues and are working to improve that team, but I have been told it will likely be rough/overwhelming if/when I start. 

I agreed to an interview to at least entertain the idea. I am highly considering it as the pay raise is far too tempting. I am STRUGGLING on 25/hr. I can't afford my own place so I have roommates, and I have a second job waiting tables a few nights a week. I'm in my early 30s and feel insane pressure to increase
my income. I feel very behind in life compared to others my age. My pay increase to 30-ish an hour would be such a great step in the right direction. 

I should also mention this position is for sure a promotion and the experience would look great on my resume. 

But I'm aware of the issues of that team and I don't know if it would be worth the extra stress.

1jns29g,How to handle unemployment period on resume,"TLDR: it took me a while to graduate In aerospace engineering due to medical issues, I wasn‚Äôt able to get an internship, and due to depression and other mental issues I‚Äôve been stuck in concrete about getting a job. Hundreds of apps later and barely any callbacks, it‚Äôs been almost 2 years since getting my bachelors. I‚Äôm getting off my ass and getting back into gear, how should I handle the very obvious gap on my resume and lack of experience? I currently have down that I was running my own small business doing wood and metal work which is mostly true, I‚Äôm just exaggerating the scale of it to sound better. I feel like I‚Äôm getting looked over because of this. 


To put a really long story short: I graduated high school in 2017, went to an unnamed military college/university (don‚Äôt really want employers to find this post) to pursue a military career and get a degree in engineering. Major medical issues popped up my first semester, disqualifying me from service. I had to transfer schools due to loss of scholarships. Took me 6 total years to graduate due to transfer, and because I was playing catch up in school and working full time to pay the bills I never landed an internship. I graduated spring 23, and after hundreds of applications to tons of companies, I‚Äôve barely got any callbacks and two interviews with the same company, after which I was ghosted. I haven‚Äôt applied to any new jobs in the better part of 9 months now, I basically have had a very hard time mentally. I‚Äôm doing some side work selling wood and metal furniture projects I make on Facebook, but it‚Äôs not really ‚Äúexperience‚Äù obviously. I‚Äôve decided I need to get off my ass and keep trying, and I‚Äôm really worried I will never be marketable because of this gap and lack of experience, two years after getting my bachelors. My wife and I really can‚Äôt pick up and move right now unfortunately for a variety of reasons and there‚Äôs not a ton of engineering options near me.

1jnrags,Transition from IT Auditor to SAP Consultant,"Hello everyone,

I am currently an IT auditor at a Big 4 firm, where I have been working for two years. However, I find the job less interesting than I had hoped, and I want to specialize in SAP. I am looking for an internal transfer to the SAP consulting department.

To make this transition, I need to convince the department‚Äôs partner that I have strong SAP knowledge. While I have two years of experience applying controls and checks on clients‚Äô SAP systems, I have never directly worked with system configurations or implementations. So, while I understand SAP concepts, I lack hands-on experience.

What would be the best way to quickly build my SAP expertise? I was considering obtaining an SAP certification. While it‚Äôs a bit expensive, do you think it‚Äôs a worthwhile investment?

1jnr8q7,Leadership didn‚Äôt listen to me about a problem and it blew up - do I point it out to my boss?,"Two months ago, I brought up an issue about my coworker‚Äôs work (after he had asked me to help him with it, which was not my responsibility but I obliged then I saw what a disaster it was) to my manager. I was calm, diplomatic and explained exactly what all of the issues were in a matter of fact way. This coworker is more senior than me but has been the source of countless issues, however no performance management or consequences have ever been applied, to my knowledge. He continues to create problem after problem, unsupervised.

The reaction to my bringing this to my manager was not good. My manager was appreciative but blase / did not take it seriously clearly, and my manager‚Äôs boss did not receive it favorably and I was told to ‚Äúmind the culture‚Äù. 

Last week, this issue blew up, exactly like I warned, and my manager‚Äôs boss was in crisis mode all day to fix it. Another coworker was dragged in, and I coached that person exactly what to do to fix it in private messages because I did not want to get involved again after how it was received the first time.

I am torn between staying out of it but am somewhat considering speaking to my manager about it. He does seem to respect me, but his boss sucks. However I am extremely irate that I was flagged as the problem when I was, objectively, not. Advice please and thank you.

1jnq6tm,Completely lost - Career Advice is Appreciated,"Long rant, but desperately need advice.

I‚Äôm nearing the end of my sophomore year of college and I‚Äôm a psychology major and recently added a minor of speech language and hearing sciences. Since I was a kid I always thought of myself working to help children with special needs, as I have grown up with a sister who has ASD, I knew I wanted to become someone who had helped her so much (like her therapists). I had thought about OT and SLP throughout high school and this past summer I was still unsure. I chose psychology since it is such a broad field (I don‚Äôt have an interest in becoming a teacher so I didn‚Äôt go into special education, and I am not interested in becoming a mental health therapist or psychologist). With a bachelors in psychology you can really go into any kind of allied health path like OT, SLP, etc. After shadowing a couple of SLPs and one OT this school year, I made my decision and really liked SLP. 

I added a minor of SLHS, which at my school is online and doesn‚Äôt offer in person (I learn and do much better in an in an person environment). I have taken phonetics (which I didn‚Äôt do well in but ended up okay in the end because we wrrre allowed corrections which helped my grade but I still don‚Äôt get it). the rest of this semester I am taking language development which so far I haven‚Äôt had much motivation to sit down and really grasp the information and I‚Äôm more so just wanting to get it done. I think I‚Äôm so all over the place and burnt out in a sense because I‚Äôm taking these classes online and have to do a bunch of assignments each week (each class is a 6 week course) and don‚Äôt do well with online classes and need the structure of in person. 
I just have lost interest in the field, and I‚Äôm not really liking what I‚Äôve learned. This scares me because I don‚Äôt know what career path to take. I have been on the fence about a career for so long and this is just something I don‚Äôt know if I would be capable of doing. This isn‚Äôt a case of imposter syndrome where I‚Äôm doing well in everything, but don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it - I just don‚Äôt think I have the mental capability of learning all of what this career entails like I thought I would. I‚Äôm trying to be real with myself. I‚Äôve always done alright in school but never did good on tests and I‚Äôve always struggled in a way. I was diagnosed over the summer with combined adhd and anxiety so there‚Äôs that lol. 
Anyways, I have just had this constant anxiety and sadness for the past year of how I don‚Äôt have a plan. I have always had an idea of what my next couple of years would look like, all until college really. Now I‚Äôm just so lost with not really being interested in SLP. I didn‚Äôt care for OT either, and I‚Äôm not good at anatomy and that sort of thing where that is a bigger focus in schooling. 
I really like how SLP (and OT) have many different settings you can work in, I particularly would aim to work in a clinic/office type of setting where I can do one on one with pediatrics. I like that you help all children (neurotypical and atypical). I really like the one on one patient aspect, I feel I would most likely do well with this since I can focus on the one patients goals at a time and make up plans easier. I would be open to schools but hearing stories of caseloads and how common it is for them to be overpacked scares me.

I‚Äôve looked into ABA a few times over the years and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something I could personally handle in regard to the behavioral challenges, (which I‚Äôm sure SLP or any other related career would have but this is probably seen more daily). I believe I even volunteered/ shadowed one for a group project when I was in 8th grade (and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it, but granted this was 6/7 years ago).

I was thinking about potentially being a Child Life Specialist, but the money is‚Ä¶ awful. 

Looking back at my naive 17 year old self who chose her college major, and potential career paths thinking I would be a little smarter and better at school and have passion now, I don‚Äôt blame her. I‚Äôm really still in the same boat at almost 20, just a little too close to the end of college for comfort. 
I just don‚Äôt have any specific strengths that stand out or would be perfect for any sort of area. I‚Äôm not interested really in any other major. 

At the beginning of last semester I talked to one of my psychology professors at the time of when I was trying to decide between OT or SLP and she had the same ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so young‚Äù, ‚Äúone career isn‚Äôt forever‚Äù, ‚Äúnothing is concrete‚Äù. I understand that, but for me I just want to have a career I can have stability in (financially/  just overall), and that I‚Äôm capable of completing the schooling for. 

One thing I know is, is time is everything and college has gone by so insanely fast. I just want to be comfortable knowing in the next year or whatever what direction I‚Äôm going in. 
If anyone has any sort of career ideas or thoughts of any kind please let me know, it‚Äôs greatly appreciated.",Weekly-Gazelle1301,2,1.0,2,1743378770,2025-03-30 23:52:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jnq6tm/completely_lost_career_advice_is_appreciated/,3,2025
1jnpw7f,LinkedIn hacks that improved my job search efficiency,"As an old LinkedIn user since my freshman year, it‚Äôs the website that accompanied me from internship searching to landing a full-time job. During recruiting season, I checked it as frequently as Reddit. But there's a big problem with jobs posted on LinkedIn: they‚Äôre highly competitive, sometimes there are over 200 applicants within 24 hours! Here are my tricks to improve efficiency with every LinkedIn job application.

**Find jobs posted on LinkedIn in the past 1 or 2 hours instead of 24 hours**

1. Search for your desired job and filter by ‚ÄúPast 24 hours‚Äù
2. In the URL, change from 86400 to 3600 or 7200 ‚Äî 86400 represents 24 hours, 3600 is 1 hour, and 7200 is 2 hours.

It effectively increases the chances of my resume being seen, without any extra effort!

**Find jobs that aren't posted on LinkedIn but are hiring**

1. Type-in a search query using this template: ‚ÄúKeyword‚Äù + ‚ÄúRole‚Äù or ‚ÄúLocation‚Äù, keywords can be Hiring, Seeking, Looking, Opening, Recruiting...Examples: Hiring Data Scientist New York City
2. Click posts and filter to show results from the last 24 hours.
3. Check if the post is from the hiring manager or recruiter, and send them a connection request with a short note.
4. After they accept, send a quick DM: introduce yourself, highlight one key accomplishment, and explain why you‚Äôre reaching out....Ask if they‚Äôd be open to a quick chat to discuss the role.

If they don‚Äôt accept, I still follow them to look for future opportunities. It‚Äôs completely normal for people to ignore your connection requests, don‚Äôt feel embarrassed!

**Maximize free Chrome Extension on LinkedIn**

My principle is to use free resources on the internet to save both money and time, neither should be wasted... Here are two completely free extensions that saved me a lot of time:

1. [One click to predict interview questions for any LinkedIn job posting.](https://www.amainterview.ai/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Reddit+Post&utm_campaign=AMA+AI)
2. [Automate filling out application forms, even after uploading your resume](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/simplify-copilot-autofill/pbanhockgagggenencehbnadejlgchfc)

This way, I don‚Äôt need to subscribe to paid memberships just to access interview questions, and I can use the time saved to get more sleep and recharge, so I have more energy to apply for more jobs.

1jnpoee,Want to apply for new job but hiring manager knows my current manager,"So one of my dream companies to work for is hiring and I have the qualifications. I do like my current job but the pay is not great but overall I am happy there. My current workplace is a bit culty in the sense that no one ever leaves because we do have a great culture and we do fun work. We did have one person leave recently and it sparked a lot of people asking around if anyone plans on quitting or if they‚Äôre looking for a new job, i was asked and said no but this position has come up and I want to apply. Only problem is the hiring manager has a lot of mutuals with people at my current company and I do not want anyone to know I‚Äôm applying unless i actually get the job. Also, this company is partnered with one of our current clients I work with and if I am to get the job I‚Äôll be working on the same client, so it‚Äôs likely this company might ask our client how I am as a worker and correspondent which may lead to people at my work finding out I applied.

Should i not apply if im worried my current company will find out or do you think most hiring managers know not to say anything?

1jnozdo,Huge career move in a town two hours away... Fiance really doesn't want to move.,"So, as the title says, I currently have a solid job making 130K\~ a year, with around 160K being the cap.  I have an opportunity to take a more senior role making around 160K a year (210K being cap) with bigger bonus, more vacation, and perks such as being the boss, driving the company truck, trips to head office, etc, but the catch is I have to move two hours away to a larger city.  My fiance can transfer her job to that place but she's not willing mostly for emotional reasons, kid in school, family here, etc.

I am thinking I would be honestly stupid to not take this once in a lifetime opportunity and she's just not seeing the light through the tunnel (solidifying early retirement, pay off debts, live somewhere I consider better, multiple times a year hot vacations etc.)  It's also a bit intimidating, entirely new group of people and I feel a little bit of imposter-syndrome but I think that's only normal and I think I will do just fine ultimately.  The kids will benefit from me being able to pay for more of their university, cars, etc, money will no longer be the problem or limiting factor...

I am contemplating just driving there during the week, renting a room or basement suite, maybe working from home one day a week and just driving back on friday evening for the weekend, leaving monday morning for the week until she feels comfortable and can transfer when she is ready, and I think this isn't a huge deal as I will still come out far ahead, and it halfway appeases her as she doesn't have to change anything huge for a while.  In my head, this is only 2 hours away, people fly in fly out for much shittier jobs and work away for a LONG time.  Not just 4-5 days a week...  Would anyone else do this or am I crazy?

At times I think to myself that I am just chasing a career-peak and an extra 40K-60K isn't going to change my life for the better, but then I remember all the other perk...  But I also don't think I should let her super emotionally charged feelings about it make it so I have to turn down a life changing job offer.",CamelAppropriate5034,177,0.8100000023841858,433,1743375219,2025-03-30 22:53:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jnozdo/huge_career_move_in_a_town_two_hours_away_fiance/,3,2025
1jnoyuk,"Working in a union at higher ed. Coworker is inept & I make less, but doing all critical assignments","I have spoken to the department head once last year due to the lopsided work load and the fact that coworkers makes 35% more than me. She has become extremely reliant on my competence. She can't even format Word Docs after working as a office admin for 30 years. She has been promoted by default in the past due to other workers retiring.

I am currently overseeing all critical, project based work. Coworker is always having family & health emergencies and can't even remember what happened 2 hours ago so her work is very subpar.

I know my only real leverage is leaving for a better job. Bosses all love me. They have stated that their lives have improved 100% since I started working for them. I do love this job and find my other coworkers very pleasant & I thrive in this environment.

I asked for a salary review and an assessment of my current duties & job title. Because the salaries and job titles are passed through various boards for approval getting a new title and possible raise is more complicated than the dept head saying OK.

Any advice on things to say, things not to say at this meeting? I do basically all the day to day ops and coordinating of capital improvements projects while being a admin assistant and the 2nd lowest grade on the pay scale. I want to ask for at least equal pay with my coworker since she works maybe 2 hours a day while I run the admin side of the dept.

Bosses are very lenient on all of coworker's mistakes and incompetency and she has never been held accountable for her performance.

1jno2r1,Making half as much as my colleagues,"So this company took a chance on me - I was referred to them and they took me on with very little project management experience, and zero experience in the platform we sell. That was about 10 months ago.

I was hired as an ‚Äúassociate project manager.‚Äù At first I did need a lot of guidance, but for the past several months I am consistently expected to perform at the level of other, much more senior PMs. I‚Äôm also taking on as much as or more work than they are - right now I‚Äôm managing 3 projects, one has dual work streams, and just took on another dual work stream project. I‚Äôm taking over another coworker‚Äôs project once they go on their upcoming leave. So that‚Äôs effectively 7 implementation/consulting projects - with huge corporations, household names.

At first I was just happy to have my foot in the door and wasn‚Äôt worried about my pay. But I‚Äôm bending over backwards for this company - and sacrificing my wellbeing to keep up.

I found out recently that I‚Äôm making half what the regular PMs make. Less than half in some cases. The PM who told me this was completely shocked at how little they pay me. My workload, tasks, and expectations aren‚Äôt materially different than the more senior PMs in any way I can see. I do collab with them and ask for their input, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs more than anyone else would. My pay is even below the typical minimum for an entry-level PM in my industry - and not by a small amount.

What‚Äôs the best way to go about this? I have no experience in asking for a raise - never had to do it before. But also this is such a discrepancy it‚Äôs almost insulting and can‚Äôt just be an oversight.

1jnnmeh,College or Air Force?,"College or Air Force?



Hello, I'm 30F and wanting a life change. I'm currently a dental technician but it's not very well paying and doesn't have a very good career outlook. I own a house and have multiple cats. I'm thinking of either joining the Air Force as active duty and going to college while I'm enlisted. Or continuing my current job and going to college part-time. I don't currently have an idea of what I want to go to college for so the Air Force seems like the best bet, over taking random classes until I can figure out what degree I want. If I join the Air Force I would have to sell/rent out my house. I would also need to rehome my cats as I don't have any friends or family that would be able to take care of them while I'm enlisted. I just feel like I'm extremely behind career wise if I want to be successful. Would reserves be a better option? Any advice or other suggestions would be appreciated!

1jniok9,Looking for ways to get more feedback at work,"Hi all, I am currently facing a situation at work which is a bit frustrating to me.

For some context, I am about a year into my full time career in a technology rotational program. Since I am in a rotational program, my situation is a bit unique, I had one role for about 9 months, and have now been in a new role about 4 months. In each rotation, I have a different ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù manager which gives me work, and also my actual manager which is basically a mentor throughout my program. My functional manager and actual manager work together to right my reviews and I also have frequent 1:1s with them both.

In terms of my frustrations, I feel that I am not getting much feedback on things I can improve. In my first half year review, I received very good ratings without much guidance on things I could do better at, and it was a similar story for my annual review where I received the highest review I could and was again not given much feedback besides that I was doing great and the teams I had rotated on really loved working with me. I‚Äôve asked in our 1:1s too without much luck.

This isn‚Äôt the biggest deal in the world, but I want to make sure I continue to grow my skills which is harder to do without knowing what I can do better at. If it really is the case that my managers have no feedback, then I feel like I need to be challenged to do harder things.

1jngwwy,Is it Okay to leave a Job after just 6 months?,"I started this job at a non-profit almost 5 months ago. It's an accounting/finance related role. Mainly came on-board as the annual salary was 5K more ($55K) while my  previous role was 50K. And also the fact that I was going to do some new responsibilities. But sadly, I haven't been assigned these new responsibilities.  Our team is pretty small - with just me, the manager and the CFO. 

I was at my previous role/position for 3 years. It was a larger company with an almost 20 people finance department. I guess I notice a cultural difference between both of these organizations. And I just feel like I don't fit in well with my current organization. Now that I think through I feel like I shouldn't have made this jump, I think I made a mistake. Because even though I made 50K, we had the option to work overtime. So my salary reached almost 52K -53K. So in that case the 55K at the new place hardly makes a big difference. Plus the new responsibilities I was supposed to do... my manager isn't giving them to me yet.

I recently applied for a position titled ‚ÄúFundraising Executive‚Äù at Acharya Prashant Advait Foundation. My background is in Life Sciences (graduation) and Anthropology (post-graduation), and I‚Äôve done some interesting work in the non-profit world. I interned at Pledge a Smile handling research, project management, and fundraising, and then worked at Ashoka University as a teaching fellow where I bridged the gap between professors and students, managed data, and held discussion sessions.

During the interview, I shared that my post-grad in Anthropology gave me skills like relationship building, storytelling, and understanding human behavior‚Äîall of which I thought were perfect for a fundraising role. I explained that these skills help in establishing rapport with potential funders and understanding why people give.

However, here‚Äôs the twist: I later discovered that the actual job responsibilities are not what I expected. Instead of raising funds, researching potential donors, organizing events, or writing grants, the role is primarily telephonic. I‚Äôd be contacting people, counseling them, and encouraging them to attend the organization‚Äôs Geeta sessions. It‚Äôs target-based but doesn‚Äôt really involve traditional fundraising tasks.

Now I‚Äôm stuck. On one hand, the pay is a solid 50,000 per month, and it‚Äôs a chance to work with a good cause. On the other, it doesn‚Äôt align with my career goals or the expertise I developed during my post-grad in Anthropology. I‚Äôm wondering:

‚Ä¢ Should I take this job for financial stability and the chance to build some related skills (like persuasion and relationship management)?

‚Ä¢ Or should I pass on it because it might not help me in the long run, especially when I‚Äôm aiming for a role that fully leverages my background in fundraising and anthropology?


Any advice or insights from those who‚Äôve been in a similar situation would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

I also deal with nerve pain, brain fog, and other related symptoms that affect my daily life.
I am still very functional. I‚Äôm wondering if these issues could make it difficult to pursue this field or work long-term as a Rad Tech.

1jnf9d8,Applying again to a company that you just turned down. Am I an automatic rejection?,"A few months ago I applied to 3 separate positions at one company.

Fast-forward a month and I‚Äôm seeing more jobs listed by that same company that would be a very good fit. Should I even bother applying because? I did apply to one but never heard back, and I recently saw another position open up, where I applied and then stated that i was previously offered an online interview but declined.

1jnepib,"Job offer, want to turn down. Am I crazy to in this job market?","I, like many, have applied for several jobs & interviews are slow to come in. Lost my job 3 weeks ago, sort of unexpectedly but I hated it and had been searching and applying pretty aggressively before then. 

For context: BA and MBA. 6 years experience in Marketing Manager position (small org), <8 years marketing/comms total experience. Was making $93k fully remote, with org for 5+ years. Washington, DC area (on site to start then moved remote during the pandemic & I was working from Michigan in LowerCOL area). 

Initial phone interview with potential new org was in Jan. They explicitly stated salary was between 70-75, and up to $85 for the ‚Äúright candidate.‚Äù I told at that time the salary was too low, even at $85K, as it would require me to move back to DC-area and was less than I was making and explicitly said I was not interested in moving forward if the highest they could go was $85K. And she was going to check with the hiring team, I guess, but I left the call without ever expecting to hear from them again. They reach out a month later for an interview (one day after I lost my job- but they did not know that). After 3 rounds of interviews they offered me the job for $72K on Friday. Marketing Manager position, requesting 3-5 years experience & I check all the qualifications boxes. I feel like it‚Äôs a low ball offer. And the org has displayed very disorganized communication during the process which I had already viewed as a red flag prior to this offer. Lack of details around the role (not disclosing details about the software they use) to the point where when I asked directly during the interview, it seemed like the hiring manager was trying to hide that they weren‚Äôt very advanced. It‚Äôs a small org with little to no growth potential and they‚Äôre lagging in some ways compared to previous org so I‚Äôd be beneficial in the sense of helping them move up to speed, but no challenging projects or career growth for me as I‚Äôve already done those things. The main point is it‚Äôs already given red flags. I do not want to accept this job but would I be absolutely crazy to turn down a job offer in this market?? I‚Äôve been in it so I know it‚Äôs rough and getting interviews has been slow. 

I‚Äôm planning to counter to see if they‚Äôll get closer to $85K. But sending out a lowball offer is another red flag imo, and obviously and is below market pay for DC-area anyway & the lack of growth opportunities is a big deal to me. So with the red flags piling up I don‚Äôt feel confident in making a move for this org (would require me to move down as it‚Äôs one day a week in office), even if they move up to $85 which seems unlikely at this point since they came in at $72K. 

I have some savings to get me through a couple month or so but I feel somewhat  desperate to take the first offer as I don‚Äôt want to rely on savings and not have income. And I‚Äôm single, live alone, and have a mortgage so I definitely feel the pressure to get some income coming in. 

TLDR; offer on the table for $72K, despite previously telling them even $85K was too low while still employed (since then I‚Äôve lost my job) which they said they could do ‚Äúfor the right candidate.‚Äù On paper I‚Äôm overqualified for the role requirements & even $85K is below market pay for DC-area marketing manager with 6 yrs experience in role and masters degree (MBA). Am I crazy to turn down a low ball offer from an org with other red flags during interview process? In a different market I‚Äôd know the answer, but looking for perspectives given how terrible things are right now for job seekers.

1jneejp,Econ Major Feeling Lost and Need Career Advices,"I'm feeling a bit lost and could really use some advice. I'm currently studying economics and will be finishing my bachelor‚Äôs degree in a few months once I complete my thesis. I have a strong interest in econometrics and enjoy working with different models. I even had the chance to publish a research paper in a small journal using panel data analysis. While I worked on it with my professors, I developed and ran the model entirely on my own with some policy recommendation and analysis.



I also enjoy coding in Python and I have built a simple time- and distance-based recommendation system during an exchange semester in Germany (I study only data science courses) , and I earned a 1.0 and feel really proud of it, though I‚Äôve since returned to my home country in Southeast Asia.



And also I have work in a sale department in a travel agency for my internship and continuing to work for a couple of months before quitting and did the exchange program I have mentioned. I don't mind the job but I feel like I belong in other fields.



But I am really worry that my skills are mostly academic and that I only have a basic foundation in the skills I have. I'm currently self-learning machine learning because I find it interesting, but I‚Äôm unsure about what comes next. When I look at job descriptions in different fields, I always feel like I‚Äôm missing something.

Excuse the pun in the title but it's a real dilemma. I've been at my company for three years and was promoted this month. I love my job and although my manager is quite a charachter we have a good working relationship and she generally lets me get on with things. Last week the director of the function called me into her office and let me know that a role is opening in another team and my name has come up and to consider it.

I'm also very worried about how my current manager will take this as she hired me and promoted me and ha given me lots of visibility and will feel very betrayed if I go for this move. Then again I can't help thinking this could be a great opportunity. I basically have two weeks to think this through before the position opens and I can apply.

1jnd009,PIP‚Äôd. Please help.,"I‚Äôve been working at this company for 3 years and have consistently received positive performance reviews from previous managers‚Äîuntil now.

On Wednesday, my manager scheduled a 1:1 meeting for Friday with no context. When I joined, HR was there, and a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) document was pulled up on the screen. For the next 45 minutes, she listed accusations that don‚Äôt seem like valid grounds for termination‚Äîthings like minor errors in drafts (which I had specifically asked for feedback on), a comment I supposedly made a year ago, or even the font size in a presentation. She sited things from my performance evaluation six months ago that she had recognized I had been improving on prior to the PIP. The corrective actions in the PIP are vague and subjective, with no clear way to measure improvement.

For the past six months, she has scrutinized everything I do, and I feel like she has been looking for me to fail. A month ago, she documented areas where I needed to improve, so I worked aggressively to perfect my work and went above and beyond. Leading up to the PIP, I made one small mistake (a single incorrect bullet point in a presentation, which I corrected immediately). Since then, I‚Äôve delivered multiple flawless presentations. Yet, she cited that one mistake as grounds for the PIP.

As soon as the meeting ended, I had a mental breakdown. I knew she personally didn‚Äôt like me and wanted me gone, but I thought my hard work would change her mind and it wouldn‚Äôt get this far. I immediately started job searching, and I still am. This was my first job‚ÄîI thought it was stable, and I understood how things worked. Now, I feel lost, terrified, and like I‚Äôve been set up to fail. The more I reflect, the more I realize she has spent more effort trying to push me out than helping me grow. My good work is ignored, while any minor misstep is magnified. I don‚Äôt understand why HR signed off on this.

I‚Äôve already sent back the document with my feedback and comments disagreeing with points and asking for measurable corrective actions before signing. But I need advice. Is there a way to get out of this all together? Has she already decided to fire me and is just building a case? What should I do over the next 60 days? How do I stay sane? Can they terminate me before the PIP period ends? Any legal or tactical guidance would mean so much to me.",PurpleBunny-22,47,0.8500000238418579,93,1743343164,2025-03-30 13:59:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jnd009/pipd_please_help/,3,2025

I‚Äôm 27 with two kids. I have a bachelors in liberal arts and I have a bad gpa because I screwed around a lot in college. I started a business with my dad after college and now I‚Äôm thinking about doing something else. The business is able to run pretty much by itself and I feel like I‚Äôm just collecting a check for doing nothing (feels like I‚Äôm taking money from my dad) but I‚Äôm not sure what I should do. 

I‚Äôm currently taking computer science classes at a local community college, I took a few when I was in college and I really enjoyed it but with all of the AI stuff it seems like I‚Äôll be pretty hard to get a job once I get my degree. What other degrees would be safe from ai that are decent paying? 60-70k range. Accounting maybe or is that going to be gone too?

1jnan3l,The AI Hype: Why Developers Aren't Going Anywhere,"Lately, there's been a lot of fear-mongering about AI replacing programmers this year. The truth is, people like Sam Altman and others in this space **need** people to believe this narrative, so they start investing in and using AI, ultimately devaluing developers. It‚Äôs all marketing and the interests of big players.

A similar example is how everyone was pushed onto cloud providers, making developers forget how to host a static site on a cheap $5 VPS. They're deliberately pushing the *vibe coding* trend.

However, only those outside the IT industry will fall for this. Maybe for an average person, it sounds convincing, but anyone working on a real project understands that even the most advanced AI models today are at best junior-level coders. Building a program is an **NP-complete problem**, and in this regard, the **human brain and intuition are several orders of magnitude more efficient**. A key factor is intuition, which subconsciously processes all possible development paths.

AI models also have **fundamental architectural limitations** such as **context size, economic efficiency, creativity, and hallucinations**. And as the saying goes, ""pick two out of four."" Until AI can comfortably work with a **10‚Äì20M token context** (which may never happen with the current architecture), developers can enjoy their profession for at least **3‚Äì5 more years**. Businesses that **bet on AI too early will face losses in the next 2‚Äì3 years**.

If a company thinks programmers are unnecessary, just ask them: **""Are you ready to ship AI-generated code directly to production?""**

The recent layoffs in IT have **nothing to do with AI**. Many talk about mass firings, but no one mentions how many people were hired during the COVID and post-COVID boom. Those leaving now are often people who entered the field randomly. Yes, there are fewer projects overall, but the **real reason is the global economic situation**, and **economies are cyclical**.

I fell into the **mental trap** of this hysteria myself. Our brains are lazy, so I thought AI would write code for me. In the end, I wasted tons of time fixing and rewriting things manually. Eventually, I realized AI is just **a powerful assistant**, like IntelliSense in an IDE. It‚Äôs great for writing templates, quickly testing coding hypotheses, serving as a fast reference guide, and translating text‚Äîbut **not replacing real developers**.",inkberk,4,0.5699999928474426,1,1743334976,2025-03-30 11:42:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jnan3l/the_ai_hype_why_developers_arent_going_anywhere/,3,2025
1jnalvz,"Postgraduate Dilemma ‚Äì NUS Offer, Job Prospects & Financial Strain","Hi everyone, F20 from India here. I‚Äôm in my final year studying International Affairs at a private university and would really appreciate advice‚Äîespecially from those in Singapore, Malaysia, the UK, or with experience in international relations careers.

Background

I struggled with depression throughout school, which affected my academic performance. In 11th grade, I moved to a boarding school to escape a toxic family environment, and that was a turning point for me. I finally discovered my passion for International Relations (IR) and worked hard to build a strong CV. However, I didn‚Äôt apply to universities abroad for my undergrad because I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get accepted.

For my master‚Äôs, I applied to universities in Singapore and Malaysia and planned to apply to Europe, Australia, and the UK as well. Recently, I received an offer from NUS (National University of Singapore)‚Äîwhich is an incredible opportunity, given its global ranking. But the tuition and living costs add up to nearly 10 million USD which is a major financial burden. My family is willing to support me through savings, but I‚Äôm struggling with whether it‚Äôs the right decision.

The Dilemma

	1.	Should I accept the NUS offer despite the financial strain and uncertain job prospects? I‚Äôve heard from seniors and locals that securing a work visa and job in Singapore after graduation is tough. I believe in my ability to land a job‚Äîwhether in Singapore or elsewhere‚Äîbut there‚Äôs no guarantee. I fear ending up back with my parents, which would be emotionally devastating.
	2.	Would it be smarter to wait a year, apply for more affordable or funded programs in Europe/Australia, and gain work experience in the meantime? I have a backup option‚Äîa one-year program at my current university in India‚Äîthat could give me more time to plan.
	3.	Does an NUS degree hold strong weight for international IR careers outside Singapore? Would the investment be worth it if I eventually have to apply for jobs in Europe, the UK, or Australia?
	4.	Should I work alongside my degree? I avoided paid jobs during my undergrad so I could focus on academics and explore different opportunities. But in Singapore, I‚Äôd likely need to find some kind of income. Would taking up online/remote work on the side be a good idea, or would it hurt my studies?

Why This Matters

My home environment is incredibly toxic, and even my therapist has advised me to leave. My older sister moved to Australia and has been able to build a stable life there, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be as lucky. I‚Äôve always been the emotional support system in my family, and it‚Äôs mentally exhausting. On top of that, I‚Äôm dealing with health issues from a past smoking addiction and have been drinking heavily to cope. I need a way out, but I also don‚Äôt want to make a reckless financial decision.

Would really appreciate any insights‚Äîespecially from those who have studied or worked in Singapore, or have experience in international careers. What would you do in my position?",ameezing-cheese-222,1,1.0,0,1743334838,2025-03-30 11:40:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jnalvz/postgraduate_dilemma_nus_offer_job_prospects/,3,2025
1jnab8w,Seeking Career Advice,"I‚Äôm currently a CAP2 ACA (ACA = Associate Chartered Accountant, a UK/Ireland accounting qualification similar to CPA) grad working in a Big 4 firm in their Government & Infrastructure Advisory team.

While I‚Äôm gaining experience in procurement and government consulting, I don‚Äôt see myself staying in this role or the firm after I qualify.

Factors to consider:

2. I am the last to leave every night. 
3. I have been moved onto different, bigger portfolios across the last 3 years, however no reward or compensation came with that move. 
4. The business has performed poorly for the last few years so there have been no increase or bonuses for the last 2 years. 
5. A tint ‚Äòbonus‚Äô was given in January not for merit or work done but as a retention tactic to be paid back fully if we leave this year. 
6. In Jan I addressed that I cannot continue doing the work of 2 people without compensation and effecting my health. My request was disregarded, and no urgency to recruit someone since October last year when the person left. 
7. My salary does cover expensive and allows me to live comfortably with good benefits. I do however feel under appreciated and there is nothing returned for my loyalty and work. 
8. My new boss is impossible and a driving factor for my unhappiness. I am learning nothing new either since my previous boss left a year ago as new leadership is clueless.

1jn7s1y,Put on PIP- I don‚Äôt know what to do,"27F. I was  just put on PIP at my new job in an outpatient clinic. I have been struggling to catch on with this job and have been told by my manager they have never had someone have this much trouble working there. I am way too slow to learn things and not able to multitask 

When I was hired they had added a second doctor to the practice and I am apparently meant to be his sole nurse and manage everything for this doctor. This was not made clear in the interview- I thought that I would be working with a team of nurses. With the addition of the new doctor things have been disorganized and there was no plan in place either.  

Ultimately though I know it is my fault that I was put on PIP. I am dealing with health issues that I have been trying to figure out the last 2 years- my doctor believes I might have Cushings. I am very sick and all my time spent out of work I am recovering. I think that this is causing me to have issues retaining information/ problems with my memory- which is really scaring me. 

I have been a nurse for a little over a year- I started in the icu which I didn‚Äôt make it in. I then got a job on a pcu unit and worked there for 10 months. Wanted to get off nights and job gave me a lot of anxiety so I went to outpatient like everyone says to do- and I‚Äôm also failing there. 

I do not think I should be a nurse at this point since I am struggling so much and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have so much anxiety with the responsibility and my memory problems/ health issues. I‚Äôm going to be fired and I‚Äôm scared of not having health insurance. I think I need to look at other jobs outside of nursing but don‚Äôt even know what I am capable of handling at this point- and I know how hard it is to find a job right now.

This post is all over the place which I apologize for. I am just looking for advice on how to get myself in a better situation. My life feels so unstable right now and I can‚Äôt handle it. I think my problems are being caused by the possible Cushings.

I got exceptionally close to my staff (which I know isn‚Äôt encouraged in the corporate world, but it was so easy to get close to them because I‚Äôm a very young manager, and was relatively close in age with everyone below me). 

I was having many issues with the rest of my management team, which eventually led to me being terminated. The termination was a huge surprise to me and everyone else, because the issues we were having were not serious enough for a reasonable termination. But genuinely, it‚Äôs not the loss of my job I‚Äôm grieving, but the camaraderie of my team.

If you‚Äôve ever worked in a restaurant, you know how tight knit restaurant people are. And my staff were my safe space. I felt very comfortable around them. We would joke around and on a human level get along so well. I felt like they respected my leadership even more because of how well we got along. I never had issues disciplining them because they always did as I asked. But beyond that, we were like a family. 

The day I got terminated, I was immediately removed from all our work group chats. All my staff started messaging me and calling me.

Key facts the speak for staying at my job:
- My team! I really, really like all of them and we are doing a lot of things outside of/after work together 
- My manager - He is managing in the way that I personally like (no micro-management, trusting me with doing things on my own but jumping in and defending me if I do a mistake, pretty flexible with work hours (as long as I get the work done it‚Äôs fine if we leave earlier))
- The job itself: I still like what I do and am interested in it but feel like I don‚Äôt really learn new stuff anymore
- the industry and the company: I like it and it is pretty hard to get into at the moment

CONS:
- also the industry: it pays a lot less than I would get somewhere else and there is always the possibility of letting people go (my job is quite Save though)
- my job: I am scared of getting bored of it in the nearer future and don‚Äôt see any career development happening (maybe I need to ask for it?)
- money - as I could definitely get more money if I get a new job and the salary increase that comes with it

General issue is that I wouldn‚Äôt even know what jobs to search for. My current job is officially called Business Analyst but my tasks aren‚Äòt really the same as one would expect for it. I searched similar job offers at other companies and can‚Äôt really fulfill the expectations that they have.

I really wish I would have listened to him in hindsight, because I would have been fine on just that money, along with my side hustles and already well established savings. 

Ultimately, I‚Äôm not sure which job to quit. I don‚Äôt want to let anyone down (which I fear I am already doing from being stretched too thin). Since this is a small town as well, I also don‚Äôt want to get a bad rap or make anyone mad or screw anyone over, so I‚Äôm in desperate need of what to do. Both jobs have their pretty fair pros and cons:

Job A:
$25 an hour
Retirement with 3% match
Cause I‚Äôm more passionate about (animals)
Heavy fundraising pressure 
Remote, flexible hours
More meetings day to day
Generally like co workers
Worry about my perception as I haven‚Äôt been putting in as many hours as they have been wanting/achieving desired results
Much more disorganized as an organization (warned by other staff of no clear onboarding, other staff not sure what to do sometimes and most have other jobs too, generally have gotten very little guidance)
Work is harder but more prestigious 
Generally more fun after hours events 
Less financially stable (ended last year about $26,000 under, still have 12 month reserve and other money and assets)
More reliant on funding like grants 
Position is grant funded
Already have work from home set up that money was set up like a desktop

Job B:
$24 an hour (to be bumped to $25 after my first 90 days)
No benefits
Working directly with children ages 12 months to 6 years in classrooms (This is not something I thought I would be doing originally and am incredibly uncomfortable with it, although it is only supposed to be on rare occasions when we are in need of subs, I heavily dislike ill behaved young children)
Less fundraising pressure, mix of other office work
In-person 3 days a week, sometimes more depending on what‚Äôs going on that week like other office absences or meeting or events
Less meetings day to day
Generally like co workers, heavy dislike of temporary consultants brought on to help with fundraising for the rest of the year 
Very positive perception of me overall
More organized than Job A, although still could improve
50 minute breaks every day
Work is easier but less prestigious 
Generally less fun after hour meetings/events
Generally more stable (steady stream of income as a child care institution)
Less reliant on funding like grants, mostly just a push for specific capital project right now 
Position is not grant funded

I would love to break out of fundraising altogether, and just go in to office work. Although, I‚Äôm lucky to even have got these days and it‚Äôs very hard to find a part time office job, let alone many jobs in my small town. So, this is ultimately my dilemma right now. I welcome any thoughts, questions, or other perspectives!

1jn6qhk,"Unsure of What to Do...In a job that has *great* benefits, but I am not suited for it","Basically, I'm in a pretty decent job. It's got good benefits, decent pay. I work remote. I will admit I work for a university in a blue state, so the ""industry"" is a little uncertain right now. However, I work doing data work for the university. It's not strictly a data-entry job, but that's a lot of it. The issue is it involves a lot of executive functioning and project management. I have severe ADHD and idiopathic hypersomnia (both have been diagnosed by doctors). Even treated (which is hard) both conditions still impact my job daily. I feel like I underperform and let my team down constantly. Not on purpose, not because I don't care, but because I'm struggling that much.

However, I also have a second job at a big-box retail store. I'm just a cashier. That's it. Not management. I love it. I love talking to people, I love seeing them smile, I love helping fix their problems (which usually aren't high stake), and I love just chatting with people. I like seeing new people, regulars, etc. I even like working at Christmas time! (I get that this is really weird) I'm also \*good\* at my job there.

  
And as I'm typing this out I realize how big of a difference there is in the two jobs. 

  
The problem is that the university job, of course, pays more and offers benefits (which I need due to the medical conditions mentioned and the others not mentioned).  Otherwise I would, even with the worse hours, take a retail cashier job in a heartbeat. 

  
I think the retail job is also easier for me because I have to take tasks as they come at me and not plan out (as much) what I have to do and when. I also enjoy the immediate feedback of a job-well done, even if it's in the form of a customer smiling and saying thank you. I enjoy the fact that there aren't a whole lot of tasks to do: just a few tasks you have to do over and over. 

I should also say that I am not someone who wants to be important and ""high-up"" in their job. I am happy without the responsibility that comes with management and supervisory roles. Also, those roles typically require more executive functioning, which I have almost \*none\* of.

Does anyone have any suggestions for where/how I can maybe find something more suited to my strengths and capabilities? 

**Also, I do want to note that at my university job since I \*finally, finally\* have a diagnosis from a doctor I am working on asking for accommodations that will help me perform as best as I possibly can. I am also providing documentation (not directly to my managers, but to the accommodations office), to protect myself.** ",Due-Baseball6076,1,1.0,2,1743317255,2025-03-30 06:47:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jn6qhk/unsure_of_what_to_doin_a_job_that_has_great/,3,2025

I can test relatively well, but theres something wrong with my executive functioning. Never had the grit to stick with anything long enough to get good. Only thing Ive ever excelled at was athletics and I love being active, but I just don't see or want to turn that into a meaningful career. I've been a teacher on and off for the last 13 years and I do well with kids, but it just gets repetitive and boring. I feel cursed.

Ive spend a large chunk of my adult life just vegetating (gaming, napping, doomscrolling, drinking/smoking), avoiding having to face my issues head on, and its really starting to feel like I'm losing my mental faculties.

I feel like if I had someone by my side 24/7 with a gun to my head forcing me to put in the work, I could make something happen but the drive just isnt there, I've always just kinda been mentally lazy. Didnt have the iq for physics and too much social anxiety for mba.

1jn4ei9,How to handle a problematic person on team,"Hello reddit, I have a problem that is making my work and my life hard. I have talked to all of my family about it, but I would like some perspective from other folk.

For the last 6 months I've been co-leading a technical team on a very specialized industry. This is, for all intents and purposes, my dream job. Everyone on the team is technical, except for my co-lead who, although an engineer, is more on the mangement side of things.

About a month ago, I started to feel a bit overworked and had some minor health problems. Around that same time, my co-lead started to act out, picking fights with our boss, stressing out the team over minor things and picking minor fights with me over minutiae.

A couple of weeks back, we had a big confrontation during a team dinner in front of the team, she acussed me of being insensitive because I sometimes fixed her GPT-generated english on our presentations and I got really uncorfotable. She kept being nasty until I broke down a bit and confessed to feeling overworked and close to burnout (this was unapropiate of me).

One week later, during a team meeting, she presented some work that was not very well defined and I challenged her on it (who is this for, how much time / effort would it take, etc.). She got defensive and said that she didn't understand my concerns, and said this is the only part of the job that is fulfilling for her. The whole team got uncomfortable but we were able to carry on.

Up to this point, we've resolved our issues over a coffe, so I asked her for a coffe meeting to smooth things over. At this time, she played nice, and said she is worried about me, she brought up things about my ex (she only knows we broke up some months ago after my step-dad passed away) and acted worried about me, saying that I am stuck in a vicious cycle of overworking and that it seems as is my life is devoid of meaning. She also claimed my knee injury (I've been limping for a month due to a gym injury) was due to my ""anxiety"".

I didn't process it at the time, but afterwards I felt like absolute shit. I started to have trouble sleeping, and I started to examine her claims and our work relationship so far.

This is where I discovered, to my dismay, that she had consistently done work at the last minute counting on me to save her (working late, working though lunch, etc.). I also realized that there were many instances where she showed unprofessional behaviour (talking about her family drama during meetings, gossiping about people, picking fights in front of clients, etc.). I started to freak out and spiraled a bit, I looked at her deliverables and realized that many of the things she claimed to have done were either incomplete, not up to standard or actually done by someone else.

Since then, she has continued to exibit all of these behaviours and started actively bad mouthing our boss. I am technical staff, this is my first real leadership role, and I am not well equipped for confrontation, I am also a bit naive. I have tried to assert some boundaries with little success, but I feel that the ship has sailed.

On monday, I am going to make my case to our boss that she is not properly fullfilling her role, that so far we've been able to achieve results because the rest of the team has stepped up, but that we need someone else who can actually cover her responsabilities if we're to deliver on our project.

I am extremely frustrated, I am anxious and I feel like a fool. I am scared that she might retaliate, I am also a bit scared that maybe I am on the wrong here.

I‚Äôm currently a grad student graduating this May, and I‚Äôve been interning since last Fall, primarily working in the DevOps/cloud space. As I start seriously applying for full-time roles, I‚Äôm trying to figure out the best next steps to strengthen my resume and boost my confidence; whether that‚Äôs through certifications, portfolio work, or learning new tools.


What I‚Äôve Been Working On (Internship Experience):

‚Ä¢ Mostly working with AWS services (Lambda, S3, EventBridge, CloudWatch)

‚Ä¢ Building ETL pipelines: fetching API data, transforming it, and storing it in MongoDB
	
‚Ä¢ Creating infrastructure with Terraform

‚Ä¢ Setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions (YAML)
	
‚Ä¢ The org I interned with is a non-profit (a church). The work has been hands-on and legit, but I sometimes worry if it will carry the same weight as corporate experience.


Certifications I‚Äôve Been Considering:
	
‚Ä¢ AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (maybe Dev or SysOps next)

‚Ä¢ HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate

‚Ä¢ Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin

‚Ä¢ Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)

‚Ä¢ AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional
(I started studying for Cloud Practitioner but it feels too basic at this point.)


The Dilemma:
I‚Äôm tight on time; finishing grad school, still working part-time, and actively job hunting. I want to make sure I‚Äôm investing effort in the right areas, so I don‚Äôt waste time on certifications or projects that won‚Äôt meaningfully help in landing a job or standing out.


What I‚Äôm Looking For:

‚Ä¢ Advice on which certifications are actually worth prioritizing for someone aiming to get into DevOps or cloud roles

‚Ä¢ Any other suggestions that can help in job applications: portfolio tips, tools to learn, open-source contributions, resume focus, etc.
	
‚Ä¢ General career guidance as I make this transition into the industry

1jn0upq,"After 1,956 applications and countless rejections, I finally got 1 offer after learning this lesson","I started applying for jobs in March 2024 and finally landed a job today. It was common for me to prepare for interviews on the school shuttle bus or skip dinner to finish an assessment.

My long job search journey can be broken down into three phases:
1Ô∏è‚É£ No Direction (March 2024 ‚Äì August 2024)
1,300+ applications, 5 interview invitations from fake or small-sized companies.
I even attended an information session where all the participants were old grandma and grandpa.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjustment (September 2024 ‚Äì October 2024)
Stopped applying and reflected on my mistakes.
Realized I had wasted time on ineffective efforts: no polished resumes, no refined interview skills.
Created 6 versions of my resume tailored to different job roles.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Apply! Practice! Refine! (November 2024 ‚Äì March 2025)
500+ applications, 23 interviews.
Polished my interview answers daily using ChatGPT until it achieved full memory.
Visited mock interview websites more frequently than Tiktok.
Revised my resume sentence by sentence.
Even dreamed about practicing behavioral questions in my sleep.
Finally, I made it.

Here are the tools I used after adjusting my strategy, hope this helps someone struggling!
‚úÖ Job Application Websites:
Indeed: Better for mid- and small-sized companies, ideal for students seeking internships or entry-level roles.
Handshake: Where I got my first internship. A reliable platform connected to universities with up-to-date job postings.
LinkedIn: More suitable for applying to larger companies than Indeed.
‚úÖ Interview Preparation Websites:
Glassdoor: Offers real interview experiences and company reviews from past candidates and employees. Also provides job market insights worth reading.
AMA Interview: Mock interviews with an AI avatar. Helped me refine my speaking speed, gestures, and answers through real-time feedback. I felt proud when I finally received a high score from my robot interview coach lol.
It can directly predict interview questions on LinkedIn job posts and start mock interviews with an AI avatar based on your target role and resume. It helped me refine my speaking speed, gestures, and answers through real-time feedback. I felt proud when I finally received a high score from my robot interview coach lol.
‚úÖ Resume Revision Websites:
ChatGPT: Provides tailored resume suggestions based on job descriptions, work experience, and projects.
DeepSeek: Offers more detailed and comprehensive feedback than ChatGPT, though slightly slower in response time.

I lost count of how many rejection letters I received, but they never stopped me from applying for the next job.
The most valuable lesson I learned from my hundreds of sleepless nights is this:
A smarter strategy is more important than the number of applications.
Landing a job is becoming increasingly difficult. If you're struggling, know that it‚Äôs not your fault in this job market.

1jmzjp7,Considering Leaving Job Because of Unsafe Working Conditions But Nothing Lined Up to Replace It.,"I (22F) recently transitioned into a full time position at the company where I had previously interned at. I'm an engineer and my position involves going to manufacturing sites and performing maintenance on certain equipment. I had finished my training which involved going to a few different manufacturing sites and working with another engineer to work on the equipment. My boss just sent me on my first solo trip.¬†

To put it lightly, it has been an absolute¬† nightmare. Even prior to getting on site I was immediately concerned because the list of equipment I needed to perform maintenance on was twice as long as the ones that I worked on during my training. I raised my concern with my project manager and got told not to worry because we've done this in the years prior. 

When I got to site, none of the tools required for the maintenance were there. Because of this my trip had to be extended quite a few days. This site is also not local, and my position requires me to do travel all over the country. When my tools finally arrived two days later I start to work on the list of equipment needing maintenance and all the equipment is wildly different from what I was trained on. I started frantically messaging coworkers to try to figure out how to service the equipment and how to even get to it. In some cases the equipment was incredibly hard to reach, and the workarounds weren't safe enough in my opinion. For example, some of the equipment was high up and I had to get on my tiptoes on the ladder in order reach it. When I reached out to my project manager about unsafe conditions, I was left on read for three hours. When I finally received a message back it simply read, 'Sorry, was in meetings. Did you fix your issue?'. Due to these conditions, I got injured, resulting in a third degree acid burn. I had received another acid burn on another one of my trainings, previously.

The help I received in terms of actually working on the equipment was also lackluster at best. It typically involved just being told what equipment was required to work on the equipment, not actually how to do it. I would sit on the floor, watching YouTube videos on how to use it.¬†I've informed my colleagues that I haven't been trained on the majority of the equipment and they've mostly ignored me when I say it.

As a result of this, the work has been extremely slow and I am not going to finish in time. When I told this to my coworkers they merely told me to focus on certain types of equipment, which is extremely frustrating. Every single day on site has been an absolute nightmare, and I've almost walked out multiple occasions.¬†

I interned with the company for a year, and this maintenance stuff tends to be something that new engineers do. I really enjoy the other stuff that I do while¬†working here, but this maintenance is what I'll be doing for the rest of the year. I don't have anything else lined up, but I don't think I can handle any more of this. It makes me almost physically sick to go in, and I'm concerned about the ways my pleas for help have been ignored especially in regards to safety.¬†

1jmxx8e,How to find a job as SAP MM/SD Consultant with Zero projects experience but more than 16 years of experience as a superuser & managerial experience?,"This is a brief of my professional background and experience.

Over the past 16 years, I have built a solid foundation in SAP systems and business processes. My journey began with 10 years as a superuser in Dow Chemical Company at Egypt‚Äôs manufacturing facility, followed by 5 years as a key user in a Saudi chemical trading company , where I served as the focal point for the implementation of ECC and its upgrade and migration to S/4HANA. During this time, I was responsible for the SD and MM modules, ensuring their successful integration and optimization.

Additionally, I spent 1 year as a key user in a rollout project for one of our newest manufacturing facilities. This experience allowed me to complete SAP SD and MM consultant courses, both of which culminated in practical projects that further refined my technical expertise.

Although I didn't have the opportunity to work on the rollout project as a SAP consultant due to relocating to Norway with my family, I have gained extensive business experience and technical knowledge that make me confident in my ability to add value to any organization.

I would be delighted to discuss my experience in greater detail with anyone who might have a job opportunity for me to see if it aligns with the needs of your client or project.

Thank you for considering me. I look forward to your reply!

1jmxul7,How long is it normal to wait on a job offer and how to negotiate?,"Hey guys, l need help. Long story short, one of my coworkers in a branch on the other side of the country (Canada) offered me a job last wednesday. Needless to say, I was over the moon. After spending 15 years in the same position i finally have a chance and reason to leave everything behind to go live on the west coast and work with my favorite coworkers. But it was only verbal. This is the first job offer i ever got and received useful tips on what to look for when i get it in a previous post.

  
But it's been a few days now, and nothing. There's no one else to consider for the job. They offered me the position before posting an ad (which they ended up not doing cuz i immediately said yes), so i think that's self-explanatory on how much they want *me* and not just anyone to fill it. It's a new role by the way, which makes it even more exciting. There's a similar position already held by someone else, but business over there is growing and they need one more person to get the work done.

  
How long is it normal to wait on a job offer? The wait is killing me and i don't want to blow my chance. This is the opportunity of a lifetime to live my dream. After how much time can i ask about it? I'm guessing it has to be approved by head office, but how long does that take?

  
Moreover, how do you negociate salary? I currently make 45k, which i think is unfairly low considering i've been there since i'm 16. I'd have to move to a big city on the other side of the country. I'm a single 30yo woman with no kids and i refuse to live with roommates. It's a coordinator/dispatcher position in the customer service industry, 40 hours per week. Would it be unreasonable to ask for at least 60-65k? Or even more? I looked on job listing websites for similar positions and some of them were offering a salary over 70k. I wanna be able to pay my bills and still have money left at the end of the month without having to use my savings. I want to able to live a comfortable life, not try to survive only on what i earn praying i'll be able to afford rent the next year. I never said anything about my salary or the last (very insulting) raise I got by fear i'd somehow lose my job as i can't afford to lose the health insurance that comes with it.

1jmxjf1,Career Change Ahead,"In genuine need of advice.

I was laid off last week, I‚Äôm 50, and I want to career change, but I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I have been in marketing for over 25 years. I have worked for large companies (mostly) and small ones (more recently). I had two employers over 20 years. I work hard and I‚Äôm
Good at what I do, including leading and developing teams. I did really well and was promoted many times.

About 9 months before the pandemic, I switched jobs but the company was hit really hard (revenue dropped 90% in just one week!) and I was laid off after ~2 years.

I got a new job almost immediately. They were a pre-profitability start-up, spending loads of cash but growing revenue. Then interest rates soared and the company had to cut back on spending. Again, I was laid off after ~2 years.

I consulted for a while as I tried to find something that could be a long term job. I thought I had found it and I accepted a lot less to take it. After 3 months, the PE-owned company was sold and they were not hitting their numbers. They made me layoff a third of my team and then laid me off!

I am a great person. I‚Äôm great at what I do. I work hard. I love people and teams and people who have worked for me have (at least said) they loved working for me. My experience is an in-demand area, but the senior jobs are very hard to come by right now and I have had zero luck getting a lower role with so much experience.

I think I need to career change and reinvent myself. I‚Äôm good with people and numbers, sales and marketing. I love global markets. I have an undergrad degree in global studies and an MBA from a highly reputable school. I live in Minnesota but my family and I are even willing to move.

Does anyone have experience, advice, or recommendations for me? I am
optimistic about the future and I need to start down a new path beginning Monday.

1jmx7s0,leaving my cushy job for something better... (i think?),"hi, i'm very confused on what i should do career wise and looking for advice from people who prob have more life and work experience than me. 

some backstory i'm in my mid twenties and i am a very sheltered person i've been at my current job for a year now i consider it my first ""job"" because i've mainly done summer youth-esqe programs (it goes up to 25 in my state) where i only worked for a month at most on the rare occasions i was employed. i'm definitely at work to live person, i don't like working at all and i don't think i have a dream career.

i been working my current job for a year and for a first job it's easy mindless money. i work at a bar( not as a bartender) in a airport making 23.25 an hour 40hr a week 4 days, it's also a unionized job. the management is very lax and i'm able to get away with a lot like calling out once or multiple times a week and leaving sometimes 1 or 2 hours early unannounced without being reprimanded. 

there are things i really dislike about this job 

1. the environment: i hate working at an airport it's super depressing. going through tsa everyday etc. 

2. the pay: i'm a little bitter that my position pays less than a bartender though tho i'm expected to bartend if none come in. 

3. the job allows tipping: this is the first tipped job i've ever had, but i don't like the type of person i'm becoming because of that. my mood is ruined if i don't make a certain amount per day. it's irrational i know.

4. my coworkers suck: i know everywhere i go i will encounter this problem but i just feel like they take advantage of me and expect me to cater to them hand and foot. and getting paid less and tipped out less is just more salt in my wounds. i obviously know that some people get paid more but the fact that we do the same job ( i'm expected to do my job AND theirs when they can't but the opposite never happens) irks me to no end 

right now i'm in the interviewing process for another job it's a corporate position with an insurance company in manhattan it's an apprenticeship that pays the same that i'm making currently, they offer raises throughout the 2 years it'll take to complete it but it'll only cap off to around $25hr (which is how much a bartender makes after a year at my current job) they'll also pay for me to get a associate degree in business management ( i'm not interested it that...)

i have one interview left before they'll give me an offer but i'm having second thoughts because idk if i'm possibly walking into something i have no passion for that definitely will be more strict and have more expectations of me on the off chance that i could make more money in the future. i just hate customer service and i don't want that to be the only thing i'm qualified for.",SeveredHeadOfMedusa,1,1.0,3,1743285083,2025-03-29 21:51:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jmx7s0/leaving_my_cushy_job_for_something_better_i_think/,3,2025

1jmw7wf,"Found out Boss has been sleeping with the new trainee for months after lecture about ""keeping work and pleasure separate"". What should I do?","Q3 of last year we had a new trainee (24F) start in our team. I (29M) mentioned to other colleagues that I was thinking of asking her to hang out and my Boss (40M) decided to pull me aside for a short talk explaining how it ""would not be appropriate"" as I'd just been promoted and how I ""have to keep work and pleasure separate - you'd lose your job"". 

I should mention that during this particular time I had a family member with a very serious illness which meant that I *literally* could not afford to lose my job at any cost (boss was aware of this).

Fast-forward to now, I've returned to the office having worked remotely to provide care, and I've been told by several colleagues that my boss, the very same man who threatened my position, has been engaged in a (poorly kept) secret relationship with her (trainee) for months. If I am to believe what I've been told by co-workers, this all began a few weeks after I had to take leave from the office. She barely talks to me now. 

Needless to say I am both confused and furious at the situation, especially the hypocrisy displayed by my boss, who I respected and saw as a mentor. He is already being monitored by HR due to breaching company policy (taking her on business trips etc.) but as of yet nothing has been done. 

Can anyone who's been in a similar situation give me some advice? I'm trying to let it go but I'm having a hard time trusting him. Is it really a simple case of ""let it go and don't get involved""?

1jmw2zz,"Should I stay a full year? Unprofessional boss, not feeling challenged","Graduated college in May 2024. Got a job at a mental health center and resigned two weeks later as my body and mind couldn't physically handle the stress - I slept 35 hours within 2 days.

I got a job in admin at a local university (alma mater) a month after the mental health job. This job pays $1 better, has good benefits, and I don't usually take stress home with me.

Anyway, I'm feeling restless as I'm never challenged in ways that I want to be and my boss can be... well, I'll let you read:
 - Boss *always* speaks horribly about the person in my position before me (e.g. ""she didn't want to do this project because she had to stand. She was fat and needed to go to the gym""). 
- Boss speaks poorly of fellow colleagues in nearly every conversation
- Boss has gotten mad at me for using post-its to take notes, because the person in my position previously did, can't use a legal pad either.
- Boss sends condescending emails when there is no need (well, there should never be a position in a prof environment). Takes accusatory stance instead of following up politely.

The department is dysfunctional. No one gets along and there's no sense of community. No one stands up to Boss. My colleague I mainly work with is kind and I appreciate him a lot.

I've been there for 6 months. I want to make it to a year, since my mental health job didn't work out and 1yr on a resume looks good. I've passed the probationary period and did well (however, boss said I needed a ""thicker skin""... bruh).

1jmvvqf,Should I change roles in the same company even though the work culture is bad,"I'd posted here a few days back about whether I should quit my job just after 10 months since I realized this isn't what I want to do at all.

Fast forward to this past weekend, I had the conversation with my boss about quitting since I didn't think this was the right job for me. Contrary to popular belief, he doesn't want me to leave and is open to the idea of changing my role in the company. 

Currently, I work as a customer success manager but he would like me to switch to marketing if I think that would suit me better. He explained the job profile and it actually sounds more interesting and right up my alley. It does sound like a great opportunity too

However, I would still need to work under him. One of my reasons for leaving the job is also the toxic work culture and upper management. I'm worried the stress might increase and I might be overworked big time.

1jmvoo0,6 Month review coming up soon. How honest should I be with them about the challenges and grievances I have about working there?,"I'm 15 years into my career, for reference. in some ways I'm running a bit ""behind schedule"" career development wise, in part because of being pigeonholed at previous jobs, and also frankly because of ongoing ADD symptoms, even with treatment).

Before this job I spent six years working at my dream company, and once again I found myself being pigeonholed and started voicing those concerns, until last summer I got laid off. I started this job a couple of months later because they were offering a position with which I could ""catch up"" career-wise and move into more managerial territory. 

It's now been six months since my higher date, and one of the partners and a senior associate want to do a check in to see how I've been doing in my role and how I'm feeling about all this. This is standard procedure for all new hires and follows up a few monthly check-ins with HR with the same theme.

thing is, there are ways in which I'm unhappy there and I'm not really which ones to voice.

A big part of the problem is my current manager on my current project. Historically I've been told that I'm very easy to work with and I've never had a manager attention like this before. She doesn't like communicating with me and generally avoids it which is obviously a problem. She's very insecure and there are aspects of the work that she frankly sucks at, but she also is a bit of a control freak who tries to do aspects of my job and relegate me to a more junior level. The only feedback I get from her is negative feedback about mistakes I've made learning along the way, and she also accuses me of not doing certain tasks when in fact they are done and she just didn't read the email that I sent about it.

The other part of the issue is that I don't get much satisfaction out of the work that the office does. My previous company created very satisfying product and the stuff happening here, well intended as it is, generally has pretty a terrible outward facing appearance. 

A third part of the issue is that they have no organized set of information for how to get the work done, and no resources set aside to educate staff about it. The first phase of my project consist of myself and my new manager constantly making mistakes that violated office standards because we were never informed of what the office standards were. And the people in charge of the standards know this and have been hoping for literally years to get information organized, but nobody has had time to do it. The profit margin on the work is so small that there is almost no time to spend salary hours on these internal efforts.

Unfortunately, the reality is that I don't see myself working here for more than a few years. I appreciate the opportunity to catch up on career development, but my manager seems to be getting in the way of that and setting up a ""no win"" situation for me, covering her ass at every return and pointing fingers at me for all the team wide mistakes. I've already spoken to the partners and HR extensively about the tension she and I have, and things have only mildly improved.

What is appropriate to say and not say at this six month check-in? Obviously I'm not gonna tell them I envision myself leaving in a few years but, but I do want to see if there are ways to have a discussion about how a further improve my experience in the meantime.

3) Intelligent Jerk. He is very knowledgeable and organized. These traits alone lead to good productivity and outcomes.

now after i requested my dad back in 2021 to get me a spread system to work on and my old system can't handle editing softwares that much. it gpu used to suck a lot and i was done with sharing pc as i couldn't get time to learn editing. now when i got my pc i completed my certification in this field from digiskills to gain more skills and took help from youtube too. thanks to gfxmentor. and done certification as well. after that i got into college and i did diploma not inter. from 2020 to 2023.

so, diploma took all of my time. and i couldn't focus on video editing at all. i thought maybe in computer science is my passion. i have done diploma in software engineering. that's why. but, my passion is only in working as an video editor. i am slipping downwards now. and own household isn't much hopeful for me and they think i am wasting time. which i accept i am somewhere. but, they don't know how much it's difficult for me now to put all things together back. i left my bachelor's degree in media science in 1st semester in last fall. because i wasn't able to put my best and i got afraid from the place by seeing how different i am from this place and it makes me feel like a stranger. i was foolish at that time. i got socially awkward over there.

now i am like a football without a goal. kicking myself and don't know what i have to do now. i have searched what's going on in the job market and currently in my knowledge i might be wrong i can see video editors are content creators now. from creating scripts to the ideas of the videos and gathering all assets of the video for the client. which i later confirmed by my friend who work as an video editor from 2-3 yearsnnow. he can't give me work as well because he works with his brother and not interested in working with me (that's my thought) and i know video editing is a very specific field. which only focuses on editing videos and giving video a meaning in any sense. it's creative in it's own way. but, the clients somewhere taking this field in a very bad way. and with no good future. less budgets with more work which isn't relatable mostly to a person's designation.

now if anyone can please guide me on how to put myself again to be working in this field. as i can't accept the current job market and it's weird strategies. and if i am doing somewhere wrong which i am totally unaware off. please let me know.",MSLogan07,1,1.0,0,1743279897,2025-03-29 20:24:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jmvcyn/cant_start_my_career_guidance_needed/,3,2025
1jmunog,Engineering jobs with work/life balance?,"I‚Äôve been with my husband for almost a decade but he‚Äôs only been in this mech. engineering career going on 3 years. It‚Äôs been very tough especially on him. I know his job means a lot and he loves his coworkers but I keep begging him to explore his options. He works a lot of unpaid overtime bc he‚Äôs salary. His hours should be 7-4 except it‚Äôs been 7-whenever he‚Äôs done most of the time. That could be at 6 at night or even 8:30. 5 days a week. He also goes in on weekends for a few hours, unpaid. Sometimes at night people will call him or email him so he‚Äôs always on his phone. 

This has put a serious strain on our relationship. He‚Äôs too tired to do anything. I‚Äôm picking up the slack a lot with chores and shopping, I also have a job doing 12s. I want to start trying for a child this year but he said absolutely not. He is always moving the goal posts. I feel like if he had a more stable, better paying job he‚Äôd come around to it. I don‚Äôt feel loved or heard. I‚Äôm angry all the time because I‚Äôd rather be alone at this point than have an absent husband that contributes to the mess of the household. 

I feel like he‚Äôs also changed as a person. Whenever I see weaponized incompetence on TikTok, I used to think ‚Äúthank god he‚Äôs not like that‚Äù but over the past year, he IS now like that. I‚Äôm so incredibly tired and frustrated. Now he wants to go back to school and that pushes back our plans for a family even more or even plans in general.

1jmtffl,"I left my job in Oct 2024 because of a lot of personal issues. Looking for work now, what do I do about this on my resume?","Graduated in August 2022, worked as a freelance writer till I was hired full-time for content writing by a dental company, and did that till Sept 2023 (after she replaced me with AI. lol). Since I had experience in risk/compliance from my student job and primarily wrote compliance training content for the dental company, I worked from then till Oct 2024 (as a 1099) for a company in risk/compliance. 

A lot of brutal things in life accumulated to a breaking point, which led to me leaving the job last year, in addition also to a few pretty severe ethical violations at the company I was working for which were unbearable to me. I took a few months to try to reassess what path I wanted career-wise; my degree is irrelevant to most jobs (I originally planned to go into law, but changed my mind because of expenses) and risk/tech was becoming too brutal, and my writing aspirations weren't opening any doors either because of AI. So, long story short, I resorted to living with my dementia-riddled grandmother and was her daily caretaker for her since around December last year as we tried to figure out selling her house to afford a memory care facility, because my mother couldn't handle it anymore, and it gave somewhere for my cats and I to live while I tried to find another job. The house finally sold in February and I have been relieved of my duties. 

Of course, this felt like a ""job"" and I feel like it was a valid excuse to stop working for a while, especially since I was lost about what direction I wanted to take and was mentally burnt out. I see so many people recommending putting caretaker on their resumes to explain gaps, but if that's such a common recommendation, are employers going to see it as an excuse/something fake? It's legitimate in my case but I fear giving them the wrong idea.

I have done sporadic little writing and marketing projects for clients here and there but not near enough to constitute work or putting it on a resume. I don't want to put that since I fear that it'll give the same idea. But I am very anxious about the end date of my most recent job being Oct 2024. 

How can I approach my resume in a way that isn't dishonest but also isn't potentially off-putting? I am going to be applying for uni jobs, municipal jobs, etc, all in administrative assistant roles and similar.

I'm working on a capstone research project exploring why the modern hiring process seems so dysfunctional at the moment. I'm gathering data from both job seekers and recruiters/hiring managers to understand what's working and what's not.

After watching friends (and this subreddit) apply to hundreds of jobs with no responses, while companies simultaneously struggle to find talent, I became fascinated by paradox. 

**If you have 5 minutes to share your experiences, I'd really appreciate your input:**¬†[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZtOCwIrzzLIJMdR8zD11m1yT7kJdlA5wglQRYuZvBSNilcA/viewform?usp=dialog](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZtOCwIrzzLIJMdR8zD11m1yT7kJdlA5wglQRYuZvBSNilcA/viewform?usp=dialog)

The survey is anonymous, but I'll be sharing the aggregated findings here once I have enough responses. I'm particularly interested in understanding:

* How people are navigating the current job market
* The effectiveness of referrals vs. traditional applications
* What job seekers and referrers wish the other side knew

1jmr11w,Is this common for student jobs?,"I‚Äôm a 19 year old international student living in Antwerp and studying at KDG University, and I recently landed a job at an Irish Pub in the city centre.

I had to go through 2 trial days to ensure I was ready and I passed them both.

The way this Irish Pub handles their employees is through an app called Strobbo, in which I have to put my desired working days (and hours) and they have to get accepted. Through this app you also clock in when you get there and clock out as well when your shift ends.

Now here‚Äôs where everything went downhill: The day I finished my second trial I was waiting for a message from the same person I‚Äôve been talking with before and the person that also interviewed me. I‚Äôve waited the rest of that day and no reply so I texted her the morning of the next day, asking if my second trial day went well and when can I put my availabilities in the app.

She replied 3 days later, saying that the second trial day went well and I should put my availabilities in the app for as long in the future as I could, and that‚Äôs what I did.
I put my desired working days for the rest of March and the entire month of April as well, and then I texted her saying that I did.

It‚Äôs been about 5 days now and I still haven‚Äôt gotten a reply from her, and my availabilities haven‚Äôt been accepted either. And the thing is, I‚Äôm able to see in the app that other employees have theirs accepted all the way till the middle of April. 

So I called her‚Ä¶ and she declined immediately, but right after she replied to my message saying what she said before, that I should put my availabilities in the app so I can be included in the planning, which I did.

Then I asked why none of my available working times have been accepted (which was yesterday) and today I‚Äôm still waiting for a reply, and my working shifts haven‚Äôt been accepted.

Is this normal for student jobs or jobs in general in Belgium? And what should I do?

1jmql0f,How much can I tweak my job title,"Here‚Äôs a few paragraphs of background:

Early twenties. Work at a small series A/B startup on growth. I‚Äôm getting my bachelors degree in Econ (finishing very soon with high GPA from t50-t100 school) while I work for this company in NYC, there‚Äôs only about 15 employees.

I feel like the company I work for can be very inefficient for an early stage startup. I‚Äôm the only technical person on my team and I‚Äôm much more productive than others, and I often wonder if that just would put me at like standard productivity for a normal company or if this is usual. Overall I‚Äôm starting to get a bit unhappy here, and am wondering if there are better opportunities elsewhere where I can be surrounded by more like minded people.

I made a push to get involved more on the engineering side but it hasn‚Äôt gone super well. I‚Äôm in this weird medium where the stuff I make is super helpful for my non technical team but it‚Äôs ridiculed a bit by the small engineering team we have, and I‚Äôm a bit looked down upon. I feel like if I was given guidance I could definitely write code to their standards but I‚Äôm juggling a lot of different stuff on my plate and sometimes given short timelines. They know I use AI to code stuff really fast and they sometimes kinda look down on me for it. I feel like I‚Äôm being led on that I will eventually ‚Äúbe an engineer‚Äù but realistically they will never accept me. 

There‚Äôs another team, and that‚Äôs our product team. I think I‚Äôd be a good product manager. I‚Äôm charismatic when I need to be, can write code of my own, I understand software infrastructure, and I communicate well with technical people. I feel dissuaded from working on product by our founding team, but I‚Äôm slowly trying to work my way over to do stuff for that (very small, 2 person) team. However, there‚Äôs no guarantee this will work, the respect I get at this company by the more ‚Äúserious‚Äù teams (engineering and product, they loop the growth team out of a lot of important stuff)   probably will remain the same and be an obstacle.

Also, I don‚Äôt make a lot of money. I make a mid 80k annual salary and living in NY has been a bit tough on that.



So, all in all, the big question is, how do I become a product manager on the fastest timeline possible? 

-Can I literally just change my title to Technical PM or something (even though technical PM is a job at my company that I definitely do not have) and apply to other jobs with that title? There stuff I can highlight that I‚Äôve done that technical PMs definitely do. Do I have to wait until I stop working here to safely change my title on my resume/linkedin?

-Do I work towards doing product work within the company and try to earn more respect despite my young age and lack of experience? Is this futile and unimportant when it comes to actually getting a PM job?

Additionally, what can I do in NYC in my situation to effectively position myself for my next role to be a PM role? Does anyone know of good ways to network for this? Am I realistically PM material or is this wishful thinking?",Business_Wallaby8714,1,1.0,0,1743267019,2025-03-29 16:50:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jmql0f/how_much_can_i_tweak_my_job_title/,3,2025

For the past three years, I‚Äôve been working nonstop overtime (by choice) making roughly $80K‚Äì$90K annually, but the burnout has been overwhelming.

I recently came across an internal position for a Quality Engineer and jokingly mentioned my interest to the hiring manager. To my surprise, I was offered the role‚Äîcontingent on relocating from SoCal to NorCal. I have a strong relationship with management in that department and expect to receive the official offer letter within the next two weeks.

The posted salary range is $90K‚Äì$130K with a hybrid schedule, which I find appealing since it would allow me to earn a solid salary without excessive overtime. However, I‚Äôve already been informed that relocation assistance will not be provided, meaning I‚Äôll have to cover the moving costs myself, which will be a financial hit but something I'll have to manage.

I have 13 years of experience in the healthcare industry, but I only hold a high school diploma. I recognize this as a rare opportunity to fast-track into an engineering role with a strong title and salary. Given my background, I don‚Äôt expect an opportunity like this to come up for at least another 2-3 years staying in SoCal while I work my way up to it

That said, I anticipate the offer will be on the lower end of the posted range, and I‚Äôm unsure if I can negotiate for more‚Äîespecially considering the high cost of living in the Bay Area.

1jmlwv1,Is career switching with a masters degree possible for a completely unrelated field?,"Good evening all. Not quite sure of the format for these things but, I (23M) am a graduate of biomedicine (Hons), i have about 2 years worth of experience in the field as a laboratory analyst. Ive slowly found that i hate the field, its very inflexible in terms of jobs in other countries are licensing for healthcare positions is a nightmare, pay is much lower than i expected especially given how hard the degree was and the work itself doesnt feel satisfying. I have been thinking of career switching to finance and going into data analysis and financial analysis for companies which is where my question of whether it is possible or not lies. Im fine to complete the masters degree and start off with internships till i find my footing.

Overall my reasons for this are (A) Id like to specialize in a field where I can find jobs in different countries easily without needing to have licensing everytime i go to a different one (i tend to live in multiple places year by year) (B) Pay is higher, need to clarify pay isnt my only reason here but better compensation and progression would be nice and (C) I am increasingly passionate about the field. Ive been told hours are long and it is hard but ive already experienced 12 hour shifts and on calls in my previous jobs so it shouldnt be a problem.

1jmkh4l,Job Offer Negotiations Advice,"Well I just received an incredible offer! The benefits and perks are exactly what I was hoping for so I wont be doing any negotiating there. 

The salary however is 10% lower than I want. When HR mentioned the salary it was immediately followed with ""we can negotiate in a few days and are willing to add a sign on bonus. (This bonus is not written into my current offer.)

There are quarterly bonuses & an annual bonus written into my offer, however those wont be in full effect until i am employed 12 months. And since I don't know the amount of these bonuses, I'm not comfortable relying on them to make up 10% of my salary.

So my question is..is it reasonable for me to just ask for the 10% salary increase and leave the sign on bonus to their discretion? Or should I ask for a 7% increase with a 3% sign on bonus?

1jmkazn,Job vs. Values: would you take this offer?,"I need help figuring this out.

I'm an M26 immigrant in a European country on a job seeker visa. The market is tough. I work in marketing, and my visa lasts six months‚ÄîI've used four so far.

I've applied to over 100 jobs, done \~20 interviews, made it to four final rounds, and finally got one offer. But it‚Äôs from¬†**a big tobacco company**. The team seems good, the pay is solid, and the benefits are great.

Now, the ethical dilemma:

Do the ends justify the means?

Should I take this job to secure my residence card and settle here (where the opportunities are, all in all, better than back home)? Or should I stick to my principles, and keep searching‚Äîeven though it's been incredibly hard, my visa isn't renewable, and I could end up having to return home after spending a lot of money?

Under normal circumstances, I‚Äôd never work for a tobacco company. But I also wouldn‚Äôt judge a friend if they did, regardless of their reasons. I keep telling myself this would be temporary. Plus, since marketing tobacco products is so heavily restricted here, my work would mostly focus on product branding and distribution‚Äînot direct promotion. Still, at the end of the day, I‚Äôd be helping a company sell more of a product that benefits no one.

I already spoke with two friends who worked in major oil and mining companies. While those industries have their own ethical issues, at least you can argue they provide something essential. Tobacco? Not so much. I also worry about how this could affect my career long-term. I want to work in sectors like sustainability and wellness‚Äîwould having this on my CV hurt my chances? Or does it not matter as much as I fear?

What would you do? Stick to your values and trust something else will come along, even with the risk of ""losing everything?"" Or take it for now while still searching for something better? And if I do take it, would it be better to frame it vaguely on my CV‚Äîlike consulting for a new product at a large CPG company under NDA?

1jmj5qy,How to transition from startup to corporate,"I've been working at startups for most of my career and while the pay has been fantastic, I am getting to the point of extreme burnout. I work long grueling hours (from 9AM to almost midnight with just quick breaks for lunch and dinner). I work from home and so barely have time to go out, go to the gym, see friends and actually have a life outside of work. I used to be an advocate for remote work but with this current company I'm in, I don't enjoy all the perks that makes remote work great. I've gained so much weight and my boss is a racist sexist sociopath with zero emotional intelligence who makes my self-loathing worse with every interaction I have with him that I just cry myself to sleep at night sometimes.  I want to GET OUT.

  
I completed my post-grad business studies a while back and did an internship at a large multinational corporation and it was the most enjoyable work I did. I enjoyed the problems I was working on but the pace was very slow and I heard from full-time employees that the pay wasn't very good. At times it was frustrating because I was so used to fast-paced environment without needing approvals for everything you do. But now, I realize I would rather be in a place that actually respects work-life boundaries, where people actually go home and finish work on time because there are enough people to distribute the overall workload to. I have learned the cold hard truth that startup founders exploit their people in the guise of rallying them towards ambitious goals to the point of burnout. I don't care about the money anymore. I'm a creative person and would rather be paid lower than what I have now but have time for my passion projects outside of work. 

  
I've observed that startups usually hire people who have startup experience and large corporations hire those who have been at big names. So, as someone who has mostly worked for startups (from early stage to hyper growth stage), how do I position myself in the job market so I actually have a chance at joining a large corporation? I know large corpos get 10K+ applications for a single job and people usually get in through connections which I don't have much of. I would appreciate any advice on this. For context, I work in HR and the reason I'd like to make the switch is that large corporations often have bigger and more structured HR teams and strategies in place.

1jmj4zc,"I took on an easy, stress free job and I think im going insane with boredom, I don't know if i go back to a more difficult job or stay in a role where my anxiety is non-existent.","So two years ago I took an an apprenticeship in industrial maintenance and moved towns for the job after several years labouring in construction,  agribusiness and stints with traffic management construction sites. The role was a  nightmare, i learnt alot but a combination of bullying and the insane business practices turned me into a nervous wreck who got fired with a smile on his face.

Because I was expecting twins and because I was still full of anxiety, i went back into traffic management as a flagger and its given me easy pay days where I am making decent money standing still all day but its driven my ADHD brain crazy with boredom.

I don't know if i should stick with what is honestly the easiest job in existence or go back to a more engaging role where I had some pride in my day. I helped out an old builder boss of mine i labourered with at my first ever job, we use to fight because he expected a labourer on minimum wage to give the same performance as a tradesman on a better wage, after 2 years in industrial maintenance I felt like a new man working with him, i am leaps and bounds better than what i was 7 years ago and I feel like if i returned to construction i'd actually smash it out.

I don't know if its worth going back to stressful, hard labour that gave me satisfaction or staying with easy, low ceiling work that keeps my anxiety as low as it's ever been.

I moved back home to give the newborns a proper support network, industrial maintenance/machining is dead in this town, that apprenticeship is dead in the water and i don't miss it regardless.

1jmi4g3,I like my new job but hate my manager to the point I fear we will bump heads. What do?,"6 months ago I got a new job and experience wise it is everything I could hope for. This job has given me the opportunity to learn new skills that I was looking for and I planned to give it at least two years before transitioning into a field that I am looking for.

However, during the interview with our current acting manager I had a gut feeling that he would be a problem and 6 months in it turned to be correct. 

He is a micro manager of the worst kind. Rude, takes things personally, always gives demands and never gives credit. I can't tell you how many times I have had a sit down with this moron after deviating on a minute detail where he ""lectures"" me about company policy and way of working when there is absolutely no need for it.

He is very confrontation seeking and I think he enjoys the ""power"" he has when his employees fear him.

The team on the other hand is great. They are all super friendly and helpful. Always at hand when I need help with something. The complete opposite of our manager. We also have a ""team leader"" who everyone respects, has a super good attitude but works hand in hand with our manager. They are kind of friends and to be honest he does most of the grunt work. Without him the team would be in complete shambles. I can't for the life of me figure out why he isn't our manager instead.

I for the record take responsibility for my tasks, and try my best to keep a good attitude but it has come to a point where every time I see this moron I get anxiety and hate seeing his stupid face. I don't want to say good morning to him and he has zero clue what he is talking about.

I have gotten to know my team more personally, and I can tell you that nobody likes him at all. Since he has taken the role as acting manager 7 months ago, 4 people have quit.

The most recent guy who quit was basically a ""hero"" in the whole organization we are in. He himself developed tools that the whole company uses and we became good coworkers. He advised me to walk carefully with our manager and warned me that he will make it difficult for you if you question him.

He told me about a story where he was hospitalized once, and our manager called him to check on him. He very rudely asked ""So when will you get back?"". My colleague hung up the phone on him and decided then and there that it was time to change jobs. It came as a shock to the whole team.

My question is what should I do? I wanted to give this a shot but unfortunately he ruins it for me. Should I start looking elsewhere?

Problem is my resume:
* First job I got, I stayed for two years
* Second job, 9 months
* This is my current gig where I have 6 months of experience",firewaterdirt,8,0.9100000262260437,7,1743238357,2025-03-29 08:52:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jmi4g3/i_like_my_new_job_but_hate_my_manager_to_the/,3,2025

I‚Äôve heard his team members praise him and say that he will probably be promoted. 

Since earlier this year, his manager has said that he is ‚Äúmore senior‚Äù now every month. He even went as far as to say that he can challenge or provide more balance on the team by challenging a more abrasive and condescending senior on the team now that he himself is ‚Äúmore senior‚Äù.

However, promotion cycles have come and passed, and my boyfriend was not promoted. Roughly 50% of the people at his level and tenure were promoted. When my boyfriend asked his manager about the situation, he was told that he did not even submit the promotion packet on behalf of my boyfriend at all.

These past few months his manager has been dangling this carrot in front of my boyfriend by hinting at a promotion. His feedback was that my boyfriend needed to ‚Äúadd more comments‚Äù on tickets and ‚Äúguide discussion more‚Äù.

During the annual review, his manager said that he could be considered for the senior level in ‚Äúa year or few more years‚Äù. On a neighboring team within the same organization, two people were promoted to senior and four people were promoted to mid-level.

His manager is not known to be kind or compassionate. He is strong technically but fails to inspire his reports. When he‚Äôs previously fired individuals or seen individuals leaving the company unwillingly, he‚Äôs shown little remorse over these people leaving. 

I‚Äôm posting this to see what thoughts the people of Reddit have with regards to this situation and if my boyfriend should job search immediately.

I'm planning to go back to my previous company (Company A) after 6 months from leaving, because of toxic work environment and micromanaging bosses within my current job (Company B) and it's already affecting my mental health.

I previously left Company A due to higher salary, it was a 75% increase from my previous salary. But I really loved my bosses and my teammates there. Safe to say I already know the workload and processes so I wouldn't have to drastically adjust upon rejoining again.

6 years ago I took a position as a supply tech in a hospital making 16.50 an hour because I was desperate. I then got promoted to a lead making $19 an hour. Then to a supply coordinator making $22 an hour. 

After doing that role for a couple years, I finally got my dream job. I just accepted a salary position as a purchasing agent. They offered me $70k a year and it is majority work from home. 

I applied for this position 5 times in the last 6 years and got it by building relationships with the purchasing department over the past 6 years and being very good in the positions I held. 

I start soon and I'm dealing with some major imposter syndrome. I'm not qualified for the position on paper- it requires a degree and I only have a GED. They know this, obviously. I didn't lie about anything to them at all. 

I'm just really worried. I know the systems we use well and I'm relatively smart. But I'm from the brown collar warehouse world. I don't know how to dress nice or how to function in an office setting. 

This promotion is huge for my 10 year old daughter and I. But I'm terrified of screwing it up because they really took a chance giving me the position and I don't want to let them down. Or my daughter. 

Has anyone ever faced this scenario? How did you handle it? ",WTAF__Trump,116,0.949999988079071,46,1743219630,2025-03-29 03:40:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jmdo7m/i_just_accepted_a_massive_promotion_and_im/,3,2025

Why anyone didn't know about this? 
Listen listen
Most of us have enough time to sit and watch cartoons but none of us try to find out actual ways of earning money or atleast fund our education ourselves.

Have you ever heard of scholarships?

1. Let us tell you: Big companies like Google, Reliance, etc., MNCs ,charitable foundation they all provide financial support in form of scholarships to students those are good in studies or even average or unprivileged. You need not pay back the scholarship amount in the first place. 

2. Sometimes, they may award you as high as 50 thousands to support your education. Scholarship providers just ask for basic details like your class, year background etc. Generally, scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and financial condition. It may vary case to case.

3. Many times, scholarship providers have their own dedicated portals through which you can fill up the scholarship application forms online which hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes.

4. Those who don't know, there is a term known as 'Corporate Social Responsibility' Policy under which big companies must have to spend a part of their profit for good causes like education, healthcare, environment etc. It's not that these opportunities are meant only for undergraduate studies. They can vary from nursery to PhD level, hear me out.

Tell m, are you really happy spending 10s of hours in downloading apps from here and there to earn commissions from referral & bonuses? If you answer is No.
Then, please stop wasting time playing colour gambling etc.

For public awarenessfor scholarships,
We have just started regularly uploading videos on youtube to spread information about such opportunities which are new and active and most importantly, known to lesser people. And everyone can apply and get selected. 

The yt channel name is AAGE HAMESHA scholarships. Alternatively, check profile of ours. If you're still unable to find, then dm. 

Give this post utmost priority- don't be negligent towards education.

(Upvote if it is helpful)


Remember that the real and valid scholarships are only those which have absolutely 0 registration fees.

I just wanted to share this because no one talks about it openly.

Share it to your bestie and him /her fly high.

1jmce3r,I feel lost. Did I make a mistake?,"In August 2023, I (27M) moved from NY to DC to pursue my Master‚Äôs in International Affairs at GWU. While there, I fell into a deep depression, dealt with imposter syndrome, struggled to find work related to my studies, took a job that was decent and paid for my Masters, but wasn‚Äôt what I wanted to be doing. In July 2024, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, and have been struggling with it/in treatment for it for months. 

Last April, I was also awarded a Dept of Defense fellowship to study Mandarin in Taiwan for one year. I was so excited because it finally felt like I was going to make progress in what I wanted to do. I studied Chinese to that point, but my Chinese was awful and not really something I could put on a resume. I thought I would finally get really valuable experience. I left my job and moved back home to NY in Jan 2025 to prepare for Taiwan. 

I was supposed to leave in Feb 2025, but due not making enough progress on my mental health struggles/BPD, after long discussions with family, I decided that I was not ready to live in the other side of the planet for a year in a foreign country. While in DC, I struggled with even being alone in my apartment and establishing a routine for myself outside of school, the lack of a social circle really did a number on me. 

I am now living at home in NY, working on finding work (maybe going back to my old job) in DC and potentially going to finish my Masters. But this feels like such a set back for me.

1jmaxph,Right time to ask for a raise?,"I've been wanting to ask for a raise for awhile, but something has always come up. The company didn't hit end of year goals (my team did), then we had a layoff 6 weeks ago, then I was told by mentor to wait until after a deal I was involved in closed. Initially I was fine with that, since it's only another 30ish days, but then two of my coworkers quit. One was offered 30k to stay and the other was offered 15k; both turned it down. We haven't yet backfilled the roles. This brought our team of 7 down to a team of 5, and our boss is actually doing work and covering some of the tasks of the folks that left.

For context, I have 18 years of experience in my field. I'm a director who makes 140k and get an annual bonus of 20% of my salary based on a combo of company performance and a much smaller factor of my own performance. In 2024, my bonus was 42k. This year it was 9k, and it was only that much bc I got 300% of my performance bonus. 

The problem is, I'm not at market for my role. I've had a few interviews for similar level roles and the salary range is averaging 160-175k. When I took this role at 125k five years ago, I wasn't handling anything close to the breadth of work I do today. Aside from annual increases of 2-5%, I haven't had salary increases to go along with the expanded duties. 

I'm worried that if I don't ask now, I'm going to be miss my moment of opportunity. They need me, I don't particularly want a new job, and I'm excellent at what I do. The company has given me RSUs the last 3 years and in every annual review I've received the highest level, which is exceeds expectations.

Good idea? Bad idea? FWIW, if I do ask and they say no, I'm planning on asking my boss to help me offload these extra duties I've taken on. They're all outside my job description, so if they don't want to meet me halfway, I don't see why I should keep doing the work.

1jm8z3j,Changed my mind,"I‚Äôm 21F having some serious doubts about my career plans. Hoping for some advice. This is my first Reddit post so please be kind üôèüèº. 

I‚Äôm currently in a Master‚Äôs program majoring in criminal justice. I‚Äôm just under the halfway mark with 2 semesters nearly done. Since I started this program, I‚Äôve realized that this is not what I want to do with my life. The original plan was to get a PhD and become a professor. I chose criminal justice because it was interesting to me, not thinking of any other career outcomes because I was so dead set on academia. 

Well, academia is not what I thought it would be. I can‚Äôt stand the environment and I am certain that this is not the place for me. Also, the subject does not spark passion like it once did. I find social science exhausting as there is no real solution to any of the things that we talk about. I‚Äôve been exploring different career possibilities within this field but truly nothing is sparking interest. It feels pretty clear to me that I need a change. 

My first plan when I got into college was healthcare, but after failing my first math class, I convinced myself that I wasn‚Äôt smart enough to pursue that field. I don‚Äôt think that is true anymore. I‚Äôm having major regrets about not sticking with it, because I feel like that would be a great environment for me. Plus, there are so many possible career outcomes. I‚Äôve been looking at nursing programs and am very much inspired by this idea. 

Maybe I‚Äôm being stupid, but I feel really shitty about the idea of abandoning everything I‚Äôve put into my path so far. I have my BA in criminal justice and now some graduate experience. But, it feels equally dumb to stick with something that I dislike. It feels so embarrassing to change my mind. What if I don‚Äôt like the next thing I choose? What if I never feel happy with what I pick? What if I never finish anything?

I don‚Äôt know what I should do. Should I finish out my masters, and then see about nursing school? Should I take some pre nursing classes this summer? Should I drop out of the masters and go straight to nursing? Any thoughts are welcome; I‚Äôm feeling really lost right now.

1jm6dvr,Should I take the risky job offer?,"I‚Äôm currently on the job hunt and need some advice since I‚Äôm not particularly experienced in the startup space! Any thoughts/advice here would be well appreciated.¬†

About me: I‚Äôm currently working at a reputable Tech Company working remote in a mid-senior level Strategy & Ops role. This company has a promising future (and its presence in the tech world today is quite prominent) but the core product and what I‚Äôm doing at the company doesn‚Äôt interest me too much. I‚Äôm more focused on Ops Strategy and want to shift over to something more closely related to Product (where I have experience in my previous company). I‚Äôm interested in the AI space but still not sold that its the right space for me to work in.

I‚Äôve reached out to a few companies/replied to a few companies that reached out to me. I have an offer from one of the companies, I‚Äôm deep in interviews with another, and I see a potential 3rd option.¬†

Current TC is \~$310k/year with a $170k base.

**Option 1: AI Startup**¬†\- This is a company that I reached out to a few weeks ago fro whom I‚Äôve recently received a job offer from. Its a YC backed AI startup that has received its Series A funding from YC and two smaller VC‚Äôs. The YC partner that funded the company is Garry Tan himself. The product is pretty promising - I happen to think it's pretty remarkable. There seems to be some good momentum as the company received its Series A funding a few months after its seed funding. Conversations with the two founders (both former founders of other companies) and others at the company have been great. The role I‚Äôd be taking is ‚ÄúDirector of Customer Success‚Äù, an area I don‚Äôt directly have experience in, but in which I‚Äôve had peripheral experience in. Here are some of the elements of the offer (this is the initial offer, so there‚Äôs definitely room to negotiate):

* Base Salary: $150k a year ($20k pay cut)
* Bonus Target: 20% of base salary ($30,000)
* Company Stock Options: 9,000 Shares (pre-IPO, so this is just Monopoly money)
   * How do I tell if this is a fair amount?

Despite the cut in pay and smaller share of stock options, I think there‚Äôs some positives to this offer

* Bump in title to Director
* In the AI space, which is very hot right now and potentially makes me more marketable in the future to other companies
* The company is based in the city that I live in, so I‚Äôd work in a hybrid capacity, which I prefer
* I‚Äôd get a ton of experience that I can use to my advantage in the next company that I work at

Cons

* Certain to have a sizable drop in TC - almost 50% drop
   * Which means a significant change in lifestyle
* Its an early stage startup - no idea if they‚Äôll exist in the next 6 months
* Customer Success isn‚Äôt exactly a field that I‚Äôm super interested in
* I‚Äôd be working a TON since its a startup thats pretty early in its existence¬†
* Unsure if there is health insurance/401k benefits

**Option 2: Retail Startup**¬†\- I‚Äôm in the deep stages of interviewing at a (also YC backed) retail startup who reached out to me a few weeks ago. This is a company that's grown significantly in the last 5 years and has received a Series E round of funding. The role is an S&O Senior Manager role that has hints of what I like about what I do now but also pulls from my experience at my former company. This wouldn‚Äôt be a product facing role, but there would be some aspects of it involved. The company‚Äôs culture seems great and everyone I‚Äôve spoken to so far seems to like working there. Here are some of the pros and cons of this opportunity:

Pros:

* Late enough of a startup that there's¬†*some*¬†structure within the company
* This is a Senior Manager role - still a step up in title
* The pay range is between $160k-$245k, which leaves a ton of room for me to push for a nice bump in salary
* The company is growing in reputation and is working to build out an untapped market (live streaming retail)
* Benefits for employees are great
* Remote work is allowed but there‚Äôs an option to move closer to one of their offices to work hybrid (preferred)
* Better work-life balance

Cons:

* Not in AI - not sure if I‚Äôm super invested in the retail space
* Not a role that's Product focused
* Less overall ownership by not having a director role and being in the later stages of the company‚Äôs age

**Option 3: Stay but eventually leave -**¬†Stick with current company and put in my two weeks in a few months after my next stock vest. Take a month or so off to unwind and mentally reset before beginning to apply again. I‚Äôd love to have some time away from work to travel and work on some personal projects.

1jm5u05,Is this a situation where it‚Äôs actually a good idea to accept the counteroffer?,"Several months ago, I started looking for a new job because I found my supervisor incredibly stressful to work with. I wasn‚Äôt the only one at the company with this problem, but for various reasons I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable trying to switch supervisors or talking to HR or anything. I decided my best choice was to switch jobs. 

Then, in February, my supervisor unexpectedly announced their departure from the company, and I was immediately reassigned to a supervisor that I have a great relationship with. However, by that point I had made it to the final round interview for a position that really appealed to me. I thought it made sense to see it through, and just today they offered me the job. 

Pros: It‚Äôs an 18k pay bump, it‚Äôs remote (as my current job is), and the work itself is more technical and seems a bit more intellectually stimulating than my current work. 

Cons: The supervisor (and the broader culture) is an unknown quantity, and they‚Äôve offered far fewer vacation days (I currently get 20 vacation days and 2 personal days, and they‚Äôre offering just 12 vacation days in the first year and 17 in years 2-5). And perhaps most notably, they‚Äôre funded by the federal government, and they had a round of layoffs as recently as the last Trump administration. I asked them about this point blank and they said they felt were in a strong position (they‚Äôre hiring, after all) but couldn‚Äôt guarantee anything.

If the new company isn‚Äôt willing to bump up PTO and my current company can match the new salary (or come reasonably close), is this one of those situations where accepting the counteroffer is a good idea? After spending so much time with a supervisor I didn‚Äôt get along with, I‚Äôm sensitive to how much that can make or break a workplace.

1jm4tps,Update - On-Call with no pay?,"Here is the original post for those that want to read what happens: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/s/CmBuvMVAlo

Thanks all for comments on this post.
 
Here is a little bit of back story to explain things. I have worked for this employer for 7 years. I originally was hired as a salaried employee. Two years ago, they made me an hourly Non-exempt employee in an attempt to save money on labor. When I signed the new contract, it spelled out the hour rate and overtime rate and stated that no on-call duties were to be performed unless leadership instructed you to. They never stated the rate of pay for on-call duties. My boss always told me that he will do everything to ensure I do not get overtime and just get use to it.
 
My normal work week is 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, Monday thru Thursday 8am to 5pm. As a term of my employment, I have to keep an hourly description of activities I perform for work. So, I have to record everything I do for work to justify what I do.
 
My boss has a habit of not thinking things through, along with leadership telling him he could not have a three-day weekend unless he had someone cover the on-call duties for the weekend. Here is where I might be the A--. My boss comes into my office on Thursday afternoon, tells me I‚Äôm working the on call duties for the next three days, and I have to keep track of everything I do during the next three days. I asked him, ‚ÄúDid leadership approve this? As you know, they do not want to pay me overtime.‚Äù His response was: You do what I tell you to do and don‚Äôt question what your boss tells you to do.
 
Me being me, I knew he was going to take advantage of me just because he likes his power trip. I contacted upper leadership and asked if this was something they authorized? Along with the question of how much is the on-call rate of pay? Their response was only, we will talk about this on Monday when you submit your timecard.
 
So update on Tuesday morning: I clock in, go to my office, and in about 20 minutes, my boss comes in yelling and screaming about the computer and cell phone. I look at him and state: If you keep yelling at me, I will not respond until you talk to me in a normal tone. Soon, everyone in the building starts to walk over to my office to see what is going on. So here I am, sitting at my desk with a look of confusion on my face, watching this guy scream and yell, along with threats of taking out my lights. I‚Äôm trying to take notes to enter into my daily activity report as I know what is required of me. The senior leadership manager along with the head of HR runs into my office, pulling out my boss, along with telling me they wish to see me.
 
I pack up my computer, company cell phone and start that long walk to the HR offices at the end of the building. Without even asking me what that was all about, they state they are not going to pay me for the three days, and are thinking of suspending me for the rest of the week. Well I quote what the state law is about being on-call and hand them a copy of the WA State labor and industries regulations on the payment of on-call. The look on their faces was priceless. The head of HR tells me to go back to my office and go back to work, I tell them I don‚Äôt feel safe returning as my boss made some threats. HR says, they will send someone with me to ensure I‚Äôm safe. I‚Äôll fast forward to today, Friday, Payday. I look at my check and see they paid me for all hours worked along with the overtime pay. It was a nice amount of change until I looked to see what they took out in taxes. I guess my job is somewhat secured, but I know they will never have me work on-call duties again. I‚Äôm so happy I did a daily activity report for the three days I was on-call as it proved that I did what I was hired to do. I‚Äôll update if something else happens. Wishing you all the best for the advice.

1jm42og,I don‚Äôt think I can afford to do this underpaid internship but I‚Äôm worried backing out now will negatively affect my professional reputation,"I applied and interviewed for a paid gig this summer. A previous classmate who has since graduated put in a really good word for me; I‚Äôm positive it‚Äôs why I got the job. But as we get closer to the end of the semester the expectations are becoming clearer and I can‚Äôt afford to meet them. I was expecting to be able to work part time on the side as this position doesn‚Äôt pay an hourly wage, but the hours will be full time. So I will be earning less than mini wage. On top of that the location is outside of town so I would need access to a vehicle (the contract pay wouldn‚Äôt cover the cheapest second hand vehicles on the market). 

Lately I‚Äôve been getting a lot of positive feedback at school about how everyone wants to work with me. I think part of that is because I set more boundary than the other students do, so I don‚Äôt stretch myself too thin or burn myself out. I‚Äôm starting to value the work that I do, they aren‚Äôt doing me a favour by letting me work for them, and the school credit doesn‚Äôt makeup for the fact that if I do this job I won‚Äôt be able to afford classes next year. 

I feel like I‚Äôm too overwhelmed to really think through the decision, but I‚Äôve been edging closer to this for a while now. I‚Äôm also just having a terrible week and don‚Äôt want to do anything rash, but I can‚Äôt afford to wait until exams are done to decide, if I‚Äôm going to quit the sooner the better. 

Honestly I think I‚Äôm doing a lot better than some of the other students, I keep beating myself up because they have more practical experience, but what‚Äôs the point of those practical experiences if you are too burnt out to do a good job. 

It‚Äôs also not my fault that everything is so unpredictable right now, my financial support from my family fell through, there were a few family crises, my housing situation is still up in the air. These are all things beyond my control, believe I‚Äôve been driving myself nuts trying to fix these things. 

I‚Äôm also not even sure if I want to pursue my current career path as it is very unpredictable and often underpaid. I want to be reliable and predictable, I want a predictable income, not because I‚Äôm materialistic but because I‚Äôm tired of how chaotic things are when you don‚Äôt know where your next pay-check is coming from. 

I don‚Äôt know, there is no right answer. I know either way there will be consequences. I don‚Äôt want to let these people down but I think I‚Äôm finally at a point in my life where I‚Äôm ready to take my own wants and needs into consideration. Sure if I wasn‚Äôt going to follow through I should not have accepted the job in the first place, that‚Äôs on me, but they should have been a lot clearer in communicating the demanding hours and inconvenient location. 

I think I just want someone who has things put together to tell me I‚Äôm allowed to do, even if I‚Äôm making a mistake. I should be allowed to make mistakes.",So_Many_Questions17,5,1.0,4,1743191881,2025-03-28 19:58:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm42og/i_dont_think_i_can_afford_to_do_this_underpaid/,3,2025
1jm3oue,Data Science OR Computer Science Engineering,"Hi

  
I am a second-year student at UC Irvine, currently pursuing Computer Engineering, but I am deciding on switching to Data Science or Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).

  
CpE is super heavy, due to which I don't get time for any extra-curricular work. CSE suits me more since it's a combo of both software and hardware. I love Data Science because I have been coding for a long time now, and mostly into the AI and ML space.

  
I want to go into Venture Capital long-term, but start my career off by creating products and developing businesses.

In case you are wondering why I don't pursue something like Business or Finance, it's because I am simply not passionate about it. I am also international, so the stakes are pretty high!

  
With the advent of AI, I am extremely unsure which major to pick (Data Sci or CSE). Both are great, but the way AI is changing anything can happen, and I just want to be safe in case anything happens in the future, I can fall back on something I studied in college.

1jm3eoi,The Price of a Promotion: Growth or a Golden Cage?,"For the past nine months, I have worked at a small company with a workforce made up mostly of young professionals, a few in their mid-30s, and some beyond. In that time, I have watched people come and go at a dizzying pace. It‚Äôs like fashion‚Äîone day someone is in, the next they‚Äôre out.

I have seen firsthand why they leave. The leadership is uninspiring, management is suffocating, micro-management is rampant, and the work itself can feel mind-numbing. I would be lying if I said I haven‚Äôt struggled with the same frustrations. But unlike those who had the freedom to walk away, I have been tethered by circumstances‚Äîvisa restrictions, career aspirations, and the need to secure a better opportunity before making a move.

The weight of it all has been heavy. I‚Äôve cried, I‚Äôve been frustrated, and I‚Äôve felt my potential being stifled by policies and systems beyond my control. But through it all, I‚Äôve shown up. I‚Äôve adapted, maintained my professionalism, and given my best effort despite knowing that this job offers me little in return.

Lately, the struggle to retain employees has become more visible. More people are leaving, and faster than ever. Some of them started this journey with me, and now I watch them go, wondering when it will be my turn.

The ""Promotion"" Dilemma
Then today, I was called into my manager‚Äôs office. To no surprise, I was ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù with a promotion‚Äîfrom my current role to a slightly senior version of it. A small salary bump came with it, and I was assured that my commitment and hard work had not gone unnoticed.

I accepted, humbly. Because if nothing else, I know I have earned it. I have worked tirelessly, remained open to change, and carried myself with respect and professionalism. On paper, I am overqualified for this job. But here I am, being given a title upgrade that, in reality, does little to change my circumstances.

And then came the real sting: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt offer you this other role because it requires a different level of authority and confidence‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not to say we don‚Äôt believe in your abilities.‚Äù

A contradiction wrapped in corporate diplomacy.

It made me wonder: Am I being recognized, or am I being retained? Is this a genuine step forward, or just a strategic move to keep me in place while others leave? I don‚Äôt want to be a placeholder. I don‚Äôt want to be someone they promote just to stabilize their workforce.

Yet here I stand at a crossroads, uncertain of what this moment truly means.

A Half-Filled Cup or a Half-Empty One?
Do I see this as a stepping stone, an opportunity to prepare for a future role they claim will open soon? Or do I fight harder to find a company that aligns with my skills, aspirations, and values?

A part of me whispers that this is a game of control, a tactic to keep me anchored while the storm of resignations rages on. Another part of me acknowledges that I have, indeed, progressed‚Äîeven if not in the way I imagined.

Perhaps the real lesson here is this: growth is not just about promotions, raises, or titles. Growth is about clarity. It‚Äôs about recognizing when a situation is serving you and when it is simply using you. It‚Äôs about knowing when to stay and when to leave.

So, where do I go from here?

For now, I will buy myself a nice coffee‚Äîextra caramel‚Äîas a toast to this milestone, however bittersweet it may be. But I will also remind myself that promotions are not the same as progress. A title is just a title if it doesn‚Äôt move me closer to where I want to be.

And when the right moment comes, I will take my next step‚Äînot out of fear or frustration, but with confidence and authority. The very qualities they claim I lack.

1jm2vnr,"Been in talks with this company for about nine months, need some honest opinions please","Not sure this is the best sub to share my issues but I‚Äôll try regardless since I don‚Äôt know how/if to proceed with these people. Thanks in advance for reading, this will be a longer one. 

I worked for company A, very toxic place, planned to quit anyway. Now, I signed a contract with a non-compete clause of six months, enforceable, according to lawyers I spoke with. 

At one point, company B comes to me trying to poach me. This is a direct competitor of A. About five people from B start adding me on LinkedIn, asking if I would join them. 

I end up interviewing with person S, who got in charge of my application. I openly state my clause but I still pass all the tests and interviews successfully. Note, S has always been kinda ghosting, saying their internet died, and similar, so they have that going on regardless of my clause. 

They eventually tell me there‚Äôs nothing they can do after three months of going back and forth. During those three months the ghosting started getting worse. 

Then, right around the time I quit, another person from B comes to me and asks me to work in her team. This person E is not HR though but wants me on their team. 

So after months of silence from B and person S I decide to openly tell E about my experience. 

Allegedly E speaks to HR, they agree the process was awful and offer no tests when I apply in the future. 

I quit, my six months pass, and I reapply to two openings with company B. One rejected immediately, the other application goes to the same person S who doesn‚Äôt even process it. 

Many people from my previous company went to work for B, they talk about me and want me to join. But it seems like HR got cold on me. 

So my former colleague asks person R from HR about me and what‚Äôs going on. R tells them they vouched for me last year they did so again this year but ‚Äòthere‚Äôs nothing for me at the moment and if I applied to something I should reach out on LinkedIn.‚Äô 

I literally applied to the same role they had opened last year. Fine. I reach out on Li and it‚Äôs total silence again. 

This was my dream company as they seem to be doing great and we all know I would fit right in. 

My last option is to reach out to E again, ask if they will have the opening in their team or quit playing games and move on. 

I just don‚Äôt understand this:

We all know I fit, why not get me for the same role we spoke about nine months ago?

Why have the job opened if there are no actual roles?

Why not just reject me for that role as well so I know where I stand. 

It‚Äôs been nine months, I‚Äôm on my last nerve with these people and just need insights on whether this is normal HR behavior or I‚Äôm just insane for chasing them still. 

Note that I spent almost all my savings and need a job soon. My feelings are a mess and I hope I explained things well. ",magic-creator,1,1.0,5,1743188826,2025-03-28 19:07:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm2vnr/been_in_talks_with_this_company_for_about_nine/,3,2025

Email signatures are quite normal in academia, and I included one in my school email address. However, I am not sure if it‚Äôs necessary now that I‚Äôve graduated college. 

I am currently applying to graduate school, though, and I reach out to different community organizations for volunteer opportunities and partnerships. Will including a signature provide more networking opportunities if included or does it make you look pretentious ? 

Thank you for replying! ",wafflehousesupremacy,1,1.0,0,1743188016,2025-03-28 18:53:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm2jwa/do_you_have_an_email_signature/,3,2025

1jm2bzv,Chronic Career Switcher AMA (70K+ to 440K+),"Hey everyone, wanted to create this post to specifically answer any questions for the career switchers out there! I've transitioned a couple of different industries/roles over my career so hoping I can provide some value on how to switch roles and/or companies (e.g. positioning your previously un-related experience, how to look for the next best roles etc.)  
  
A couple of high level points on my career journey: 

* Started out with an Engineering (non-CS) degree from a Midwest State School
* Internships in Manufacturing ($15/hour lol) 
*  First job was in IT consulting ($70K) 
* Second Job was at a High Tech Start Up as a business/sales function ($120K)
* Third Job was at a bigger Tech Co. for an Operations role ($250K)
* Fourth Job was at the same company but moved more into the Product Strategy Space ($440K)

Spent a couple years in each of the roles listed above. My general high level advice is: 

* Always go for optionality early career: Choose something that is harder to do earlier on so (e.g. Engineers can do business functions but not vice versa) 
* If you see a good opportunity you have to grab it, like literally drop everything and spend 2-3 weeks prepping yourself for the interview. Opportunities don't come by that often. 
* Industry trends are real - I had no idea what tech or consulting was when I was 18. Following where the market is going helps with compensation even if you're not a core contributor to the industry. (E.g. I work at a tech company and benefit from stock appreciation but I don't know how to code) ",Krooai,0,0.30000001192092896,2,1743187461,2025-03-28 18:44:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm2bzv/chronic_career_switcher_ama_70k_to_440k/,3,2025

1jm1ily,Looking for some advice with regard to next steps in real estate career...,"**General background:**¬†28 years old, 4-year BA undergrad in Legal Studies, full-time independent real estate broker in Ontario for 6 years (got licensed and starting working full-time immediately after I graduated university). Currently making about $250k/year and aiming to gradually continuing growing year-over-year if possible.

**Pros of my career:**  
\- Real estate is a great career. I have a free flowing schedule with a ton of flexibility day-to-day and week-to-week.  
\- I like the fluidity of the career and that the work is ever-changing. Every client, house and transaction is different. I am always learning and improving every day.  
\- It allows me to work independently. I enjoy the balance of work-from-home components with a mix of in-person interaction.  
\- Genuinely helping people. I build such close and genuine connections in my day-to-day and truly feel I make a difference in people's lives. I feel as though I assist in being a problem solver and make significant change in the trajectory of my client's lives not only financially but also on a human-to-human level. A lot of my real estate transactions stem from significant life changes like death, breakups, job changes, financial hardships, growing families, etc. which all come with a very emotional component and in many cases we end up connecting very deeply on other personal issues they are dealing with.

**Cons of my career:**  
\- I am very anchored to where I am growing my business. It limits my ability to ever consider a significant move (either within my province or out of province) as I would be essentially ""starting fresh"" with regard to connections and business in a new area. I do not like this as I could potentially see myself wanting to move outside of my area and/or live in a warmer climate for 2-3 months per year over the winter. This freedom is not an option with my current career.  
\- I feel a lack of control with regard to my income due to the volatile nature of the real estate market in general. I am actively working towards setting myself up for success to weather those storms (e.g. Building/growing investments, aiming to never over-extend myself through overspending, continuing to build equity in my primary residence, I also own a short-term rental cottage investment, always working on long-term leads and future business, etc) however at the end of the day I can only do so much. I am still very reliant on people selling their homes and the nature of the market which feeds into a feeling of ""lack of control""  
\- I would love a job that allows for more opportunity for passive income. Real estate is a very nuanced job that is location-specific. Every market/area has different types of homes, communities, by-laws etc. I don't see there being a ""one size fits all"" approach that I could genuinely leverage as I am only an expert in my area.  
\- My job can be very emotionally draining when dealing directly with clients. I feel fulfilled when I am helping people but I also naturally take on a lot of their problems/hardships and many of which are out of my control. Those issues weigh heavy on me. I am working towards building those boundaries but it is a challenge as it is who I am at my core and ultimately the cornerstone of how I have built a successful business so far. With that said, I still can only do so much. If a Seller needs X amount of money on the sale of their home but it is an impossibility due to market conditions, I struggle to create a boundary and not internalize this pressure/heaviness that I can ""only do what I can do"" because I truly do care for the well-being of my clients.

**My conundrum: Where to go from here?**  
As I progress in my career, I have realized that I feel fulfilled when I can help/assist others with their problems but I feel drained when I cannot provide assistance due to factors out of my control. I have put thought into 2 potential career transitions:

1. I could see myself transition away from dealing with clients 1-on-1 and transitioning into leading/managing a team or group of agents instead. This appeals to me as I love to help others and absolutely love seeing others be successful, and it separates me from primarily dealing 1-on-1 with clients and the emotional heaviness that can come with selling/buying their homes. It also would allow me more freedom/flexibility in terms of traveling as a lot of this support can be done remotely whereas I am¬†*very*¬†limited to going away (even for the weekend) as a lot of the work is in-person and client facing typically on weekends/holidays. I am not scared of taking on the overhead that this would entail as I see purchasing a bricks & mortar office as an investment. The cons of a scenario like this is that I am still at the mercy of a very volatile market and a portion of my success is still reliant on factors I cannot control.
2. I have considered going back to school part time to get my Masters in Psychotherapy which would help garner my skillset of helping others and earn the credentials to offer virtual coaching/therapy for other realtors, entrepreneurs and/or other high-achieving people. This opens up a world of options that would allow me to work fully remote if I wanted to, gives me more control of my income, could be a huge asset if I opt to continue staying in real estate full time via real estate coaching or potentially owning a brokerage, or gives options for additional passive income if I were interested (i.e. Selling programs or content for successful realtor and/or business building while taking care of our mental health and physical well-being). The balance between mental health, physical health and high achieving success is always something I have been passionate about. The cons of this approach is having to dedicate time and money to go back to school which will take me away from my real estate career. As an entrepreneur, I also struggle with the idea of paying to go back to school for the ""credentials"" but I understand in some scenarios that is just what you have to do. In theory ""life coaching"" can be done without a specific credential or degree but I am a science-based person and would¬†*never*¬†feel right about selling a program to someone or having conversations about mental health without being qualified.

All of this to say, any advice and/or thoughts? I am open to anything. Has anyone gone through their Masters of Psychotherapy a few years post undergrad? Has anyone made a career change from X to Psychotherapy, or gone the opposite direction? Do you have any other recommendations based on my pros vs cons?

Thank you so much!",alanalanaa,1,1.0,0,1743185386,2025-03-28 18:09:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jm1ily/looking_for_some_advice_with_regard_to_next_steps/,3,2025
1jm0t6a,Roller coaster ride internship into interviewing to full time?,"Sorry if this post is kind of all over the place hard to put my thoughts down in order when it‚Äôs been such a roller coaster ride. 

I started a compliance/information security co op at a top 500 technology company (very big) in June of last year. It went really well I learned a lot as it was my first time getting a compliance position and I got it through a referral from my sister who works at the company as a senior product manager. My original co-op was supposed to end in December, but last second they extended me! They asked me to stay until April 25th of this year,there was some talks about going full time but basically it didn‚Äôt happen and there was no budget (also my lack of experience and certifications for compliance.) 

I accepted the extension and have been working extremely hard and I think it‚Äôs gone noticed? Every single meeting with my director he‚Äôs updating me on potential full time opportunities and what needs to happen. He just kept saying basically there is no budget but he would love to try and keep me full time (was his last words he said to me). I basically told him I got another job offer which I did and I need to know relatively soon if they are keeping me or not he said he will keep me updated if they can make the budget work. He‚Äôs now on vacation the next two weeks and randomly a compliance specialist job opened up? (Confirmed with one of the managers they got the budget approval for ONE job found it kind of weird no one told me). I basically kind of panicked and applied internally to the job and now an interview is set up with the head recruiter mean while my director is on vacation still. 

I‚Äôm just curious your guys thoughts on me potentially getting this job and whether I have a real chance? I only have 9 months of experience but it‚Äôs with this job! I know all the softwares made connections and so on. The salary is very high for this position and the job description wanted 5+ years of experience. Also, since I‚Äôm working there I like looked up all the other people interviewing the position on LinkedIn (I know I shouldn‚Äôt) and they all like blow me out of the water experience wise. Do I have a real chance at this job? Is this just a formality and I‚Äôm still most likely getting hired still since my director is the hiring manager and last thing he said to me is he will try and keep me if they get the budget? He legit made me wait to accept another offer to see if he got budget approval. I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm really lost and not sure how to feel. Should I message him as soon as he gets back into office? 

(Would like to mention every person on the team loves me and my last 3 performance score cards I have gotten 100/100)

Back in December, I accepted a project management internship at Cisco for this upcoming summer.

I would hope that the name would help me get FTE at a company more locally to me after I graduate.

1jlxlrf,Navigating a Major Career Opportunity ‚Äì Seeking Advice,"I've been with my company for nearly six years and was recently promoted to a Quality Technician position last month, earning $30/hour. For the past three years, I‚Äôve been working nonstop overtime (by choice) making roughly $80K‚Äì$90K annually, but the burnout has been overwhelming.

I recently came across an internal position for a Quality Engineer and jokingly mentioned my interest to the hiring manager. To my surprise, I was offered the role‚Äîcontingent on relocating from SoCal to NorCal. I have a strong relationship with management in that department and expect to receive the official offer letter within the next two weeks.

The posted salary range is $90K‚Äì$130K with a hybrid schedule, which I find appealing since it would allow me to earn a solid salary without excessive overtime. However, I‚Äôve already been informed that relocation assistance will not be provided, meaning I‚Äôll have to cover the moving costs myself, which will be a financial hit but something I'll have to manage.

I have 13 years of experience in the healthcare industry, but I only hold a high school diploma. I recognize this as a rare opportunity to fast-track into an engineering role with a strong title and salary. Given my background, I don‚Äôt expect an opportunity like this to come up for at least another 2-3 years staying in SoCal while I work my way up to it

That said, I anticipate the offer will be on the lower end of the posted range, and I‚Äôm unsure if I can negotiate for more‚Äîespecially considering the high cost of living in the Bay Area. I‚Äôve also thought about asking for a sign-on bonus since relocation assistance isn‚Äôt provided, but I want to approach this carefully to avoid jeopardizing my chances.

**Any advice on salary negotiation, sign-on bonuses, or how to navigate this transition smoothly would be greatly appreciated.**

1jlxlqu,Boss avoiding me and fear losing my job,"Hello everyone!

(This may be long so I apologize)

Just looking to get some feedback on what you all think. My boss isn't really the most approachable person out there. I've been at my job for over a year now and have yet to have gotten my benefits/ pension I was promised over 8 months ago. (I've brought it up 2 times now)

I made a screw up earlier on this week and my boss brought me into his office to spend over 20 min tearing up my report and how bad it was. (I will admit, it wasnt my proudest work and I apologized and told him that I'd rework it. I spent the better half of that day modifying the report and advised him that I would provide him the report once he gives me the information he told me he'd provide me after the meeting (take note, I should have had that information beforehand but failed to ask for it)

By 3PM I gave him the heads up that I completed to revised report and feel much more confident in it. I'm just waiting on the information he needs to provide me. He never acknowledged my message as he was apparently busy all day.

Fast forward to 11:30PM when I get an email from him to our external team with my report, just for him to have changed everything once again. None of my work was in there but all his.  I compared his report against mine and his wording is basically the same, just worded in his own words. I had gotten someone from the external team to review my report and he agreed that it was also a very good report, just written differently.

Since Wednesday, he's locked himself in his office and hasn't spoken to me and simply texted. He's gone to ""lunch meetings"" the last several days but won't tell me with who when I ask. (We're a client facing company)

My issue is I'm done with being treated like this. Should I just pretend this never happened and look for work elsewhere? Or do you think he'll beat me to the punch and fire me? I've never had issues with prior employers until this one. All of which have agreed to be referrals for future employment until I met my current  boss.

He's said things to me such as:

- You're lucky I didn't write the things I wanted to write on this report because there would be things I'd say that I regret

- If I'm mad at a situation, I need 24hrs to cool down so I can evaluate things better and avoid saying things I will regret (take note, that means he locks himself in his office the entire day and never comes out or speaks to anyone and can't proceed with certain tasks till he's cooled down)

I've dealt with this consistently throughout the year (I had one other error that was fixed early on last year) and it makes me sick to my stomach. I'm his only employee and apparently he's been looking for someone for over 2 years to fill this role. He spends most of his time with his door closed in his office or working from home (which he's against btw) and I speak more with my office coworkers (from other companies) more than I do with him...",Notatbayifthrowaway,1,1.0,0,1743175400,2025-03-28 15:23:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlxlqu/boss_avoiding_me_and_fear_losing_my_job/,3,2025

1jlwo3m,Should I quit? Wait? What to do?,"I'm so confused.

I'm realizing my job is mentally affecting me. Like the only reason I'm staying here is because I have a salary. Otherwise I would quit. But I'm getting to a point where I don't know if it's worth it anymore. The good thing is I've been saving these past few months so I'm okay for a couple of months. But at the same time I'm worried about what happens if I quit and don't get another job, esp with this job market. 

At the same time, this company put me in the work visa lottery and the results are coming out next week Tuesday. If I get selected, I'd have to stay here till October or November to receive my work visa (it takes months). If I don't get selected, then I can comfortably quit.

So I'm like in limbo. Should I quit now. Or wait till after the results are out. But then, even if I'm selected, can I mentally survive till November? 

Ideally, I would stay here till I get the results and till I get a new job. That was my plan. But my employer is so trigger happy when it comes to firing people and he has mentioned termination in passing, like we expect the best or termination follows. Everyone is supposed to a biweekly review to determine if they're performing well. At least 4 people have been fired in the last few months (that I know of), which is a lot to me for a small company.

I joined my company as an intern on november, with the assurance that after three months, I‚Äôd be promoted to a permanent role. By mid-January, I was told that they were happy with my performance and were already considering my promotion. In February‚Äôs first week, they sent me all the forms, and I completed them. However, just a day later, they suddenly decided not to proceed with my appraisal.

I accepted this and continued working through February and March, even though I was handling the same workload as permanent employees, frequently working overtime and without proper weekends off. However, when it came to fair treatment, I was still classified as an intern.

By mid-March, I asked about my internship completion certificate and my future position. They resent the same promotion form but changed the date to April 1st and said I‚Äôd receive my certificates once my tenure ended. Meanwhile, I discovered that interns who joined after me had already been promoted, while my situation was ignored.

When I reached out to my managers, no one responded. Frustrated, I finally decided to resign. Within a minute of texting my manager, I got a call asking me to stay. I explained that the role no longer aligned with my career goals. Then, I spoke to HR, who blamed me for being ‚Äúunprofessional‚Äù, despite the repeated delays and inconsistencies.

I officially submitted my resignation, and they accepted it but threatened to mention my ‚Äúunprofessionalism‚Äù in my employment certificate and recommendation letter. They also stated that I must serve a 30-day notice period until April 29th.

1jlv9iy,Should you tell your current managers that you are looking for a new job?,"I advised my adult son on this question and I just wanted to get some additional perspectives on this from more people. 

My adult son (30 years old) is in a role which he has outgrown and wants to start looking internally at his organization for a new opportunity.  He asked me whether he should tell his manager that he is doing this. My advice to him was that he doesn't need to based on the following rationale: 

1. ""Looking"" and exploring opportunities or even applying may not result in actually getting a role or even accepting it. So this would be premature and creating uncertainty when it might not result in a move at this time. 

2.  He could be applying and getting no bites for months; he may even interview and not be successful for months. And in the meantime, his manager may be looking at him as being a potential target for reduction or whatever. I should note this department where he works has had layoffs recently. 

3. He doens't have a close relationship with his manager. There are no conflicts or anything between them but this is a ""hands-off"" manager who has a very large team and it's a unionized role so there aren't really a lot of discussions with their staff on direction or career path. 

4. This is a large organization and people moving/transferring between departments is common. 

This is a new thing for my son because in all his roles in the past he has had frank and honest discussions with his managers on his role so he would be telling them he was looking. But he was hesitant this time because he currently doesn't have that type of manager. 

He knows that at some point he would have to tell his manager i.e. if there was referencing. I was just curious on what people thing on this issue? I've been a people manager for decades and I've never expected my staff to tell me that they were applying elsewhere. Some of my staff did because they felt comfortable doing so or because they were at a point where they were very close to accepting something and wanted to use me as a reference. I've always provided positive references and encouraged people to do what they needed. But I know not all managers are the same.

So, I'm currently unemployed. 2.5 years ago, I left my first job because I was having a really bad time mentally. I loved the industry, but the environment (mostly my private life) was toxic, and I wanted a break. After I left my job, I took a short break and found another job, but not within my industry. It was a entry-level position. Unfortunately, I did very small tasks and didn't get any real-world experience. So, I was job hunting, trying to find a proper job, but unfortunately, I couldn't. The company had to lay off people, and I was let go. Then, I found another job. I saw a few red flags, but went in anyway. Later, I realized the coworkers were really toxic, and one of them was a bully. Initially, I didn't say anything, but once I started to stand up for myself, they gave me impossible work and fired me, telling me I was not capable. I never lied about my experiences and skills, so I don't know how it suddenly became an issue. They never gave me room for improvement. They said my work was dissatisfying and fired me the day after. For nearly two years, I have been applying for new jobs, but I was not able to secure a good one. I don't know what I do wrong. I always try my best and learn everything I possibly can. It was not too hard to secure my first job. But I think, due to my mental health deterioration, I don't give off a good vibe during interviews. I used to do technical interviews somewhat okay at the beginning, but after a while, my interview performance has gone so much downhill. I have been rejected so much that my self-esteem is really low. 

I do know, due to being a junior, I don't really know a lot. Also, with my previous two jobs, I have gotten good, positive reviews, so it's not like I can't do my job. But now, I'm scared maybe I really am not capable. 

My love life has also been going downhill. I have had one short, toxic relationship and a situationship, which were really horrible. I met an amazing person, but later realized we were not compatible, which was again very painful to let go of. 

Now, here I am with a failing career, no love life, no friends and very burnt out mentally. I am so lost. I don't want to go back to college because I don't like studying.

Recruiters and hiring managers: Would you hesitate to interview or extend an offer to someone in my position?

A few things to consider:

* If I omit this role from my resume, I'll have a 4+ month gap.
* I understand that leaving so soon will likely burn a bridge with my current employer.
* I've realized there's limited room for advancement with my current employer, as promotions are based on seniority and position availability, rather than performance.

1jlt6a1,Lost & Running Out of Time - Am I Missing a Better Path? (Advice Needed),"**TL;DR:** This is a detailed post covering my experience, goals, and the options I‚Äôm currently aware of. This is extremely personal and valuable to me, so I want to attract people who are willing to take the time to give me comprehensive advice.

If you‚Äôre looking for a summarized version, please check my profile.

Any resources, ideas, questions, or other forms of help are welcome as long as they relate to my situation.

¬†

I‚Äôm a 24-year-old male who left college about four years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve been improving myself and working as a freelancer specializing in video production and digital marketing.

My ultimate goal is to become a filmmaker in an English-speaking country. I was born and currently live in a developing country. This post isn‚Äôt about that goal specifically, but I need to mention it because every decision I make has to bring me one step closer to achieving it.

Right now, my primary focus is immigrating to the UK (more on why the UK specifically below). However, I don‚Äôt seem to have the type of work experience that would make companies abroad willing to sponsor me for a visa, even though I have collaborated with some major companies in the past.

After spending the last year continuously applying for jobs and improving my CV without securing a **single** interview, I‚Äôve concluded that sponsorship is highly unlikely (at least for now). If I had at least gotten some attention, I would have doubled down on my efforts.

I know I can provide value to companies looking for video makers and social media marketers. I‚Äôm confident in my ability to market myself during interviews, but the hardest part is getting noticed. I feel invisible right now.

A few days ago, I found a recruitment agency that claims they can elevate my profile, apply for jobs on my behalf, and land me interviews. It sounded too good to be true, but I‚Äôve decided to give them a chance.

At the same time, I‚Äôve started looking for agencies or individuals who can help me secure high-demand, unskilled labor jobs, such as construction or caregiving. It may not be ideal, but given my situation, I‚Äôd gladly take it.

Time is extremely important to me, and as it passes, I feel increasingly anxious about my age. My short-term goal is simply to be in the UK legally. Once there, I can start networking with other filmmakers, attending industry events, and sharpening my skills. I‚Äôd prefer to be in the UK before turning 30, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a realistic expectation.

¬†

**Other Options I‚Äôm Considering**

Aside from the paths mentioned above, I‚Äôm aware of these possibilities:

1. **Studying in the UK**

* Studying in the UK is significantly more expensive than in other European countries, and I‚Äôd need to save for another **2‚Äì3 years** to afford it.
* I‚Äôm not really interested in studying, but if I do, it would be solely for the purpose of staying in the UK.
* Even after graduation, a visa sponsorship isn‚Äôt guaranteed. I‚Äôve seen many international graduates struggle to secure sponsorship.

2. **Becoming a Successful Financial Trader**

* I have an agreement with a company that will sponsor me if I become a consistently profitable trader.
* They are legitimate and have sponsored people before, but their probation challenge is extremely difficult.
* Financial trading is unlike any business I‚Äôve tried before, and it could take me **years** to master.

3. **Launching My Own Digital Marketing & Video Production Agency**

* In theory, this seems like the best option, and I have contacts who could guide me.
* However, **logistical challenges** make it incredibly difficult:
   * Forming a UK-based company is possible, but I struggle to open a UK bank account due to my country of residence.
   * Major platforms impose restrictions on my region. Facebook, for instance, instantly restricts any new agency ad accounts created from my country‚Äôs IP address.
* Even if I overcome these barriers (which is possible), progress would be **very slow**, and reaching the self-sponsorship qualification level would take at least **five years**.

¬†

Right now, I feel torn between these options. I don‚Äôt know whether to go all in on one path or to keep assessing my options and alternating between them until something works.

I‚Äôm **certain** there are pathways I haven‚Äôt considered yet. I keep learning about new possibilities almost every day, which is why I‚Äôm hoping to reach people who might know something I don‚Äôt.

What career paths should I explore when I‚Äôve got no interests, no passions, and haven‚Äôt worked in 7 months?  
Are Full Stack or other IT roles like QA, Data Analytics, or Cloud worth trying, or will AI make them pointless?  
How can I figure out if IT or any of these fields is for me with no real experience?  
What should I put on my resume for job experience when I was on bench for 2 years?  
Should I go for the MBA if I get in, or is it a bad idea since I‚Äôm so unsure about everything?  
How do I stop feeling so behind, clueless, and stuck after 7 months jobless?  
I‚Äôd love honest advice, especially from folks who‚Äôve been out of work or felt this lost. Thanks!",museumsoul,2,1.0,2,1743162306,2025-03-28 11:45:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlt4qn/jobless_for_7_months_and_totally_confused_no/,3,2025
1jlsgxg,What certificate program should I take? Machining or Medical assisting,"Hey y‚Äôall so I‚Äôm 27, female. Married 7 years no kids but would like a baby in like 1-2 years. 

Since high school i‚Äôve primarily only done warehouse work. Ive tried other things (bank telling, personal aid, restaurant) and always go back to warehouse work. Mainly cause I like having an active job and I like being able to put in my ear plugs in and not have to talk to anyone and just mind my business and work.

Anyways recently tho ive been feeling really stuck and I really want to move on from warehouse work and do something different. 

My husband‚Äôs been a welder for 11 years so he started teaching me at home. I like it a lot, but I don‚Äôt know about being a welder just because of the health risks. Especially because I already have issues with my lungs. Those fumes really get to me man.

Now CNC machining, is something ive ALWAYS wanted to do. Ive done alot of research on it, read some books, CNC machining is a genuine interest for me. Im enrolled to start a program for it next week

BUT BUT BUT BUT, BIGGGG BUT

I‚Äôm starting to think despite my interest in it, maybe Machining wont be able to suit my lifestyle. Because:

1. I only want to be parttime, and I dont see a single parttime machining job out there when I search. I need to be part-time because I do all the cooking, cleaning, errands, etc. at home and I get extremely overwhelmed with all my domestic tasks + a fulltime job. Let alone also required overtime
2. I also want to have a baby in 1-2 years. Can I work in a shop while pregnant? Would shops be flexible with a working mom then after? I feel like probably not.

So then I saw the same school I start in a week for machining has a medical assisting program for the same cost and I‚Äôm considering calling to switch over. Near me I‚Äôm seeing medical assistant jobs EVERYWHERE, parttime too. Paying what I make now at a warehouse. Is it my passion? No absolutely not, I hate everything about the idea of working in healthcare, but should I be more realistic and go for something that would probably be more convenient for my future? 

Please help me decide and thank you! ",Russiandoll97,1,1.0,0,1743159757,2025-03-28 11:02:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlsgxg/what_certificate_program_should_i_take_machining/,3,2025

1jlrk24,Returning to a toxic workplace after being signed off with stress,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to manage returning to work after being signed off due to stress.

Since joining my workplace late last year, I‚Äôve experienced ongoing bullying, exclusion, and deliberate sabotage from certain colleagues. (And after disclosing that I'm currently being assessed for autism.)

On my first day, I was told outright that I‚Äôd likely have a breakdown and get sick from stress. Since then, I‚Äôve been ignored in conversations, excluded from meetings, and even had my work sabotaged or taken credit for.

The culture in my team is cliquey, and those who aren‚Äôt part of the inner circle, including others who have since left, are treated unfairly. I‚Äôve witnessed inappropriate behaviour from managers, including favouritism, unprofessional gossip, and even harassment towards male colleagues.

I raised these concerns with HR, and they informed me weeks ago that they‚Äôre in the process of putting together an independent investigation into my team. However, I haven‚Äôt heard anything since, and in the meantime, my treatment at work has gotten worse. My colleagues have been cold and distant, stopping direct communication with me and switching to impersonal email correspondence. My manager even told me that my colleagues are ‚Äústruggling to sleep‚Äù because I went to HR, making me feel guilty for reporting them.

The stress of all this led to me being signed off by my doctor. I‚Äôm due to return on Monday, but I‚Äôm anxious about how to handle things.

How should I approach my return? Do you think I should take any further action? I'm already looking elsewhere for work, but I haven't had any luck so far, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",No_Amphibian2790,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1743156045,2025-03-28 10:00:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlrk24/returning_to_a_toxic_workplace_after_being_signed/,3,2025

I'm relatively from a middle class family so I've a responsibility to look after my parents as an only child when I clear my degree but as of now I see it to be impossible

I thought of double majoring after I complete my graphics course but my parents can't pay for it and I don't think it'll be possible for me to pay for my course look after myself and my family with just a graphics degree I don't even know if I'll get a job afterwards

The thing is, I have a degree in an unrelated field (technical-based) and have been doing projects and certifications as well as working part-time in a temp, low-paying job for the past several months.

1jlq4ct,Freelance vs. Full-Time AI & ML Talent: Which is Right for Your Project?,"‚ÄãWhen embarking on AI and machine learning (ML) projects, a pivotal decision is choosing between freelance professionals and full-time employees. Each option offers distinct advantages and challenges that can significantly impact your project's success.‚Äã

**Freelance AI & ML Talent**

*Advantages:*

* **Specialized Expertise:** Freelancers often bring niche skills tailored to specific tasks, making them ideal for projects requiring specialized knowledge.‚Äã
* **Flexibility:** They can be engaged on a per-project basis, allowing you to scale your team up or down based on current needs.‚Äã
* **Cost Efficiency:** Without the overhead associated with full-time employees, freelancers can be a more budget-friendly option for short-term projects.‚Äã
* **Quick Onboarding:** The hiring process for freelancers is typically faster, enabling rapid deployment to meet tight deadlines.‚Äã

*Challenges:*

* **Limited Availability:** Freelancers may juggle multiple clients, potentially affecting their availability and responsiveness.‚Äã
* **Variable Commitment:** Their dedication might be project-specific, lacking the long-term commitment that full-time employees offer.‚Äã
* **Integration Hurdles:** As external contributors, freelancers might face challenges integrating seamlessly into your company's culture and workflows.‚Äã

**Full-Time AI & ML Talent**

*Advantages:*

* **Consistent Dedication:** Full-time employees are committed solely to your organization, ensuring steady progress and continuity in long-term projects.‚Äã
* **Deep Integration:** Being part of the internal team allows for better alignment with company values, culture, and objectives.‚Äã
* **Knowledge Retention:** Full-time staff contribute to building and retaining institutional knowledge, which is invaluable for ongoing and future projects.‚Äã

*Challenges:*

* **Higher Costs:** Salaries, benefits, and other employment expenses make full-time hires a significant financial commitment.‚Äã
* **Reduced Flexibility:** Adjusting the workforce in response to project demands is more complex with permanent staff.‚Äã
* **Longer Hiring Process:** Recruiting full-time talent often involves a more extensive selection process, which can delay project initiation.‚Äã

**Making the Right Choice**

Consider the following factors when deciding between freelance and full-time AI & ML talent:

* **Project Duration and Scope:** Short-term or highly specialized projects may benefit from the agility of freelancers, while long-term initiatives might require the stability of full-time employees.‚Äã
* **Budget Constraints:** Evaluate your financial resources to determine if you can sustain the ongoing costs of full-time staff or if the pay-as-you-go model of freelancers is more viable.‚Äã
* **Need for Integration:** Assess how critical deep integration into your company‚Äôs culture and processes is for the success of the project.",Loud_Inevitable_1162,1,1.0,0,1743149369,2025-03-28 08:09:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlq4ct/freelance_vs_fulltime_ai_ml_talent_which_is_right/,3,2025

1jlpmex,Should I try to make a career,"Basically I worked for a company for long enough for them to want to keep me, but I moved to a location that wasn't hiring at the time. I've noticed a lot of job postings for the same company but across the state should I just give it a try. I left what I had with the company before to help my brother get out of debt but he's kinda done nothing but ignore my help/dig himself deeper.

He'd never have been where he is now without my help and even so he doesn't really act like he cares. Should I just idk I want him to live but I need a career I can't sacrifice my life for him. I just want freedom. Should I apply for a position clear accross the state and live in my car for a while if I get the job? Or is that too much of a risk, I don't know if I can keep doing everything around the house so much so that he's come to rely on me for meals and if I don't cook he doesn't eat. All he does is talk to his ex girlfriend who left him for another guy who ended up being a douche so she kept him as a backup hoe on the side for her to swoop in and take back when they inevitably broke up.

I started this job last year, I had small introduction meetings with the team leaders of other teams in my first couple of weeks, about¬†3/4 weeks into my role I was supposed to have one with the managing director but I unfortuntely got really ill which doesnt look great I know but it couldnt be helped and my own line manager could see how ill I was, so the meeting with the MD kept being pushed back until eventually the meeting just never happened. He is essentially my second line manager though, so you would think it would have been rescheduled? As time went on I forgot about it but then it got kind of awkward, because we havent had that inital meeting theres not even small talk or anything. 
Hes really nice to everyone else though and everyone seems to rate him, I‚Äôve seen him speak to newer staff than me too. He also really likes my manager (and hes her manager) so you‚Äôd think he'd want to know who she hired? Especially¬†as MD of the business? 
Anyway in one of my 121s my manager was talkin about him and I joked that I‚Äôd barely spoke to him yet¬†because of the above reasons and she said oh no really you should message him and ask him for the meeting, I said its fine I know hes busy its fine, she said no no he shouldve¬†made that happen to be honest, she said he'll appreciate the message too. 
I wasnt sure at first but the week after (last week) I sent him a message on Teams just saying if he has time could we have that meeting, he replied later that night just saying Hi sounds great, I'm pushed for time this week can we look at booking something for next week (this week) I replied the next morning saying yeah thats fine of course. 
But then nothing, hes smiled and gave me an acknowledging nod since but not come over to me to make any conversation, I¬†didnt want to just go and put it in his calendar either with how busy he is I thought surely he'll just grab me when he gets 5mins. Yesterday was the perfect opportunity too, I was the only one in that part of the office (others wfh) and he was using a meeting room next to me for a call, when he was finished he came out and awkwardly smiled but said nothing.¬†¬†I‚Äôm confused. Maybe I‚Äôm being awkward/unapprochable without realising?

I was lucky enough to get a new grad role at a pretty great company, and now I really want to do well.

How do I go about being the type of engineer my teammates appreciate and become reliable / valuable in my team?

I asked what the on call pay rate was?  His reply was,  leadership will be filling me in on that next Monday.

So the weekend comes, I take my cell phone home and company computer and I do my weekend things around the house.

Well I‚Äôm pissed, so I write a email to the state Labor board and give them the proof of what the boss had emailed me about being on call along with the email about them not paying on call hours. 

Now it‚Äôs 4:50pm, my shift ends at 5pm and leadership wants me to come for a meeting. I tell them my shift ends at 5pm and I can not stay later. I go to the meeting and HR had my time card, right at 5pm they punch me out and say, we will be with you when we can.

With new people, I‚Äôm quiet, nonchalant, and I feel it so difficult to speak.

1jllwhp,How One Subject in University Changed My Whole Career,"Joined CS in University in hopes of making games,websites but the thing is basically for me it coding never clicked me or I found it something I wanna do for long term.

Now the thing that got me into coding when I studied CS in university wasn't money or anything but as I wanted to open a startup someday I just didn't want to depend upon any other people to make MVP as its expensive.

Now while I was in 3-4th semester I use to make small games, websites but I while I always enjoy learning new things that never happened with coding or while I was doing job as developer while in college.

Then in around 5th or 6th semester I don't remember it now but there was a subject called 'Technical Writing' and obviously as it was a CS course there was PHP in that semester now I should have been more interested in PHP as it was in the course curriculum I was more interested in technical writing and got highest marks and for me I guess that was a turning point.

 That subject in CS degree sparked a new interest in me to get into marketing and then that there was a choice to pick elective in final sem and instead of picking tech subjects like game dev ,neural networks or any other I choose International Business Management as It was more closer to marketing.

Now, obviously I had to find job when I graduate but I never got any interviews for tech jobs ,not even a single call but whenever I applied for marketing jobs there was usually a follow-up when thinking about it is strange as I did have projects in my CV when I applied for tech roles but not in marketing and from that I got marketing job in tech and I don't think I will ever return to dev.

1jllmd0,How do I get out of customer-facing roles?,"Need to get out of customer facing roles

I have worked in customer facing roles my entire life, and I genuinely don‚Äôt think I can do it anymore. 

I currently work at a B2B SaaS company. Last year, I was promoted from a role in tech support to a technical role in Customer Success where I have an assigned book of clients. My job mainly consists of hosting customer facing meetings, answering technical questions, and managing/escalating product issues. On paper, this is the best job I‚Äôve ever had (great pay, solid benefits, well-established company), and I am by far the most miserable I‚Äôve ever been. It feels like half of my day is spent being yelled at by clients because the product is falling short, and the other half is spent being yelled at by my own engineering/product teams when I try to escalate the customers concerns. I am constantly absorbing negativity from all angles, and while I can recognize that it‚Äôs not always aimed at me directly, it‚Äôs started to wear on me over time.

On a deeper level, I have always considered myself to be socially awkward and an introvert. I don‚Äôt like confrontation, and I don‚Äôt even necessarily like talking to people. Every time I have to present a slide deck in front of a group of people, or have a difficult conversation with a client, I feel like I‚Äôm putting on a mask. 

I want out, but nearly all of my skills are built around interacting with customers. When I do get offers from LinkedIn, it‚Äôs for other customer facing roles (CSM, Account Manager, etc.). I have some technical skills, but they are mostly specific to the products that my current company owns, which makes me feel trapped.

How do I get out of this career path? I want nothing more than a job where I can just sit down, do my own work, and never have to ask a customer how their weekend was ever again.

1jlleva,How to Navigate Hot and Cold Boss at New Company,"I recently started at a new company in a senior management position. They recruited me based on my specific experience and area of expertise. 

I‚Äôm having a difficult time navigating my manager‚Äôs expectations and behavior. They tend to run hot and cold‚ÄîI‚Äôve been told by a friend that this person does tend to take their frustrations out on the team when they‚Äôre under pressure from leadership, and I have been trying not to take it personally, but it‚Äôs becoming more and more difficult as some of their reactions are very clearly pointed at me specifically. They fluctuate between actively seeking my input on a variety of project processes, to overtly negative responses to my contributions (cutting me off in meetings when I‚Äôm answering questions asked of me or explaining something I worked on, eye rolls when I bring up an issue, etc.).

I work well with other team members and they have expressed appreciation for the ideas and experience I‚Äôm bringing to the table, and I have not gotten the impression from any others that my contributions are unwelcome. I know that I‚Äôm excited about this position and that many of my ideas are different than what this company has historically done, so I‚Äôve tried to take a step back and offer less proactive input, and am now trying to couch my ‚Äúunprompted‚Äù ideas with less confidence, as this seems to be part of the issue, but I really never know what reaction I‚Äôm going to receive - whether it will be welcomed or immediately shut down with a terse statement or email. That uncertainty is causing me to *actually* lose confidence and I don‚Äôt know how to find my footing in this new role‚Äî I‚Äôm becoming afraid to speak from my experience which is why the company sought me out in the first place. 

I know that I need to have a direct conversation with my manager to establish expectations. We do talk regularly and I‚Äôve even addressed some of these occurrences but they‚Äôve denied that their frustrations have had to do with me. Whether or not that‚Äôs true, those conversations haven‚Äôt gotten us anywhere as far as managing frustrations and their impact on our ability to work productively together. I need to understand what they want of me, and I need them to understand that me walking on eggshells is not going to allow me to do my job.

Opportunity Available: new project but lateral move, vague but I‚Äôm sure deliverable expectations. Exposure to different parts of the business and networking opportunities. Different manager, uncertain about workload/expectation. Would likely be offered ~$96k + 8% bonus.

Reason to hold out: I‚Äôve been working with my managers and director and they believe I‚Äôd be ready for a manager position, however one is not *currently* open. We are growing and hiring a lot. This would be a step up vs lateral. Would likely be offered between $110-120k + 12% bonus.

1jlizgj,Don't know how to look on this,"

Hello everyone, just wanted to share my current situation and hopefully get some advice or perspective.

I'm currently working on an airline doing some smalls projects. The pay is very low, lower than what I was paid on my first graduate job. I accepted the job due being screwed on the prior job (still don't understand what happen) and needed money to continue living.

A bit on my background. I have a Computer Science degree and a Master's in Data Science. And 3 years of experience on a small consultancy as Backend and Data Engineer.

Besides my formal tasks, I've somehow become the go-to person for any problem with Cloud Technology or development issue. To the point, that I'm solving doubts to my seniors and tech leads, and being asked to mentor the team on some of this topics.

That part is honestly burning me out a bit. I seem to be respected in terms of responsibilities, but my income doesn‚Äôt reflect any of it. Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt bother me as much if I wasn‚Äôt also struggling to make ends meet.

To dig myself out of this situation, I‚Äôve been learning DevOps on my own, revisiting materials from my Master‚Äôs, and trying to keep everything in balance. But lately, it‚Äôs been mentally exhausting‚Äîlike I‚Äôm pushing the limits of my mind, trying to absorb knowledge from multiple fields and make sense of it all.

I feel stuck. It‚Äôs only been 7 months in this role, and I‚Äôm hesitant to leave because I don‚Äôt want it to look bad on my resume. After spending 3 years in a small consultancy, I hoped this would help my career trajectory. Maybe it still can?

But emotionally, I feel worn out‚Äîlike I‚Äôm being drained of my energy and time, and those years won‚Äôt come back.

1jlij0a,"Most careers don‚Äôt stall because of skill gaps, they stall from quiet hesitation","I used to think I wasn‚Äôt making progress because I lacked experience.  
So I kept doing what felt smart‚Äîupdating my resume, researching job paths, watching career strategy videos.

I told myself I was preparing.  
But I was mostly stalling.

What I eventually realized is this:  
Most people don‚Äôt stay stuck because they‚Äôre unqualified.  
They stay stuck because they‚Äôre quietly avoiding something.

Not big things‚Äîjust the small decisions that keep piling up:

* Sending a follow-up email
* Asking for feedback
* Applying for a role you bookmarked weeks ago
* Having a hard conversation with your manager
* Finally admitting your role hasn‚Äôt challenged you in a year

It doesn‚Äôt feel like fear.  
It feels like ‚Äúbeing thoughtful.‚Äù  
But underneath, it‚Äôs hesitation in disguise.

What helped me break the loop was asking a new question:  
**What have I already decided‚Äîbut haven‚Äôt acted on yet?**

That one filter brought up everything I was avoiding.  
And once I stopped rationalizing, momentum started to come back.

I‚Äôve been writing about this in [NoFluffWisdom](https://nofluffwisdom.com/subscribe)‚Äîweekly breakdowns of the mental clutter that keeps people stuck in place  
Not motivational fluff‚Äîjust clear thinking and systems that actually help people move forward

1jlg8zj,Lost in my career choices,"Hey Reddit community,

I'm looking for some career guidance and hoping to tap into the collective wisdom here. A bit about my background: I recently completed my CFA Level 1, and after finishing school, I landed a job as an advisor in the sales department of a bank. While I‚Äôm grateful for the experience, my aspiration is to transition into an analyst role.

However, I'm finding it challenging to break into the analyst field, likely due to my current role being more sales-oriented. This has made me consider whether pursuing CFA Levels 2 and 3 would significantly improve my chances of landing an analyst position.

Additionally, with the increasing importance of AI in the finance industry, I'm also contemplating learning Python. My goal is to acquire skills that would allow me to contribute to AI initiatives or even build AI models myself.

So, my questions to you all are:
For someone in my situation, is it worth pursuing CFA Levels 2 and 3?
Would learning Python be a valuable addition to my skill set given the current trends in finance and technology?

Any advice, personal experiences, or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!",Lake_Western,1,1.0,1,1743115872,2025-03-27 22:51:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlg8zj/lost_in_my_career_choices/,3,2025

She even showed my manager our chat as ‚Äúproof‚Äù which was shady as hell!!!

The thing is, I went back through our entire chat history and could only find like 2 times where I didn‚Äôt respond with a thumbs up or thank you. I always respond to peoples messages and the only time I‚Äôm late with it or might‚Äôve missed it is if it got buried deep in my inbox. The main thing that‚Äôs pissing me off is that she ran to my manager for such a small issue that could‚Äôve easily been resolved with a direct message to me (I.e. ‚Äúhey just following up on this message, all good?‚Äù)

Anyways, my manager insists that I chat with her 1/1 to just talk it out and make sure we ‚Äústrengthen our bond and relationship‚Äù so I have a call set up w her. 

I need advice, what should I say in this call? Should I just be passive and tell her let‚Äôs move past this? I really want to let her know how uncool and shady this was in the most corporate friendly way possible

1jlff0g,I made a mistake at work (apologies if not right sub to post in),"So I just started my first job, fresh out of uni (currently just shy about 3 months in so still probation period) and I've been doing a pretty good job at it, my manager and colleagues keep praising me.

But just this Wednesday I made a processing mistake and feel really down about it and worried it might affect my standing between my manager and senior team members :((

So backstory, I work in IB (Back Office operations) and we had a really sensitive client trading with us for 10+ mil USD. I originally processed it everything as per SOP and it was cleared (waiting for payment to be released) but just before it was released an amendment fed down and caused it to reappear in my queue. 

Proceeded to clear it again but this time a duplicate warning came up, and per SOP when this happens, you're only supposed to push ledgers out for accounting purposes without releasing any payment, so I did exactly that. Only I failed to check whether payment had actually gone out first even (I didn't know how but also I should've checked with my team members first) and bc it was just ledgers, it didn't go through a second check (that usually happens with high payment values)

It got escalated all the way to the Trading Managing Director (apparently client needs to be treated like Platinum level hence the level of escalation) and while my manager and colleagues kept telling me ""dw abt it, it happens to the best of us too. ur still new, as long as u learn from it and be a bit more careful next time"" and proceeded to give more training to curb that gap in knowledge in me

But idk i just feel really bad and worried it might affect my performance review :((

Is it normal to make this level of mistake on your first ever job? To me it just seems very big cause of who the client is and the amount of money TT we still managed to get the payment out to client though it was a day later so client asked us to pay the Overdraft fee ",Pochi_Ninja,2,1.0,1,1743113728,2025-03-27 22:15:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlff0g/i_made_a_mistake_at_work_apologies_if_not_right/,3,2025

1jldum3,I hate my job,"I know I shouldn't be saying I hate my job in this job market / I'm lucky to even have a job but I'm absolutely miserable. I'm currently on a restaurant marketing team for a popular fast food chain and I absolutely despise it. I have been there for almost 3 years and have only been given a $1 raise for a store that makes 20 million, the owner profiting almost 3 mil. 

I'm supposed to be marketing the product , marketing catering but instead I'm stuck delivering the catering. Why may you ask? We have one delivery vehicle and when there's multiple orders I have to use my personal vehicle . We barely have any workers that possess a license . My bosses response  to this is that he pays for our parking (he pays for all the director team parking) and that he pays me mileage (60 cents). I'm having to leave marketing meetings early to deliver food. Mind you there's also no tip option. So basically my job has turned into me either helping out the restaurant by waiting on people, or delivering food. All while I obtain a masters degree. I also haven't taken my vacation yet because honestly I can't afford to go anywhere. I'm not allowed to take Saturdays off but other managers are on their third week of vacation time. 

I'm at the point where I'm completely miserable and exhausted. I dread going to work and dread going to bed because when I wake up I have to go to work.

I really wish I could quit and do what I truly want to do which is social media marketing but I've applied to almost 100 jobs and have gotten no response or get denied. I don't want to continue to be miserable but I can't help it when I have no set hours . It's literally all based off of when catering deliveries come in which I wasn't aware when I got hired.

Economics is easy to me and I would do good in this, but it seems the only jobs I could get into are entry level banking or accounting. I like the subject but not the career, I would quickly burnout.

International relations I definitely would enjoy doing the most but the employment prospects for this degree are nil. The only option is to get into the public service and that is quite competitive. Apart from diplomacy there is literally zero jobs and I will probably have just sunk tens of thousands in debt like a fool.

Psychology is my other academic interest. I just do not know if I will be able to handle medical school as I plan on psychiatry not counselling. I understand it's a big commitment 7 years of school+ training.

Cyber security fits what I want in a job the most. I mean doesn't everyone want to work from any country and not be in a 9-5. I never liked coding though, being a software engineer is a nightmare for me. I do not know if I will be good at this even though I know it has better career prospects than humanities.

1jlbwot,I‚Äôm terrified to quit my job and I‚Äôm not sure what to do,"Last summer, times were rough and i (25M) had to move back home to live with my parents. I was in about 8k of debt. During this time in July, i applied EVERYWHERE including a warehouse i previously spent some time at, and they agreed to take me back. A couple days later, i was able to pick up some creative writing freelance gigs that pay me $35 an hour. The warehouse pays $16 an hour. When i first began freelance, a lot of people were advising i should not rely on not full time, which i understand due to the risk of inconsistency work, but I‚Äôve genuinely been having a good amount of work since I‚Äôve started.  Thankfully through grinding, i was actually able to pay off all my debt by stacking these opportunities by October, and fast forward now i feel somewhat attached and dependant on the warehouse job. This is mainly due to the fact that this job market in general is quite awful, and I‚Äôm afraid to take the risk and rely on my freelance gigs completely. Furthermore, i have a younger brother who‚Äôs 22 that hasn‚Äôt had a job in 3 years and I‚Äôm afraid if i approach my parents about quitting my warehouse job, i would come across as ungrateful and they would definitely use his situation to convince me to stay, even though both the job and pay aren‚Äôt that great.

TLDR; i have a great freelance gig that pays me super well although there is a risk of inconsistency,  and have a stable ‚Äú9-5‚Äù that i feel pressured to stay in because of the current climate in the job market. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach my parents and tell them i want to quit without it causing major problems in the house, considering i was in pretty bad debt last summer. I still somewhat rely on them and would want their support in my decision. How can i approach them?


For context: I‚Äôm 25, living with my parents, and have just under 5k saved up. Fortunately i don‚Äôt have to pay rent, just my groceries although i am willing to contribute.

An Engineer that is a friend of a friend works there, he told me that they were going to open up an Associate CADD position and I should apply.

We sent her another request for a reference, she's is your sister in law?"" and I said yes, she is. They asked if I spoke to her about using her as a reference and I said yes. We ended the call with them saying they were going to call her up to verify her as a reference and schedule the next interview. Later that day, a hiring manager I had not previously spoken with asked if my SIL had another number or something, I said not that I know of, but that she ""was known to take her remote position pretty seriously, so we often dont hear from her until later in the evenings"" - I called to give her a heads up, texted her, and no response. Meanwhile, she is in a family group chat talking about buying shoes at Costco, clearly shopping.

The next Monday (couple days ago from today) I logged into my profile on the company site, and my sister in law's review was overwhelmingly negative to the point where it was insulting. She ended her email that ""I would not recommend hiring him, he would not be a good fit."" - I tell my wife this, and she thinks I am full of crap until she sat down and was able to see what all 8 of my references wrote, including her sister. - I haven't heard from the company since then. My sister in law doesn't know I am able to see what she wrote.

I'm having trouble processing this. My wife on the other hand... doesn't understand what the big deal is and thinks I shouldn't take it to heart. Even talking to her in a group chat like normal. Like, we have kids, mortgage due in 2 days, and I had to sell my car.

1jlb66v,How Do I Start With Cars/Motorsport?,"Hey everyone, 

I am 25 years old, and have trialed pretty much every job/career opportunity around me. And I‚Äôve been to college twice. That said, nothing has ever ‚Äúworked‚Äù or ‚Äúclicked‚Äù with me, other than cars, especially high performance (GT/LMP) cars. I have always loved cars and I really feel like pursuing a career in the high performance automotive/motorsport field could bring me a sense of purpose. 

However, I feel like I don‚Äôt belong in this field. I have no mechanical/technical training or knowledge, and I‚Äôve struggled with math in pretty much every class I‚Äôve taken, including when I had a tutor. And I worry that I am already ‚Äútoo old‚Äù to start from scratch in such a competitive/demanding industry. 

But I am genuinely eager to learn and am hoping to hear from others who might have been in a similar position or anyone with advice on how to get started? Where do I begin? Would I need to attain a degree/complete a program, or are there other opportunities? Would I need some sort of ‚Äúconnection‚Äù to get my foot in the door?

I know I‚Äôm starting from scratch, but I have a passion for cars and even just the potential thought of being a part of this industry really excites me. Any advice, resources, experiences, etc. that would help point me in any direction would be greatly appreciated! 

I know a career like this for someone like me is a long shot, and I‚Äôm not looking for an immediate result, just somewhere to start.

1jlars0,"Boss' boss asks ""is everything alright"" because I've ""been quiet lately."" Been on poop-eating duty for a year, so how would I even start to respond to that?","So first, I don't know what he's measuring my quietness against or why it matters to him. I'm never in meetings with him, and I'm seldom on e-mail chains. He only talks to me to say, ""I'm checking in on you"" (even though he definitely doesn't care) or to nonchalantly inform me of some new responsibility that will come with no additional pay but must be completed ASAP!

He's a really bad manager and an even worse leader. He pits workers against each other, sets them up for failure, takes credit for their work, spends money we don't have, pretty much all the bad leader things to do. Pretty sure he's taking kickbacks from vendors. He would have fired me a long time ago I think, but the owners like me a lot more than he does.

He quiet-demoted me a year ago when my old boss got axed for what I would categorize as whistleblowing. He moved me into a cube from the office I had for years and thrust a lot more work on me with no additional pay, while backfilling up and leaving me at the bottom of the org chart.

Then, we lost hybrid WFH schedules with little to no input from employees and no compensation, duty adjustments or anything. He's signed off on a really bad review (after years of stellar reviews) that reflected more about how poorly the organization responded to my old boss than anything I personally did, so a raise seems like an unlikely ask.

The latest things were being told (not asked) to cover an additional day of lunch breaks for an adjacent role (it's in my job description, but also in others' job descriptions), and learning he just hired a kid out of college (the grandkid of a board member) to earn 7% more than me (with 15+ years of experience) in an adjacent role. Oh yeah ... and after he asked my opinion about the department, where a couple of others and I said something like ""we need more worker bees,"" he hired another VP who'll pull down twice what I do.

So there are plenty of clear reasons to be annoyed at him, and he is aware of all of them.

Everything over the last year suggests I'm being quiet-fired or slow-boiled, deliberately burnt out or whatever you call it, but I really don't think my attitude or behavior has been much different while my productivity is much, much higher. Of course, I'm looking for new work, but I've regrettably pigeonholed my skills severely to make this role function. Further, the pay isn't too, too bad, I have a family and bills and reeeeallllly HATE looking for new work.

Is he playing dumb by asking ""what's wrong,"" trying to distance himself from his responsibility over the shitty work situation I'm in, or is it possible he is actually that oblivious to how shittily they're treating me (and frankly everyone below director level)?

I can keep my head down and collect a check until something better comes along, but I really don't want to point out what a short-sighted, morally bereft, managerially unfit bumbleschmuck this guy is should I snap. Is this sort of thing just something to ignore while I keep looking or should I have an answer for his feigned interest in my well-being?",footfirstfolly,22,0.9200000166893005,24,1743099724,2025-03-27 18:22:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jlars0/boss_boss_asks_is_everything_alright_because_ive/,3,2025

Not that it really bothers me or that I expect to learn anything especially interesting in an interview, but this has just never happened to me before.

1jl8lv1,Seeking Career change advice,"I have always been somewhat of an ambition person and always wanted to do something useful with my life. I always took my day job as a way to finance my own projects, and saving  money to one day be self employed. Though the motivation remained at the back of my head, it was years ago. I am older now and have a family. I am unhappy with my current job providing little satisfaction and growth opportunity. I have been at this place for 4 years already and nothing changed.

So with that context, I am writing this. I am asking for suggestion. My options are as 

* To do what I always wanted and take the risk and start a small business of some sort.
* Finding another job

# About me:

* I am 35
* Savings: around $50k
* Debt: None
* Current Industry: Software developer (11 years of experience)
* Married but no kids, have parents as dependent.

Programming was my hobby and been doing that for 21 years. For the last 11 years I am doing the same professionally. In college I did some freelance work (created a website for a local company) which I liked because it allowed me to connect with other people, learn the trade and get a many intangible skills. But it was hectic as I was doing everything from scratch and wanted to do everything on my own because I also wanted to learn the ins-and-outs of creating a professional website.

Anyways that was many years ago and since then I have just been working professionally, which is not the same at all. I have come up with this pros and cos list for the options.

# Starting a business/freelance - Challenges:

* **Out of touch with latest trends**: I work low level in primarily C/C++, so I feel out of touch with current software stack (particularly web). I was working and learning it  10 years back and many things have changed since then.
* **Lack of Guidance**: No one in my family ever owned a business so I am bit on the dark.
* **Burnout**: I am older but I feel I have less time now. Having a proper mindset is very important which I doubt I have now. I fear that I have waited too long!
* **Fear of failure**: I have a stable job with moderate to high salary. I am not rich and do not have any other financial backing.

# Finding a new job - Concerns:

* **Time**: I will not get another chance. With age responsibilities increase and the ability to take risk decreases. I have waited long enough, I do not want to waste another 5 years.

I want to give starting a business a chance because I believe it would get more harder in future.

1jl67yu,Waiting on job offer/update before lease ends,"
**TLDR at bottom**

Back in January I applied for a somewhat entry level position at a tech company in California working at an exclusive site a couple hours away from their HQ. At the end of February I was flown out to tour this site, signing an NDA and receiving reimbursements for all expenses. This company has been around for a decade and operates internationally, but still relies on investor money and has some start-up tendencies, which was apparent throughout the interview process. Additionally my lease ends on April 12th, and I communicated that one of the reasons I was considering this job is that my lease is ending soon and Spring would be a good time for me to pursue a new opportunity. 

To provide some more context, I applied to the job after messaging the site manager on LinkedIn who coincidentally was a former classmate of mine who I worked on a couple projects with. Additionally, I have a lot of relevant experience for the position I‚Äôm applying for and felt like I did a pretty good job throughout the rigorous interview process, so I feel like my odds are pretty good of getting a job offer. 

The job was posted as a contract position but I expressed interest in working full-time and they moved me on track for a full-time opportunity, but they told me if I didn‚Äôt meet all of the requirements they may offer me a 6-month contract position (that will allegedly likely lead to a full-time opportunity after). I live on the East Coast so for me I‚Äôm hoping to be hired on full-time, especially since they mentioned that they will only cover moving expenses and offer benefits to full-time employees. 

After all of the interviews, they flew me out to California to tour the site I‚Äôd be working at, covering all my expenses for the 3 days I was there (costing over $2k), one of which I spent the entire day at the site doing a tour and talking to people throughout different departments. It basically felt like I already had the job when I was there, and I felt like I left a pretty good impression overall. After the day was over, the site manager who I knew thanked me and said that the hiring manager will reach out with an update of some sort. 

The following weekend (beginning of March) I sent an email thanking the site manager, hiring manager, and the HR lady who coordinated the visit and expressing my gratitude, saying that I‚Äôm eager to hear back. I didn‚Äôt get a response to that email but didn‚Äôt think much of it. A week later the leasing agent for my apartment sent me an email reminding me that my lease ends in April and that they‚Äôd love to have me renew and sent me a form to fill out. This apartment is awesome with a fantastic rent rate, so if I don‚Äôt get this job I‚Äôd love to renew if possible. I held off on replying to the leasing agent for a few days in hopes that I‚Äôd get an update from the company, but still didn‚Äôt receive one. 

I eventually replied and filled out the form, expressing interest in renewing my lease, but explicitly stated that I‚Äôm waiting for an update on a job offer that would require me to relocate, and I will let her know whether I will commit to renewing or not as soon as I get an update. I told her I‚Äôd circle back with her on 3/17 to keep her posted. I didn‚Äôt get a reply from her. The weekend before that self-imposed update deadline, I reached out to the site manager and hiring manager of the company 2 weeks after my tour date to ask for an update and was vague about having to consider and take care of some ‚Äústuff‚Äù, hence why I was asking for an update. The next day the site manager replied and told me they still haven‚Äôt made a decision but will let me know as soon as they do. I responded and thanked them for the update (or lack thereof). I circled back with the leasing agent on Monday (3/17) to tell them I‚Äôm still waiting for a response. Haven‚Äôt got a response on that either and it‚Äôs been a couple of days. 

I‚Äôm starting to get a bit anxious about my lease ending in less than a month (4/12) and waiting for this job offer/proposal. This is a job I‚Äôve spent months interviewing for and I really want it, although I am a bit conditional about the terms (contract vs full time, moving expense coverage, wage). I don‚Äôt want to pressure the managers into making a decision or seeming desperate, but I feel that if they don‚Äôt give me an update soon, eventually I will have to force my hand and tell them that I have a lease to renew soon and need a decision. I also feel bad for the leasing agent, although she seems a bit carefree at the moment not replying to my updates and is known for being a bit unprofessional. I really hope to hear something soon, but if I don‚Äôt get an update by the end of this week, what should tell these folks? Additionally, what should I do if I receive a job offer that isn‚Äôt satisfactory and want to negotiate for better terms? I know I may not have the luxury of time to negotiate, but am also a bit concerned they‚Äôre gonna give me a low ball offer since this is kind of a supplementary position that they were initially hiring contractors for. 

My plan is to reach out to the leasing agent today and ask for a month extension on my lease to buy time for decision, will also afford me time to put my two weeks notice before lease ends since I‚Äôm approaching that deadline tomorrow and they may not make a decision by then. If that‚Äôs not an option then I will probably reach out to the hiring manager and ask explicitly when I can expect an update and explain my situation, potentially turning down the job if no decision is made, and I can‚Äôt wait much longer for an update, and I‚Äôm becoming more comfortable with the idea of renewing my lease at my awesome apartment and just staying here.


**TLDR:** Applied for job back in January that would require me to relocate across the country. Job was initially a contract position but they are exploring the possibility of hiring me full time instead. My apartment lease ends next month on April 12th. Interviews went well and I was flown out to tour site at the end of February and am currently awaiting an update or job offer/proposal from hiring manager. Leasing agent for apartment reached out over a week ago offering a renewal, can‚Äôt give her an update yet. Reached out to hiring/site manager for update on job offer and they still haven‚Äôt made a decision. Deadline for lease is approaching and want to hear back on job offer soon so I know whether or not to renew lease. How should I approach this situation if I don‚Äôt receive job offer by the end of this week? What should I do if they reach out with a job proposal that has terms that aren‚Äôt satisfactory that I would like negotiate for? More than likely I would just turn them down in the but the terms of this job are solely dependent on the proposal from the hiring manager. They are somewhat aware of my lease ending since I made it known multiple times but they are taking their time on this decision.

1jl51je,Therapist or Rad Tech?,"
I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I‚Äôm ready for a drastic career change. I‚Äôve been stuck in dead-end retail jobs that barely cover my financial responsibilities unless I strictly budget. With health issues and some debt, I‚Äôm struggling to pay rent and live comfortably, leaving me with no choice but to make a change. I regret not pursuing higher education sooner, but I‚Äôm ready to go back to school.

I‚Äôm torn between becoming a therapist or a radiologic technologist (Rad Tech), though I‚Äôm also open to nursing or other medical fields. My biggest concern is that a psychology degree takes too long to turn into a stable career, and even then, the pay can be unpredictable depending on where you practice‚Äîsomething my own therapist pointed out. On the other hand, the medical field offers more job security and consistent opportunities.

I‚Äôm considering becoming a Rad Tech to secure a stable income and job security while furthering my studies in psychology later. However, I‚Äôm nervous about pursuing jobs due to my upper cervical issues and other health concerns. I also have a tremor in my hands and fear I wouldn‚Äôt be good at handling needles. Would Rad Tech be the better short-term option while keeping psychology as a long-term goal?

1jl4n01,Senior FP&A looking for advice,"All,

I am on year 3 as a senior financial analyst at a local organization. I did a lateral transfer into this organization in March 2022 so this will effectively be me going on 4.5 years as a Senior Analyst title at two organizations.

I have had several conversations about promotions into a Lead Analyst role at my current organization, and believe there is potential here. Lots of positive feedback, I have been a ""High"" rating the last 2 years and raises have reflected that. 

However, being in FP&A I can see how much coworkers make, and I am not only the least compensated (mid 100's) I believe even if I was to get a promotion to a Lead Analyst I would be barely making more than a recent hire senior analyst on the team (mid 110s). Obviously I can never use my access to personnel information or their pay as leverage to get more compensation for myself. But we also have another senior analyst position open and I know there's no way we will be able to get a new person in the door for less than I make.

So: I guess my question is do I just suck it up and keep pushing for the promo, or just not even bother as I would be making as much as a coworker but with a higher title and more responsibility (feels very unfair). 

I'm actually less motivated now that I know this information than before, knowing I have mountains to climb to get maybe a $10k raise when I could go to another org and probably get a $15-20k increase for a lateral move in title.

There are a lot of positives to this organization: pension and 401k, local, remote 2 days a week, etc. 

What should I do?

1jl20ne,International Business Management vs. Business Informatics - Which Bachelor Path?,"Hello I'm struggling to determine which path would give me the best advantage in the job market.

My goal is to study and work over the next four years, securing a job that supports a comfortable lifestyle‚Äîwithout needing an extra 2‚Äì3 years for a master‚Äôs.


IBM

Pros
* English-taught (mother tongue) ‚Üí Easier learning + better for future English-speaking jobs
* Study abroad option
* Less stress (assumed easier) ‚Üí More time for side projects, jobs, and upskilling

Cons
* Generic degree ‚Üí Covers a bit of everything but lacks specialization
* Job security depends on work experience + technical skills learned on the side


Business Informatics?

Pros
* In-demand skill with good remote work potential
* Higher salary potential

Cons
* French-taught ‚Üí I‚Äôm fluent but struggled with French in school. Learning IT in French could be tough.
* Difficult studies ‚Üí Many say IT-related fields are intense and can lead to burnout

I keep going back and forth because, with either option being part-time, I‚Äôd have the flexibility to specialize in something on the side. For example, if I choose IBM, I could take an online programming course for six months to build technical skills. Since IBM is more general, I‚Äôd mostly rely on work experience and additional skills learned outside of school to stand out.

The same applies to Business Informatics‚Äîwhile it‚Äôs already more specialized, I could still deepen my expertise in a specific business area alongside my studies.

Would love to hear your insights!

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Marketing & Consumption in Sweden and wanted to get some insights on how Swedish master's degrees are perceived internationally, particularly in the job market.

I have four years of professional experience in marketing (CVM, customer retention, and service marketing) and plan to explore global job opportunities after graduation. While Sweden is an option, I‚Äôd like to know if my degree would be recognized and valued in other countries, such as the UK, US, or other European markets.

A few specific questions:

How do employers outside Sweden view Swedish master's degrees in marketing?

Have any international graduates from Swedish universities found jobs abroad easily?

1jl061q,Market leaders in small industry vs larger org but number 2 in the industry. What would you choose?,"
Hi all,

Would you continue working with the market leaders who are a global company operating on the NASDAQ or would you consider taking a leap to a company 3x the size with more exposure and diversity, Fortune 500, however, number 2 in terms of market share?

Some factors to consider about me:
-Young (>30 YO) and ambitious (aim is to work in FAANG)
-Things are pretty good at the current workplace with possible progression into leadership 

Some questions 
-would there be opportunities to move internally to better teams in the new org or grass isn‚Äôt greener?
-should I pigeonhole myself in this niche industry in hopes of leadership roles (half promises)?

1jkywwa,"Job offer midst applications, do I take the slightly lower salary?","I am in my final year at university and I am currently in the midst of applications for graduates schemes and jobs. I was lucky enough to receive an offer for a sales/marketing role, where I managed to negotiate the highest salary within the salary range on the application. I received this offer a few days ago however I have also applied to many other schemes and jobs before interviewing for that role. Some of these places that I applied for are progressing me through stages and one particular company has offered me an assessment centre. The company that offered me the assessment centre as well as some of my other choices have a salary which is quite a bit higher (around 3k more, increasing yoy through the scheme) than for the role that I managed to obtain. My problem is that I don‚Äôt know whether to continue with these other applications whilst still accepting the role for the job offer I received as I have to sign a contract this week. The team for the company that offered me the role seem amazing and the job itself seems really interesting. This has really been playing on mind ever since I got the offer. I don‚Äôt want to let the employer down as they are an established but still upcoming company, and I know they didn‚Äôt interview many people so if I declined the offer after accepting they might struggle to find a replacement. Whereas these other roles seem more demanding and come alongside an additional qualification that I will need to sit which I know is great but workload wise seems intense and not as fun. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I prioritise the money or do I prioritise doing something that I think I will really enjoy? I don‚Äôt want to let anyone down or waste anyone‚Äôs time, but this is so much to consider.

They'll teach me the fundamentals from Graphic design, motion graphics, UI/UX, Animation and VFX, along with Design with AI which they have recently updated in their curriculum where they basically teach you how to use AI tools in design.

Other benefits include: 
1) placement
2) Adobe lifetime student version

Softwares are all the softwares from ps, illustrator, Xd and figma, premier pro, AE, InDesign, Maya etc 

I'm 21, I am committed to learn. I'm thinking. I'm thinking of commiting only to motion graphics and UI/UX. Other are just going to be add-ons. To be honest, I find interesting in all, that's why it's a pain in the ass. 

I talked to my friends, one told you'll get a good view on what field you want to get into by learning all. Other friend told me it's a huge loan to take in this age. 

I'm already working in a startup which is giving me an average pay. And it's a student loan with 9% interest..

1jkxso4,What do I do,"I'm not quite sure about what degree or job I should pursue. For context, the part of my family I know is mostly apart of the medical field and I've never had any real passion for anything. My mother wanted me to follow in her footsteps and become a nurse and I thought it's a nice thing to be one for people so that was my vision for what I'd be throughout my childhood. 

Fast forward to now, all my life everything academic wise mostly came naturally to me and I would only do some light studying. It was not always smooth sailing, and I'd clear classes with a low C or something but I would get by and I felt like that would be how it would have been until getting my degree. However, as I am taking anatomy, I'm staring down the barrel of a giant F. At first, I was treating just like any other class that I've taken before, but after getting a F on my first exam, I decided to try to study more and actually take the class much more seriously than others. Second exam rolls around and it's the same result. Tomorrow morning I will walk into that class and take my midterm and as I review my notes and work, I know I'm screwed. 

For the first time, I'm second guessing my decision to pursue this path since if I can't handle anatomy, I doubt I have the academic prowess tocomplete other prereqs like physio and what comes after since it's likely only uphill from here. But, again, I have no passions and don't really know what I would go for. I'm in an asian family and while they aren't as strict as the stereotypes, when I brought this up with them they said still want me to do something that is successful enough (basically a high paying job) that I live a comfortable life, otherwise I'd be an embarassment and disowned.   
  
Everyone I've opened up to hasn't gave good advice; friends respond with the equivalent of ""that's crazy,"" girlfriend says to just move out of state and live off minimum wage like her (I feel like this option is out of the question rn due to a sense of disappointing my family), family says it's my problem. I feel so inexperienced and like a child acting like an adult and really need advice. 

Also, I don't know if this would help in decision of a career, but I currently work as an amazon associate that stows packages in bags and drags these 30 Ibish bags across a warehouse. I honestly wouldn't mind much working a job like this for the rest of my life if it was slightly less labor intensive and wasn't completely mindless.

1jkwocy,Classes might conflict with job. Seeking feedback.,"Trying to make this as anonymous as possible, good chance the person involved in this will see this. I work remote and was told no travel at hire, but apparently this year they‚Äôve decided *maybe* we will travel some with little to no notice, but it would be highly infrequent. Right now it‚Äôs almost exclusively for senior managers and up, of which I am not.  Regardless, I‚Äôm fine with this generally. 

I‚Äôve been taking paid classes at a local art institute. Basically a college course without the hassle of enrolling as a student fully. Not to quit my job, but it‚Äôs a lifelong passion that I have time and money to pursue again. The next tier of my course is 8 weeks long and on Mondays only after work hours (6:30-9:30pm when I work 8-5pm). I want to sign up, but my manager is implying I shouldn‚Äôt (manager is someone I know outside of work and already knew about the art classes, we‚Äôre in the same close circles. It was unavoidable). The issue is they said it‚Äôs a bad look if I just happen to get asked to travel on a Monday, and I say no because I have art class for 8 weeks, even though at this time there is no travel planned for me whatsoever and it was not an expectation of my contract. I told them I‚Äôm likely taking the class, and I‚Äôm more than glad to travel Tuesday - Friday or even Saturday, just no Mondays.   I recognize my contract probably has a clause about ‚Äúother responsibilities to be added‚Äù or something to that effect. 

What‚Äôs bothering me is they‚Äôre saying all this on hypotheticals. They don‚Äôt want me taking this class because of this hypothetical maybe what if they ask me to travel, which would hold true for years. I spoke to another friend who‚Äôs a senior director with plenty of team management experience, their advice is take the class and put my manager on an aggressive info diet, and continually state Mondays for 8 weeks after hours are off limits, don‚Äôt say what the class is, but that I‚Äôd be happy to travel the rest of the week (which I am). The course is no makeups when dates are missed, and if you miss a day the remainder of the course is ruined as it builds. It‚Äôs a very strict schedule, and not cheap. 

Am I truly harming my career by furthering my hobby? I‚Äôve worked at companies for years where I didn‚Äôt do things due to the maybe I need to go somewhere what if. I missed out on a lot of life and don‚Äôt feel it was worth it, but looking to hear more advice outside of 2 people who are very close to me and biased in their own ways.

It's stressful and involves frequent out of state travel which gets really tiring. I've been offered a job in a new field that really interests me but pays $24 an hour. It's 100% remote with no travel and flexible hours. Health insurance and PTO are comparable. The new role also caps out at ~$70-80k, so I doubt I'll ever get back to 6 figures even with time.

I could afford to live on the lower salary between that and my husband's job (we have no children to worry about), but we would definitely have to scale back. I'm leaning towards turning it down because I can't imagine taking that much of a payout (especially since it took so long to get to that salary), but having a job that I actually might like is really making me second guess my decision.

1jkujls,Leaving my case management job with nothing lined up yet.,"I‚Äôm well aware that there are countless posts regarding this topic. I just want to explain my specific case. 

I work in human services, specifically case management, and have accrued just over 4 years of experience so far. I stayed at my first case management job for 3.5 years. Despite the challenges, I loved every second of the job thanks to having an unbelievably positive work environment and strong support system. My team dispersed over time but we all still remain friends. Unfortunately, this contributed to the spike in turnover at my agency with no priority to pursue new hires. My workload was quickly dialed to 11, inducing extreme burnout. I was even beginning to have panic attacks in my office which was a first for me. Needless to say, it was time to leave and so I did. 

I began my second case management job in October 2024, working remote through a much larger agency with a significant pay increase. However, I quickly saw a ton of red flags only within my first month on the job. From being expected to hit benchmarks that are triple that of my state‚Äôs requirements, carrying oversized caseloads, and receiving constant pushback from unsupportive/unprofessional supervisors and directors every time I try advocating for myself, I have already decided that this place just isn‚Äôt for me. Heck, two of my coworkers have already left despite starting the job only a month before me for these exact reasons. As you can guess, the turnover rate is atrocious. 

I‚Äôve been applying to different jobs left and right, some at other agencies, others with the county/state. I even received 1 offer already which I declined because I‚Äôd be taking a 17k pay-cut. 

I‚Äôm being as proactive as I can while I work on my escape plan. The problem is the burnout I‚Äôve been enduring has been escalating every month. My mental and physical health were already at an all time low coming into this job, only to realize that I jumped out of the kettle and into the fire just trying to better myself. Things are only getting worse. My hair is thinning, I‚Äôm becoming forgetful, a full nights sleep has been out of the question, I have less interest in my hobbies, etc. 

This is why I‚Äôve never been more tempted to just quit my job now or at least give a resignation notice despite having nothing lined up at the moment. The good news is that I still live at home and have well over a years worth of savings to my name. I‚Äôm just extremely torn.

And input/advice is greatly appreciated.

1jkuhbd,[Story] When You‚Äôre Next: Quiet Replacement in Tech,"
Not a rant. Just a breakdown of something I‚Äôve seen happen ‚Äî and eventually lived through.

At first, you notice someone you work closely with getting pulled from their main project. No announcement, no reason. Just‚Ä¶ shifted. Suddenly they‚Äôre working on something random and low-priority. Then comes a new person ‚Äî no experience, no context ‚Äî and somehow they take over.

You think, ‚ÄúWeird, but okay, org changes happen.‚Äù

Then it happens again. Another person. No feedback, no explanation.
You feel the tension start to build.

Then it‚Äôs your turn.

You‚Äôre removed from your core work. Promises of ‚Äúother projects soon‚Äù never materialize. Your responsibilities vanish. You‚Äôre still showing up ‚Äî but nobody really knows what you‚Äôre doing.
And leadership? They go quiet.

No conversations. No updates. Just enough vagueness to avoid accountability.
And eventually, someone else is quietly hired ‚Äî to do what you used to do.

What this taught me:
	‚Ä¢	Trust dies fast.
Once leadership‚Äôs words don‚Äôt match their actions, you stop listening.
	‚Ä¢	Turnover goes up.
Some people quit. Others get ‚Äúquietly replaced‚Äù ‚Äî like me.
	‚Ä¢	Reputation travels.
If you push people out quietly, they‚Äôll talk about it quietly. But they will talk.

And if anyone in management still thinks this tactic works, here‚Äôs where it leads:
	‚Ä¢	Evernote ‚Äî lost product vision after pushing out key people.
	‚Ä¢	Zynga ‚Äî bad communication + mass exits = product collapse.
	‚Ä¢	WeWork ‚Äî internal chaos, unclear leadership, public implosion.

Teams don‚Äôt fall apart because of one resignation.
They fall apart when people stop feeling safe.
When silence becomes policy ‚Äî people leave. And they remember.",DenseProgrammer1111,2,0.6700000166893005,0,1743044989,2025-03-27 03:09:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jkuhbd/story_when_youre_next_quiet_replacement_in_tech/,3,2025
1jkuext,Increased Responsibility: How to Approach the Salary Question,"I joined this new company at a manager level July 2024. My performance has been pretty good. I came aboard and hit the ground running, fully accepting new and transferred projects. At the end of last year when we were setting goals, my manager asked me if I‚Äôd be interested in managing people. I said yes. 

Well, last week, we posted a coordinator-level position that will be reporting to me. We hope to bring someone on in a few weeks. I also found out that I will inherit another coordinator because of changes with the current manager. I‚Äôm ok with that for the most part‚Ä¶ even though I was not expecting to be managing people so soon. 

Here‚Äôs my question. My manager and I will discuss my new year goals soon. How do I tactfully and professionally ask if the new responsibilities will bring on a salary increase? When I accepted the job, I didn‚Äôt factor in people management‚Ä¶ managing people is completely different than managing projects. Now I have three people to worry about rather than just me.

1jktl2e,How Can I Negotiate For Salary and/or Flexible Start Time (Remote)?,"Hi all! 

I was recently offered a Strategy Manager position at a fully remote startup for $120k (where the range listed is $120k - $130k). I also have an offer for a similar role at $135k/year, but I have a preference for this role/company. Both roles are largely project based, so they don't necessarily require me to be fully present during the entire workday, though there will likely be some meetings I'd need to attend regularly.

I'm in a bit of an unconventional situation, where I also accepted a baking role at a local bakery this week, where I'd need to be present from about 4am - 10am PST for a few days a week, at least for the next three months. After this, I'd expect to have earlier shifts (ending at 9am) more frequently, where I'd be more available during standard business hours. In any case, I'd have access to my phone/laptop for anything urgent during this time, but I can't take meetings. I'm firm on continuing with this role and doing corporate work after my shift.

I'm struggling with how to approach negotiating salary in the context of me needing some flexibility with start times. Should I offer to sign on the spot if they can accommodate my baking shifts, or is it reasonable to ask for both an increase to get closer to my other offer in addition? I don't want to push it, as I do genuinely want to make both roles work.

I'd appreciate any guidance!

1jkq449,Opinions on leaving a large company for a much smaller one,"Does anyone have any advice on leaving a large company (100+ people) to a much smaller one?

For context - I (30F) have been working at an extremely large Ad agency for around 8.5 years now. It‚Äôs been great for the most part - amazing coworkers, interesting work, hybrid work policies etc. However, I have only received two raises despite my asking every year, and I feel pressure to earn more to afford the city I live in. This is also my first and only job out of school, and lately have been feeling very stuck in my current role with not a lot of opportunities for growth.

I started job hunting and recently accepted a new job which seems great on paper and is offering me a lot more money. However, I learned they only have 4 full time employees including the owner. I am getting concerned this will be too dramatic of a change, both in the social aspects of work (leaving behind coworkers I really like) and the actual way of working having to take on more roles at once (no specified roles and less man power so I‚Äôm doing everything myself).

If anyone has any experience with this or advice, I would love to hear your opinions

1jkol1l,REALLY NEED YOUR ADVICE!!,"I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use any kind of advice. A while back, I applied to two jobs‚Äîone was a Technical Specialist position at Apple Retail, and the other was an amazing IT job. To my surprise, I got both offers. I started the IT job recently, and I absolutely love it. It feels like the perfect fit for me personally. My current routine and pay is exceptional.

However, I haven't started at Apple yet, and I‚Äôm really torn about whether to go through with it or rescind my position. The reason I applied to Apple was to have a fallback and to gain access to their internal job board, just in case the IT gig didn‚Äôt pan out. But now I‚Äôm realizing that taking both jobs would be a huge challenge for my schedule, especially as I‚Äôm still a student with classes to manage. (Albeit online program that is somewhat manageable)

If I do take the Apple position, I‚Äôd essentially be working seven days a week, earning good money, but sacrificing my personal life in the process. I‚Äôd even be coming home around 10:30 pm once on a weekday, and 9-5 on weekends, which really doesn‚Äôt sound sustainable to me. Plus, working in retail, especially at a place like Apple, comes with its own set of challenges and shenanigans.

On one hand, I feel guilty about letting go of an opportunity at Apple, especially since those positions are rare and highly sought after. On the other hand, I have a very real concern for my well-being and work-life balance.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do you navigate the pressure of amazing job offers while also trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle? I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights or advice you can share!

ALSO In two years I'm going to graduate with a bachelor's and master's and plan to apply to apple corporate. However, getting this apple retail position (technical specialist) is there any slight possibility this position could make it easier to get an interview/position at corporate? I eventually want to work as a vulnerability management operations engineer.

My point is, will working in apple retail give me access to advantages than just being an external candidate?

1jknjcn,How do you know if a job offer is good and when do you tell your boss?,"I'm a 30 year old woman, single and no kids, living in Canada, and have been working for the same company since I'm 16. As part of my job I have to communicate with people working in other branches located all over the country. Over the years some of these people and I have developped a friendship. Once in a while we were joking around about me either going to work for them or taking over their job. Until today. One of them proposed a job to me over the phone. At first I thought it wasn't serious like all the other times before, but he called me back a few hours later and said his boss would love to have me go work for them and that he would send me an offer. I need help. I've never had a job offer before. The only reason I've been working for this company is because a member of my family was working there.

  
If I accept that offer, I'd be moving on the other side of the country to work in another branch.



At what moment should I tell my current boss about it?



What should I look for in that job offer? What are the red and green flags? Like I said, I never had a job offer before. I don't know what to look for or even what it looks like. I'd love to go there, living in that part of the country would be my dream come true and that offer is giving me a reason to move away and leave my family behind.

1jknf03,How to tell my boss I'm working outside my job description?,"I was hired at a company about five months ago as the first person in their trucking department. It was on me to overhaul their current process and create a new way of handling trucking at this company. The company is seasonal with winters mostly off (I was working every other week) so I spent that time getting things figured out. For context, I work at a family owned business that has both an asphalt manufacturing plant and then a paving company. I was hired for the paving company. 

When I first started the job they didn't have much for me to do in regard to trucking so they gave me busy work that didn't have anything to do with my job description. For example, I was creating invoices for the customers that go to the plant (meaning I was doing work for the owners second business, not the one I was hired for). What's more is that I was also put in charge of payroll for that second company as well (and remember, im not an accounting or HR). And they also have me taking customers orders (for the second company) at a cash window. All of those things are not only not for the company I was hired for, but they also have nothing to do with what I was hired for. And mind you, they have a part time accountant for the asphalt plant, who takes care of the invoices on the 2 days she comes in, which only further confirms that theyve given me tasks they think are fit for an accountant.

Now a lot of these may seem small but the invoices take 3 hours to do and the window is a constant annoyance of me having to stop what im doing to take care of it. And the payroll is a confusing mess to me because I have never been trained to do payroll (and it's also very stressful to make sure everyone is getting their right pay amounts, plus or minus insurance, plus or minus PTO...). Payroll also comes with me calculating and entering taxes, monthly reviews, quarterly reviews (none of which I have been trained on). But now with Spring and the trucking about to take off I can't possibly imagine doing all of this work while also working through dispatching. They expect me to have a short turn around time for dispatch (>1min) which is doable unless im bogged down by all these other tasks. Or what if I have to be dispatching (trying to find an available truck, communicate, make a job for them...) and then a customer comes to the window? Even just today I was supposed to handle renewing some permits but I didn't even have time to look them over because I was so busy making invoices and taking customers at the window. It's all such a disaster and I never wanted to work as an accountant, I wanted to work in Logistics (which is what I was hired for).

I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow as a performance review so that would probably be a good time to discuss this, correct? I don't know how to say any of this so any advice would be appreciated. I just know if they keep having me do invoicing, payroll, taxes, checks, etc. I am going to have to find a new job. I really appreciate any advice, thank you!

1jkn8md,Reconsidering an Internal Offer Abroad,"

Hello everyone,

I recently declined an internal offer for a position abroad, primarily due to certain personal constraints‚Äîone of them being not having a driver‚Äôs license, which I felt could be a challenge in that specific location. However, after further reflection, I realize that this opportunity aligns perfectly with my career goals, and I would like to revisit my decision.

I am now exploring the possibility of reopening this discussion with my company. Given that my profile matches the role‚Äôs expectations and that I have taken steps to address my initial concerns, I would also like to negotiate the salary as part of this process.

For those who have been in a similar situation, do you have any advice on the best way to approach this request? Do you think it‚Äôs appropriate to bring up salary renegotiation at this stage?

Looking forward to your insights and experiences!

    ‚Ä¢Gross pay: 140k USD per year
    
    ‚Ä¢Perks: Relocation assistance and Green Card sponsorship

Both are in the same space/industry, which I‚Äôm really interested in. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs best for my future career, but I‚Äôm also hoping to find a partner and eventually get married.

Yerevan seems cool with its growing tech scene and lower cost of living, but I‚Äôm worried about the dating pool. San Juan and the US is tempting for future opportunities.

1jklkep,Are golden handcuffs real,"My career has seemingly hit a non-existent ceiling. I have been in the same position for the entirety of my professional career in corporate America(8 years), and have been with my current company for 3 years. My job title is currently the highest level I am able to progress to prior to moving into leadership. I love my job and have built a great career so far. Today, I work for a dream company that offers interesting work, a good workplace culture where you have work from home flexibility, using PTO is not frowned upon(unlimited PTO), amazingly inexpensive and effective benefits, and an actually competitive compensation.

The company is a conglomerate of brands that have been acquired and span a variety of industries, all centrally in the tech space. In my role, I work with the senior leadership team members within each organization. It is a great gig and I have taken away a lot of knowledge from my engagements with these executives. I have nice colleagues in my same job title with shared similar interests that I am able to collaborate with on work items and/or issues in addition to exchanging humorous banter, discuss the latest sports news, or to just simply bullshit and blow off steam. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I do have a strong relationship with my boss who is competent and takes interest in my career development.

Overall, everything is amazing and I am exactly where I want to be, right? Yes, but‚Ä¶ here is where the problem lies and it all comes crashing down. Because I experience all of these things at my job, and of course I don‚Äôt live in a vacuum, a large amount of those benefits are extended to everyone at my company. I look around my team and other teams(same job, different managers) and see people that have been here for 7, 10, some even 15+ years in the same exact position they started in. NOBODY LEAVES. It is true that the org structure is relatively flat and the nobody leaving part does include the managers, so for a leadership opportunity to open up in my group, one of the current managers would have to hit the lottery or die‚Ä¶ 

I have come to the unfortunate conclusion, and here‚Äôs to hanging on hope it is unfounded‚Ä¶ however, it t is my belief that if I want to progress my career into a leadership path, it may not necessarily happen at my current company as there are things outside of my control. It is a hard pill to swallow because I had audacious expectations for myself here and am regularly recognized as a high performer tasked with new initiatives and strategic projects that expand my scope.

I am at a crossroads because I don‚Äôt think the job market will be massively improving within the next 24months and even so, it would be near impossible to transition to a leadership position without the management experience. In parallel, if I were to take a lateral move somewhere in the hopes of springing forward, I am all but guaranteed to be taking a huge hit. I have heard from others and seen job posts located in my city for my same position at other companies looking to pay ‚âà30k+ LESS than what I make today. I cannot feasibly afford to take that kind of cut for my family.

And then finally there is the nagging question of: Is the devil you know(which isn‚Äôt terrible in all honesty), better than the one you don‚Äôt?

I don‚Äôt know the answer. I don‚Äôt know if I even want to know the answer or if came here just to vent. At the end of the day, the golden handcuffs feel very real and I wanted to just get it out there to see if anyone had any other experiences or advice they could share.

1jkke75,How do I get a simpler job?,"As someone who desires a simple life, I'm upset that life seems to be sticking me with more and more stressful jobs, with no apparent way out. Basically I've only worked in restaurants my whole life, the reason why is because kitchen work is the only thing I know how to do. It used to not be so bad when I only worked in small-scale places, but now small places don't want me anymore. I have enough experience, and from what I can tell, the small places prefer to hire people with less experience, so now the only places that'll take me are the bigger places. But now I've learned that the bigger places are too stressful for me to handle, I'm ready to get out now and go to another field.

The problem is, nobody else at all will even give me a chance. When I put in applications, foodservice jobs are the only ones that ever go anywhere, anything else I apply to dosen't even humor me with an interview. I kinda wanna just do some basic entry-level thing, but now that I have the experience in a specific field, I'm assuming that's what makes them not want me.

What I‚Äôve realized now is that most people (myself included) aren‚Äôt stuck because they‚Äôre underqualified.  
They‚Äôre stuck because they‚Äôre caught in **low-stakes indecision loops** that quietly drag for months.

* Debating whether to apply to a role
* Half-considering reaching out to someone
* Putting off a hard convo with a manager
* Delaying an obvious pivot because it‚Äôs uncomfortable

It doesn‚Äôt feel like failure.  
It feels like ‚Äúbeing thoughtful.‚Äù  
But really, it‚Äôs fear wearing a productive-looking disguise.

1jki9ue,CAREER ADVICE - PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTANT,"
**Context** :27M, working in public sector finance as an assistant finance manager for a council in London. My salary is ¬£50k per year. I am CIPFA accountant qualified. 

Recently I have been considering a career/job change. I became fully CIPFA qualified around a year ago (public sector focused accountancy qualification - forms part of the CCAB group). Since then I have been an assistant finance manager and have been involved in a lot of budget monitoring and forecasting work for a key area of the Council‚Äôs operations. 

While the work has challenged me in some ways, analysing trends, contributing to senior reports and meeting directors in the organisation, I feel like I am not working to my full potential. I regularly work fewer than my contracted hours where I can complete tasks quite quickly, and I no longer feel challenged. I am also very envious of the salaries I see people my age making in the private sector and wonder if I should pivot this way too. While I always thought ¬£50k seemed like a lot of money, the cost of living in London is so expensive that it isn‚Äôt going as far as I once thought.

I have considered the idea of completing the Google or IBM data analytics course on coursera, as a way of making myself more employable. I am not proficient with Python or SQL etc, but thought this might help me secure other opportunities when what most interests me about my job is the data and analysing trends on unit costs and demand for services. I wondered if there were any other skills that could help make me more attractive to employers.

I am not currently on LinkedIn, but I intend to get this in order to see what else is out there. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here could shed light on where they have had opportunities arise from LinkedIn.

*I suppose I had the following questions to anyone who might be able to help:*

1. **Has anyone transitioned from public sector to private sector financial roles, was it worth it and what would you recommend doing to prepare yourself to land these opportunities?**
2. For those still in the public sector, is there a way you managed to fast track promotions and move up the ladder? 
3. What else can I do to boost my CV and give myself the best chance for new job opportunities and job promotions elsewhere? 
4. How can I network and put myself out there to find opportunities/ be headhunted? 
5. How can I boost my income?
6. *Am I cooked? (Lol)*

1jkhk6q,"22 Year old accountant, Looking to change career paths","I just turned 22 and graduated from College in April of last year with a degree in accounting with a minor in finance and economics. I also got married to my now wife in July of the same year ( I know we are young thats a whole other story haha). After graduation I started working full time as an accounting at the business I interned at while in school. It pays a very competitive rate, with top of the market health coverage, employee owned so I can buy shares (dividend last year was 50%, usually around 30% YOY) and I have the ability to move up in the company if I stay for the long run. Plus I received a 10% raise and about a 5% of my salary bonus at year end. On paper it is the ideal job the one problem is I don‚Äôt enjoy accounting at all. In college I really found that I am a huge people person and I miss working a job where I can influence others and have a higher purpose other than the bottom line. 

This takes me to my current situation. I just interviewed for a job as an RD (resident director) at my alma mater and I am really excited about the opportunity. The one down side is it pays minimum wage. With the job though I would live on campus so no housing expenses, no gas, no utilities and so on and I would get a meal stipend. I built a budget and money wise it would be about a wash because we are paying a decent chunk for an apartment right now. Another bonus is I could get my masters degree for free while working full time in this role. 

My dilemma is I would be leaving a job that people stay at for life while taking a job that is arguably a huge career step backwards and not using my degree. I‚Äôm trying to decide if its worth it to explore my career options while I am young and try and find a new path forward with a masters degree or if I should just try and stick it out in my current role.

1jkh9my,Should I apologize to my manager?,"My manager typically is very laid back and constantly says she doesn‚Äôt micromanage. For context- there are no one on ones. Our team has a very informal culture where personal likes and dislikes and pets/families are openly discussed in meetings and teams chats. The schedule also is flexible with team members taking off an hour early or shifting things around a bit as they see fit.  
Anyways, I‚Äôm new-about 6months in. I logged in an hour early to my work for one day because I needed to leave an hour early for some personal things. It was a very last minute need and I didn‚Äôt communicate on time.  Just as I was about to send her an email- My manager demanded why I am changing my regular hours and that I need to let her know before hand. She called me out in the teams group chat with the rest of my colleagues instead of just privately messaging me. 
If she did regular check-ins she would know that I‚Äôve been dealing with some personal struggles. But all I did was shift my schedule over for one hour-I didn‚Äôt take off or not log in or not do my work. 
I‚Äôm so confused-is this one of those unwritten rules where managers says they don‚Äôt micromanage but that‚Äôs not actually the case. 
Anyways-should I send an apology email and let her know that I will be more mindful next time. Or is it just adding fuel to the fire? 
For context-I am a visible minority on this team and the manager is a white woman. I‚Äôve already experienced micro aggressions previously and need advice on navigating this.

1jkh0bv,Seeking an American dream job,"Hi! I am seeking a career path and have not been successful on finding one I feel is right for me. My husband and I have been married for 3.5 years and I have been a SAHW (now SAHM) ever since. However, things are getting really tough with inflation, especially with now having the cost of a little one. I would say I am semi-frugal with money, but the monthly expenses still drain our pockets. My husband and I are both very creative and I could see that providing some business opportunities possibly. Started a business or some type of entrepreneurship sounds like it would be just my cup of tea, tbh. However, a couple of obstacles #1 most gigs require money up front to get started, #2 I am an overthinker. But mostly the second. I have not been able to pin-point or pick the business type. I am not a gainst a company job, I just want it to be something I can still have a life outside of work and that has great pay. If I am to have a job, it won't be to put in 40 hrs a week and it only cover gas and food, I also want some for savings and also for spending. One thing that I should also mention, I want a job that feels meaningful, I have had some opportunities to be in sales(insurance), marketing, and other options with about the same income. Those types of jobs somehow make me feel that I am not genuinely myself and somehow feel I am taking advantage of others. Anyways, I would love to hear what other options are out there. I know there has to be some things that I have not yet considered. I have pondered being a real estate agent. Also, if anyone can think of other careers similar that require a simple certification or exam those would be great, too. Basically in and all jobs that would either be remote, or flexible for a SAHM send them my way, please.

Here is a little a bit about me for context. 
I am 33yo female and I live in Tennessee. I am bilingual in Spanish/English. As I mentioned earlier I am creative and to be more specific I sew, papercraft, and love DIYs. I have always loved fashion and have some dreams in that direction but have never pursued any of them. My husband and I live out in the country with a few animals and we both could see our selves getting more.

1jkgtqt,What to do? Im 22.,"I turned 22 3 days ago, I'm currently in college for IT Server Administration & Cybersecurity, I LOVE computers & these types of systems but I'm really not enjoying the classes. I feel like at the end of it if I stick with this I'll be in a situation where I've taken something that was just once a hobby & passion and turn it into a job & I'll end up hating it, spending time on my devices, and end up resenting my choice. 

I get really stressed out thinking about dropping this to go do something different as I feel there's this level of expectation assigned to me being in these classes from friends and family. I'm the computer guy! I cant just drop this, but I don't want to do this. I've always been very forthright with myself & tried my best to think about my choices, how they'd impact my future, if I'd really enjoy something, etc etc. This is one of the times where I wanted to try & see what it'd be like to learn this stuff in an organized structure, cisco, redhat academy, etc. But I'm just hating it. 

A part of me thinks ""maybe I should go into sales"" as I've always been really good at researching products, finding their pros/cons/appropriate use-cases for friends, family, coworkers, but that's just me loosely thinking about it

All this to say that I don't see myself continuing this path and want to ask what some of you who might've gone through something similar did in this scenario.

1jkgsme,"New job, should I express frustrations?","I started a new job a little over a week ago and I have a few frustrations that I‚Äôm trying to decide if I should air. 

TLDR new jobs communication sucks and is wasting time, should I bitch about it? 

1. The training is absurdly long. I‚Äôve spent a week doing things that could have been learned in a day. 
2. I‚Äôve been learning this process and found out yesterday I won‚Äôt even be doing this at all, they just want me to know the ‚Äúcore workflow‚Äù. Meaning I spent an inordinately long time learning an easy process I won‚Äôt even do. 
3. Which leads to‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what my actual job is supposed to be. I thought I was hired on to do a certain process but yesterday a team lead made the comment that I won‚Äôt be doing that and I‚Äôll be doing something much more complex (Edit - I‚Äôm qualified to do this work but not paid anywhere near enough.) 

Why this even matters:
I was hired in a different time zone than the rest of the team. This is in my contract and my manager is well aware. I agreed to do a one month period (verbal, not in writing) in their time zone to train and shadow. I‚Äôm nearly 2 weeks in and don‚Äôt know what my job *is*, let alone when I‚Äôm going to be out of training/shadowing (I was supposed to be done with training this week). 

Why I‚Äôm not sure if I should care:
This job was the first offer I received after over a year of applying and I took it as a bridge while I worked on something more in line with my background and goals. I never planned to stay longer than a year but will be working on closing that gap obviously because this place is loaded with red flags. I‚Äôm in last round talks with my dream job and if an offer comes there I will be gone within a month, but I obviously don‚Äôt want to count on that. 

So the questions:
1. Should I bring up these frustrations?
2. Who should I speak to? Trainer? Team lead? Manager?

Currently interviewing at Twilio and the chances of getting selected here are more and major reason to consider twilio is remote work.
Getting an offer from twilio might take some time but my joining date at tide is approaching pls suggest what should i do ?

If i join tide and later get an offer from twilio it will be a problem in bgv if this tide company mentions the same in pf contribution.

One of my frds suggested to take risk but i m not agreeing as in this job market taking risk is very bad.

Others frds are asking to join tide and then resign once i get a offer from twilio and they say this wont be a problem. Other suggestion they gave is about asking tide to move the joining date further.

I told my recruiter at twilio that my notice period is of 30 days but if u need to fill this role faster i can buy it out at revolut as well.

1jkg5ma,No idea which path to follow next (studies/career),"
(This will be kind of long. Sorry about that! I hope this is the right subreddit for it)

Hi!

I'm (19F) an English BA major, and I'll graduate a year from now. I have no idea what I want to do with my degree.

I'm studying in France, and I'm not even sure if the degree is equivalent to the American ones. Our curriculum covers a lot: American and British civilization (which includes social and demographic trends, history, politics, economics, and culture), American and British literature, grammar, phonetics, discourse analysis, oral expression classes, etc. I don't really love it because I'm not learning a lot, and I get bored. However, I do enjoy the American Civilisation course; and the oral expression one as well because we get to discuss a lot of topics and debate on it.

Honestly, I chose this degree because I had to go to college and had no idea what I wanted to do. My thought process was basically: ""You like history, you like reading, you like debates, and critical thinking ‚Äî even when watching shows. So why not?""

It's been five years, and I still can't figure out what I want to do with my life. I genuinely have the ambition and the need to know what I want and excel in it. I value storytelling (but I'm not a writer), advocacy, justice, practicality, individuality, and personal fulfillment.

But I'm also chronically ill, so I have to choose a job that'll grant me financial stability. That's why I thought about doing a BS in Nursing right after my English BA, and the upside would be that I could help people as well. Every day would be different, and I could afford to support myself. Maybe I'd finally get to settle down in New York (I know it's clich√©, but I really do love the city). But, I still have this fear of not being that carefree and creative person, and I'm scared of making the wrong choice.

It's just frustrating. Time feels like it's running out. I've been thinking about this for years, and honestly, it's kind of tiring.

Thank you for bearing with me. Any piece of advice would be greatly appreciated :)

i like history, english, political science and law (though i‚Äôm sure i wouldn‚Äôt like law school; i‚Äôm an introvert at heart) and all the research that ties into that. my dream was to work in a museum, law library, or archive, but i also liked the idea of working in a corporate office in a city.

I dug into the numbers and found that I had by far the most quotes sent 600+ vs my co workers 420 and 375.

I had the second best closing rate 25% the others were 29% and 16%. 

Granted with all this info, the other estimators most likely work on larger jobs, thus the quantity and closing rates variance.

People are gone so quickly. In the 1 year I have been here I have now had 4 different bosses, all with different titles and opinions. I was moved up to an interim-director role because my boss left without notice. They then made me interview for the director role after 4 months of doing the role. I went through the process and have not been told by the people I work with for over 2 weeks now if we are hiring someone outside, or I am continuing my role. It feels like my boss is currently doing my role, and any advances I try to take for the institution, I get told to hold off on. I am feeling stuck. There has been little to no transparency on what happens if I do not get the role. I asked about that in the interview process, and was told they had not yet discussed it.

Based on my convos I‚Äôve had with the new company, I really don‚Äôt foresee any issues and I‚Äôve already had many people from that company connect with me on LinkedIn, which tells me my name has been shared internally as a new starter. So I feel fairly confident about it all staying on track.

First, I thought that this is a nice gesture and that it is great to have an honest conversation about this topic, but then it got me thinking. Are they mentioning this to me because of people quitting the company due to the startup nature of it? Are they mentioning it, because the company lacks structure and is rather chaotic when it comes to precise roles?

A few years ago, I got laid off and struggled to find work, mostly because I was trying to pivot my career. I ended up pursuing a master‚Äôs degree and was able to land a contract job with the county government. This move was a gamble but I do think it paid off because for the first time in my career, I have multiple job offers. The problem is, I‚Äôm not sure which one to take because the state of the economy is so uncertain right now.  I'm also worried about the potential for AI to impact my employment in the future.

I consider myself a very ambitious person, and I think that if I really apply myself I can make the most out of the private sector job. After working in the county government, I have to say that I just don‚Äôt see myself enjoying the work. I know I can still make a good salary, but the environment is not the best. My heart wants me to bet on myself and take the corporate job, but my brain tells me to take the county job, which is the safe choice. I would really appreciate any help in making this decision.

Tldr: work drama might get me fired and I'm far too tired to do anything

My husband and I work assembly where they have ""quotas"" that 70% of the time can not be met due to one thing or another out of our control. We both have been here for almost a year and there are 2 coworkers that try to stir the pot and run to our supervisor whenever someone is not doing their job- mainly just not in their eyesight. The only reason I'm getting hella stressed about this is because my husband's brother just came to me and said their staring at me right now because ""i take long bathroom breaks and don't get anything done"". His brother was trying to say we need to pick someone to divert the attention to, but I don't know if I can even do that. 

One of these two should-have-been-cumstains will snap on anyone for the smallest of things as well. More so yelling and arguing and threatening, and has yelled at my husband for telling the coworker the piece of paper is right in front of him. He has been dragged to hr already for a different issue, and received no repercussions for threatening another coworker (all hear say, i unfortunately wasn't there for that). 

The other one will argue with our team leads and engineers that design the product so she can get her way, then when she doesn't she cries and goes to our supervisor and whines ""her wrist hurts"" so that she can go home and the rest of the team can pick up the slack. She mainly seems like the one behind all this crap but she can't be touched since she's our supervisors golden child with her record breaking numbers that she only got while stealing my products, and still whining I'm not getting good numbers. 

But none of this is happening to my husband, no nit picking, no snitching, nothing. If anything he's gotten far more praise and even a raise while I'm sitting in the dust. And he doesn't do anything too different either. I can keep up with those on the next step of assembly, and I've been essentially learning how to do that next step so of course I'm going to be a bit slower. If anything, I do need to use the restroom more because of my stomach issues. 

I've been debating going to hr about this but after seeing that nothing was done for the aggressivness, I doubt it will do anything except delay the inevitable. I know i can easily say right now that I would love to run them both through the muck but I dont think I have it in me.

I bought several properties and thought I had 10 years of savings but ive run through 80% of my cash, stocks, etc.    Now I‚Äôm cash poor and in debt about 50k mix of CC and loans.  My only wealth on paper is in my real estate equity.  Im making 3-4k a month scraping by with side hustles to cover the mortgage and bare minimum of bills‚Ä¶.i need to find a job soon or risk having to sell my last assets.  

I‚Äôve been doing serious soul searching, daily research on new careers, checking job listings but can‚Äôt find many options paying more than $20/hr‚Ä¶..I tried several business ventures and failed and can‚Äôt afford another gamble.  My Ba in history is worthless, I‚Äôm pushing 40 and have an unappealing resume and minor criminal history (no felonies).

My friend has been working for New York term life insurance and is doing very good making low six figures.  He‚Äôs been teaching me about the industry and offered me a chance to work remotely from home and earn $1200 commission for each client I can get signed up for the minimum plan which is $200/month for $150k in coverage with some cool features like 10k annual coverage increase, dividend investing, benefit sharing, cashback withdrawals, and things that sound pretty appealing, almost too good to be true.     Anyone work in this industry?   Is there something negative or predatory about selling term life insurance.     He says the hardest part is simply finding potential clients which is why I assume he‚Äôs offered me such appealing commissions.  I‚Äôve already started talking to friends and family offering a cut of my commission for referrals.  

Is life insurance a morally good product to be selling, I don‚Äôt want to be involved in predatory business that screws people over.  I hate pushy sales people, I hate the health and auto insurance industry because of how they raise rates while skimping and reducing coverage.   

My initial impression is that I think life insurance has a bad reputation because it looks beneficial to people.  It‚Äôs not like regular insurance where you get nothing back if you don‚Äôt file a claim.   The payments get invested long term which you can recoop in the future against the total policy coverage.   Why isn‚Äôt all insurance like this?   I would be thrillllled if my health and auto insurance premiums got added up over the years and invested for benefits and able to get cashback.   I have been doing research and genuinely think it‚Äôs a beneficial product that helps people invest in their future while providing important insurance in worst case scenario.  

It‚Äôs not just payouts for death, but coverage for disabilities as well.  So it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúyour family only gets paid if you croak‚Äù, but something you can see benefits while still alive.    Im thinking about starting a policy just to show my faith in the product and not be a hypocritical salesman.   Am I missing something?    Any good places for more information?   Thanks in advance!

Yesterday, we discussed the salary increase (which the CEO had already approved), the start date, the contract, and other details. They told me I could start working without needing an interview since I was already familiar with the job.

However, today, HR called me and said there was a miscommunication with the manager. Apparently, the manager actually wants to interview other candidates as well, including me, but the HR didn't discuss with the manager before contacting me.

1jk562t,"Late 30s Jack of All Trades needs to settle into a career, and I am adrift in an ocean of possibilities.  Anyone have a compass?","So to start this off, I‚Äôm 38, turn 39 late this year.¬† Live in SoCal but from New England.¬† Despite how the world is turning I still intend to own a home before too long, and to retire at a reasonable age.¬† I‚Äôve watched my parents hit their mid-60s and neither has any sort of retirement plan or assets, and with my time spent working in property management I am no stranger to how unlivable social security is on its own.¬† 

I've never been career minded, and while maybe I should have been, there's no turning back the clock.  So it‚Äôs time to pick a path here soon and start on down it.

My education: I got my bachelor‚Äôs in software development just as Covid started.  Basically felt I had to go to school for \*something\* and took a stab at it.¬† Got really interested in data science after taking the Google course out of curiosity and applied to a few masters programs 2 years ago only to find out that apparently my school was the lesser type of accredited (nationally, I think?) and got told by a few ‚Äúnicer‚Äù universities to ‚Äúcome back when you‚Äôve obtained a bachelor‚Äôs degree‚Äù.¬† Soured me from searching for a career and I just doubled down on being self employed.

I find SWE work‚Ä¶. Awful.¬† I work on a contract basis at the moment and have never disliked a job more, not even cleaning gyms.¬† It‚Äôs simply not at all for me.¬† Though for the very few hours I put in, it pays well.¬† I have a lapsed A+ certification as well for what it‚Äôs worth.

So here‚Äôs my current and previous work experience.¬† I‚Äôm currently doing vintage electronics repairs (as well as having others shop out microscopic soldering work to me), manage an apartment complex (including leasing, accounting, and vendor relations), and the aforementioned contract dev work.¬† Altogether it‚Äôs fairly low stress, I can bounce between things at will, and overall the pay‚Äôs pretty alright given what I save in rent/utilities.¬†¬†

Prior to this I‚Äôve repaired and flipped cars and motorcycles, installed windows, managed retail warehouses, done electronics repairs for various companies, and was a dog groomer for a while.  I can weld, solder, rebuild engines and transmissions, repair boat hulls, build decks, and a dozen other things.¬† I‚Äôve excelled at cobbling together a living without having to work for an employer directly for over a decade and it‚Äôs been really nice in its own way.

But I am tired of the grind.¬† I certainly don‚Äôt mind hard work at all, or even long hours, but I‚Äôd like work to be more defined.¬† I want to go in (or WFH),¬† work, and leave.¬† Right now I‚Äôm working sporadically throughout the day and in a way it‚Äôs all encompassing.¬† Along with the need to always have my head on a swivel to find more work.¬†¬†

Maybe that‚Äôs the bigger issue actually, even over a decade in and. having quite steady work I have never felt fully secure financially.¬† I‚Äôve just finished paying all my debt off (student loans, car, motorcycle, and credit card debt).¬† My bills rack up a whopping $530 a month, so I‚Äôm basically free at this point to do just about anything, as well as save drastically more than the average person.

The biggest problem is that my interests are vast, and while I am genuinely capable of going in just about any direction, I have absolutely no passion for work.¬† My passions are love and beauty and romance.¬† I‚Äôm never going to be defined by my career and I‚Äôm never going to sacrifice relationships and family for work.¬† Work is a means to an end, and if it‚Äôs interesting that‚Äôs a big plus.¬† 

So rate of pay (especially choosing an industry where market raises are reasonable and expected given how the economy is acting lately), fairly structured advancement, benefits, and hybrid or remote are my priorities, and basically in that order.¬† Anything I could do living in a LCOL area remote for a HCOL area employer gets a huge plus on my list.¬† Can buy a nice house on the lake in a state that actually has seasons for less than the 810 sq ft home across the street from me just sold for.



Things I‚Äôve thought are interesting, pay well enough, and are possibly worth pursuing already are:

\- Actuary - I‚Äôm decent at math and excel at standardized tests. I studied for the P exam before a couple sudden family deaths last year and was breezing through practice exams no problem.¬† I could go back to this with just a short refresher, I‚Äôm sure.

\- IT - isn't a huge interest, and I'm also not terribly into competing with all the displaced folks in our current environment as a complete newbie.  But maybe there's something there I'm not considering worthwhile.

\- Paralegal - potentially carry through to attorney while working as a paralegal, but I‚Äôm not sure of the value in it now, though it was a goal for HS me.¬† I‚Äôve actually applied for a local ABA certificate program, but it won't start until fall so I have plenty of time to consider other things.

\- Radiation technology - Seems interesting, pays well, almost everyone I know that isn‚Äôt in IT or real estate is in medicine.



Most of my other ideas inevitably become business ideas and throw me right back to having to grind to find work.¬† I‚Äôd also like something that doesn‚Äôt tie me to SoCal forever, so starting most businesses is ruled out right from the start.

The only thing I‚Äôm not likely to do well in is anything in a creative field.¬† I enjoy being creative but I couldn‚Äôt force it to save my life.

I would love to hear other people‚Äôs ideas and suggestions.

1jk4a7s,Considering a transition to Tech,"To try and keep this as short as possible, I am currently in a licensed clinical position in a government agency. My role is middle management with some supervision experience and several extra certifications. Generally put, I am well accomplished in this field. I am considering a switch to the tech industry due to the not so great changes in health care over the years mixed with the new government challenges. 

It seems the jobs are high paying and plentiful (despite a lot of lay offs and overseas outsourcing). Netflix is one place I have come across that sparked interest noting the more favorable employment packages when compared to healthcare.

I don‚Äôt want to go back into large amounts of debt for another degree and I am considering a degree in computer science from Western Governors Union (WGU). 
 
How plausible is it that I could land a remote and well paying (at least lower 6 figure) job right out of school with this scenario in tech?

1jk444n,"Recently Promoted After Intense Year of Extra Work, Supervisor Is Arguing to Downgrade My New Title","Been at company for 3+ years, 4+ years on current project (after working for a much more prestigious consulting firm). 

I was promoted recently with a modest salary increase after supervising direct report for ~7 months, though I have been a team lead for 2+ years. I am also a developer, with a Master's in Public Administration, and am matrixed across 3 teams, including the one I lead. In two of the three teams, I play a critical leadership role in which I am a senior developer in the one I don't lead. Lastly, I was introduced to business development and capture and conducted key research for our current contract, and my verbiage was used for over 40% of one of the most important white papers our project has ever written. Lastly, I've taken it up on myself to set up formal training sessions to onboard newcomers in a 40% project staffing increase, and teach ~15% of the total project staff the fundamentals of data science and programming, leveraging my former experience as a university professor for the same purpose. 

I was promoted to the title of ""Director of X"", which is exactly what I'd hoped for, and which captures much of the value I actually add. However, my supervisor, who is himself a director, said this decision by higher ups is a mistake, and that only contributors at his level or higher can be a ""Director"". Instead, he is arguing that I should simply have the title of ""Manager"", which seems reductive and petty, especially when titles cost next to nothing. 

I approached my supervisor asking that they reconsider at least giving me the title of ""Senior Manager"", but he says that because I have been managing direct reports for less than a year, my team lead experience aside, I wouldn't qualify, but I can get a title promotion within my pay grade over time. He seems almost offended. 

I want to leapfrog her and write directly to the higher ups who awarded me the title of ""Director"" and make a case, but don't want to step on toes. What should I do? Thoughts? 

**TL;DR: I was promoted for significant contributions and given a director title, but my supervisor wants to downgrade it to a manager title, which is reductionist for what I actually do/have done. He won't even go to bat for me for a senior manager title. Should I go directly to the higher ups who made the initial decision to award me the director position?**",anonymous_beaver_,1,1.0,19,1742964981,2025-03-26 04:56:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jk444n/recently_promoted_after_intense_year_of_extra/,3,2025

1jk2pjk,Fork in the road,"I need some advice. Or just a platform to layout my thoughts. I‚Äôve been in my line of work for almost 10 years. I left a really good job and joined a smaller company to help grow their commercial side of the business. I went to a training for a couple of days and that‚Äôs when I realized that I knew quite a bit. I started thinking that instead of putting so much effort into someone else‚Äôs commercial business starting from scratch, why not put those efforts starting my own business. Well, I started to get motivated and started a business plan and figuring how I could make it work, but then a really big company offered me a really good job. The first 2 years is just training as a sales associate. They pay your salary, business expenses, and even a potential for a bonus. But after year 3 you become a sales rep and you‚Äôre on your own to make your salary and then some. Essentially running my own business without owning it. If that makes sense. I like the idea of getting paid to gain knowledge, but if I want to start my own business, idk if I want to wait that long when I know I can still be successful.

1jk2dq8,What should I do next? (Psychology),"Hi everyone! I'm a 20F community college student who is graduating in May (yay)! It would be an exciting moment, however I've been given some pretty discouraging advice from my current advisor. 

You see, I've already taken on 12k of student debt (yes, from community college) and obviously, if I pursue a degree in psychology I have much more ahead of me. My plan has always been to get my masters in counseling psychology and eventually become a licensed therapist, but my advisor doesn't feel there's enough money in that line of work for it to be working + match the amount of debt I'll be in. So now, I'm very conflicted and upset, psychology has always been my biggest interest and passion, it's how I want to help people. So, I'm here to ask for advice, below I've gathered some questions and if any of them could be answered I'd appreciate greatly. Thank you.

1. For anyone who's already a licensed therapist/who's pursuing that and farther ahead than me, is it worth it? Whats the pay like? Do you wish you had done something differently?

2. For any psychiatrists/medical students on route to that, how hard is it? My advisor thinks I'm ""smart enough"" to go to medical school and become one, and I'm not opposed to it. I'm just scared that maybe I won't be cut out for it. Once again, what's the pay like? Please tell me out the job and if you regret it or not!

3. Is there a lot of oversaturation right now? I personally know maybe like ten current college students who are majoring in psychology looking to go to graduate school for it, and it worries me. Is this a field too many are pursuing? 

If I have anymore questions I'll add them, but for now I really just need insight and maybe to hear something hopeful. If anyone can offer me any sort of advice or tell me about their own career journey I'd love to hear, thank you!",sillysadgreengirl,1,1.0,1,1742958915,2025-03-26 03:15:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jk2dq8/what_should_i_do_next_psychology/,3,2025

I am currently at a job given to me by a family friend. Its a successfully  owned company with opportunity to grow, but I have no passion in this field whatsoever and frankly the money isnt good either. The growth seems slow but steady for those that work there. I have only worked there 4 months, but am having opportunities arise that aligns much closer with my career goals. The people that I work with care alot about me and my success at this company and the idea of quitting is really stressing me out. I feel like I owe them more time, or honesty. I hate ""lying"" when they bring up busy season is coming and I am ""going to learn so much"" and I feel like Im wasting their time when they train me and show me how to do certain things. I pretend to be excited but its unauthentic and they deserve better. 

  
I know this isnt my path, I am grateful for the opportunity, but I dont know how to go about this. The company is large and successful so the owner (family friend, and an amazing persin) isnt there often, so i dont know how to go about this whole process.

1jk11sc,I think I am doing two people‚Äôs jobs and I‚Äôm not sure how to bring this up,"I joined a team as an Analyst about 10 months ago to replace one guy who was on a team of three people (two Analysts, 1 part-timer). Shortly before or after this guy left, the part-timer got laid off and their work got divided between the two analyst positions. The other analyst was promoted to a lead after 10 years of being now the only analyst on the team. 

I thought I got hired to do the one Analyst‚Äôs job but I have over time come to realize that I think I am doing both the part-timer and the Analyst role I was hired for. Basically, the work that was supposed to be divided between me and the lead all falls entirely on me. The team inbox that we share might as well be my inbox only. And I have had multiple instances where I am trying to deal with an emergency situation (some of my tasks are high stakes/stress) and she tries directing me back to the team inbox to do ‚Äútraining‚Äù aka make me do the task that just came in two minutes ago myself while I‚Äôm already taking care of something.

It has gotten to the point that my manager is now asking about various projects with no deadline that have inevitably been shelved because I‚Äôve been swamped doing all of the team‚Äôs work by myself. And all of these tasks are so menial and inconsequential that while I complete them all, I receive no acknowledgement. I am in a job where I get barely any time to network or face-time with other teams. I thought about asking for a senior analyst promotion due to working both of these jobs simultaneously and also covering for the lead while she takes vacations, but I would likely have to stay there longer after getting that promotion and I don‚Äôt know if I can take it. I‚Äôm realizing that 
 I have found myself in a toxic work situation and need to get out before I hit the 2 year mark before it genuinely harms me. I am pretty young and yet I have become so bitter & jaded in the last few months. I feel like I have strong leadership capabilities and yet I‚Äôm not only getting shafted and used for tasks that no one cares about, that simultaneously don‚Äôt teach me anything for my professional development bc it‚Äôs literally just keying payments and data entry.

I have a performance review coming up and did not mention this in there in case I wanted to jump ship internally. Is there a way to bring this up to my boss? I understand that the lead is busy like I am but I don‚Äôt comprehend how I‚Äôm not supposed to be stressed and overwhelmed in this situation. 

I also understand that I am lower on the totem pole and have to earn my way up but the workload is literally putting so much stress on my body that I have had a physical and mental toll and the lead joking that I need to take vacations while she takes multiple vacations in a row, effectively leaving me the work of 3 people. The last time she took off of work I jeopardized my entire team because I lost a ton of money in one day, which my boss minimized and said wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Given that response from him, how the fuck do I bring this up? My boss is extremely laid back and does not want to be bothered but I also fear that he‚Äôs going to push back if I tell him that I have deduced that I am doing an abnormal workload because the team has become basically reliant upon me overworking myself to the point that I had to log in on my days off because the lead ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt‚Äù cover parts of my job.


Edit: also I feel like the worst part of my job is that between all of this work, I am simultaneously being hounded about menial tasks while in high stakes, high stress situations.

1jk0wz5,Coworkers Should Never Be Your Friends (5 Lessons I Learnt),"When I first started to work, I met a coworker who overshared everything within days of knowing me. Office gossip, people‚Äôs salaries, and even the manager‚Äôs personal life. She‚Äôd always ask what I thought, and I‚Äôd just nod and say, ‚ÄúMaybe they‚Äôre having a bad day‚Äù and I literally didn't know why she knew so many things. Turns out, her dad was friends with the manager. She flat-out told me not to tell anyone. Maybe my reaction was not what she expected, so she found a new work bestie. A month later, that girl got fired over something small. That was my first lesson: workplace friendships can be dangerous.

Now, five years into my career, I‚Äôve learned to balance professionalism with socializing without risking my peace. Here‚Äôs 5 things what actually works:

\- Be friendly, but never overshare. Let them think they know you, but never give them real ammo.

\- Mirror people‚Äôs energy - if they‚Äôre casual, be casual; if they‚Äôre professional, be professional.

\- Never say anything about a coworker you wouldn‚Äôt say to their face. It will come back to you. And if someone gossips to you, they‚Äôll gossip about you. Nod, smile, and change the subject.

\- Keep lunch conversations light. TV shows, food, vacations - safe topics only.

\- Be ‚Äúapproachable but forgettable‚Äù at work. Friendly, competent, but not someone people come to with drama.

But last year, I got a new job. My boss told me I was too quiet during our 1:1 meeting. Apparently, not participating in office gossip makes me stand out - and not in a good way. It‚Äôs frustrating. It was the reason I decided to change jobs again and I recently began working with a career coach. My coach recommended some books that made my mind clear. If you‚Äôre experiencing similar things, here are five books i found helpful:

**- ‚Äú**[**The 48 Laws of Power**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-48-laws-of-power-by-robert-greene/heart)**‚Äù by Robert Greene**

This book isn‚Äôt just a guide to power, it‚Äôs a survival manual for corporate life. that shows how manipulation works in professional settings. This book is classic and changed how I see people.

**- ‚Äú**[**The Laws of Human Nature**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-laws-of-human-nature-by-robert-greene/heart)**‚Äù by Robert Greene**

Another book by this author. This book talks about the psychology of ambition, envy, and manipulation. After reading it, you may never look at workplace interactions the same way again.

\-¬†**""**[**Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking**](https://www.befreed.ai/book/quiet-the-power-of-introverts-by-susan-cain)**"" by Susan Cain**

This book explores how our culture undervalues introverts and what we lose because of it and provides research-backed strategies for introverts to thrive without changing their fundamental nature. Worth reading it if you are an introvert.

**- ‚ÄúThe Mountain Is You‚Äù by Brianna Wiest**

If you struggle with over-explaining, people-pleasing, or taking things personally at work, you can definitely read into it. This book is about emotional intelligence and breaking self-sabotaging habits. Insanely good read.

**- ‚ÄúThe Charisma Myth‚Äù by Olivia Fox Cabane**

Say less, mean more. It‚Äôs all about presence, confidence, and learning to communicate with power.

Navigating workplace relationships is a skill. Be smart about who you trust, learn to read people, and never forget. Read, learn, and protect your energy:)",Deep_Jellyfish_8421,838,0.8299999833106995,126,1742954411,2025-03-26 02:00:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jk0wz5/coworkers_should_never_be_your_friends_5_lessons/,3,2025
1jk0jz7,How to use 1-on-1 with manager to share the work that I have been doing?,"I work in an agency and handle many clients. I do a lot of work that my manager is not privy to.  

And I have learnt that visibility is imp otherwise it seems that you are not doing any work.

How can I use the meeting to showcase all the work that I have been doing without it sounding just like a dump of everything I did, or becoming just one-sided info update without any discussion/conversation aspect to it? 

Do you use any good structures for your 1-on-1s that help you with this? Anything that helps you with making sure your manager knows all the awesome work that you do?

 How do I highlight any special tasks that I thought I really nailed or were really better in quality than what the company has been doing until now?

1jk09k6,Advice on pursuing a career transition into editorial writing?,"I have an MFA in Writing for Film and Television, and am thinking about making a career transition into editorial writing.

It's difficult landing editorial assistant positions, and wanted some feedback on how to break in this industry. Are there transferrable skills I can apply that can make me more marketable?

Basically call center with staggered hours. It's irritating. I'm over 4 years in but in the same position and hours. It wouldn't be a bad job, but I'm always having to train people and they never want to work. They don't want to take calls and that's the job. They get more money than I do and better hours. I'm tired and I am too open about how I feel. I can't hide anything or I'll explode. I'm wondering if all jobs are like this in an office? My boss says they're trying to work behind the scenes to find a new position for me but they always say that when I'm frustrated. It was supposed to be a position of growth but it's not. I'm stuck. 

Are they always like this? I have good numbers, my customers like me, I get things done and generally do a lot to help my team. I'm not perfect and I think being honest with my emotions betrays me, but I work hard to care and listen to my teammates for better and worse.

1jjyzac,Passed over for promotion for someone who doesn‚Äôt meet criteria - next steps? [UK],"I‚Äôll try to keep it brief. I‚Äôve been at my company (tech related) for 7 years in a few positions, 2 years in current post.

A senior version of my role was created, for the 3 of us on the ‚Äújunior‚Äù level to apply for. 1 of the 3 I know didn‚Äôt apply, leaving myself and 1 colleague to get the job.

Now, this other colleague has been in post for around 8 months. I have had to provide support and training for them over the last few months, to get them up to speed on various software platforms we build. I have done this as our previous line manager had left in February, so I figured to pick up this responsibility to demonstrate my ability to do the senior role.

This unofficial training continued right up to last week when the interviews were held. I also had to support and encourage them on speaking to clients to demonstrate our products - something I do regularly and was a requirement for the promotion available.

They‚Äôve been given the job over me following an interview. I‚Äôm incredibly confused how my manager has landed on this decision given the job description states a deep technical knowledge of all our platforms and the ability to manage key customer relationships.

I have a chat with my manager pencilled in for 2 days to discuss my interview feedback - am I looking at this the wrong way and should just begin searching for a new job?

1jjylzj,Does this affect my market value? And how much?,"I am currently working as a medical assistant for a urinary surgeons office. In this job I am mostly rooming for doctors, running UA's and preparing/sending out specimens for cultures, cytology, etc. BUT I do conduct bladder scans (a type of ultrasound) daily. 

I will be attending school to become a radiology technician in the fall, and will probably have to quit this job when clinicals start due to the conflicting schedule. That will only leave me with a year of experience at this current job. I do not plan to get into sonography when I graduate, I'd like to stay in Xray. I know that bladder scans are just one small piece of ultrasound technology, and it's only one year of experience, but I feel like it might be important enough experience with radiology to leverage my starting salary when I graduate.

 I'm planning to apply to the same parent company I work for currently (just not the urology office), using the same EPIC software system, and having worked with many of the doctors that will be ordering the xrays I may be performing. I will have (albeit limited) knowledge about what they are looking for in urology based xrays (KUB). Even if I don't end up securing a job with this same parent company, is this experience enough to leverage for a higher starting salary out of school? (Most other companys also use Epic).

In the interview, they asked me then to email my references as soon as possible. The second job I‚Äôve had I have no problem putting them done as a reference, loved working there, got along well with management, and ended my service there amicably. 

My first job is a bit more complicated, I worked there for 6 years from 12-18, and up until the very end, I was the star worker, always taking shifts, going above and beyond. Near the end of my employment there, the summer before college, I took a month off to study for exams and said I was leaving for a college in August. 

This is entirely my fault, but I was too scared to quit and assumed that they read between the lines that I wasent gonna return for a single month. It‚Äôs on me and I admit it, feel bad for it. Anyway the next month comes around and my employer asks me if I‚Äôm returning and I say no. They leave a passive aggressive comment on leaving behind a 2 weeks notice and I‚Äôve never heard from them since.  I worked under three bosses my time there

When I first went to school, I had no idea what I was going to do with my career so I ended up getting a BA in Business Administration with a 3.54 GPA (i didn‚Äôt like my major so I did not try hard enough).
I‚Äôve been working as an account for almost a year, but last year I read through an articles series called 80,000 hours that gave me perspective on my career. It made me realize I want to pursue a Masters in economics with background in CS to eventually work in Ai safety (and to have experience for other back up options). I am currently teaching myself programming and was planning on applying for econ Masters programs this fall but I don‚Äôt think this is a good approach considering my experience and grades.

My previous bachelors degree was paid for entirely. I currently don‚Äôt have any debt so I am open to going back to school. I was thinking of going back for a BS in econ with a minor in CS.

Is this a good approach considering my career goals? Is it too late for me to change my career and start all over? Should I instead continue on the path I am already on?

1jjxsuu,Feeling hopeless,"I just turned 46 y/o. I spent my whole adult life addicted to drugs/alcohol. I was able to get my LPN license in 2007 but it was revoked before I ever even got to work as a nurse. It was revoked because of a drug possession case. I lost all hope after that (lost custody of my daughter around the same time) and pretty much gave up on trying to get better. I've been clean (on methadone maintenance) since 8/2021. I just got my drivers license back. I work in a grocery store making peanuts as a cashier. It's not a liveable wage and if it weren't for my best friend allowing me to live with him rent-free since 2008, I'd be homeless. I have an extensive criminal background spanning from 1999 (that one never showed up when I applied for LPN school so I ran with it) and my last misdemeanor was a 2nd DUI that I caught in 2/2019. My last drug charge was in 2014. I have 11 misdemeanors, nothing violent, no thefts and nothing having to do with children. I've never held a job longer than 3 years and that 3 years is the retail job I have now. I worked in a call center for about 3.5 years a few years back but I got fired bc I relapsed and was nodding out on phone calls. I'm honestly feeling hopeless. I'm worried about my future. I cannot rely on my best friend to basically support me forever. He's 10 years older than me and if life goes the way life goes and I don't get hit by a bus tomorrow, I will likely outlive him due to the simple fact that he's 10 years older than me. I don't know what to do with my life. This job I have now...I''m basically maxed out salary-wise. I do NOT want a career in retail management because I see those people kill themselves in a salaried-wage position, putting in 55-60 hrs/week for $55k/year. I'm terrible at selling things. I can't get a CDL bc of my DUIs. I've thought maybe phlebotomy training or something like that but I'm finding out that they make close to what I'm already making as a grocery store cashier. If I could do ANYTHING, it would be to get my LPN back. Nursing is what I'm interested in. I'm solid in my recovery and I'm doing a slow taper off methadone because that is the ONLY way I'll ever get my LPN back. I spoke to the people at m state's nursing peer assistannce program and they told me that IF I can get off methadone and not get in any more trouble, I could apply to have my LPN reinstated. I would of course have to take my boards again since it's been so long but they did tell me that it's a possibility. But I know from the past when I've tried to get off methadone, I've always crashed and burned. The difference now though is that I'm highly motivated. I want to make something out of my life. I'm rambling now. I'll take any and all suggestions or advice that anyone has to offer. Aside from getting my LON back, does anyone have any advice for me?? TIA. Sorry this was so long but I wanted to create an accurately picture of what I'm working with and as I'm sure you can see, it's not much.

1jjx1lv,How to frame feedback about new hybrid work policy,"I'm in a very small office of 8 employees with a hybrid work policy. I'm in 4 days a week, WFH 1 day. Everyone else is in office 3 days, WFH 2 days. My schedule is specifically like this because I'm responsible for reception, but I get 1 WFH day the same day that a part-time person comes in to cover reception. You are not allowed to switch WFH days with in office days, so that everyone's WFH days stay consistent. If there's a mandatory event related to your position on your WFH day, you forfeit that WFH day. This is straightforward and makes sense to me.

They are now updating the WFH policy in a way that, from my perspective, unfairly forces employees to forfeit their WFH days. They're now saying the default of 2/3 or 4/1 must be adhered to even in light of vacation or being sick. 

So, for example, let's say your WFH days are Thursday and Friday. It's December and you catch that stomach bug from your 7 year old kid because it's flu season. You're out on sick leave Mon, Tues, Wed. You're feeling better on Thurs, but you now have to go work in person Thurs & Fri because you weren't physically in the office earlier in the week. 

This also applies to personal days and vacation. Another example: last month, I took a personal day to go support my father through day surgery. If this new policy had been in place, I would have lost my 1 WFH day that week because I needed to help a family member.

This policy seems unfair and could even be seen as punishing employees for being sick or having emergencies beyond their control happen. The rationale for it is that they want consistent staff presence in the office... but from my perspective, this counteracts the purpose of having set, unchangeable WFH days to begin with. 

For my position in particular, it also seems to counteract the express reason why I am WFH on 1 particular day. If I'm sick or take a personal day and then have to come in on my WFH day... there is already the part-timer there doing reception. In a way they've already told me there's no real reason for me to be in the office on this day, so it seems entirely arbitrary that I would have to come in to make up for another day in the week that I missed.

I'm the newest employee at this workplace (been there 4 months), and my probation is over (passed with flying colours and praise!), however I'm still not permanent (permanency comes after 12 consecutive months) so I'm not sure I am even in a position to provide feedback. I'm not worried that they would retaliate or punish me in a way, it's more that I have zero leverage at this job. But let's say I go ahead... how would you frame the feedback from my position?",tygertayl,1,1.0,0,1742943560,2025-03-25 22:59:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjx1lv/how_to_frame_feedback_about_new_hybrid_work_policy/,3,2025

My most recent job only lasted a year and half so just curious to hear people‚Äôs thoughts really.,Electronic-Hyena1920,77,0.8899999856948853,131,1742943502,2025-03-25 22:58:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjx0t0/what_is_the_acceptable_amount_of_time_to_remain/,3,2025
1jjwtat,Suspicious Job Offer?,"

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm really confused. I received a job offer yesterday from a company based in Toronto, and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think about it.

First of all, it‚Äôs not a job I applied for myself ‚Äî they reached out to me on LinkedIn, which is very rare (I just finished my Master‚Äôs degree this past December).

The person told me it was for a Data Scientist position, but then in the email I later saw it was actually for a Data Engineer role ‚Äî so that already seemed a bit strange. He wanted to discuss the opportunity with me. He messaged me on February 10, I only responded a month later on March 9 saying ‚Äúwhy not,‚Äù and he replied the same day and scheduled an interview.

I had the interview with him, and then HR contacted me to complete a technical test to be submitted the next day. The test came with a README file containing 5 questions I had to answer, as well as a JSON file with results from an ETL pipeline.

I submitted the test, and the next day they told me it was good. I then had a technical interview with a Data Engineer (I was really stressed ‚Äî it was my very first job interview, and I felt like I completely failed it, so I was surprised when he said he would recommend me to HR). After that, I had a third interview with the VP of Innovation. He asked me some theoretical analysis questions and told me it was good from his side.

Finally, I had a 15-minute interview with the company‚Äôs CEO, who asked general questions and told me the salary would be a fixed $60k for the first year. That seems really low to me ‚Äî I told him I was looking for something between $70k and $75k, and even then, my friends tell me that's still quite low. At the same time, I don‚Äôt have any experience as a Data Engineer, so I‚Äôm conflicted.

What worries me the most are the negative reviews on Indeed and Glassdoor. They say the work environment is toxic, poorly organized, and that the company doesn‚Äôt care about employee well-being. There are some positive reviews too, but most of them are from 2014 to 2017, with just a few more recent ones.

I‚Äôm currently in France. I have an engineering degree in computer science and a Master‚Äôs from the University of Sherbrooke. I‚Äôm not sure whether I want to start my career in France or in Canada (I was aiming more for Quebec), so I‚Äôve been open to opportunities. This job is fully remote anywhere in Canada, but even then, I‚Äôm not sure if working from home every day is a good or exhausting idea.

One last thing: I have very little self-confidence professionally. If I don‚Äôt like my work environment, I can‚Äôt force myself to stay. I‚Äôm afraid of going through all the steps to move from France to Canada and end up having a bad experience ‚Äî that the negative reviews might be right and that I would have moved for nothing. But at the same time, I‚Äôm also afraid of saying no and struggling to find another opportunity later, especially since the job market is tough, I have no experience yet, and I still lack confidence in my skills.

What do you think? Should I accept or not?

Thanks!",Feisty-Beautiful9019,0,0.5,1,1742942945,2025-03-25 22:49:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjwtat/suspicious_job_offer/,3,2025

I did email those uni‚Äôs that got back to me, to see if they could point out what was lacking in my application, for maybe reapplying next year, and have been doing a bit of job searching too (since I didn‚Äôt really expect to enter the workforce until I finish eduction) But i know a degree in urban studies doesn‚Äôt get you far without a masters in something.

1jjv6ya,Currently work in a restaurant. Advice on my thought process.,"Hello, this is my first post and probably my only one for a while. I will try to make it brief, but I have quite a bit of information to include to make the situation easier to understand. 

I work in a restaurant within London as a Barista/Bar Supervisor, and have been for the last year and a half (started Oct 2023). In July 2024, out of interest, I asked if I could become salaried, rather than paid by the hour. Surprisingly, they agreed. Now, I am quite naive as a person, and despite being almost 27, I don't have much experience in the work world in general. The reason this is relevant is because I asked for quite a low salary expectation for what my job usually gets paid. I asked for about 24-25k per year, not doing a background checks on similar salaries elsewhere. The manager, after discussing in the office with the owner, ended up offering me 28k instead. To keep it short, I laughingly asked why, and she said that it was to reward me for what I deserved for the work I've put in. I will leave it there for that part.

Fast forward, but also up until July 2024, where I got my raise, the restaurant has always been difficult to manage and deal with. The boss is extremely frugal, despite the restaurant being quite popular, which frequently causes a lot of issues, when it comes to working material, equipment, help and hours of work etc. Here are some issues:

\- Almost always, the feeling is that we are understaffed. If you are efficient, like any other place, more work will be placed on you, and many will be sent home early. From originally being someone who stays behind the coffee machine, I have eventually learned to do every position for FOH and BOH (except cooking ofc).

\- Almost everyday, I go past my shift end time, to about 30 minutes later, or I frequently do all the closing tasks alone because, for some reason, writing this EOD report takes 1 hour (but I know the managers just chill on Instagram and let me or someone else do all the closing tasks). I had a few days where I was the MOD for that day, and it came down to me to write the EOD report and whatnot. Believe it or not, I wrote it up in 5 minutes way in advance, and waited for past closing time to write it, as to not get told off for 'finishing' the day early. I never got told off that it was rushed, and I made sure it wasn't. As much as I believe managers have other things to do, they constantly lie to me about why they head to the office (usually to 'do the hours'), because they end up doing that exact thing the day after (seemingly like no progress was done the first time they said it).

\- To add to that part above, even if I write on the rota that I finished quite a bit later, my proceeding weeks don't get updated to have less hours to balance the month out. Another main point, which may be something that happens everywhere: the main general manager is always, and I mean always, late. They frequently tell me this via WhatsApp, rather than updating their rota to their usual arrival time. Frequently, they leave early as well, passing by me with their stuff on the way out asking if we are ready to leave (seriously?).

\- This is something that cannot be changed but provides a POV. The tips for this restaurant are shared in an odd way. Everyone receives tips at the end of the month, I believe based on your position, more than on how many tips were made on that day. What's the issue here: the previous other barista, who has roughly 20 years experience in hospitality, has shown greater skills than anyone in both FOH and BOH (and more than the managers who have roughly 2-3 years each in experience), gets roughly the same amount of tips as a part-time FOH who only works weekends. The amount? 8GBP of tips, for 1 month of work. Mind you, that previous barista was a full-time 40hours. Every workplace shares tips differently, I know, but it confuses me if this is a frugal situation, or if the managers amass the majority of tips for themselves.

I will proceed to my main thought at the moment. I would like to leave, because, as described by the previous barista of 20 years experience, this workplace is horrible and is poorly managed. He has managed to make us save a ton of money on monthly expenditures, thanks to the advice he has given us over his 5 months, but yet, has not been rewarded, or has not seen improvement. On our recent weekend day, in one year and a half, I almost felt like fainting towards the end of the day, with the fact that half the team was sent home, despite it still being busy and needing to prepare the closing down roles. At the same time, we had 3 people on their first shifts who required shadowing and being taught what to do. When they send people home early, they don't actually assign anyone else to cover that position being released, and so the restaurant starts becoming unorganized. These two managers start making their complementary weekend staff alcohol drink, while we are here rushing left and right to grab the reigns. I end up putting a quite frequent bad tone, where I don't talk to them or even respond back (this isn't the first time, and you can conclude why). A 19 year old girl, who works as FOH (and is actually leaving in a week), starts crying for all the weight that has now been put on her (this isn't the first time). Guess what she told me in private after the manager when to talk to her? She should consider talking to a doctor for anti-depression pills.

Here is what is stopping me from immediately giving my notice. I mentioned the salary to be 28k, but, based on my payslips, through the help of TRONC, I am apparently getting 30k per year (can confirm). I have also recently received a bonus on my monthly pay of 200GBP for hard work I put. My mother is suggesting, instead of closing the door and simply leaving, to try and talk to these managers, because she knows that if I leave, they would be in panic mode, and so I have leverage to reason with them in how to improve the situation. Mainly, how to avoid being so under stress and whatnot. However, she knows I want to leave anyways, but still pushes for me to discuss with those two. On this other side, I just had a trial shift at a coffee/bakery chain, where I was offered 30 minutes in a position as Team Leader/Supervisor for 14GBP per hour, which can increase to 15GBP at manager's discretion, depending on performance. I know it is quite a drop in money earned, but my rent is paid by my parents (their choice), and I split expenses with my girlfriend. I easily save and re-invest 400GBP every month into Vanguard anyways, so money has never been my drive, as you read from what I asked for my salary.

And sorry for making this so long. Another point to make is that my contract, while mentioning correctly my salary, start date etc. has wrong or misleading information. The minimum rest time between shifts of 11h has been frequently broken, sometimes closing for events at midnight, and starting again at 7:30AM. The operational hours written are incorrect by 4 hour difference. The 'Termination of Employment' section states that I need to consult the employee handbook for notice periods, but I was never given this to begin with. I have heard by word of mouth, that for my position, I would have a month notice period. However, through the gov.uk. website, I understand that the minimum is 1 week, and the employer is welcome to give more. I would give them 2 weeks max if I am able to. I don't quite understand who is correct and who isn't, but would like some advice on this part.

I know I should listen to my parents, but I also know that I would prefer to work in this other place, despite the lowered pay, because I can still live calmly without the extra money. I don't want to have to go through that fainting stress again. A big reason I don't want to stay is because I just don't agree with how things are carried out on a managerial standpoint within this restaurant. Even the owner, despite my lack of experience in hospitality, in my opinion, makes terrible decisions.

Please, do share your opinions and advice. You are welcome to ask questions to further understand the situation.",Riwser,0,0.5,0,1742938827,2025-03-25 21:40:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjv6ya/currently_work_in_a_restaurant_advice_on_my/,3,2025

1jjupbq,How do I know when/if I need to look for something else?,"Hey everyone. New account because lots of coworkers use reddit.

So! For context (being pretty vague) I'm a teacher, and I absolutely love what I do. I genuinely feel like I'm making a big difference in the lives of the kids I work with and am very proud of what I've helped them accomplish.

Recently, I've been doing a lot of thinking with my fianc√©e. We'll be married soon, and we've set several goals regarding what we want to do before kids and for preparing for having kids. During our talks, it became pretty obvious that my current career choice isn't very likely to help us get to our goals.

There's a chance (albeit small) that my income where I am now can increase decently eventually, but that's at least several years from now. 

My question is, at what point do I need to start looking into advancing my career for better pay and possibly have to give up something I enjoy? I'm sure I can find something else I like with my qualifications, but it won't be in the same field.

1jjttlh,"Should I raise any alarms about my coworker working excessive overtime, or is it fine if it is his choice?","I (M26) have a colleague (M26) who works from 8:30 to 21:30 daily with very few breaks. He is an easily stressed person, who tends to make every problem bigger than it is.

The workload at the company is large, yes, and we are under some relative pressure. However, it is not that this work needs that many hours, but that he is a very heavy perfectionist. He just wants to triple check everything 10 times before doing any step forward, and I actually sometimes avoid working with him because of how tedious and long a small task can become.

I sometimes wonder if it is correct (within the overall incorrectness of working unpaid overtime, but that is another topic) that he is allowed to extend his working hours this long on such a regular basis, or if someone should raise an alarm and put some more reasonable limits. I also wonder about whether it reflects any kind of issues around oneself, or if he is a perfectly mentally ok person who just likes to work a lot.

There is another person in the office who also works these hours and has the same kind of perfectionist approach. At the company, this kind of attitude is accepted and HR even once embraced in public.

1jjrain,The Truth About 'Passion Jobs' No One Talks About,"We‚Äôve all heard it: ""Do what you love, and you‚Äôll never work a day in your life."" But what happens when the job you‚Äôre passionate about doesn‚Äôt pay the bills? Or worse, burns you out?

I started out chasing my dream job, convinced it was the only path to happiness. I‚Äôd wake up excited, ready to give 110%, but soon realized that ‚Äúpassion‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always pay rent or provide a work-life balance. In fact, it can drain your energy, leave you underpaid, and lead to burnout when you‚Äôre constantly hustling but not making ends meet.

Here‚Äôs what I wish someone had told me earlier:

1. Passion ‚â† Paycheck: You can love what you do, but sometimes that‚Äôs not enough to secure a stable income. Find a balance between passion and practicality.

2. Set Boundaries: Passion projects are draining when they bleed into your personal life. Don‚Äôt let your enthusiasm hijack your well-being.

3. It‚Äôs OK to Pivot: Don‚Äôt feel like you have to stay in one lane because it‚Äôs your ""dream job."" Jobs evolve, and so do people. You‚Äôre allowed to change directions if something feels off.

4. Financial Freedom Feels Great: Passion is important, but financial stability and mental peace are crucial too. No job is worth losing sleep over.

1jjotjp,"I got a promotion from on operations level role to a strategy level role, but my pay increase was hidden from me until I got it","I'd been talking with my bosses about a promotion for months, and they agreed they wanted to see me progress etc. I moved from delivering elements of the strategy for our service to overseeing, writing and delivering it. 

They were cagey on pay when I asked, but they knew I expected 10% ish. 

I was on ~¬£27,800, and they've increased it to ~¬£28,600, which is a 3% increase. Am I right to be insulted by this? It's quite a big step up in work and responsibility. 

I work in the charity sector, which I know means I can't expect huge pay increases, but I was expecting to at least be on 30k for a strategy level job. Others at this workplace are on quite a bit more. 

I feel I've had the wool pulled over my eyes and been taken advantage of for not being aggressive about having the pay conversation ahead of time (which I tried to, but was told we wouldn't be having it). Any advice, insight or questions are welcome.

She has already gone through the interview process and she is now being told to proceed with the live scan, which she will have to pay $95 for out of her own pocket. Pretty standard. But she is not doing so well financially so to her, it's a lot of money. She is afraid it wouldn't be worth it regardless because she knows they will find a felony child neglect charge.
We live in a sober living environment next to the inpatient program we graduated from. She got the referral to the caregiver job from a counselor at our program so they know she's been through program and that she lives in an SLE and that she is working to turn her life around. What she would really like to know is if she should tell the employer what they will find in her background and attempt to explain her situation beforehand. To be clear: the child neglect charge is from before she went to program and she was still living in her addiction and she was caught driving under the influence with her children in the car. 
She would like to know if it would be worth it to even proceed or will she be rejected regardless?

1jjogtx,Advise for a young and early career college grad,"Hello all. I am 25M and recently engaged. I graduated Fall 2022 with a BS in Economics with average grades, no high profile internship. I was able to land a fairly well paying job out of college, but its customer service (inbound call center, no sales, almost all standard CS work or tech support) for a large financial institution. Paying 60-70k. The company paid for me to get my financial licenses (SIE, 7, 63) and I‚Äôve been here about 2 years, the direct management and coworkers are great/tolerable, but the corporate side has a ton of red tape and there‚Äôs not a lot of career growth in my current role. I was recently re-assigned to help another department ‚Äútemporarily‚Äù to help with tax season. The career opportunities on the internal job board are either way outside of my qualifications or part time teller locally, not much in between that makes sense to apply for. 

I am having trouble staying motivated to excel every day, and I can feel the burnout coming in as I continually spin my wheels. I‚Äôve been looking for a new job for about a year now, and I am having minimal luck. The only response / recruiters I get are for other customer service jobs, often doing more for less pay. I really, really want to move away from customer facing, hopefully towards doing an operations or analyst position. I really enjoyed statistics in college, and would love to continue using it and learning from my work. 

Currently I am in the process of interviewing for a position where I would help monitor an internal email box for a different company. Providing quotes, answering questions, etc for the sales team for the company. It would be at least a 10k pay cut. I do not have clear figures on what the pay would be, but the benefits are similar. This other company seemingly has much more room for my career growth and aspirations of data management. Also more opportunities for project work and possibility of OT and the ability to apply myself more. 

Currently I am self enrolled in the google data analysis essentials program through coursera to refresh my data skills. I am hoping that the certification at the end would help with pushing me in the right direction. I don‚Äôt want to do any more brain numbing customer service or tech support.  

What is my best course of action? Obviously I want to make more money but my current job is honestly negatively affecting my mental health and my sleep.

I know no job is perfect, but at times I feel the shortcoming of my job is they try to exist paradoxically at times. What I mean by that is there have been times that I have been told that something isn't in my job scope and I should stand down. Only for the same thing to creep up and me being asked to take care of it. I am telling myself that I'm being too narrow minded, but it does feel like a bit of whiplash at times. As if I'm having my chain yanked back and forth, depending on the way the wind is blowing. 

I think it bothers me more that it isn't me that is affected, but I look around at the talent that has left; been demoralized; or just mentally checked out whenever they would/could be great assets.

It seems as although my work is greatly appreciated and praised, I'm being criticized greatly by my boss on things that just aren't in the employee handbook but are rather her personal preferences. The first run in I had was about my hair, I'm black and I have my hair in a small fro. my boss, who is an older black woman, made a very uncomfortable remark about my hair and essentially suggested I see her stylist who ""handles natural hair"". Every year my church goes on a trip together in June, and we recently found out the dates. I'll admit, I should've probably mentioned this during the hiring process, but because I didn't have any concrete information, I didn't. My 90 day probationary period ends on June 3rd as stated by HR and I get my benefits which includes vacation time. I will only be out for two days and back the following Monday. My boss told me that she declined my request because I will still be in my 6 month probationary period and I should speak to my manager. I spoke to my manager and she mentioned that although HR has a 3 month probationary period, off the books, the boss has a 6 month probationary period she runs to see if I'll be a good fit for the marketing department. This threw me off and I realized she was rejecting my requested time off due to her imaginary extra 3 months of probation. My friends tell me I should go to HR since she's denying me the right to use my benefits, but I don't know if it's really worth making the fuss.

1jjn26q,UC Berkeley vs. University of Porto ‚Äì Which Master's Offers Better Career Prospects in Urban Planning?,"Hey¬†[r/](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/)careeradvice

I need some advice on a tough decision. I‚Äôve been accepted into two master‚Äôs programs in urban planning, and they offer very different paths:

\- Master of Urban Design (MUD) ‚Äì UC Berkeley (USA) ‚Äì \~$43,000 USD tuition (excluding living costs)

\- Master‚Äôs in Urban Planning and Design ‚Äì University of Porto (Portugal) ‚Äì \~‚Ç¨4,400 tuition for Brazilian students (also excluding living costs)

I‚Äôve saved $21,000 USD for my master‚Äôs, so if I go to Berkeley, I‚Äôd need to take out a loan.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm wondering:

1. Career Prospects & Salary ‚Äì Would a degree from UC Berkeley significantly boost my salary and job opportunities compared to the University of Porto? Would it open more doors in the US and possibly even in Europe? I‚Äôd love to know how much someone with a master‚Äôs in the field earns. If you're comfortable, please share your aproximate annual income!
2. Geographic Mobility ‚Äì If I study in Porto, would I still have good opportunities in higher-paying European countries, or would it be much harder to break into competitive job markets?
3. US vs. European Job Market\* ‚Äì Does the US have significantly more job opportunities for urban planners compared to Europe?
4. Personal Factor ‚Äì My girlfriend was also accepted into the University of Porto, meaning we could study together in Portugal. If I choose UC Berkeley, we‚Äôd spend at least a year apart, with her visiting when possible. Would the career advantages of Berkeley justify the financial burden and time apart?

Ultimately, the big question is: Would the financial investment in UC Berkeley pay off in the long run, or could I achieve similar international career prospects with the more affordable program in Porto?

I‚Äôd love to hear insights from those working in the field. Thanks!",Old-Librarian-4186,2,1.0,0,1742919022,2025-03-25 16:10:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjn26q/uc_berkeley_vs_university_of_porto_which_masters/,3,2025

1jjmx2l,Which career path to take?,"Hello Everyone,

I am 24 years old. I want to continue working on my bachelors degree. I am 4 classes away from an associates in arts and I am on my last class for a drafting certificate.

My education and some professional background:

In 2018 I was going to school full for a software engineering degree. Then covid hit and I found taking calculus 2 very difficult to take online. 

So I decided to try and get professional experience in the hopes to move up to a position I wanted. I got hired as a help desk technician for a MSP. Then I got hired as a school IT technician. Shortly after I got into a car accident and couldn't make the drive. I found work closer to where I lived for another MSP but was let go because I lacked certain training they were looking for.

For 2 months I was out of a job. I applied to every IT technician job possible but I didn't get a response. So I started applying to any job possible. I landed an interview for reviewing closet designs and creating CAD/CAM models to be submitted for production. I got the job.

2 weeks after I got the job at the closet company, I received a phone call for an Area IT technician job, that was better pay and I would receive a work truck. I scheduled an interview.

At the interview I was told how I will go to 1 store in my area for about 4 hours to fix IT issues as they arise then travel to the next store and stay for around 4 hours. The interview was at one of said stores. The interviewer explained to me how there is not really any upwards mobility and during the interview, employees of store were interrupting because they had IT issues. During the interview I realized how much I disliked doing the help desk role, so at the end of the interview I turned the offer.

At the closet company I realized I like doing CAD work to some degree and I was able to work out a deal with company, where they would pay for my drafting certificate from a community college. 

After a year and a half at the closet company, I started to look for a different job, due internal changes at the work place. I found an internship at a gas turbine manufacturing company and then landed the a full time job there. Since I do not have a degree, my role currently is a machinist/engineering assistant. I have learned to run machines for production, I create technical documentation for processes, and I have designed tooling for different processes.

I need of help to decide what  bachelors degree to pursue.

Option 1:
I pursue a degree in mechanical engineering. Once I complete the degree I can I have will have at least 2 to 3 years of engineering experience because I plan to stay with the current company until I finish the degree. I know I can find some enjoyment with this career but I don't feel very passionate about it.

Option 2:
I pursue a degree in cybersecurity. I find the cybersecurity field to be very interesting, even just talking about it or hearing about it. I feel fired up, but I don't know what will my day to day look like or how I will get a job since I will have minimal professional experience.

Do I go down the path of mechanical engineering because it feels more stable and concrete to me? Or do I go down the path of cybersecurity because I feel more passionate and excitement for it?

TL;DR
Should I get a degree in mechanical engineering because I have some experience with it? Should I get a degree in cybersecurity because I feel passionate about it without knowing how my day to day will be?",Rockstorm8232,1,1.0,2,1742918662,2025-03-25 16:04:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjmx2l/which_career_path_to_take/,3,2025

I‚Äôm about 10 months in to my first job since graduating college. Pretty data heavy, and people openly admit there is a high learning curve.

1jjk3fn,"If your boss is a creep, your dedication is just free labor","I‚Äôm guy from Mumbai and working a remote job as Brand Strategist that pays ‚Çπ35,000 per month. The agency started in 2018, and I joined in November 2024 as a Brand Strategist. On paper, my salary was mentioned as ‚Çπ35,000 with a quarterly bonus of ‚Çπ12,000.

To qualify for the quarterly bonus, I handled email campaigns, WordPress website updates, project proposals, and complete content planning for social media across six brands. I also managed timely deliveries. When I joined, there wasn‚Äôt even a proper system to maintain records or plan tasks‚Äîit was just a WhatsApp message from the copywriter in the morning, the graphic designer completing it by evening, and the SMM girl posting it the next day.

I created a structured content sheet, established processes, ensured content was prepared a week in advance, and managed everything efficiently.

In December, I was supposed to get a performance bonus, but I didn‚Äôt received till day. I was completely broke despite taking on multiple roles beyond my responsibilities. And here‚Äôs where things got frustrating‚Äî

The agency owner, a guy, hired a copywriter in December. She received her quarterly bonus on time after just completing February, without even requesting it, while I never got mine to this day. The twist? She arrives at work at 12:30, even though office hours are from 10 AM to 7 PM, and doesn‚Äôt do any work unless I remind her four times. I don‚Äôt have an issue with her personally‚Äîshe listens to me and behaves like a normal fresher.

But the real problem was the agency owner. He made me believe that people are so lustful they‚Äôd go to any lengths just for female attention. He praised her work when, in reality, I was the one doing it. And despite all my contributions, he accepted my resignation in one go.

Honestly, I‚Äôm glad I left that job and this creep of a boss. His agency is definitely going to suffer.

1jjjsgm,Should I mention my boss‚Äôs bullying behavior in my exit interview?,"So I (24F) am currently going through my last two weeks at my job. I do marketing at a nonprofit that has a little under 200 employees, and it is/was my first job post-college (I also completed my internship here, which is how I got the position). 

Our CEO is a great leader. Our CFO, which we‚Äôll call Angela‚Äìwho I directly report to‚Äìnot so much. The thing is, if Angela likes you, you‚Äôre golden. If she doesn‚Äôt, she‚Äôs a bully. I don‚Äôt think she feels too strongly about me either way, so I‚Äôve managed to go unscathed. But I‚Äôm really not okay with how she treats other people: She frequently engages in gossiping with one of my other coworkers, is very fake, and is one of the reasons I‚Äôm leaving. Our old offices were next to each other, so I‚Äôd hear her slam her phone down or berate people, most namely my one coworker, who we‚Äôll call Marie. 

The best way I can describe how my boss treats Marie is just straight up bullying. Like, will talk down to her like a child (or has yelled before), finds fault with everything she does, talks about her behind her back to other coworkers‚Äìthat sort of thing. I have stayed out of this mess and keep to myself, but a little while back I sort of befriend Marie and validated that the way she was being treated was completely not okay (she even broke down in tears). 

I think the reason Angela was able to act in such a way was because administration was split into two buildings, so the rest of leadership was in a separate facility. And when they‚Äôre around, she absolutely changes her personality and kisses the CEO‚Äôs ass. 

Now we‚Äôre all under one roof, and so the bullying has gotten less intense, but Marie has told me Angela waits till the rest of our leadership is not around to pick on her. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll go through with it, but Marie has talked about filing a work harassment case (sorry if that‚Äôs the wrong verbiage). I told her if I got an exit interview with the CEO‚Äìwho I‚Äôm on good terms with‚ÄìI would say something about Angela‚Äôs behavior, which Marie was very on board with (Looking back, I think I may have agreed to that too recklessly). However, my dad has advised me to NOT do this to ensure I leave on good terms, especially given that there‚Äôs a strong possibility they may use me on a contract/freelance basis in the future. 

Just this morning, I found out I will be having an exit interview with the CEO. I know it likely won‚Äôt change anything, but it also feels weird not saying anything knowing in any other context the overall consensus would probably be to speak up. (Also, for those who might be wondering, the reason Marie won‚Äôt just leave is because she‚Äôs at retirement age and is scared of not being able to find a job, and she can‚Äôt afford to retire at the moment.) I‚Äôm obviously fairly new to the workforce so I wanted to get everyone‚Äôs thoughts.

Like most artist, my other job experiences are mostly cleaning jobs that have nothing to do with media nor games. I am booked for a seasonal cleaning job so I'll be fine until autumn but I am just feeling directionless. 

I would like to find and land a proper job by the time I turn 30 and while I generally always liked going to school, I unfortunately cannot afford a new degree. I do have money to take courses though. So I came here to ask for recommendations on what to study and what types of positions would even be possible for me to attain without needing to get a second degree.

I would ideally like an office or a remote job‚Äî I am good at picking up new programs and generally willing to try new things. As long as the hours are reasonable I don't even need the pay to be above the minimum wage. 

So, does anyone have any ideas on what sort of positions I should look for and how I could potentially boost my chances of getting hired?

Hi all, I'm a fresh grad from Singapore with a data science and AI background and I just got offered a desk quant analyst role at squarepoint for a relatively lucrative offer.

I am in a huge dilemma with regards to whether I should take up the role. I don't think I enjoy data science/analytics a lot, and at the end of 2.5 to 3 years, you may get converted to a quant researcher, and in some rare cases, quant dev, otherwise you're let go from the company without conversion.

I heard that conversion rates are pretty low, and doing a basic reading I find myself more interested/inclined towards a quant dev role, as compared to quant research. I'm also really not super keen on finance.

1jjgnfa,Switching from office job to retail.,"M 25yo. Hey guys I need some advice. I've worked in Customer service for almost 3 years. This is basically my first job.

Last 2 months the company has transfer me and my coworkers to a different project (Still customer service). 

Long story short I decided to quit this position because of the current project management and my new supervisor is Soo toxic .

Currently I'm looking for a job but whenever I tried to apply for customer service job the bad experience from last 2 months makes me anxious. 

I'm thinking to take a break from office job / customer service for a couple months and work in retail. 

If I worked in retail will it affect my future in the next office related / customer service job I want to work? 

Do recruiter see the switch of my career as a setback?

1jjfr1w,"Would you quit your ""good"" job to work part-time in restaurants/cafes?","I‚Äôm 22 and a remote software engineer with a year of experience in the field. I graduated from a BootCamp, so I don‚Äôt have a degree or prior work experience before this. I‚Äôve always wanted to get a bachelor‚Äôs degree but couldn‚Äôt afford it. However, since I started working and saved up some money, along with a little help from my family (they are doing better financially now compared to when I graduated high school about 5 years ago), I‚Äôm in a position to pursue my degree. I recently moved to a European country to do just that while working remotely as a software engineer. I have a few exams I need to pass in the next few months to be accepted into a university here. My main problem is that I can‚Äôt study or prepare for the exams while working.

A bit more about my job: it‚Äôs very stressful and demanding, and I‚Äôm paid $15/hour (which was great in my home country, but not in Europe, where I could earn the same doing random jobs). I‚Äôm working 10-hour days with insane deadlines, and I absolutely hate it. In the past few weeks, I‚Äôve even received written warnings from my manager because I‚Äôm apparently not communicating enough. I had to work all weekend this week because there was a demo on Sunday(work days for some people in my team). The fun part? I was informed about the demo halfway through Thursday, so I had less than two workdays to prepare a whole new demo app. It wasn‚Äôt that difficult, but it was just poor management. And what happens if I don‚Äôt finish by the end of the day on Friday? I had to work on Saturday and most of Sunday to finish the demo (they literally had me do two rounds of changes). Not to mention, the time zone difference with my manager means I get messages at 1 a.m. asking for updates on this demo.

Okay, I think I‚Äôve overexplained why I hate this job. I do hate it, but it‚Äôs still engineering work, and I am learning. However, my ultimate goal is to study and get my degree, and I won‚Äôt be able to do that if I don‚Äôt pass my exams in the next few months‚Äîsomething I know I won‚Äôt be able to do if I‚Äôm working 10 hours a day, including weekends.

I‚Äôve saved up about two years' worth of living expenses, and a friend has offered to help me get a part-time job at the fast food restaurant they work at (only 4 hours a day, which is more than enough to cover my expenses, so my savings won‚Äôt be touched).

My main dilemma is: Is it okay to quit an engineering job for a fast-food job? I may not be able to find another eningeeirng job even after I am done with the exams and in university and have more time, I ma scared I will regret it.

1jjetc4,Return to old job or wait out new jobs?,"Hi everyone!

To give everyone a backstory‚Ä¶at the beginning of this month I recently started a new job, however I ended up having to resign after two weeks because of family issues and the commute.

I was considering going back to previous my job. The con of going back is that the pay is really low (but I get paid weekly), there‚Äôs no room for growth, and it‚Äôs kinda far (but not as far the one I just resigned from). However, this company and my boss was really understanding and accommodating since I am a student.  

I had 2 interviews last week for similar roles and I am currently waiting to hear back if I will be moving along the next stage of interviews, however I am worried that if I keep on waiting I will miss my window of opportunity to return to my old job before they hire someone else.

This decision has honestly been eating me alive since I resigned. I am currently not in a bad place financially, but I can already foresee having to touch my savings. 

I appreciate everyone‚Äôs comments and taking the time to read my post!

1jjeexd,Career Suggestions?,"Hello all! üëã‚ò∫Ô∏è


I'm new to reddit but this thread immediately caught my attention-I'm hoping for a wide variety of sincere career suggestions/advice. I'm a single mom of a little one, but he's in school and we have a great support system. My goal right now is to get full benefits with 80K (my last salary) &  into either a 9-5 M-F, or ideally- a remote/WFH position. Please-No recruitment agencies. Apologies if you're affiliated with one, I mean no offense, I just personally am not a fan of the disconnect there, and I prefer to speak with my employer directly and vice versa (just my personal preference/opinion) ü§ó

I want to save ASAP and be able to take care of my son without having to rely on anyone ever again. I'm recently out of a very...Stephen King level abusive relationship. My son is what finally made me snap to, was seeing him scared. Any and all directives are helpful.
I have been out of the working world until recently, I just took the first bartending job because that's all there is to do job wise -service industry- and I needed income immediately.
        I miss problem solving and using my brain and personality to move a project forward or help simplify it. I am great with people, I don't dislike bartending but the hours are awful, and I want to be home when my son is home-not asleep and then immediately getting ready to leave for work.
     I work better in a structured environment. My last, more ""career oriented"" jobs, were 2 years as a project coordinator for a metal fabrication company/2 years as an event coordinator for a company that did the audio&visual effects for big events, and a year as project coordinator for an energy storage system company (all of which I knew absolutely nothing about when I first started), and I was still able to contribute ideas to help simplify/streamline their day to day at each company, that are still being utilized to this day. 
Lol I mention all this because I don't necessarily have a particular field in mind...however I will say I don't miss the 9 million acronyms associated in the energy field-P.A.S.S. üòâ But I also don't mind not being completely familiar with a company and having to learn a new industry because I learned what each person did, how paperwork flowed from what to who, to and from the beginning/end of each project, asked a bunch of questions, and learned fast. Similar concepts are applied for any project, and definitely  communication. 
I was just wondering if anyone had any ideas, suggestions where I should apply? Or what field I should look into?  I've never NOT gotten a job that I've gotten the interview for, I'm familiar with Quickbooks, Office Suite, Autodesk, etc . 
So...any suggestions for a Remote/WFH Positions (ideally) or set office hours near Houston. 80K annual salary. Any directives are appreciated (lol aside from recruiting agencies-again sorry!) :)
Thank you to anyone commenting/reading I sincerely appreciate your timeüôè all the best to all the rest :)

1jje9kd,Urgent advice needed on quitting new job,"Desperately looking for advice. I started a new job last week and I really want to leave. I've thought about it a lot and know in my gut it's the right decision.

There are lots of reasons for this - firstly, I've realised it's not what I wanted and I've just been swept up in other people's expectations of me, secondly I've realised I'm a 'behind the scenes' person and this is a promotion which is more 'front of house' which does not play to either my strengths or desires, and thirdly in between accepting the job and starting, I've been told I have ME/CFS which will be made worse by exertion - new job involves travelling to the office 2hrs either way once a week plus business travel which is already exhausting me. I did know this was a possibility before I started but I'd been holding onto the hope my symptoms would be something else which was treatable. The new company doesn't know about this yet. I really believe I need to put my health first even if it means taking a step back in my career.

This is extra awkward though because I had previously worked with my manager in an old job, and she vouched for me when I applied for the job (in fact she encouraged me to apply but in hindsight I applied because I felt indirectly pressured by many different people). 

Also awkward because I'll need to go back to my old company and beg for my job back with my tail between my legs. They did say on three occasions, both 121 and publicly, that I'd be welcome back. However I didn't get on with my manager there. If I went back I wouldn't report into him, but it's him that I will need to have the conversation with which is what makes it awkward. I don't even know where to begin with what to say. I did enjoy the job and it worked really well in terms of managing my ME/CFS symptoms as I worked fully from home, I just got caught up in everyone in my life expecting me to get a promotion and advance my career. I wasn't actively looking for a new role. 

I have really bad brain fog and am struggling on how to frame these conversations. Do I only mention my health and not mention the other reasons to try and save face? Or should I be honest and lay all my cards out, accepting the embarrassment that comes with it? Any advice on how to handle each of the conversations HIGHLY appreciated.",_banana_brain,1,1.0,6,1742889608,2025-03-25 08:00:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jje9kd/urgent_advice_needed_on_quitting_new_job/,3,2025

1jjcczb,I need some advice on what to do next,"TLDR; Work policy changed, and I am afraid I might have to quit to focus on school

I will try to keep this as concise as possible. I have been working as a night-shift emergency department technician for over 6 months now. As a recent college graduate, I have been able to work a flexible full-time schedule thus far with no issues. However, I am enrolled in a graduate program beginning in May of this year and will need to drop down in hours at work as a result. This is where it gets complicated. At work, there WAS a policy where upon completion of 6 months of work as a full-time employee, technicians could request to change their status from full-time to PRN (per required need). As long as you sent your request in with enough time before the next schedule came out, it was easy to have your request approved. With this understanding, I sent in my request to drop to PRN by early May (before my classes begin). I sent my request on the morning of March 16th and still have not gotten a response. Today, I was blindsided. We received an email announcing a change in the policy, which stated that full-time employees would have to complete a YEAR of work before being able to drop to PRN rather than 6 months. Additionally, without written approval before March 20th, employees who have requested to drop to PRN are unable to do so. I am certain my email was deliberately ignored so that I would be unable to drop down in hours. I don't know what to do at this point. It's a great job in terms of experience, but it is not my end goal and it doesn't pay that well either. Still, I wanted to at least contribute what time I could, even if that wouldn't be full-time. I don't know what to do next. I think it would be hard to stay full-time or part-time once the fall semester starts. I take school very seriously and don't want to compromise my grades. I didn't want to quit, but after today, I feel frustrated and like management doesn't appreciate the effort that I have put in thus far. I am going to see how they respond to my request, but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets denied. Should I just stay full-time as long as I can and then quit? Or try to stay part-time while taking summer classes and quit come the fall semester? Any advice would be much appreciated.

The date they use to judge length of employment keeps getting pushed around, and I‚Äôm in a department that is notorious for not hiring often at all. Despite having perfect reviews for 5+ years and being extremely dedicated to my job and department, I have yet to be hired. (Hiring would come with benefits, better insurance, a $10+ raise, and a bigger annual bonus). The hiring process is completely anonymous, the department who sends out the hire letters only knows about my most recent reviews and my hire date. 

Lack of being hired combined with a high stress, toxic environment, physically demanding job, on top of being 6 months pregnant, has left me feeling like I‚Äôm at a dead end and need a change. I‚Äôve been unable to transfer to a new position internally because I don‚Äôt have a replacement for my position, and there has been little to no effort to find or train anyone. (A big factor being no one wants the job because of it being a high stress position with almost no reward).

What‚Äôs holding me back from quitting right now is just not knowing where I could go. I‚Äôve been at this job for the better part of my adult/working life and I‚Äôm not sure how many of my resume worthy skills are specific to this environment. I also do not have a degree. I‚Äôm willing to try almost anything I could find but I‚Äôm not sure where to start. If I can find a good job, the plan would be to put in my two weeks notice just before planned maternity leave and start my new position after. Ideally I would love to find something I could turn into an official career. 

Notable Skills -
-Forklift certified 5+ years
-Basic SAP knowledge in relation to manufacturing and warehouse inventory
-Leadership position held for 2+ years

Responsibilities include -
-communication (phone calls, emails, and verbally) between warehouses, logistics employees, and assembly employees on multiple shifts
-Maintaining parts for a moving assembly line 
-managing staff in dedicated areas, observing their progress, handling any issues with their assigned jobs
-Training new staff 
-Documentation of issues both on the floor and systematically, and suggesting solutions 

This is just the basics of what I do, I didn‚Äôt want to ramble too much. I‚Äôm happy to provide any additional information.

1jjbjxu,I am not sure what to do with my future and feeling stuck.,"I am 23m, and I am about to finish my bachelors in IT. I don‚Äôt feel as though I learned a lot from the course, as I am not a book learner, and that is the way the course was structured(read the book, take the test, pass the class) I also have seen and heard, whether true or not, that AI is taking over majority of the IT jobs as is. Throughout the course, I have even debated as to whether or not I would be truly happy in a field under IT. I know there are other fields I can get into with said degree, but searching the different possibilities usually becomes overwhelming or frustrating as some often show up, but are not truly compatible with the degree.

I currently work a pretty much dead end job in retail and don‚Äôt really have a life outside of work. Due to the schedule for the position I am in I don't even have set days off. Another issue is that within a 100 mile radius of me, it is currently higher paying than entry level IT jobs I could get without having to go to a city I absolutely have no desire to work/live/drive/be in for any reason. I am not opposed to relocating to a larger area, but it cannot be on the list of the top 10 most dangerous cities to live in the USA. I currently own a home on a mortgage, which I cannot beat my price or rate anywhere, but for a significantly higher paying career path I would be happier in, relocating would not be out of the question.¬†

TLDR: I am 23, about to finish my bachelors in IT, don‚Äôt know if I even want to move forward in IT, and am feeling lost as to where my future is headed.

1jjbiom,WWYD,"Need Some Perspective: Stick with Stability or Take the Risk?

I‚Äôve been working as a real estate admin for a while and am currently an EA for three execs while also handling office management for a real estate investment company. I make $80k base with a $20k bonus. It‚Äôs a love-hate relationship‚ÄîI like the job and the people, but I definitely feel undervalued. The earning potential is realistically capped at around $150k, and it takes up 10+ hours of my day because of a brutal 70-mile, 2-hour commute. It‚Äôs often chaos, there‚Äôs never enough time, but 95% of the time, I actually enjoy the work. I just wish I had more control over my income like the sales guys do.

Now, one of the agents I used to support has offered me a 1099 role as her assistant. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:
	‚Ä¢	Base pay: 5% of her commission (she made $800k last year).
	‚Ä¢	Deal splits: A percentage of deals. If she gives me a lead, we split 50/50.
	‚Ä¢	First 4 leads: 25% to her, then only 10% after that.
	‚Ä¢	Other responsibilities: Helping with marketing, meeting vendors, and possibly building a team together in the future.

The obvious downside? No guaranteed paycheck. But on the flip side:
- Uncapped earning potential.
- No daily commute. (I‚Äôd be working from home most of the time.)
- Better tax deductions.

I‚Äôve looked at this from every angle, and I keep going back and forth. I want to do it, but I have debt, a mortgage, and two kids. My husband makes decent money, so we‚Äôd make it work, but there would definitely be cutbacks‚Äîlots of them.

1jjb8bu,Internship completely destroyed any sense of confidence I had left,"Sorry for sounding like a little bitch but I just wanted to vent and possibly get some motivation on the next steps in my career.

I'm an engineering graduate who did an internship at a very small business for a few months in my final year of uni last year. I suffered from bad imposter syndrome the entire time, worrying my co-workers were talking shit about me. But I ultimately knew I was making progress and eventually became somewhat autonomous when they gave me tasks. 

The internship ended in August and my mentor assured me that I made good progress and that he would be open to offering me a job once I finish my course in December. Between that time a part of me was convincing me he was lying just to be nice but I still remained hopeful and motivated to finish my course to land the job. Once I officially finished my course in December, I sent them an email asking about any available positions. No response for a week. I then decided to send them a message through their website's contacting system. No response again. At this point I didn't even care if I got the job or not, I at least wanted them to let me know they didn't want to take me on and at least get some feedback. I decided to wait a couple weeks thinking they might be busy especially with holidays coming up. I then texted my mentor (which I get is probably a bit invasive but I was desperate for SOMETHING) and he texts back literally 2 minutes later saying something along the lines of ""sorry mate we've been busy, I'll let you know soon"".

It has now been 3 months since then and he never got back to me. It really bothers me that they seemingly ghosted me and didn't even have the respect to let me know they didn't want to take me on after working with them for months. This experience has completely destroyed the little confidence I had in the first place as it pretty much confirmed to me that little voice in my head telling me that I'm not good enough and they don't like me was actually true the entire time. By the end of the internship I felt much more confident than I did at the start, but after being literally ghosted by them, I feel the worst I've ever felt about myself in my life. I haven't bothered to look for jobs this entire time as I feel hopeless anyone would want to take me on after this experience.

Sorry about this mess of a post but this experience really messed with me and has resulted in me avoiding and pushing everyone in my life away. I get that the next step is to just start looking for jobs and to try again but I'm terrified of putting myself out there again.",Weary-Ad-640,2,1.0,2,1742876661,2025-03-25 04:24:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jjb8bu/internship_completely_destroyed_any_sense_of/,3,2025

1jj8b5q,How long should I stay at my high paying job before perusing my dream of being a pilot?,"Hey everyone, as the title says, I‚Äôm not sure how long to stay. Background‚Ä¶

-I‚Äôm 19 years old on track for $65-70K this year. 
-I live at home with no expenses and have about $35K saved up. 
-My college is fully paid for with a 529 plan, although it‚Äôs online and only costing me $20K! I can share how if anyone is interested. 
-Flight school near me will be about $70K
-I‚Äôm receiving about $40K cash from family for school
-This means I have access to $75K right now, basically the cost of flight school +/-

I know I‚Äôm in an outstanding position. I‚Äôm absolutely blessed and grateful for the family support I have, but also my current job too. Lots of hard work with luck of the draw has got me here. However, I feel burnt out already. It‚Äôs been GO GO GO since I was 15 years old working and then legally when able doing 25-30 hour weeks while in highschool as an A+ student athlete. After that, I‚Äôm now working 50-60 hours completely tired after work (the trades). If I didn‚Äôt work so hard in highschool maybe I wouldn‚Äôt feel this way. 

If I stay on this path for the next 4 years, I would have about 300K without any raises (although I could be making $100-150K by then) and I‚Äôd only be 23, but, that means I‚Äôve put off my dream of being a pilot four years. If the point of working hard for money is to enjoy life, why not enjoy life now while working towards a high paying career. 300K at 23 would be nice but if day to day life is the same then what‚Äôs the benefit? Financial security sure but I‚Äôm good with money I‚Äôll be fine in whatever job I‚Äôm at, live comfortable, retire early, blah blah blah. 

Im looking for opinions on when I should leave to pursue being a pilot. My current plan is to start my most basic pilot license (PPL) while staying at this job and then once that‚Äôs completed, it‚Äôll be paid for without dipping into my $35K or family money I‚Äôm getting, and then I can make the leap, or onto the next license. That‚Äôs just an idea but I‚Äôm just not sure how long I should take advantage of my current position. I know people would kill to be in my shoes right now. The hiring market isn‚Äôt great right now at the airlines, but seniority is key. I could theoretically work all 4 years and do my pilot training along the way, end up with maybe $225K at 23, all my pilot licenses and what not, maybe get hired at 25 Y/O after time building. Or I could leave right now and be hired at 22 or early 23 with $0 in savings. I guess that 225k could be made up easily with 3 years of earnings. Or I could do anything in between. Who knows. It‚Äôs worth noting that fitness and bodybuilding are very important to me. It‚Äôs hard to stick to that with a job in the trades, and I work around some nasty chemicals all day long it‚Äôs surely taking a toll. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it to be unhappy to the point in taking it out on my family, for money. Maybe I should focus on quality of life. I don‚Äôt know but I think enough has been said. I have the urge to just start enjoying life now and go to flight school because I know if I pursue being a pilot, even if I fail, I‚Äôll have my degree in finance at 22 when everyone else will, and I‚Äôll have life experience/adventure. However, it‚Äôs hard to pass up on that absolutely realistic 225-300K That‚Äôs a paid off home (ish), by 23, and then at 25 after hour building, starting a 100K+ yearly and multi million lifetime career at 25.

1jj7ol0,Should I accept this offer?,"Currently in a 50/50 split sales role. Been there multiple years, consistently landing right at 95-105% of the commission side of my total OTE. Confident in what I can sell and ultimately earn. Good manager, great work life balance, good benefits, I can run my business as I see fit and I‚Äôm not bothered much by anyone. Paid commission monthly. 

Got offered a new position, new company, 40% higher total OTE, also a 50/50 split. Offered a little stock, 10% of my OTE in value per year for 3 years. Collect on month 13, 25, 37. Hard to say how much of the commission portion I can earn consistently, especially as I ramp up. There is no ramp up pay, I asked. It‚Äôs a big company, going through change, maybe a little less job security but who knows. Unsure of work life balance until I start. Good benefits, same as what I have. Commission paid quarterly on a month delay so every 4 months. 

Would you switch companies for the above? I‚Äôm struggling with this one because I hit my goals, work balance is great (I have a young family) and if I‚Äôm pulling in less on the commissions the total % increase shrinks sizably.

1jj723i,Boss isn't happy with my progress in a new job,"I will try to make this brief. I just started a job this is my 3rd week and I was thrown into the field with little to no training. I am a payroll admin and every payroll person knows every company has their own policies and process. I wanted to learn the process however no one was patient enough to teach me due to the budget year ending and everyone was doing their own thing. Today I received this email from my boss. 

""I wanted to follow up on our conversation from earlier today regarding your progress. As we discussed, I had expected a stronger familiarity with ADP software and payroll processes based on your experience. However, I‚Äôve noticed that there seems to be a gap in understanding both ADP and fundamental payroll duties.

I‚Äôd like you to focus on the following over the next week:
	‚Ä¢	Spend time reviewing ADP‚Äôs training materials and help guides, as well as reading our employee handbook to familiarize yourself with our policies.
	‚Ä¢	Work closely with (person) to go through our payroll process step by step. This will give you a clearer understanding of how payroll is processed at our Club.
	‚Ä¢	Identify any areas where you feel you need further clarification, and we can discuss how to address them.

Let me know if you have any questions. I want to ensure you feel confident in your role and can perform your duties effectively.

We‚Äôll touch base again next week to assess progress.""

1jj6yc0,I regret my career and I'm kind of worried,"Sorry for the long post, it's my first one.

42m Supply chain professional with over 12 years of direct experience.

I have been working in supply chain most of my career. I was kind of forced into the field (the details of how aren't relevant at this point), I never liked it. I am good at it and I was able to do it in different industries, countries, scales, and degrees of complexity. I just really, really hate it. Always have.

  
It pays well (that's relative, I guess), but it's a thankless department with tremendous pressure. Usually, the entire company's functioning heavily depends on the supply chain department. It also requires a good amount of socializing and meeting with suppliers and colleagues. I'm an introvert and I hate that stuff. I hate having to be a phoney. I usually got along well with the blue collar employees, but we didn't work together, so I only saw them on breaks.

I've been at my current job for less than 6 months and I'm burnt out already. They appeared so professional and on top of things during the hiring process. They are almost non-existent online, so I didn't get much information when doing my due diligence. The pay was good too. As it turns out, this is hell hole. The employee turnover rate is over 200% per year and I'm not even exaggerating. The owners are a husband and wife who treat us all like unwanted houseguests. I think they believe they bought us like you buy a printer. They also have no formal education or work experience outside of the company they own. They got lucky during the pandemic and now think they're a Bezos/Musk hybrid. Meanwhile, the company is on a sharp decline and they are unwilling to address any pertinent issues and prefer focusing on micro-managing the daylights out of us.

  
I only have about 3-4 months of expenses saved (my father got cancer last year. My siblings and I spent a lot of money but he's cured as of January). I am single, with no rent, mortgage, or debt aside from a car payment.

  
My question: I only held the job before this one for 1 year. It was at a lead factory and I wasn't comfortable with the lead poisoning risk anymore. If I quit this job after less than 6 months am I effectively unemployable? Also, are there any jobs I can apply to with supply chain skills that aren't in supply chain?

I‚Äôm looking to level up my career ( I have no interest in becoming a manager) I just like to perform my best and earn my money.

Do I enjoy sales? No not really but I can tolerate it, believe it not I‚Äôm actually the opposite to most sales people (introverted, not really a people‚Äôs person etc) but I‚Äôm good enough to perform.

1jj6nil,Re-org setting me up for failure with unclear management structure,"I‚Äôve been in my field for 10 years across four companies and have always had strong, experienced managers‚Äîuntil now. Eight months ago, I started a new job with the same title as my previous role, but my manager is new to people management. She‚Äôs been in the same role for seven years with no promotions and is just one level above me.

This job has been a massive step back. Despite my experience and the job description stating I‚Äôd manage multiple brands, she actually manages them all. I have to run every email and asset through her, and she excludes me from 85% of stakeholder meetings and emails. It‚Äôs clear she struggles with delegation, likely because she hasn‚Äôt been recognized at the company. Three stakeholders have already bypassed her to tell me they‚Äôre frustrated‚Äîshe insists on reviewing everything, taking weeks to do so, even when I‚Äôve already provided same-day reviews.

Last week, a re-org stripped her of both direct reports, meaning I now report to the same manager she does. At first, I was hopeful, thinking I‚Äôd escape her micromanagement. Instead, I was told she‚Äôll still ""manage my day-to-day"" and relay my updates to my new manager. Worse, my new manager doesn‚Äôt want to be included in my project status emails‚Äîhe‚Äôll rely on her to communicate my work.

My two biggest concerns:

My former manager is power-hungry and doesn‚Äôt care about my career growth. If my new manager only hears about my work through her, he won‚Äôt see my strengths or accomplishments.
Her micromanagement is unbearable. I‚Äôve been waiting five weeks for her to review an ""urgent"" stakeholder request. My biweekly updates highlight her as the bottleneck, but since my new manager doesn‚Äôt want to be looped in, it may reflect poorly on me.
Am I overreacting, or is this a textbook way to stall someone‚Äôs career?

1jj43hp,sjould i leave my job?,"i (20m) am in a sales job (non commission) and i don‚Äôt know how if i should stay or leave. 

i‚Äôve been in this role for a few weeks. i love the people and the atmosphere. i‚Äôve never been in a workplace where everyone is so kind and helpful to eachother. we go out for meals often, hangout together outside of work, our meetings are fun (serious, but fun). most of my colleagues are very supportive and friendly. i really believe anyone would kill to be in a work environment like i do

but in this short space of time, i realised i‚Äôm not a salesman. i know it‚Äôs what i signed up for but the pressure and expectation to sell is really stressing me out and didn‚Äôt expect it. and i‚Äôm not a peoples person either. prior to this i worked in a warehouse and hadn‚Äôt really had a full on conversation with someone in years, now i‚Äôm expected to have ‚Äúnatural‚Äù conversations with customers and hang out with extraverted colleagues on an everyday basis. i‚Äôm genuinely mentally exhausted after every shift the amount of energy i put into talking and masking myself in normal conversations. add to the fact the demand is very high to drive sales and they are on me constantly. miss one thing or forget to mention one of the many criteria you HAVE to follow and the management team are down your throats. the training is really tough.

i‚Äôve made the mistake of leaving a job too early, and i don‚Äôt want to make that mistake again and regret it, but i just don‚Äôt want to be in a job where i‚Äôm not suited and don‚Äôt fit in. any advice?

1jj41pi,Contractor through agency to full time employee,"I'm currently working at a company for 6 months now through a recruiting agency as an Administrative Assistant making just under 43/hr. 

I get benefits through the agency but it's costing me around $300 a month as they pay a small percent of it. While the company i believe would pay 90%.

The contract I'm on is open ended and was supposed to end around December of last year, but the company exended. I really enjoy working at the company and they have expressed how I've been doing great when they extended me. I would like to become a full time employee directly with them in the best case scenerio.

The agency briefly mentioned on my start date that this could be possible, but nothing since.

What's the best way to go about this? I feel like 6 months is an appropriate amount of time, but I can't be too sure. Do I ask the agency to ask the company? Or do I ask my boss directly at the company?

1jj284o,Advice for New Professional Asking for Raise,"Recently graduated with my masters in a technical field, started 8 months ago at 115k.

Was hired as the 3rd employee in my role, with 2 senior employees who had 30 and 10 years of experience‚Äî4 months after I was brought on the 10 year experience employee was fired (HE problems and poor performance, I was doing 1.5-2x the work they were and they compared them to the ‚Äúnew grad‚Äù) constantly. As a result, the 30 year experience lead went to part time as well this last January. So we‚Äôve really had 1.5 total employees and I‚Äôve had to take on a lot more duties and do overtime. 

I‚Äôve been doing pretty consistent 45-48 hours weeks, some time on weekends inconsistently, and they‚Äôve shifted duties of my manager onto me (approval of new procedures and policies as I‚Äôm more familiar than the manager is). 

Recently, our company has been bought out and a new evaluation procedure has been implemented‚Äîaverage of 3% annual salary increases, with up to 5% based on performance. I know the employee who had 10 years experience was being paid 130-135k. 

During my annual evaluation in the next 2-3 months, do I wait to see if I‚Äôm given a full 5% increase, or even ask for an increase of around 8-9% to 125? We have a new grad that is being brought on later this year around that time, so it‚Äôd be me and the new grad, with the part time senior employee who plans to fully retire within the next year or so.

Additional hiring context: the job market is difficult to find employees in my field, most often is new grads. We live in a smaller city where there are no other companies doing what we do, so there‚Äôs no people who already live here to fill my position, but no other company I could go to for work.

TLDR: I‚Äôve been given extra responsibility, so I wait for standard annual increase at evaluation and counter offer, or if they give me the max just take that?",Peanutz_92,1,1.0,0,1742851026,2025-03-24 21:17:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jj284o/advice_for_new_professional_asking_for_raise/,3,2025

1jj15h0,"New Job Offer, Current Job Countered. Now what?","TLDR: Current job 150k plus paid benefits, New job 185k, 10k sign on/relocation bonus, 200k after 6 months employment, 16% bonus potential. Love current job, must relocate 2 hours away¬†for new job. Current job countered at 175k. More details in the long version. 

Need some feedback from internet strangers. Sorry for the long text.¬†Currently, I love my job, my boss, my team, we're all killing it. Because of this, I have garnered attention from competing firms and have turned down several offers over the past year. However, finally an offer came that is too good to ignore. Currently I make 150k, I have done my research, I certainly know I was well paid if not overpaid for the position and for the ""amount"" of work I do. I mean, I report directly to the CEO so it's not like I'm doing manual labor, just overseeing a department. But I've built the team and systems to a point that it runs itself and I spot check here and there. My medical, dental, and vision premiums are 100% covered, any dependents (spouse, kids) as well. My bonus last year was about 7.25%. Growth-wise, I'm pretty much at my ceiling as I have no expectations to be promoted to the CEO role here, nor would I be ready for that at this point. Been here 3 years, each year my merit raises were 15%, 5.5%, and then 7.5%. So my boss takes care of me, but as I mentioned, I've fixed a lot of crap here and brought this firm to decent notoriety in the industry. 

New job is located in a similar city but 2 hours away, so relocation would be necessary, offered 175k plus 10k sign on/relocation bonus which I turned down initially because my premiums wouldn't be covered, so the pay gap wasn't large enough to warrant a job switch. I told them I would need 200k to be worth it. So they came back at 185k, plus 10k relocation/sign on bonus, and a bump to 200k after 6 months of employment (no caveats), Up to 16% bonus based on certain attainable KPI's (4 items each equaling 4% each, 2 of them were pretty much freebies). HR confirmed average yearly increases have been 4 - 4.5%. There is potential for my growth ceiling to be higher as this firm is expanding and if I prove myself, I can probably talk the top brass into letting me oversee departments at both locations. This was not promised when I suggested it, but they were excited at my tenacity to gun for that position. The expansion probably won't be complete for two years, which I will be assisting in getting that up and running so they couldn't promise me the position at this time, but again, they were excited at the idea and my interest and did not rule out the possibility.

The logical business side of things, the new job is a larger firm, more money, bigger bonus, and even with paying my own benefit premiums, I still come out ahead financially. New location has a slightly lower cost of living. Title is slightly higher, for example, let's say I'm a Director now, I would be like ""Senior Director"", but basically the same responsibility. 

The emotional side of things, I would be moving 2 hours further away north from family who are about an hour south away and another about 2 hours west away currently. I did several interviews and a team outing with the leadership and I didn't sense any red flags. Everyone was accommodating and excited to have me join. But obviously, it's still an unknown as it is new territory. I gave my current boss the opportunity to counter, was hoping in my head for 180-185k to stay, but the highest he came back with was 175k. And he was very clear it would be water under the bridge and he feels it's worth the sacrifice to keep me here. WE would continue as if nothing happened, and despite what reddit may say, I can assure he means this and I trust it. 

Now, I know the reddit echo chamber is always saying never take the counter offer, but this is certainly a different scenario. I have a trust with my boss as he has stuck up for me in some situations where things could have gone south easily amongst other things. I did not apply for this new job, I was straight up stalked and poached. Like I said, I already knew I was fairly if not over compensated where I am currently, so I know I wasn't being taken advantage of. There are no other factors here that are making me want to leave. So it really just came down to more money and growth potential.¬†Looking for the thoughts of reddit strangers.",LordMonster,11,0.8700000047683716,54,1742848441,2025-03-24 20:34:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jj15h0/new_job_offer_current_job_countered_now_what/,3,2025

I took this, and was soon given an email that said ""Intent to offer"" and they were finalizing my offer.

Fast forward to October 2024, I was given a rejection email. Yet, my co-op was extended into 2025 to find a role for me. During this whole time I'm kept in the dark and not given many updates. I am given a new team and manager in 2025 due to my previous team being restructured.

Today I am told by my current manager there will not be a role for me moving forward. This comes as a surprise to me as I know my previous manager gave me good remarks. 

This obviously is gut wrenching as I was told for the past 7ish months I'd have a job offer. I was not doing any real external recruitment as I was told I'd get an offer, and they were actively working on an offer for me. 

My plan was to enter a part-time masters program while I worked full-time, and use my salary to pay for school.

I have a bachelor degree in a semi-specific topic. I love the outdoors, wildlife, livestock, and taking care of the one planet we all inhabit, but more than anything I enjoy helping people. Part of the reason I wanted to work for the feds in the first place is because I enjoy helping people and doing a job that serves a purpose. The agency I specifically worked for was very hands on out of the office in the field kind of job which I absolutely loved about it because being behind a desk 24/7 is not the kind of job I was looking for. Another big plus of working for the feds was steady growth in a career. I had planned on working with the agency until retirement, and those plans seem to be down the drain. Before I decided to go to college after high school my other choice that very much interested me was going to trade school (again don‚Äôt want to be stuck behind a desk 24/7). I personally think trade work is a great way of helping someone whether it be fixing an electrical problem, fixing their heating or cooling or making sure they have access to working water, showers, toilets etc. I‚Äôm now struggling to decide if I should go to trade school/find an apprenticeship to start a path that I was originally interested in if/when I am fired again.

I graduate next month and I have been actively applying to jobs. In my current profession, I make decent money for the job (higher than a lot of my peers, but still not enough to live comfortably), and, when it comes to job searching, I'm being picky in regards to pay rate, job title, and location. However, in my current job, I have been exposed to opportunities for growth within the company, and was recently offered a $0.50 raise that takes effect next month (basically, the more you learn and grow within the company is worth a $0.50 raise- I recently got certified to be a station trainer. If I'm certified to train on another station, then I get another raise, and this repeats until I reach supervisor or manager status). 

I graduate at the end of next month- I'm not super rushed to have a job by the time I graduate because I am already employed, and the starting salary is close to what I make now (give or take a dollar or two). But let's say I get an offer right after graduation while I'm still getting opportunities for growth at my current job. Should I take the new offer?

I‚Äôm in a really awkward situation at work right now and I don‚Äôt know how to proceed. I have recently changed direct managers but still have a standing one on one with my old manager, at his request. 

My old manager is a really negative and reactive guy and honestly our standing calls are not even remotely productive. They typically go over time and are just him ranting and venting. I have always had a good ish rapport with the guy even if he is really emotional and reactive.

There are a few reasons why I want to create distance:

- I‚Äôm not in the same department anymore so my role is completely different. He still expects me to do my old duties when there has been a new person hired to do them.

- He does not ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and I feel myself getting wrapped up in dramatic situations that could directly impact my career or reputation.

- I just genuinely do not have the time for unproductive calls.

How can I approach this without getting the guy fired or mad at me? ",Woopsied00dle,0,0.5,2,1742839771,2025-03-24 18:09:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jixfwl/i_need_to_create_distance_between_myself_and_my/,3,2025
1jixd6b,Took a Job I Hate and Want Out ASAP,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I‚Äôm at my wits end and I feel that I made a terrible choice. Desperately seeking advice and reassurance, my anxiety has been debilitating. 

I recently left a job I was at for two years due to a sudden position change that didn‚Äôt align with my career goals, combined with low morale and motivation across the company. I‚Äôve spent my entire 15-year career in the Organic CPG industry, primarily in supply chain, but I took a new role that‚Äôs more sales focused rather than operations. It‚Äôs been a month and I‚Äôm already feeling regretful‚Äîit‚Äôs low pay (for my experience and location), high stress, lacks training, and has little respect for personal time (e.g., coworkers pulling me into meetings even when I‚Äôm visibly in another one, expectation to be available during PTO).

I‚Äôm realizing this role isn‚Äôt a good fit, and I‚Äôd rather focus on systems and operations similar to my previous supply chain role. But I‚Äôm struggling with major concerns:

1. If I jump ship this soon, will it completely destroy my ability to stand out to new employers and grow my career?

2. The job market is incredibly over saturated. I don‚Äôt have a back up plan but I‚Äôm near a breaking point. If I left for a low-key part time job will this negatively impact me?

3. The person who helped push my resume through for my current job was my POC I worked with when I was in CPG procurement. I‚Äôm afraid to burn bridges and this company has their hands in the majority of organic/natural CPG brands. Did I just fuck my self completely? 

I should also note that the interview was really low-key and the description, expectations seemed a lot less brutal than what it is. My first week they were joking how I‚Äôd be drinking from a firehouse and have baptism by fire. This is considered an entry-level job but I took it because I thought the work from home coupled with the good reviews from the person that worked there would be a good fit and great way to grow my experience in the industry and provide flexibility. I felt pigeon holed and undervalued in my last role. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? Have you ever regretted taking a new job? How did you navigate it, and what personal or professional advice would you give?


TLDR; I took a new job that I hate and I don‚Äôt know what move to make now that I‚Äôm near my breaking point.

1jiwkoj,"I feel like my team don't understand what I am going through, and I get backlash for my performance.","I am a Graduate Software Engineer at a good company. We are a group of 15 new graduates that started working this year. We have 2 ongoing projects at the company. 1 project is the actual project that we have clients for and we need to work a minimum of 40 hours a work for the client (our hours are logged). Then the other project is a graduate project that we are working on after hours and it is run like a normal project with 2 week sprints and demos and everything. They put aside about 8 hours per week for this. Then in addition to this I am doing my post grad which takes up a considerable amount of time in my afterhours and weekends. My employer knows about this and that I have capacity constraints, they give me study leave for tests and exams and are quite supportive of me pursuing it. I am however getting a lot of 'hate' from my team in the forms of teasing and gossiping. The other members of my team usually put in extra hours over the 8 hours set aside for the graduate project, however I don't really have the luxury of extra hours, especially with family and relationship expectations some time in the week on top of it all. So I end up not putting in any extra hours or taking up extra work in the graduate project, and this is what is causing this stir. I just want some feedback from the community, should I be offering up more of my personal time to match that of theirs on this graduate project and to 'fit in' with the grind?

1jiv72v,Im in a tug-o-war between two competitors,"Hi

I work for a global company who are the market leaders in their industry. Whilst their biggest competitors are behind them in terms of market share, they are 3x larger than my current employer and quite diversified (also a F500). The industry we are in is just a small part that this competitor operates in. 

I interviewed with the competitor and got an offer with 64% leap on my current basic. I imagine they would want me because I come from the market leaders, and ofc because I wowed them lol jk. 

My reasons for interviewing elsewhere is:

1) I tried moving internally but got rejected in two interviews in two different teams

2) My pay sucks. 2 pay raises in 3 years and the recent one was 10% increase only because I insisted. Despite that, the pay sucks. 

3) No progression whatsoever in my current role. The ‚Äúsenior‚Äù position is held by someone with 5 YOE and 25 YOE. And thats it, people haven‚Äôt progressed past the senior position to principal or advanced at all! 

4) This is my first job and I have 3 YOE. I have no kids or pets or responsibilities as such so Im in the position to take risks or bounce back if I fail. I don‚Äôt want to pigeonhole myself in this small industry. I want to work for FAANG

5) My director favours certain members of the team and Im not one of them. Eg he made a guy with 4 YOE a team leader to lead guys with 20+ YOE. This didn‚Äôt go down well with the team because this leader heavily relies on others to get his work done due to being inexperienced but because he was good in networking and made the right friends, hes got the job. Oh and he micromanages and is only prioritising building his portfolio. 

6) Ultimately I want to go into people management and I highly doubt this director is going to take me there. I have expressed this aspiration numerous times since last year to the director and even worked on IDPs but got nowhere. I have set up 1:1s with the VP but to no avail. I seem to be not hitting the mark with the people in this company. 

My dilemma now is that I put in my resignation to my employer and they started scrambling to retain me. The director and VP both talked to me to sell their pitch (being market leaders, why the competitor wants me etc). I was expecting them to put me on garden leave and off I went but they are being disruptive and pressurising me to reconsider. 

However, because they insisted, I said I will entertain the offer. My director has now matched the competitors offer (went to the regional GM) and has put that in the system. He said he will be coaching me to uncover my potential, no mention of progression. VP just messaged me ‚Äúglad you‚Äôve stayed‚Äù. 

I HAVEN‚ÄôT! I want to go but I don‚Äôt want to burn bridges. I emailed the competitor to say that my employer is retaining me and has matched your offer + has given me a short term progression plan to senior level or leadership (they haven‚Äôt). The competitor said they will discuss with their leadership team and get back to me in a couple of days. 

Please help me navigate this, how should I respond to my VP now? The offer Im going to get from the competitor will either be the same or better, hence I definitely want to leave. Im getting manipulated and I don‚Äôt know how to proceed .",PracticalCoconut5,1,0.9900000095367432,1,1742834500,2025-03-24 16:41:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jiv72v/im_in_a_tugowar_between_two_competitors/,3,2025

1jiu90x,Promotion vs Free Time?,"
I  (25M) currently work marketing/sales position where I book appointments for sales presentations for a travel club. The job is fully commission, but I‚Äôm one of the top performers. 

Last year I made a little over 70k, and so far this year I‚Äôve already earned 35K. I live with 2 friends so expenses are relatively low so my savings is flourishing. 

Recently I‚Äôve been overhearing rumors from my supervisors and coworkers that our boss wants to promote me to be a supervisor. Here‚Äôs the pros and cons:

Pros: 
- My pride would like for me to be promoted. I‚Äôm 25 in a position that hires 18 year olds fresh out of or still in high school. I want to be something more. 
- If I decide I do want to move up in this company it‚Äôs a necessary step I can take sooner rather than later. 
- as a supervisor I would get a guaranteed $600 per week (unless it‚Äôs less than my commission) as well as bonuses for production of the entire team.  
- I feel comfortable as a leader. Several times already my boss has had me fill in for absent supervisors (with bonus pay for the day based on the teams production) and I‚Äôve managed to keep my production close to what I do on normal days so those have been big pay outs. 

Cons:
- I make this kind of money working 3-4 days a week, sometimes 5 or 6 on packed weeks. I‚Äôm hesitant to give up that free time. 
- Leads have had a trend to make less money after being promoted. They are still expected to produce, but the 3 that we have currently don‚Äôt put up good numbers at all. Like I mentioned before in my pseudo-lead shifts I‚Äôve continued to put up good numbers, but I worry that I‚Äôll fall into the same trend once it‚Äôs official. 
- I play competitive pokemon and travel for events and I would miss a lot more if I had actual responsibility since I can‚Äôt just call out on a whim anymore. 
- I was in college for 2.5 years and was not successful due to untreated mental issues. I have since been treating them and life is SOOOO much more manageable now than it was before and I would like to give college another go, I just don‚Äôt know how easy it would be while also doing a full time job. 

Kind of both:
I dont know how I feel about this being my career simply off of morals. It‚Äôs kinda close to like the timeshare kind of thing, but our company does actually offer something of value. I just don‚Äôt like that the immediate response from strangers and family is so negative because of the bad rap that travel things like this have. On one hand I feel like that would be tied to my identity,  but on the other hand my job should just be how I make money and if I‚Äôm making a lot and not hurting anyone who cares.

I am fluent, will have a British degree, and I do have plenty of job experience in the field with some great recommendation letters from my managers (almost 2 full years of work experience when adding up all my contracts).",MrsDarcy94000,0,0.5,2,1742831683,2025-03-24 15:54:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jiu105/will_not_having_a_masters_degree_make_it/,3,2025
1jitpxa,Coworker drama,"I‚Äôm (F) new to posting so let me know if I‚Äôm missing information or anything. I know this is long and rambling, so TYIA!! 

TLDR: My coworker (F) has recently gotten cold at work and after asking if I had done something, she got way worse. I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs trying to poison my other relationships in the office. I truly just want to get her to stop but have no idea how. 

My coworker and I sit very close to each other at work with no cubicles and our jobs are the same, so we end up having to talk to each other a fair amount. We were friends for a while - not super close, but would see a movie, send each other work memes and always chat when we saw each other. If one of the guys would pick on her, I would say something back and when she was down, I would try to cheer her up. 

Where I work there are well-known athletes in different sports. One of the more ‚Äúfamous‚Äù ones came up and talked to me and I didn‚Äôt recognize him until he told me his name. He had clearly expected me to recognize him, but we ended up laughing about it and it was fine. This happened again (I‚Äôm bad with faces and didn‚Äôt grow up watching this particular sport) with a coach who works there. I asked if he worked there and he told me his name and that he was a coach there. I apologized and now we chat every time we walk out at the same time. I try to be friendly to people walking by - I always smile and wave, so I interact with the athletes more than she does since she doesn‚Äôt do those things. I don‚Äôt engage with athletes otherwise since it‚Äôs inappropriate and against the rules. I think she grew up in a way where you aren‚Äôt supposed to talk to the CEO of a company, society rules are strict, etc. where I just like to yap with whoever. 

She started getting more and more unfriendly until finally the other day I tried to check in with her. I asked her if I had done something, and after some back and forth she finally said that our manager essentially didn‚Äôt like my interactions. But I had spoken with the manager about this, and it was fine. I told her this and she immediately changed her story to our other coworker (M) being jealous that the athlete came to talk to me and how he was angry about it and she felt like she had to pick a side. This had not been my experience at all - when it had happened, my coworker thought it was hilarious (and I have checked in with him after this and he had absolutely no beef, he really did just think it was funny). I told her that this was my experience and that was pretty much the end of the conversation. From past conversations, I have seen her twist things into something it clearly wasn‚Äôt, often with someone being mean to her when she wasn‚Äôt even relevant, and I feel that might be what‚Äôs happening. 

The next day, the vibe was clearly off and she kept making comments to our coworkers about how she had texted them about stuff she had clearly not texted me about. She‚Äôs someone who fishes for compliments pretty heavily, and I normally am very quick to tell her she‚Äôs pretty, her forehead is fine, no one is mad at her, etc. but after how weird the conversation was, I didn‚Äôt really do that as much that day. I can see why that made it more weird since it was a different dynamic, but I was honestly pretty tired of constantly trying to build her up when it feels like she‚Äôs constantly trying to tear me down. But that evening, she unadded me on find my friends (I know, super Gen-Z) and has since seemed to be making comments that feel icky. 

Obviously all of this is incredibly one-sided, but I‚Äôm at a loss - I have no idea why she is so upset when what she‚Äôs saying she was upset about had nothing to do with her, was none of her business, and not actually what happened. When I asked her if I had done something, I sincerely wanted to know because we could have a real conversation about it and I could do things differently, but I don‚Äôt feel like I got anything to build off of. My friends think she‚Äôs jealous that some of the athletes have done flirty things (asking for my number, etc.) towards me and not her. She tends to lie, as with how our conversation went, so I know asking her what the problem is won‚Äôt help. When I tried to be neutral she got particularly nasty in front of our coworkers. I tried being complimentary again and brought her a donut which seemed to help, but I feel gross and fake about constantly complimenting her just so she won‚Äôt talk badly about me to everyone else in our office, especially when I used to sincerely do that. I‚Äôm not going to stop being friendly with other people to not be threatening to her, if that‚Äôs is what‚Äôs happening. 

I feel like I have good relationships with everyone else in the office, but this is making me question all of them. We‚Äôre both temp workers, so our jobs end in not too long, but being around her is making me feel so icky that I want to get out of an otherwise good job way earlier than I was expecting. I just don‚Äôt know how to get out from under her wrath üòÇ 

Any advice on how to get her to stop being nasty? Just anything to try to get this to stop without having to give in to the mean-girlness of it all. This sounds cheesy but I really do love when I can just go to work and chat with no unnecessary drama and I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to escalate it no matter what I do.

1jitf62,I want to step down from my office job and go back to being a barista. Am I overqualified?,"I know this is stupid especially in this job market, but I hate my office job. I dreamed of this position for a long time, but then realized that with office work, you have to deal with the disorganization and the attitude and the spontaneity, etc. I got burned out after 3 months and now I am ready to quit, as my boss is extremely disorganized and has zero concept of time, but me being the manager means that I have to take the backlash for his lack of responsibility from the customers. 

I realized that as a neurodivergent person, I like jobs where I can just do, and I don't have to think. My weekend job is as a barista, and I worked as a barista for several years before that. I loved it because I just had a simple checklist of tasks and knew exactly what to do in every situation. The thing is, would listing this professional job on my resume make me look overqualified if I apply to barista jobs? This isn't a local starbucks or a low-level chain coffee shop, but a local-owned coffee shop that doubles as a wellness center. I heard that listing the job may make some employers see that you are versatile and have strong conflict resolution skills, but to other employers, you may look overqualified. I really want to work at this specific place and will include as much specification as I can in my cover letter, however I know that the resume is often viewed first and want to make sure that I don't screw up my chances.

1jiswc8,Guidance needed to get out the three tier college rut in India!,"TLDR: Read the text in caps below, but if you can please read the whole thing.

Hello Reader,

I am CSE sophomore student from a three tier college. Very bad College and Parents have this dumb notion of more gpa -> more package fixed in their mind. That I am already trying to achieve but life had other plans ( i got a edc back in 2nd sem , which I am confident I will clear this time). So during those times I did some grind and really liked web dev and machine learning. I did some projects and now I am well versed with almost all popular frontend frameworks and I help my seniors with their final year projects . To prove this I make around 10k INR a month using my skills( freelance + for seniors) .

My earnings peaked at 45k INR for once ,not flexing but yeah just giving the idea.

During the time I had got a backlog , I had lost all hopes on college placements, so during that time I ravaged the internet I learnt that people can still apply through off campus , diversity hiring , remote devs etc where they wont ask for your gpa but your skills. And these people are genuinely paid a lot more than usual tcs, accenture devs ( no offence).

My Initial plan was to do a masters in the states and you know get that job for which I will have to take up a hefty loan (middle class family üò≠). But after speaking to some genuine people and thinking a lot I think I dont need masters . Look Im being completely honest here , I need to make money , a lot of money and for I know I gotta grind my bum off and why I cant do that without the masters. Then it struck me WHAT IF I GET DIRECTLY HIRED INTO THE US THORUGH SOME 2 TIER COMPANY , OR STARTUP OR ANY MAANG COMPANY (if I am lucky ) AND MAKE MY WAY DIRECTLY INTO THE JOB MARKET THERE , UPSKILL AND REPEAT THE CYCLE FOR A BIGGER PAYCHECK. you know the rest . I want to know if this path possible and doable. Did anyone do this before. How can I convince my parents that gpa != package. I seriously need some raw and honest advice .

1jirs4x,Existential Dilemma About Moving Abroad: Aerospace Startup in Switzerland or Automotive Multinational in Sweden?,"Hey everyone!

I'm writing because I‚Äôll probably have to make a decision in the next few days, and I could really use some advice‚ÄîI‚Äôm pretty torn between the two options. Here‚Äôs a list of thoughts I‚Äôve gathered for each opportunity:

**Sweden ‚Äì Automotive Multinational**

* Same company I currently work for in Italy
* Roughly the same role I have now (Test Engineer), but on different types of products
* Potential for internal mobility + future growth within the company
* Easier relocation, familiar environment
* I'd be living in a city with a great university, so I might be able to combine the job with a Master‚Äôs (depending on timing, of course)
* I imagine the net salary would be roughly the Swedish equivalent of my current Italian salary (37.4k gross), considering the usual salary grids multinationals use‚Äîso a raise, but I‚Äôm not sure how much

**Switzerland ‚Äì Aerospace Startup**

* Still a Test Engineer role, but I‚Äôd be back in the aerospace sector, which is what I studied at university (although to be honest, I don‚Äôt care that much anymore)
* Innovative projects, startup in a growth phase
* I don‚Äôt know the net salary yet, but I assume it‚Äôll be higher than in Sweden‚Äîalthough, since it‚Äôs a startup in the aerospace field and based in the French-speaking canton (Lausanne), I‚Äôm not sure what to expect
* Significantly higher cost of living
* Work pace and workload are still unclear (startup environment)

Does anyone have direct experience in either of the two countries or in similar situations?

I'm especially interested in thoughts about quality of life and which option might be better in terms of professional growth. Right now, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm leaning 60/40 toward staying with the same multinational in Sweden, but I‚Äôm totally open to other perspectives!

I could see myself being a Software Architect but I dont know where to start. So i have the following questions.   
  
**Questions:**   
1. Do you have any kind advice on how and what to choose?   
2. Do you have any advice about what mistakes I should avoid in the long run or useful habits to start very early?   
3. Which of the two carreers would you see:   
   a. Is more future proof in terms of getting replaced by any kind of AI?   
   b. Offers the best work-life balance in the long run?   
   c. Has the most diffuclt problems to solve that give you a great overview of knowledge about SDLC?   
   d. Offers the most flexibility in terms of carreer? (eg if i get bored of it then to be able to transition easily to the other)   
   e. Has the most opportunities to rise relatively fast?   
4. Should I choose a big company in the beginning the transition to a smaller one with more responsibility or the other way around?

Below, I share a bit more about my background, in case anyone wants to read it and give me their opinion with all the details. Apologies in advance for the long post.   
  
**whoami:**   
I‚Äôm a formal student of Electrical and Computer Engineering student graduate from NTUA (5years, integrated master). During my studies I got to develop several projects including:   
\- A complete backend cloud system for managing and distributing data (this was done as a part of a European Horizon project for my thesis) where i used Python with Django & DRF to develop the application, docker-compose for the deployment, Grafana K6 for testing, Mosquitto MQTT for messaging and Swagger UI for documentation   
\- A SaaS microservices full stack application using NodeJS/Express for the development of the backend, MongoDB with mongoose , Docker for deployment, Kafka for messaging, git and YouTrack for agile sprints   
\- A distributed execution cloud environment with 4 VMs (on Okeanos-Knossos) that tested PrestoDB where I did all the deployment involving the dockerization of Presto | PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Cassandra, the clean-up of the data and automatic population of the DBs with Bash scripts/ Docker volumes and the deployment of the whole stack in 4 VMs using Docker Swarm/ docker-compose   
  
**Preferences:**   
Out of all of these project I really enjoyed seeing the whole application solved the problem that was set upon us and I can say I really enjoyed especially the process of turning requirements to specifications and then designing the architecture of the systems. Though, I‚Äôd like to think I am a very creative person and I love developing the solutions of these problems as well.

My husband has a remote job and is also a high earner. We currently own our home with a 2% mortgage and about 10 years left on the loan. We love living in Central NJ and have a 9-year-old son.
 
We're weighing the pros and cons of this move, including financial and lifestyle considerations, especially how it will affect our family dynamics and our son's upbringing.

I'd appreciate any insights or advice from those who have gone through a similar relocation process or have experience with these types of compensation packages.

1jiq6o0,"I have a Unicorn for a job but I am super dissatisfied and quite frankly; burnt out, stressed out, and depressed. Does anyone have any advice for moving forward?","As the title states, I have a unicorn for a job. Big salary right out of college (~80,000) and great benefits with work from home; in a niche(ish) industry at the age of 25 (Certs in multiple business technologies and 3 degrees). I don‚Äôt know much about the industry still and frankly I don‚Äôt know if I want to.

I‚Äôm bottom bitch right now, take on the grunt work as expected (I get it, new guy); but I have 6 years of management, inventory, and overall business experience as I worked full time through high-school and college, working up to a director position within a medium size company. I also applied my experience to clubs while I was in college, growing them exponentially and setting up process where they still today are growing to new highs.

This change to ‚Äúgrunt‚Äù status has really caused my confidence to fall drastically as well as my drive to work; especially considering everyone in the company is tenured and promotions are looking to be YEARS out unless something crazy happens. I just can‚Äôt keep sitting at a computer screen all day everyday doing my base job and taking requests from everyone under the sun; while getting asked to do more and more and more, it is driving me absolutely nuts. And I can‚Äôt bring it up to my manager because he will just shrug it off and push me harder, I can‚Äôt talk to his boss about it because he will tell me to take it up with my manager, and I can‚Äôt tell my bosses boss about it in fear that I will just look like a lazy young kid trying to get his top guys in trouble.

On top of that, I‚Äôm one of the only people in the company without a science degree and I‚Äôm the youngest by 10+ years, so I feel out of place at times; my coworkers are great people and great conversationalist but for some reason I feel I don‚Äôt fit in.

I have been here for about 8 months now and I really don‚Äôt know if I want to do this anymore, but I also feel I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place as I have no savings because of student loans and don‚Äôt think I will find a job with pay and benefits as good as this one. I also have a wife who is not willing to move away from where we are in the northern United States so I am super limited on opportunities. Maybe this is a vent session or maybe this is me asking for any ideas or guidance, at the end of the day I hate it the way it is right now but I don‚Äôt see a way out. I always saw myself as a salesman, a business owner, or even a business manager for another company; but this? This is not what I expected nor is it what I want to do for the next 3+ years.

But I‚Äôve been hating the job for a month now without even really realizing and I don‚Äôt know how to quit.

I like my coworkers a lot, I also do like my managers and the job is nice, but it‚Äôs just way too much work for the pay and the exhaustion it puts on me.

1jipnp9,New job/boss making me travel excessively - what do I do?,"I recently started a new engineering job 2.5 months ago supporting a large production plant but also supporting some efforts at suppliers that requires around 20% travel. This was stated during interview and on the JD. I have now traveled 8 of the 10 weeks I have been here. They have been to suppliers for shop tours, checkups, etc. And my boss will tell me to book my plane ticket on like Thursday or Friday to leave Sunday or Monday with no agenda sent over just the destination (and gets ticked off at me when I just ask about the trip agenda for some reason that I am apparently not entitled to know which is odd). I did not anticipate this and I have obligations at home with pregnant wife and dog. I am ok with traveling but not to this extent. I had asked my boss if we could limit the travel and get more notice prior to leaving but he didn‚Äôt seem to care what I think about the situation so far. I also made mention during dinner one night that I had some obligations like wife‚Äôs check ups, mother in laws and brothers birthday, etc. that I will miss on these trips but he didn‚Äôt seem care. He made a remark saying I would never let personal stuff get in the way of business travel. I am torn because I want to make the job work and stick with it but not ok with the amount of travel. And I would say the travel isn‚Äôt really required as our group really doesn‚Äôt have a ton of oversight from other management and on these trips we really run up the bills with airfare, food, hotels, etc. What should I do here? Refuse to travel saying I have obligations, look for another job ASAP as it may be a lost cause, or any other option. And something else to note is the company is trying to reduce travel costs by 30% for 2025 in to help with more profits and shall only be for necessary business travel. Was thinking about explaining this to his boss but not sure if this would backfire on me.

For context on my boss he is in his mid-60s and seems just very eager to jump on a plane for anything. I don‚Äôt know if he is just chasing the points for all the hotels, airfare, etc. for when he retires and his wife and him travels.",beanman214,2,1.0,4,1742819921,2025-03-24 12:38:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jipnp9/new_jobboss_making_me_travel_excessively_what_do/,3,2025
1jip3e5,What can my 50 yr old husband work in?,"Husband is 50, mostly hasn't worked the last 5 yrs.  He worked nearly 20 yrs as a plumber for a family business, but didn't want to take it over so his dad sold it when he retired.  He had another job as a plumber which started out great but with a management change got really bad.  The kicker was overnight security desk shifts they started requiring of them, on only day or couple days' notice.  He quit, pandemic shut the world down 2 weeks later, he has never really recovered.

He's worked a handful of jobs since but total is less than a year of work over 5 yrs.  He also did food delivery upon my suggestion during the early pandemic but that dried up and he didn't want to shift to driving in a more lucrative area, or a more regular delivery job.

He says he wants an environment not a job; he wants work that is helping others but not insanely physically taxing, and with colleagues who are competent (or teachable).  He had a handful of contacts from when he worked with his dad but they didn't really have any leads, also he wants to get out of that kind of service work.  He said he can't figure out how to job search with Indeed etc.  I don't know how to help him at this point since I log in and see hundreds of jobs.  He's only applied for maybe 10 jobs in total over that whole time.  He doesn't want to work with a career coach and he doesn't want to cold call or volunteer somewhere or even do something like go work on a habitat for humanity site or seasonal work.  There are various other jobs that are adjacent to his field that he doesn't want to do for one reason or another.

When he works a job he is really hard working (I think TOO hard working, he's injured himself before to get the job done).  He's also really empathetic, he's really good around seniors, sick people, kids, pets.  He does not want to go to college at his age (I suggested something like becoming a nurse or home health care aid).  He's shown a recent interest in politics and activism, but when I suggested exploring that he said he had no idea what he could do as someone without a college degree who has no desire to be a ""pencil pusher"".  He said a desk job would be his worst nightmare.  I think he wants to do something using his skills as a plumber and related mechanical fields ideally.

Before I knew how old she was we'd often tease her often about work related stuff and I thought nothing of it until she started getting touchy. After i found out she's only 18 and distanced myself. A few months passed since I tried to let her down lightly. I told her something along the lines of she is sweet and attractive and I admire her work ethic/personally as a whole but she's much too young. The other day she sent me a video her in the shower. There's no way it was a mistake as it was addressed to me. I just deleted our text history completely. I can't block her because she's one of the boss's daughter and pretty much the manager. Today she asked if I was mad at her and asked why I haven't responded to or been talking to her.

 I'm not going to lie when I first started I thought she was in her mid-20s because she said she was going to college to become a doctor, is the manager and was working 10-12 hour shifts just like myself. Even her older sister noticed and mentioned to me that she has a thing for me. 

I don't want to lose my job because I quite like it and make easy money. I don't really want to talk to my boss about it. I'd consider myself an introvert and normally don't speak unless spoken to. I don't really have any idea how to handle this. Any suggestions?

1jiioea,Do I have a good case for a mutual separation agreement?,"I live in California and am about 2 years into a pretty miserable experience at my current role in biotech. Though it was clear within the first few months that I wasn't the most natural fit for the role or company culture, I've shown a lot of determination to overcome my obstacles and make it work. But after a lot of struggling and some poor performance reviews, a few months ago I was diagnosed with a couple (mental) disabilities that impair my ability to succeed in this role and company culture ‚Äî that explained a lot. Though I received a letter from my provider with some suggested workplace accommodations, by this point I had felt enough personal suffering as well as frustration from coworkers to know that pursuing accommodations won't help me here and I needed to leave. By then I'd also become burnt out from the stress required to sustain even my below average performance level, and the lack of free time has made it difficult to give the effort required to find my next job. And since I've even started hoping to get fired (for the unemployment benefits), I started worrying that sharing my disability letter with HR would make it too difficult to fire me. I've still fought to give my best effort at my job every day. But in order to reach a good place in my career, I know in my heart that I'll have to leave this environment first. I'm willing to lose some money while I take some time off to feel like myself again and find the right job, but my cost of living is too high to do this without unemployment benefits.

Thus, given my situation, would it be in my best interest to pursue a separation agreement? Will my disability letter be in my benefit here?

A couple extra variables to consider: I could probably have my provider edit my disability letter if any talking points in particular would help me. Also, we happen to have our mid-year performance review next month and I'm not expecting good reviews.

TL;DR ‚Äî I'm a burned out employee who recently learned of a couple disabilities, seeking to leave my company in a way that entitles me for unemployment benefits so I can focus on finding a job better suited to my strengths and weaknesses.",daronius,1,1.0,2,1742790557,2025-03-24 04:29:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jiioea/do_i_have_a_good_case_for_a_mutual_separation/,3,2025

1jih4wn,Is it worth trying to become an airline pilot in Australia,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 19 years old and seriously considering going to flight school to become a commercial airline pilot here in Australia. The lifestyle has always intrigued me‚Äîflying around the world, constantly moving, and experiencing new places. I‚Äôve always wanted to work a job that feels exciting and fulfilling, and aviation has stood out to me for as long as I can remember.

Right now, I live at home with my parents and earn about $1,000 a week after tax working in a warehouse. I like to believe I‚Äôm very financially responsible for my age‚ÄîI invest the majority of my income into ETFs with a long-term mindset (20‚Äì30 years down the line), and I don‚Äôt spend money on things I don‚Äôt need. Because I‚Äôm good at saving and living below my means, I genuinely believe I could survive on the low pay that comes with being a junior pilot for several years if it means I‚Äôm on a clear path to a well-paying airline job down the line.

I‚Äôve got a decent amount in savings, but I‚Äôm still a long way off the full $100,000 required for a CPL course. My parents could most likely cover the cost for me, and they‚Äôve been supportive, but it‚Äôs a huge financial commitment. I really don‚Äôt want to let them down if I fail or can‚Äôt turn it into a stable career. That pressure makes it hard to fully commit, even though deep down, this is something I genuinely want to do.

I‚Äôve also looked into the E-3 Visa which allows Australians to work in the U.S, and that‚Äôs the career path I‚Äôd ideally pursue after gaining enough flying experience in Australia

What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is:

* Is the financial risk worth it if I‚Äôm fully committed to becoming a pilot?
* Is working overseas in U.S are realistic goal if I have enough experience, or is the job market too competitive?
* For those who‚Äôve taken a similar path, any regrets or was it worth it?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice or perspectives ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre in aviation, finance or have been through something similar yourself. I want to chase my dreams, but I also want to make a smart and responsible decision that I won‚Äôt regret in the future

Thanks for reading

1jighe1,Am I screwed?,"Hi all. I'm sorry if this is not the right sub to post this.

I recently just majored in Technical Communications (Dec 2024). I  interned (unpaid) for about 6 mo as a social media manager at a non profit. I also did one of those bs Google certificate in UX design (Well, I did learn a lot but I hear the market as of now is very oversaturated) From the internship I learned some valuable skills, I think (SEO, content writing, social media management, messed with Meta Business Suite). 

I guess I've only graduated a few months ago but I've been on the job search since last summer. I've been sending apps for all types of jobs (my major seems sort of versatile), like SEO , UX design, social media management, etc. Overwhelmingly no responses, few rejections. A lot of them have been remote positions but some in person as well. I got one interview as a SEO writer few days ago but I was rejected, still felt really cool to score an interview haha. 

Anyways I'll take any advice I can get, whether to bully me for my comm degree (lol) or to give hope that UX is still alive or whatever. Thanks in advance!",wingedcoffee,2,1.0,2,1742783075,2025-03-24 02:24:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jighe1/am_i_screwed/,3,2025

If I move back home, my career (well, what little experience I have) is essentially over, as I have only been at this place for a very short amount of time. Also, what I‚Äôm doing is very specialized and location-dependent. I feel like an idiot who didn‚Äôt take that into consideration. 

Bottom line is that I want to come home. I hate it here. I‚Äôve been living alone and have no friends, but I‚Äôve been trying to find some as soon as I got here and it hasn‚Äôt been very successful. Not to mention I have no time, since I work 60+ hour weeks. I‚Äôve gotten very depressed because of this, and being constantly by myself is not good for me. There is no social interaction at work. The job isn‚Äôt like that unfortunately.

I need to come home for my own mental sake. This depression will absolutely get worse the longer I stay here. I cry almost every single day after coming home from work, and I sleep the weekends away (if I don‚Äôt have extra work assigned for the weekend). I don‚Äôt know what to do exactly. I need help.

Having another job lined up would be the way to go, but I haven‚Äôt been here that long to do that. Also, the jobs near home are limited.

I am not really sure where to go from here. My contract ends in a week with the federal government here in Canada and I am a little scared and lost. Right now I have no savings and a bunch of debt.

The problem is my job has no transferrable skills. The federal government is very specific to the program you are in and I am finding nothing I apply for I have even close to the qualifications which is the reason for the no interviews. I am feeling like I am screwed now. I do have a business administration degree but don't have a designation or MBA.

I am not sure where to go from here and was hoping to get some advice on what might be my options. I might likely end up homeless or bankrupt if I don't find a job. I applied to law school but it's not looking like that is going to materialize this year either. I just feel like a failure.

1jid9h7,I need career help.,"I really don‚Äôt have any passions or really anything I could see myself doing in the future. I am only 19M and ive worked in retail since graduating high school. I live in the small shitty state of West Virginia. With the worst education in the US and one of the most drug surrounded states in the US. Although Ive never touched anything more than a few alcoholic beverages with some friends. 

Im not really too great academically but I could definitely manage college if needed. Although I feel like the ROI is just too low and it makes me shy away, my family is poor and grades weren‚Äôt great leading to a pretty bad hand with affording college. 

I think a trade or associate degree would be the best option for me. 

My father did jack of all trades, but i was never around enough to learn from him. Not to mention he‚Äôs so broken down now that he cannot work, and he was never even middle class while in his prime. I can say though it was definitely because of bad financial decisions, he doesnt know how to invest and had no passions creating a company. He hates being a leader. 

I have to agree with that as well.  Im more behind the scenes type of guy, Im social but to an extent. I do know, I do not always want to be an employee in a rat wheel. That makes me shy away from anything corporate. I need a bit more excitement than that. 

I have don‚Äôt have the badass mentality to be any 1st or 2nd responder,and Im a scrawny kid with a very bad weight gaining issue but Im working on it. 

Military is a option always mentioned,and its a thought on every young kids mind. Pls no military talk,i know it‚Äôs great for you and I love that but its  not for everyone. 

I want a job that‚Äôll always be around so assuming healthcare and transportation are two big ones not going anywhere. I dont really have the heart to be a nurse, but want the work life balance. (Not a good enough reason to pursue.) 

i like the thought of being a radiology Tech,slightly behind scene, some human interactions, not too hard on your body as a trade would be and great money. Yet again i still bounce between so many other careers. 

I love the thought of being a engineer but a doubt my self confidence to pursue it. Not to mention my schooling was terrible and I barely even know algebra. 

I guess really what im saying is i have no idea what to do. All I know is a job is a job and its more important for me is the life outside of work. I love traveling, want to build cars and start a dealership one day. I want to do real estate and even one day own a hauling company. 

All these can be done, no matter what job if I save and invested properly.

1jicqu5,"Fired after less than 1 year, networking/interview advice?","I will try to be brief, even if this is turning to a wall of text. I attended a semi-target in Canada. I got an sales & trading internship in my third-year summer and got along well with my bosses, but I wasn‚Äôt given a return offer in a competitive year. I did get a reference letter from my boss. I went ballistic trying to get a FT job throughout my fourth year, as in 3-5 coffee chats every single weekday, countless applications and final-round interviews just to get rejected at the last second for inexplicable reasons, and at last - while interviewing during finals season - I broke through and got an equity research position. I was over the moon, finally ready to start the next chapter of my life. 

Then it was all downhill from there. The learning curve was more steep than I thought, and despite my best efforts, I made a few mistakes along the way, and my boss/analyst seemed incapable of forgiving me after that. The snarkiness began, and after some other points of friction and MUCH much bearing through rudeness and trying to come up with new ways to approach working with him, I got a horrible performance review. I was just as dissatisfied, if not fuming at this point, so I also provided feedback on my analyst about his rude remarks, given that one of his superiors was present. My analyst could not even look me in the eyes the next day, and he said ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for the first time for any work that I did. 

To save my job, I arranged a meeting with the head of ER, who ignored all my complaints and seemed incapable of listening to me. All the while, the analyst was known to be rude and go through associates every 1-2 years since he started working. I felt dejected, resentful and bitter, and I complained to some of my nicer coworkers about the situation. Unfortunately, I got an upfront warning from the head, who threatened to fire me if I keep talking. I said I was just looking for advice, and to this day, I don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs punishable if not for the head trying to protect her reputation. They knew they were not treating me fairly. In the end, the head said that they were going to hire someone to work alongside me. 

I lost all hope and just focused on recruiting, which was turning out longer than expected. At the end of January, I got fired unexpectedly. I was flabbergasted and upset, because I was trying so hard not to quit only for this to happen. I had already gotten over the learning curve and was doing good work then. I got a letter of recommendation from one of my coworkers. I was unable to focus, so after fulfilling all my interview duties, I took a solo trip to clear my mind. Now I am back and beyond overwhelmed with all the work that I have to do to get to the next step. I am terrified of how extra difficult recruiting is now that I have to explain why I left after such little time, and I‚Äôm not even sure what field I should pursue. I am reaching out to people I worked with before, but everything is moving so slowly, and I am growing more and more anxious every single day. Any advice on what to do next or how to talk about this in coffee chats/in interviews would be appreciated.

1jibqhe,What career paths should I look into?,"I honestly don't care what field I'm in at this point. I'm willing to take on any type of career subject (healthcare, environmental, government, science, etc) as long as the type of job plays towards my strengths and minimizes my weaknesses. I'm in my mid-20s, I have a college degree that I don't 100% care for, and I just need a stable career. Luckily, I've been in the workforce since high school, so I have experience on what my strengths and weaknesses are:

*Strengths*

*Very detail-oriented. This is too the point where I can be perfectionistic and stick to something until it's absolutely done right.
*I like to move around a lot, but also would like to sit down once in a while. If I stand or sit in place too long (especially at a full-time job), it'll drive me insane. I don't mind being confined to a room as long as there's dynamic movement (eg. teachers can move about in their classroom)
*Good with numbers. 
*A good learner, able to soak in knowledge


*Weaknesses*

* Prone to boredom. I not only need physical movement, but intellectual stimulation as well (I could have adhd, but I won't self-diagnose myself)
*Not exactly customer service oriented (I'm polite, but I'd prefer not to talk much if I don't have too). I'm an introvert & my people skills still need work, but they've definitely gotten better.
*I'm not exactly an innovator/inventor type. I prefer to memorize and learn the knowledge that's being taught and simply apply it. But I would like to stay away from a career where they rely on new methods

1jiaot1,I can't work for this company anymore - 15 years of service.,"Thank you for taking the time to read this. I just need to rant.   
This is my story: 

I've worked for this big conglomerate for 15 years. I moved to North America at a young age (18 years old) with big dreams. After struggling for the first couple of years I found this company that  was promoting talent.  I started in 2011 as an operator (most basic entry level they had, perfect for me back then as I had nothing to offer) that was approx. 45K per year. Not bad for 2011 and a 21 year old.    
  
I consider myself the guy that would say yes to any training or ticket they were willing to offer for free.  (remember, no education here so I was paranoid and wanted to move up in the world)  now I have some decent credentials that can help me in the future. 

Long story short by 2013 I was already a lead team member and also making 55K.  Then after that  in 2015 I got another promotion to join our supply chain team. that pushed me to the 65K range.  

Then the shit show started.  Upper management thought I was a great candidate to apply for the supervisor role. I did, and I got it immediately with a new salary of 75K.  I was very excited because I knew the operation inside out. I knew what needed to be fixed.  unfortunately that's when my boss started his days off here and there.    


This guy was and is, always sick or something would always happened to him.  Then because of the circumstances I became his back up.  so now is 2020 we are in  the middle of COVID and I received nothing but positive comments about my performance.  (meaning another jump to 84K) 

The money and bonuses kept coming in but I'm starting to feel the burn out.   
he (my boss) had a couple of years of good attendance and I thought I was getting somewhere. Then 2023 hit.  he decided to go on long term disability towards the end of the year.   
  
Meaning that was me running an entire department of 25 people by myself.  at this point the company decided to offer more money LOL . 92K.   Yes it's a nice jump and a 5% bonus sounds great too. But I was very clear with the organization and explained that this is not sustainable in the long run. 

It's 2024 and they informed me they have no update regarding him coming back and they can not hire anyone until that's sorted out.  they decided to ask people from other departments to help me out.  at this point I feel awful because I'm making mistakes and also feeling overwhelmed. Guess what!!!!  They gave me more money so now I make 100K per year.  I always had dreams that one day I'll get to that point. But not this way :( 

now it's 2025 and bonus and money month is coming up and I have a feeling they're going to offer more money and give me a chill pill.  I understand the operation so well, because I started from the bottom.  So, I know very well this is not sustainable and I can not do this anymore.  I'm at a point where even If they give me another person or my old boss comes back I'm leaving anyways.  

The odd feeling I have is:  

I don't know what's out there anymore, working for this company for so long and starting at such young age, make me feel I wont find a gig like this anywhere else.  (I'm 35 years old now) 

most of what's happening in my head  feel more like mental barriers than big challenges.  I know I'll be ok working for another organization. The odd feeling still there. 

I feel management thinks because I was able to do it for the past 2 years I can do it another year and so on.   
When I take vacation is impossible not to think about the shit show I'll be walking into when I get back. 

I don't really know what I'm asking from this group.  validation I guess????

1jian1f,Negotiate or no? When did the negotiation begin?,"***Background:*** I'm currently unemployed. I worked at a single employer for \~10 years (engineer, then manager at an established technology company). New management came in and pushed RTO for a specific office that would require a move (even for those based in other offices); I declined to move and was laid off with a mediocre severance.  


\------

I applied for a job in a different career path/title than what I last had (more strategic, less operational, although there's overlap, so it's not totally different). In the application, I specified a base salary range slightly above my last base salary, which would be considered low/competitive for some companies (e.g., tech), but high for more traditional companies.

When I was first contacted by the recruiter for a screen, they noted my salary expectations and said the budgeted salary was $X, which is about 21% lower than my last base. I expressed that this was lower than expected, but I'd be interested in continuing.

After a couple of rounds of interviews, including a case study presentation to a couple of mid-senior leaders, the recruiter contacted me again and said I'd probably be getting an offer with $X base plus bonus and equity. I asked if there was a salary range, and was flatly told ""the position is budgeted for $X.""  I asked if there would be a signing bonus, and the recruiter said they weren't sure and would get back to me.

Within a few days, I got a formal verbal offer, and the base salary had been bumped up to $X+5k (which indicates to me that there is a range). I was told what would have been a signing bonus was added to the base (so there would be no signing bonus). This was then followed by a written offer. **My main questions are ‚Äì did the increase by $5k count as the first negotiation, or was that the initial offer? Do I negotiate further from here?**

*Every* dimension is worse than my last position. If I just look at base/bonus/equity, this is about 18% lower than my last job. If I include PTO, insurance, 401k match, etc, it's more like 22% lower.

This is a title/career path I've wanted for a while, and I've told myself (and my spouse) that I'd be willing to take a bit of a cut to get the title and build experience. Ultimately, if this were the final offer, I'd accept. But I'd also kick myself if I knew I could squeeze a little more by sending an email.

1jiaak2,Statistician: PhD or career pivot?,"Hi hi,

I'm (29F) at a point in my career where I could really benefit from some advice or mentorship. I have an MSc Statistics from a top European university and I have some experience working in the clinical research field (~2y). My dream would be to do a PhD in the Netherlands or the US but with the state of research funding in both countries I know I need to have a back up plan. I also graduated from my masters 4 years ago so I'm likely not as competitive as current grads.

It's really difficult for me to picture a career path that excites me as much as research and teaching in academia. I don't want to go back to clinical research and right now I'm working as a research assistant while I figure out my next steps. One path I'm considering is Operations Research but I don't have any experience in this field. Does anyone have any advice for how I can pivot?

Also I'd love to hear thoughts on the feasibility of the PhD route plus any tips for the Dutch route. Or better yet any success stories with backgrounds similar to mine.

1jia3a7,"Been looking at a few different majors, I can't decide on one though. Which one should I get?","Sorry if this is a stupid question, I know ultimately that the decision lies with me... But I'm indecisive. I'm 18, looking at going to community college, then transferring to a university after I finish those first 2 years. I only really want a bachelors, I'm not trying to spend my whole life in school (I guess I could always decide later though to pursue a masters). There's a few majors I've been looking at, but I'm honestly unsure. I have attention span issues, so regardless of what I pick, it'll be really hard for me to focus. My ultimate goal in life is to move to a major city with good public transportation, good food options, and the ability to travel from time to time. That's literally all I care about in life. If I go to college for something I'm not passionate about just to make some extra money, I'll end up dropping out. Below are a few majors which at least slightly align with my passions.

Electrical Engineering - I really enjoy building and repairing electronics and stuff already, obviously EE isn't exactly that, but it's a familiar concept and it pays well. It also requires a lot of math and physics knowledge though, which I can't exactly say that I'm the best at. I could probably learn if I really tried focusing on it though. I'd definitely like the outcome to be a job in electromechanical engineering or something though, rather than sitting on the computer 24/7. I like tinkering.

Education - I've honestly always thought being a teacher might be a cool job (obviously it has it's ups and downs), but the city I wanna move to (NYC) requires teachers to have a masters degree after 5 years of initial certification, otherwise they're no longer allowed to teach. I could always settle for another city though, or just suck it up and get the masters. In New York, being a teacher pays really well, outside of that city though, I got no idea (I've heard bad things about the salaries though).

Computer Science - Pretty much all fields in CS are things I'm passionate about, the ultimate goal would be cybersecurity, I've been really good at cybersecurity since I was like 13, but the only thing that sucks is how oversaturated the CS degree is. I could always go for a degree in cybersecurity specifically, but I heard CS is the better degree for the same field. I've heard of people sending out hundreds of applications and not getting an interview. I don't wanna waste 4 years of my life and come out with no job opportunities, nor can I afford to.

Film - I don't know much about how it actually works, but it's always been something that's piqued my interest. I've heard a lot of people say that they really enjoyed their film programs, but I'm just not sure if it's a profitable degree. As much as I wish I could not count money in as a factor, I do have goals in life, and I want to meet them. Not too sure what jobs you can actually get with a degree in film (I heard you don't necessarily even need one), but I assume it's highly dependent on both individual ability and luck when it comes to actually making a career out of it.

Thanks for the help. I‚Äôm looking for a high paying career with a good amount of free time, if you have any other suggestions (or questions) I would appreciate them.",Wise_Presentation914,1,1.0,3,1742764831,2025-03-23 21:20:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jia3a7/been_looking_at_a_few_different_majors_i_cant/,3,2025
1ji9kjf,I think I was spiked while out with work colleagues,"Hi guys.

I went out last night with a bunch of work colleagues and ended up blacking out after 2 drinks. I had one before I left and one when I got to the bar.

I did not pass out during the night, I was just acting extremely drunk, I fell over and do not remember the night at all. I came home and threw up and passed out on my bedroom floor. I can normally hold my drink very well and had eaten before hand, I also feel like shit today. This is why I believe I was spiked. I don‚Äôt think it was a colleague.

I have reported this to the police already as I thought that was the best thing to do.

I have spoken to some of my friends I work with and both have said that I was acting out of character. One of these friends I have been going out with a lot recently and I have been having thoughts about our relationship, if I want to be just friends or something more.

I ended up making moves on her and made her feel awkward. I have already apologised to her for how I behaved and explained to her that I think I was spiked. We had a good chat about where things are going. This is not my main issue.

I need to know how I should best handle myself at work tomorrow. I was out with all the people I work closely with and my manager.

I‚Äôm so worried that people won‚Äôt believe me and that I said and did more things which I would be even more embarrassed of.

1ji80t4,I've come to a crossroads,"Hi everyone. I'm in a bit of a pickle career wise. 

I'm a 25 year old male from Sydney Australia. I have a Industrial Design Bachelor Degree from UNSW. It's a decently respected institution (if that means anything).

I started my career life in July 2022 as a Junior Designer for an Exhibition company that specialises in making custom exhibition stands. The job was somewhat interesting but the company culture was quite toxic. Boss was very rude all the time. Show no respect for staff. I was happy just to have a job at that point so I stayed until I was fired at the end of December 2022 due to me ""lacking experience"". Throughout my time I was paid 25$ AUD an hour or 50k AUD before taxes.

Quickly I manage to find another job after one month. I worked for an Engineer company that specialises in the manufacturing of stage equipment, AV and Venue Engineering. I became a Draftsman and Signwriter. They offered me 30$ AUD an hour and I took it.
 (59k per annum)

The job overall was interesting at first. I never drafted engineering stuff before . Signwriting is pretty fun. I get to use a laser etcher to make my signs. But it gets smelly from plastic fumes which I doubt is good for my health. I got a raise last year to 31$ AUD (61k per annum)

For the past 6-7 months I barely get any work from my higher ups. 60% percent of the time I get some work like doing the odd sign or the odd drawing. But most of the time I sit there and act like I'm working. There's nothing for me to do. It gets really boring and painful. I use to be able to do it and often I'm happy that there's nothing for me to do. It's a break. But now it's killing me slowly inside. It's tiring to act like I'm working than actual work. Time moves painfully slow. 

When I ask my managers . There's usually nothing for me to do. I hate begging for work. My company has a good office culture. They don't fire people easily so I believe my job security is decent. They pay me nothing and when they need me.. I'm useful. 

I feel I've reached the end here. But coming from a toxic first job. I'm hesitant to jump from a decent office culture to a terrible one again. But the pay and the fact that I'm sitting there doing barely anything is also killing me.

My options I assume is to just demand work or find a new job. 

I need some advice on this. Thank you guys for reading this far

TL:DR - I'm a draftsman, working 2 years in this field. I like the work culture in my office but I barely get any work and sit there doing nothing . My pay isn't great either . It sucks.

1ji6kd0,Pregnant While Job Hunting - help,"Hi there, I have been job hunting since last fall and finally am seeing the action pick up, incl a position I may be offered this week. I will also be 26wks pregnant this week. I have kept up the hunt while I had a reasonable amount of time to work before needing leave, but we are moving into <3mos availability now (baby due very early July.) 



I need a job. I've been laid off for almost a year. I know I have to look out for myself as much as possible but I don't want a company to feel like I screwed them over out of the gate. I haven't been mentioning the pregnancy and can hide it easily over Zoom interviews. 



Questions: 

1) The job in the pipeline now recently mentioned a certain deadline in Oct. Oct would be right when I would be returning from a traditional 3mo leave. I am happy to be flexible and start returning PT earlier than that, but still think it would be a risk to the deadline. Do I tell them all this, and if so when? How would be best to present this information?

2) If I don't get this job... how long can I ethically continue looking? Should I keep going, but just start mentioning the pregnancy up front? 

  
Any advice would be very helpful. THANK YOU!!!",unicornjibjab,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1742755854,2025-03-23 18:50:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ji6kd0/pregnant_while_job_hunting_help/,3,2025
1ji60ka,Master of Nursing vs Masters in Counselling Psychology,"
Canada based. 
I‚Äôm in my late 20s. Have been a registered nurse for 5 years now. Work in hospice palliative care home care coordination. 

This winter I applied for 3 Master of Nursing programs and 1 Master of Arts in Counselling Psychology. Still waiting on responses from each university. As the time goes on I can‚Äôt decide which to choose. 

My original intention was to apply for Master of Nursing. I simply cannot do bedside care and care coordination is causing burnout. Regardless of that, it‚Äôs always been my intention to do a masters and the timing now was aligned. Goal with MN was to work in program development, policy analysis, research, education. (I will come back to this). 

Nursing aside, I have always had a secret interest for psychotherapy. How I approach my patients feels therapeutic and this is why the bedside has been a challenge for me and why I specialized in palliative care. Acute care just felt too medical and people were less human. In palliative care I get to slow down and talk with people about tough decisions and how they‚Äôre coping. BUT I was too afraid to pursue psychotherapy due to it being a big change away from nursing which I‚Äôve been in since age 18. And other opinions. 

Pros and cons:
Pro of staying in nursing feels like I could build on what I already know. I understand the systems and it‚Äôs my experience that will keep pushing me forward. Pro also would be that there is more job security, a union usually to protect me. Feels more secure in general. Cons being that I worry I will get exhausted and burnt out anyway. With a MN I will be further away from patient care. I will be working with people but I may be more like a manager, broad options though. 

Pro of transferring to psych being that even though it will be a change, I feel interested in it which will help me learn. I have transferable skills for this field. I also see how healthcare and chronic illness affects people and their families. Understanding of grief. Autonomy in my work. Continuing to work with people/clients. 
Con being the worry for set back of changing fields. The money to start up a change in career and all of the licensing compared to master of nursing. The large cost of setting up a practice. Insecurity of maintaining a practice. Everything being new to me. Not having colleagues. Being in one set type of work the rest of my career. 

Annnnd both having the con of worrying that I made the wrong choice. Help ",03piggies,1,1.0,0,1742754439,2025-03-23 18:27:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ji60ka/master_of_nursing_vs_masters_in_counselling/,3,2025

1ji5wrt,Considering a Career Shift from Project Management to Data Analytics‚ÄîIs a 1-Year European Master‚Äôs a Smart Move?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm at a bit of a crossroads in my career and could use some perspective.

Background:
	‚Ä¢	Bachelor‚Äôs in Power Engineering
	‚Ä¢	MBA in Healthcare Management (India)
	‚Ä¢	3 years of experience as a Project Manager at a large IT services company in Bangalore, India
	‚Ä¢	Work has primarily involved managing digital and data-oriented projects in healthcare/pharma tech

While the role is stable and decently paid, I‚Äôve been strongly considering a career shift into data analytics, something I‚Äôve developed a growing interest in through my work. To facilitate this, I‚Äôm planning to pursue a 1-year Master‚Äôs in Data Analytics from a European university.

I‚Äôve shortlisted Ireland, the Netherlands, and Finland for their reputed programs and post-study work opportunities‚Äîbut I‚Äôm open to suggestions beyond these as well.

What I‚Äôm trying to figure out:
	‚Ä¢	Is this a strategic move for someone with my background, or would gaining certifications/experience without another degree be better?
	‚Ä¢	Which country (in Europe or beyond) offers the best long-term prospects for this kind of transition‚Äîparticularly for someone from a non-EU background?
	‚Ä¢	How should I position my experience in project management during/after the degree when looking for analytics roles?
	‚Ä¢	Are there scholarships or funding options worth exploring for professionals with 3+ years of experience?

I‚Äôd really appreciate insights from anyone who‚Äôs made a similar switch or has hiring experience in this space. Open to honest takes‚Äîjust trying to make a well-informed decision before making a major move.

1ji5vdq,At a crossroads early in my career,"I have been a news videographer for almost two years since I got out of college, it‚Äôs not something that I thought I was going to do but I got the opportunity and develop my skills a lot in a short amount of time.

I am Part 107 certified/ Covered multiple presidential rallies to the most mundane news stories

Currently I have been driving over an hour everyday to work (9-5 shift) at a market in the 160+ range but I‚Äôm ready to move on from it after being thrown into a bigger role constantly without a rise in pay.

I had a great interviewed with a top 30 market this past week and I was told:

‚ÄúBottom line on your shooting and editing: Your work is not a barrier to moving you forward in the hiring process.‚Äù

The barrier is they know I‚Äôve expressed my thoughts on getting out of the business and finding a new career path as well (not a clue what I would do though, I just know the job is very demanding sometimes) 

The shift I would be moving into would be evening shift including weekends. This job would also be an hour away as well (with a commuter car)

My other option is that there is a position opening up in my hometown (where most of my family and friends are, and myself reside lol) that I was just contacted about which is a market in the 120 range. 

I was on air talent a lot in college but I needed a job after i graduated and my current job came up. I knew next to nothing about editing when I started, now I have the opportunity to progress.

What do you guys say is best for me?

TL;DR: 

-Top 30 news market an hour away

-My hometown top 120 news market

- A different career path all together

1ji5ltt,Is it bad to switch jobs every few months?,"Hey guys! I‚Äôm 23, and recently graduated with a B.A. in Psychology & Data Science. I moved to a mountain town in August so that my partner and I no longer had to do long distance (he ski patrols) where I worked as a Forest school teacher for 5 months, then worked as a Child Protection Specialist for 3 months and now work as a house manager/cook and at a coffee shop (coming up on two months soon). I left my teaching job due to poor work environment and my CPS position due to pay and how mentally taxing it was. I have plans to work landscaping starting in May because of the pay, consistent full-time hours so I wouldn‚Äôt have to work multiple jobs and the positive impact being outside all day has on my mental health. I haven‚Äôt worked inside during the summer, even in the fall, the last three years and I‚Äôm not really willing to give that habit up. 

I‚Äôm suddenly in my head about how that will look to employers and individuals around me. Given that I live in a mountain town, it‚Äôs expensive, and a lot of positions don‚Äôt pay well enough to support living here but both the house manager and landscaping job do. I‚Äôm also waiting to get in-state tuition (in the fall or spring) so that I can get a post-bac in pre med. my long term goal is to go to a DO school and become a nutritional psychiatrist and approach mental health struggles from lifestyle habits and then medicate if needed. That being said, I feel like within the last year I‚Äôve been switching jobs and feel like that will look poorly. I‚Äôm a hard worker and super motivated, but very sensitive about my environment and need a lot of mental stimulation which is why I‚Äôm excited to go back to school. Is it silly to landscape this summer when the coffee shop and house manager position support me financially but I‚Äôm not super satisfied? Would love your guys‚Äô advice because I‚Äôm feeling a bit lost! 

I‚Äôd also like to add that during my undergrad I maintained the same position for three years during the summer (mountain bike coach) and was a research assistant and TA for the last two years of my undergrad.

1ji5kcf,Automation Engineer Considering a Pivot to Finance Worth It?,"Hey everyone,
I've been working as an automation engineer in the pharma industry for the past three years, and while I enjoy the technical aspects of my job, l've always been drawn toward finance-particularly trading and data analytics. I'm wondering if anyone here has made a similar shift or has insights on how automation/data skills transfer into finance.
A few things I've been considering.

- Trading: I find markets fascinating, and I'm curious about algorithmic trading, quant strategies, and using automation to develop trading models.

- Data Analytics: Given my experience in automation, I already work with data, trends, and process optimization. I feel like analytics could be a useful bridge into finance and could even help with career growth in automation.

- Part-Time Approach: I'm not looking to make a full leap immediately. I'd like to learn and possibly gain experience on the side while continuing my current job.

Has anyone here successfully balanced learning finance/trading while working in engineering? Is worth pursuing part-time?

1ji5gbf,"I‚Äôm 22, about to graduate with my bachelors in finance and have a supply chain job lined up, but I don‚Äôt really like business","Essentially, I have a lot of different interests, but when I graduated high school and it was time to go to community college I didn‚Äôt really know what to do. So my sister/dad told me to choose business administration and I could figure it out down the line. My dad also was going to pay for my college so he didn‚Äôt want me to pick what was in his eyes a ‚Äúuseless‚Äùmajor. 

Got my associates in business administration at community college. I guess I wasn‚Äôt really thinking ahead at the reality that this would be my life/career in the future. I‚Äôve seen things on here where people ask if someone truly hates their career/field or just their current position. While I think I‚Äôm pretty logical, good with numbers, good at keeping track of stuff, etc. I‚Äôm realizing now I don‚Äôt like business at ALL. 

There are so many other things I‚Äôd rather be doing. In college so far the classes I actually enjoyed were my business law classes because of the law aspect to the class, my political philosophy class, and the basic history classes I had to take. Everything I learned about business/finance I did not find interesting at all. Fortunately I had some great professors that made the classes bearable but the stuff I was learning was not interesting to me. 

I know it‚Äôs my life/career and I should be in charge and it‚Äôs foolish to do this if I don‚Äôt like it. But like I said earlier, going through the classes the reality didn‚Äôt fully set in that this would be my career/life until it was pretty much my last year and too late to switch majors entirely. When I went to a different college for my last two years on my bachelor, I literally picked finance just because that‚Äôs what my sister was doing. There was a time I brought up one of my interests to my dad/sister and they said it was more of a hobby than a career. My dad was basically saying if he was going to pay for my college he wouldn‚Äôt be paying for it if I chose a major related to that job. 

I told them I really liked writing when it was stuff I cared about and I would have loved to be an investigative journalist, wildlife journalist, or sports journalist as I love sports, nature/animals, and I‚Äôm super curious and love to find things out if I don‚Äôt know something. I always excelled in writing in high school and my senior year I actually was on my schools newspaper board as a writer/editor and took creative writing classes. I loved interviewing teachers and students and getting outlooks from them and then writing about it for different stories for the school paper. Looking back I really wish I decided that I‚Äôd rather be in a major I love paying for it than a major I hate getting financial support from my family. Unfortunately I took the route of staying in finance because my family (dad) was paying for my college. 

Not only this, but my family had a family friend who was a senior manager in supply chain in a company and said as long as I had good grades and a decent resume (I had previous jobs on my resume and a 4.0 GPA) he could get me a supply chain internship at his company for the summer before my senior year as he knew I was a good kid and a very hard worker (last summer). I ended up getting the internship, excelling at it, and now I have a full time offer that I accepted in supply chain. I basically just went through with all this because the opportunities were there and my dad really didn‚Äôt want me to pass them up.

But like I said, I know I don‚Äôt like it and I hate business. While I met some great people at my internship I did not like what I was doing. It wasn‚Äôt the absolute worst thing in the world, but every week during my internship I longed for the weekends. Because I was doing a good job they put even more work on my plate as an intern so my schedule was full and the job became stressful. I still did good but I didn‚Äôt like it. Sitting at a desk all day doing all these tasks I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. Even if I had a different work environment doing similar things I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it. Deep down I know this, yet I‚Äôm going down this career path and now I‚Äôm realizing I don‚Äôt want my life to be like this. 

I know that was a whole lot of words without even getting to what I want advice on‚Ä¶ but I just wanted to give a synopsis of my situation and what led to it. I‚Äôm going to be graduating this spring with my bachelors in finance and this summer I start my full time job in supply chain. But I truly don‚Äôt even want to be in business. I hope to stay in this job/career for a little while and then make a major career change down the line. 

I don‚Äôt exactly know what I want to do‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs sooooo many other things I would enjoy instead of business/supply chain. Unironically, being a lawyer, chef, journalist, anything to do with nature or traveling, a dietician/nutritionist, something in the physical or mental health field, something in the music industry, something in the sports industry, honestly any type of media industry (shows, movies, art, video games) or even just a career where I get to work with my hands rather than sit at a desk all day are all things I could genuinely look at myself and say I‚Äôd really like to do that as a job. 

When it comes to supply chain and business overall I see myself waking up for work and dreading it because it FEELS like work. I want to do something where I wake up and actually enjoy doing it. 

So I guess I want to know, and I know it‚Äôs definitely dependent on so many factors especially because I don‚Äôt know the specific field to switch into yet, how hard will it be down the line when I went to make an absolute career change? And how long/what are the basic steps for it? Is it really doable to do an entire career change out of business/supply chain like I want? Will my current resume even allow me to pursue jobs in other entirely different fields, or do I need to go back to school entirely/get a masters in something completely different? Should I be building up my network in this new field when I decide what I want to pursue? Is there anyone out there who did a complete career change after deciding they don‚Äôt like what they‚Äôre doing and has some advice from their personal experiences? 

If you read this far, I greatly appreciate it and would love some advice. At least for the time being I‚Äôm going to be going through with graduating and starting this job just so I have a full time job for now and can have the finances in the future to make a career change.

I was invited to a¬†**second interview**, which was much tougher, with lots of challenging questions. I didn‚Äôt feel great about it, but at the end, the hiring manager said the next step would be to meet me in person.

1ji553k,am i going over the top???,"hello! i‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this to, but i wanted to give it a shot. sorry if this isn‚Äôt the right place!!!
a little bit of background first:
this past october i had a shadowing interview for a company that i ended up getting ghosted by shortly after the interview. which is fine, i understand that a lot of places don‚Äôt let the candidate know that they didn‚Äôt get the job. but they told me i did extremely well the whole way through and that they would be contacting me very soon. (spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt.)
now, what i‚Äôm mostly confused about though is the fact that i was told that the shadowing/working interview i attended would be paid. after the interview i waited a few days to hear back from them and never did. so, i sent the manager who i was SUPPOSED to be shadowing at the working interview (she never showed up that day, though). now that i‚Äôm currently looking at the dates i can see that i sent the first email about 5 days after the interview, where i was just reaching out to follow up because i had called a few times over the couple of days of waiting and never got ahold of someone. after 16 days later i sent a second email, basically saying that i understand i did not get the position, but pointing out the fact that i was promised pay for the shadowing interview and have not received said pay. 
she responded pretty quickly the same day,, literally within the hour. she asked me for a good mailing address so they can have a check sent to me. i gave her my address and also added that i could stop by in-person to pick it up if it makes it any easier. she replied with ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay! we‚Äôll get one sent to you!‚Äù. 

that was on october 18th of last year. i have not received anything in the mail from them and i have not gotten a call or email or anything like that either. i know it was probably only going to be a $50ish dollar check,, but times are hard right now. i‚Äôm 20 years old trying to maintain renting an apartment on my own, so i really need all the money i can get right now. 
i decided to take a shot in the dark and send another email today, just letting her know that i haven‚Äôt received the check in the mail. i‚Äôm pretty sure she knows, but i‚Äôm kinda just grasping at straws at this point. 

am i going over the top?? i feel like i‚Äôm doing way too much for this, but again, i‚Äôm NOT in a good financial position right now and honestly need all i can get.

I really need a path to follow, even if it's a vague one, what important to me is that the career is flexible in terms of changing jobs, maybe changing expertise too (not that important) and the most important thing is that the jobs are location flexible. Timings and pay aren't a big deal to me, as long as they don't give me a burnout even on weekends I don't have any time left that type stuff is just not what I want. For the pay part, as long as it's decent enough to survive with a few bucks saved it's all good.

I know there are tons of accounts like this, but I don‚Äôt know where else to start. Do you have any idea how to stand out? Maybe a trending photography style, copywriting tips, anything. Maybe an actually uselful Udemy course you took? I will be thankful for any tips or motivation.

1ji33yg,Should I list a job on my resume if it was only for 2-3 months?,"TLDR: Started a job about a month ago and planning to leave it once I finish grad school and not sure if I should have it on my resume. 

Little background. I‚Äôm currently in my final semester of Grad school and am finishing in early May. I plan to start looking for a full time job at a CPA firm once I graduate starting immediately. 

I currently have a part time job I‚Äôve been working for a little over a year that while it sounds impressive doesn‚Äôt pay the bills. 

I started a second part time job in late February which is fairly intense and would look nice in a resume if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that I‚Äôll be leaving it in 2ish months. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should even list it on my resume since I‚Äôll have been there such a short time even though my role there is a decent one that does apply to what I‚Äôm trying to do full time. 

I had a temp role right out of college which ended up hurting me a lot because I just worked while the regular person was on maternity leave and now it sticks out as a red flag.

1ji31qj,Should I choose job over manager?,"Hi
So I‚Äôm bad at decision making and woud like to seek for some advice here‚Ä¶
When I was unemployed last year, I had an opportunity to work at a domestic corporation. 

The unexpected thing was that the job was not my forte but focused on a very small aspect of digital marketing. At that time, I was quite confused, but because of the money, I continued to do it until now. Luckily, my manager was very understanding and kind, very thoughtful for me. But I still feel uneasy because there are many other aspects of digital marketing that I am missing. I cannot develop as I wish if I continue here. So I applied for another job opportunity and I received an offer. 
The other job seemed to give me the opportunity to learn more comprehensively about digital marketing, but at the same time, the workload would be heavier. My future line manager will be quite high-ranking, so I think the relationship would not be as close, and the salary increase is not high. I was really confused because I really appreciate my current manager, but I also did not want to miss the opportunity to go back to doing the thing I always want. 
I talked to my current manager already and understood that there are not many solutions in my current job. 

I am very worried and do not know what to choose. My manager even confronted me to take the opportunity and if I fail, I can come back. But I still feel very indecisive in this current job market.",IntelligentToe8925,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1742746945,2025-03-23 16:22:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ji31qj/should_i_choose_job_over_manager/,3,2025

I had previously worked for this company probably around 6-9 years ago. It wasn‚Äôt software related at all, it was more of a call center customer service role. I started off doing great with the company and then towards the end I started having issues, including lying to why I was missing work (once I had used up all sick time), and then coming clean that I was lying about it. I was put on a warning after that and then got another job and wound up leaving (I‚Äôm pretty sure I gave my 2 weeks notice as well). 

I marked that I had worked at the company when applying to this new position and also had mentioned I worked for the company awhile back during the phone screen. 

My only worry is that they keep this employee record on file for when they do their background check.

I recently worked as a full-time Android Developer at a company. From the moment i joined, the work environment was extremely toxic. The founder and management constantly insulted me, called me a fool, and made it clear they wanted me to quit but being jobless for 3-4 months i didn't quit.

After about 15 days, the mistreatment escalated,they started forcing me to work till 2-3 AM, which was never part of my contract. Despite all this, I held on, hoping things would improve. But after enduring a full month of harassment, I decided to leave after receiving my salary.

Now, they are threatening legal action against me for not serving the notice period and demanding that I return my salary. I checked my contract, and while there is a 2 months notice period mentioned, there is no clear penalty for leaving early.

My question is:

1. Can they actually take legal action against me, or are they just bluffing?
2. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you handle it?
3. Would you have done the same in my situation?

1jhzk39,Got an Offer ‚Äî Equity Dropped. How Should I Negotiate?,"Hey all,

I just received an offer from a startup and would love some outside perspective before I go back to negotiate.

The company is not Bay Area-based (though in the U.S.) and the role is fully remote. It‚Äôs a 30-person startup, currently valued at around $50 million. I‚Äôd be joining as a Senior Software Engineer, taking on a key role with significant technical impact. I have a strong background and more than 5 years of experience in this niche.

Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre offering:
	‚Ä¢	$200K base salary
	‚Ä¢	$90K in equity (vested 4 years, 1 year clif)
	‚Ä¢	Health coverage
	‚Ä¢	Paid time off

I had initially proposed $190K base with $200K in equity, so while I‚Äôm happy with the base raise, I‚Äôm a bit surprised to see the equity portion reduced by more than half. Given my expected impact and the company‚Äôs stage, I was hoping for more meaningful upside.

The manager is claiming the equity is on par with some employees that joined way earlier

Looking for advice on:
1) Does this sound like a fair offer for this stage and setup (remote, not Bay Area, startup, etc.)?
2) How can I approach a counter-offer focused on increasing equity, while keeping the tone collaborative and positive?

Now they're saying I actually need to manage 10 teams (25+ people, 10 direct reports) and I'll have a new supervisor. This is not what I expected and it's not something I ever wanted to do. I was very happy with 3-4 teams under the supervision of my old boss - when I took the promotion, this was all supposed to stay the same.

However, nothing's in writing and I haven't signed paperwork of any kind.

I plan on talking to my old manager for their guidance, but I might have to talk to my new manager immediately and tell them that I do not want to manage 10 teams. I need to say that I will likely not perform well in this circumstance before it actually happens.

The biggest issue is - the company sees me as literally the only one who can manage 10 teams. They don't like anyone else... But that's not my problem. There are people capable of the role; they just don't like their 'attitude' but that's too bad. I can't be the only one.

I could maybe start as a paralegal and get admitted as a solicitor, but it‚Äôs a such huge commitment for something I‚Äôm unsure about.

Hi everyone, I will list my situation below and you may guess the very clear issue..

‚Ä¢I'm an Egyptian (yes it's a birth debuff)

‚Ä¢Graduated high school in 2017 (at18yo)

‚Ä¢Got a bachelors in Education (major in biology) in 2021. Did it because I was told it was the best option available accoring to my grades in high school (friends got into pharmacy/dentist college bc they cheated like no tomorrow in final highschool exams. Ps. I didn't)

‚Ä¢Found out that pay is sht for teachers in private schools (700 egp/month =\~ 14$/month) and also found out that the government that hire teachers won't hire anymore. (If hired it was at min wage of 6000 egp/130$/month)

‚Ä¢So 22 yo me did some odd jobs for one year then went to uni again for 3 years to get another bachelors in microbiology (from the college of science) that will allow em to work in research/industry. Previous bacgelors did not allow.

‚Ä¢Now 26 yo me will finish that degree in \~ 3 months.

‚Ä¢Since my home town in the middle of friken no where i wasnt able to get any job/research experience.

‚Ä¢Now also finding out that the situation for this uni jobs is also sht and even the research industry is closed on itself.

‚Ä¢I did have an idea of that but before anything i thought having excellent grade gpa (3.7/5‚âà3.6/4) would get me somewhere but apparently not. This country values connections over anything else.

‚Ä¢scholarships are hard i applied for 6. Got rejected from 3 so far. Also in the past 3 years to now i applied for thousands of jobs but again connections > all here

1jhw36k,"I'm lost and confused, what could be the next job for a Research Software Engineer?","Hey everyone, I have been a Research Software Engineer (around 2 years, first job). While the work-life balance is good, the lack of structure here is confusing, no coding standards, chaotic work environment, disorganized technical management and bureaucracy.

My skills:

* Python (CV/ML, packaging, system design) + C/C++ for Python extensions.
* Published a conference paper + a journal article (co-author).

I liked software system architecture/design and would love to continue into that path but I'm worried about next step and keeping up with the rapidly evolving tech nowadays.

Now, I‚Äôm looking for another workplace by the end of this year; although i have applied for jobs last year, I had no luck.

1jhu4es,Career Dilemma - Promotion into Unfamiliar Role vs. 2 Years Exchange Program in US?,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice on a career decision, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.

Profile:  
\- Sales planning/analysis in automotive industry in Australia  
\- in global sales reporting team, created by global CEO  
\- 5+ years of experience  
\- have two young kids

I currently have two potential career paths ahead of me:

# Option 1: Global Exchange Program (1-2 Years in US)

* I have the opportunity to work in the US market as part of a global exchange program.
* This would be an invaluable experience, working in a global team and gaining insights into a key international market.
* However, this is the first time such a transfer is happening between overseas subsidiaries, so the process is unclear. It is more of a discussion between our HR and theirs.
   * Who covers the costs?
   * What benefits would be included?
   * Would family support be provided?
* If I pursue this, I have to turn down the second option and wait for the process to be finalized, which might take a long time (or even fall through).

# Option 2: Digital Data Analyst = Manager Level

* A managerial role in the digital marketing team, which comes with a 30% pay raise, a corporate car, and a fuel card.
* This role is less risky as I stay in Australia, continue my work-life balance, and maintain close family connections.
* It could also open up future career opportunities outside the automotive industry (as data analytics & digital marketing skills are more transferable).
* However, it is not directly related to my current role in sales, which I have passion with.
* My current team is highly recognized (even formed under the CEO's direction), so leaving now might mean missing out on potential opportunities in the future.

# Additional Concern

* I have an off-the-plan apartment under construction, which may require me to meet residency conditions.
* If I move to the U.S., this could create issues with financing or legal conditions for the property.
* My direct manager wasn't happy when this was discussed, and has been against me growing into larger role due to my age (I topped in performance for two consecutive years against the same level and one level higher employees). Recommended me to find a second job for financial, or rather seek for manager role in different department if I want promotion. If none of the two options work out, I potentially be facing additional obstacles ahead of my career progression.

# Main Concerns

* The US opportunity is rare and valuable, but the process is uncertain, and I might end up with nothing if it falls through.
* The managerial role is a safer choice with financial benefits but might not align with my long-term career goals.
* Which option would be better for career growth and stability in the long run?

Would love to hear your thoughts. I need to make decision by tonight as the application of Option 2 closes tomorrow.

Thanks in advance! üôè",patrickyoo_,1,1.0,0,1742716110,2025-03-23 07:48:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jhu4es/career_dilemma_promotion_into_unfamiliar_role_vs/,3,2025
1jhtq8d,Recruiter doesn't want to directly give their best number for counteroffer?,"I applied to a position which the top of the posted salary range is less than my current position, but has the perk of less traveling.

We didn't talk money at the interviews but I was initially given an offer which was just too low, lower than my current position by about 50k. I countered with the number at the top of their advertised range, which is still less than I make currently and explained that although I am willing to take a bit less for the other perks the job can offer, their offer needs to be at least competitive with my current job. 

Recruiter is saying they're not in a position to commit to an offer at the top of their advertised range and is asking me if I can give them a number a little bit lower so we can find a middle ground.

I've got quite a lot of experience under my belt with a wide range of different technologies all across the stack. I love what I do, and this is just as much of a passion/hobby for me as it is a career. However, I am in this really shitty cyclical hell of contract work. It seems like that is the ONLY type of work that's out there in this field.  
That last few years have gone like this for me:  
!. Turn looking into a job into a full time job + more for months.  
2. EVERYTHING is a ""6-12 month contract"" (with the \*\*possibility\*\* of full-time conversion...).  
3. Have to take the first job offer I get because most of my savings is completely gone.  
4. I try to save every god damn penny I get, and pay off every little debt that may have accrued from the last jobless stent. I'm just working all the time and only playing catch up it seems.  
5. Contract over, and the cycle starts again.  
It kind of breaks my heart because I really didn't think that working in this industry would be like this. I'm not here to complain, but I would love some advice. I really enjoy what I do, but this is starting to make me feel like I picked the wrong field to fall in love with, lol.

My conditions are:

- Double dropper
- Got admission to IPU's GTBIT, a Tier 3 college
- No savings in the family
- No house
- Parents earn only ‚Çπ27-28,000 per month
- Parents' credit score is very bad
- I have someone who can become my guarantor for a ‚Çπ6 lakh loan

GTBIT is my option, but I'm worried about:

- Pursuing B.Tech with a loan and the double dropper issue
- Everyone says double droppers face difficulties in getting placement
- I've watched three YouTube videos and spoken to some people, and they say I'll have to work in small startups for very low pay
- I don't know if it's true that double droppers can't earn more than ‚Çπ6 lakh per annum
- If I don't get a good job, I won't be able to repay the loan, which is my biggest fear

Other options I'm considering are:

- IGNOU BCA, followed by MCA from DU, but that will take five years and the double dropper issue will still be there
- By the time I'm 25, I'll have to support my family, and I don't want to be stuck in a low-paying job

Sometimes I feel like ending my life or working as an Uber driver. Please suggest any other career options.

My father is working, and there's no issue with that. The reason I'm a double dropper is that I got admission to DTU's chemical engineering program, but my loan was rejected.

During my double dropper years, my family's financial situation worsened, but it's better now. I just don't want to live in a rented house.

I was struggling with depression, but after watching a video by Alakh Sir, I realized I need to train my brain and not take tension. I'm feeling better now, and I'm ready to work hard. Please guide me.

1jhsc4t,I feel like new management is actively holding me back from moving up in the company.,"Early 30‚Äôs male, no education beyond high school diploma, net take home for 2024 is less than 40k. Currently working for a small company with 35-40 employees. Niche company that makes decent revenue and profit margins are great. 

Myself, I have 15 years experience in manufacturing, most of it being inventory control, production scheduling and planning, and entry level team lead/supervisor type roles.

I worked for one company most of my working career for 10 years, and then started over in a new state at a new company where I ended up with a massive pay cut (which is fine, I have no problem Working my way back up).

Since my time being with this company, I went from being only inventory control to now absorbing three other employees responsibilities who were fired or laid off, along with supply chain/production planning responsibilities that I had been doing on my
own without any increase in pay or title change because i can‚Äôt just watch the boat sink. But since I‚Äôve been experiencing more and more
Burnout I have cut out that part from my day to
Day, and it certainly is being noticed.

I was told blatantly that after the three employees were fired/laid off that I would
not be getting any compensation increase and I would not be getting any help for at least 6 months. This immediately sent me into extreme anxiety given I am now the only one doing all of these half ass handed down tasks. 

During this time I have been asking over and over what my expected responsibilities are I was told to create my own job description. Which is incredible to me given nobody knows what standards or expectations I am being held to come year end review and it‚Äôs time to justify a certain raise or promotion. 

My old manager had been teaching my how to
execute the production planning and scheduling because he simply did not have the time and wanted to help me out for a promotion. It appears he saw the not so fun times ahead and left the company, which I cant blame him for. But now new management has come in and turned everything upside down and is flustering everyone and people are leaving AND being removed left and right for questioning decisions, being called ‚Äúnot a team player‚Äù 

I‚Äôm worried that with my questioning of decisions if I haven‚Äôt been labeled as ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù or something of that nature to keep me locked in my current position and not progress. Which if that‚Äôs the case I feel
I truly have no business continuing with the company.

I'm 18 years old, I dropped out of high school at 16, was homeschooled before that. I have a problem where it's really difficult for me to focus on learning anything or studying or really taking on any responsibility. I'm trying to get my first job soon and stuff, I wanna build up work ethic and stuff, but I'm having a really hard time seeing myself doing college essays and assignments and all that for a degree that there's a chance might not even get me a job. I'm really good with computers, I always thought I'd go for computer science and do something like data analytics or cybersecurity, but I've heard a lot that those careers are really oversaturated and I honestly don't know what to do. On the other hand, I feel like I'd do really good in service jobs (stuff like retail, waiting tables, etc), I have really good social skills... But I also have big goals, so I don't know if it's possible to make the life I want happen. I'm also in the lower class, so the odds are pretty stacked against me. 

My main goal in life is to be able to move to a big city like Chicago, LA, or NYC. I want good access to public transit, I'm okay with roommates for a while, I'd like to be able to get a place of my own at some point though (after a few years), that way I can have family over and stuff. I'd also like to travel occasionally, I have a long list of places I'd like to visit in my lifetime.   
  
I don't wanna wait til I'm old asf though to do all this, I wanna start making moves now, that way I can enjoy my 20s. Sorry if this ain't enough to go off of, feel free to ask questions. I have goals in mind, just no idea how to achieve them.

1jhq4b5,How do I navigate last minute references? Help!,"So I have recently interviewed and accepted a role with Swissport at my local airport which I have been informed requires a 5 year background check in order to apply for security clearance and such.
My issue is they‚Äôve given a start date of next Monday and asked that I provide references for everything I‚Äôve done in the last 5 years with a 24 hour deadline from when the link was sent on Friday which I missed until outside working hours as I was out for the day.

I have filled everything in and sent it off as I really can‚Äôt afford to lose the offer with a message asking them to refrain from contacting anyone until Tuesday so I can be courteous and notify them however this has all come about so quickly that I didn‚Äôt contact any references beforehand as I naively thought I‚Äôd have more time.

They will only accept previous managers too so I wasn‚Äôt able to put down coworkers who I‚Äôm in regular contact with.

Please can someone help with how best to notify them without seeming entitled? I know this is my mess up for not being better prepared but it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been through the process and I‚Äôm still fairly green in my career so the thought didn‚Äôt even cross my mind- lesson learned though! 

I‚Äôm thinking call/email them all Monday morning and ask if they will confirm my employment for the clearance checks and if any say no then I have time to contact the vetting company? Do I just tell them I‚Äôve listed them as I was put on the spot and that I‚Äôm sorry for not being able to get in touch beforehand?

1jhpiwp,Need Help Navigating a Tricky Resignation,"I moved abroad recently with my husband (I‚Äôm from Germany) and got a job through one of his contacts at a local company. I applied for a software engineering role, but during the interview they said they didn‚Äôt have any internal developers ‚Äî they outsourced everything ‚Äî and wanted me to come in, improve delivery, set up structure, and eventually build an internal team. That sounded exciting, and I was told I‚Äôd also handle ‚Äúinfrastructure,‚Äù which I assumed meant cloud stuff ‚Äî things I actually have experience with.

Well, ‚ÄúInfrastructure‚Äù turned out to be IT support. Setting up laptops, helping with email issues, tracking down missing equipment. I was told it was ‚Äújust a small part‚Äù of the job and I could hire someone for it. It wasn‚Äôt small. It was most of it.

To make things worse, I started with just a laptop. No monitor, mouse, or keyboard. I brought my own stuff from home and kept asking for equipment. They finally gave me a monitor ‚Äî by taking it from someone else‚Äôs desk.

The office is overcrowded. Bathrooms are locked and you need to ask for a key. Sometimes there‚Äôs no water or power. Internet at my desk was 12 Mbps on good days.

My husband works at a local company with much better conditions, so I know it‚Äôs possible. I understand that working abroad (in an developping country) comes with certain adjustments, but a lot of what I experienced felt less like ‚Äúcontext‚Äù and more like poor resource management. For example, the internet at the office was once cut off because the bill wasn‚Äôt paid on time.

There‚Äôs an in-office-only policy. I managed to work from home sometimes (for meetings or full days), but it felt like a favor, and I was reminded to ‚Äúbe mindful of others.‚Äù

As for the dev team ‚Äî they‚Äôre external, in Eastern Europe. They don‚Äôt speak English. Code is stored in personal accounts, there‚Äôs no testing, no process, no documentation. Deployments are done by dragging files from someone‚Äôs local machine to production servers. I‚Äôve asked for months for a README or setup instructions and still have nothing. I can‚Äôt even run the code locally.

I was told to join their daily meetings, but they‚Äôre in Russian. I show up, they don‚Äôt translate, and I just sit there. But my manager (who‚Äôs also the CEO) keeps telling me to ‚Äúpush them,‚Äù show leadership, and make sure they‚Äôre using Jira (our task tracking tool). They barely interact with me.

The final straw? The one part of the role I was excited about ‚Äî helping build a new fleet management tool ‚Äî was dropped. Now they want me to just find an off-the-shelf product. About a month in, I decided to quiet quitting. Doing the bare minimum while applying for remote SWE roles. I knew the market was tough, but I hoped to find something before my probation ended.

I finally talked to my CEO this week. To his credit, he listened and said, *‚ÄúWe put you in an uncomfortable position.‚Äù* He offered to renegotiate the contract, let me hire engineers, restructure everything, and give me the authority I‚Äôd need to lead properly. He said all the right things: *‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give up. You lead. They must comply. We own the solution.¬† I‚Äôll back you.‚Äù* ¬†However, I feel like I wasn‚Äôt hired to build something ‚Äî I was hired to manage someone else‚Äôs mess. Regaining ownership in their case is much more than having better development processes but actually requires politics. Maybe the lines were blurred on purpose , maybe not. Either way, I can‚Äôt keep doing this.

Literally minutes after that call,  I checked my inbox and I got a job offer for a remote engineering role with a German cpmpany. I didn‚Äôt expect something to land that quickly ‚Äî especially not after I thought I bombed the interview.

My husband, who‚Äôs close to the CEO, pressured me to message him immediately and ask him not to take any action just yet. He said I owed him that ‚Äî especially since the CEO had mentioned he planned to ‚Äúfix things‚Äù over the weekend by talking to the PM.  So I sent this message,

*""Thank you again for our discussion ‚Äî I really appreciated your openness and your willingness to take action so quickly.*

*Since then, I‚Äôve taken some time to reflect on everything we talked about, and I would really appreciate the chance to speak with you again before anything moves forward with PM.*

*Let me know what time would work best for you tomorrow, or we can also talk Monday after the planning. Let me know what works best for you.""*

 I plan to resign on Monday. The CEO is abroad, and I wish I could do it in person, but my probation ends in two weeks and I need to act quickly.¬†

**Here‚Äôs where I could really use some support:**

* How do I resign gracefully in this situation ‚Äî especially after my CEO offered to take action?  
* Should I mention the offer, or just keep things high-level and professional?  

I feel emotionally drained. After sending that message, the whole thing feels heavier than I expected. I was actually on sick leave the week before all of this, which adds another layer. Under normal circumstances, I probably wouldn‚Äôt feel this conflicted ‚Äî but with everything going on, and the social component tied to my husband‚Äôs connection, something just feels off.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions on how to navigate this properly. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read through all of this.",Business_Wallaby_459,1,0.6600000262260437,0,1742698025,2025-03-23 02:47:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jhpiwp/need_help_navigating_a_tricky_resignation/,3,2025

But a friend of mine said that there‚Äôs a little room to grow here and there‚Äôs a slim chance of being a real manager or a regional manager or going further than these positions, almost impossible to redirect myself to work at a company‚Äôs head office.

1jhoorm,Boss asked me how much money it will take for me to stay and now I don‚Äôt know what to do,"I have been working at a law firm for 3 years. However, I have not been working in the capacity as an attorney because I did not pass the bar exam. I have been working as a ‚Äúparalegal‚Äù and do perform paralegal duties, but I also do pretty much every attorney task that I can legally. The only things I do not do is sign my name to documents, go to court, and go to mediations. I do legal analysis and provide legal advice in writing and then an attorney just signs their name to it. I view myself as essentially a ghost writer. 

I am not happy with how much I am paid for the level of responsibility I am given. It is evident to me they need me, both because of my skill set but also because they have been having staffing issues for well over a year. I was never happy with the compensation that they offered me, but I figured it was my fault given that I didn‚Äôt pass the bar and let them down. Though, in the back of my head I always knew that I was providing them with 85% of an attorney for a steep discount. Since I started at the firm, I have been given 3 or 4 raises that have increased my salary a total of 9k. 

I was talking to one of my friends from work that is a secretary. She has worked for the firm half the time I have and in her role, she does not do any substantive legal work. She is also not responsible for billing clients, therefore she does not generate any revenue for the firm. I told her how much I make and she was stunned that we earn the same amount per year. She was under the impression that I earn 15 to 20k more than I do. Now that I know they are paying the legal secretaries the same as someone who went to law school and performs attorney work, I am really curious as to how much the other paralegals at this firm are earning. I always suspected that I am the lowest paid paralegal, even though the other paralegals do not have to perform the tasks that I do, but now I am sure that I am the lowest paid.

I got a new paralegal job at a law firm that is commonly opposing counsel against my current firm. All the attorneys at my current firm know all of the attorneys at the new firm both professionally and personally. The new firm offered me 6k more than my current salary. This isn‚Äôt mind blowing, but I thought the fresh start would be worth it. Plus, at their firm, I would not be assuming any attorney responsibilities and do not have to bill hours to clients. 

I put in my resignation and within 10 minutes I get a call from my boss. He told me if I don‚Äôt like my work, they can give it to someone else and get me something new or if it is a money thing we can talk it out. He told me that only 2 weeks notice would put them in a real bind due to the previously mentioned staffing difficulties. Also, I know that they will not be able to find anyone that can do or will do the work I do for what they are currently paying me. He asked me if I could stay for 30 days and I told him that I did not know because the new job wants me in 2 weeks. He stated that he would call my new boss and talk to him! He did, and they agreed that they will wait 30 days for me to start the new job, as they do not want any ‚Äúbad blood‚Äù between the two firms. 

My boss than came into my office and told me to take the weekend to think about whether I really want to leave and let him know Monday. He stated that he likes me, does not want me to leave, and can ‚Äúdo things‚Äù for me should I chose to stay. I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I feel like my current employer is taking advantage of me. Many of the senior attorneys at my firm have told me that I am better at the job and more competent than the new attorneys they hired after me. They are very overworked and need me there to do the overflow attorney work they do not have time for that the other paralegals do not know how to do. On the other hand, I have heard mixed reviews about my new employer. Some people say it is great while others say it is hell there. 

Should I try to negotiate with my current employer or just stick by my resignation? If I try to negotiate, I was thinking of asking for a 10 to 15k salary increase and the ability to be remote 1 to 2 days per week. 

TLDR: I found out that I am being paid the same as coworkers that have a fraction of the responsibilities. I got a new job and gave my notice but my boss wants to know what it would take for me to stay. Do I try to negotiate or just stick to my resignation?

1jhmo6r,Is 70-78K offer worth moving to Montreal?,"Hello everyone,

My company is moving my job to Montreal and I've received an offer to work there for 78K for a fulltime week. 
As I am also studying for my master degree in Europe I have to take 1 afternoon per week off to follow my courses so I can't work fulltime. That leaves me with about 71K gross income.
Is this worth moving to Montreal for? 

I've budgeted rent & WiFi & insurance on around 2200, groceries on 600, mobile phone on 50, costs to pay off my masters on 400 & then 200 per month for 2 flights back home a year (once to see the parents & once for emergencies/just in case). 
Going out; 200, tennisclasses 100 & netflix/spotify etc 24. 
All in all my spending budget comes down to 3808 which leaves me with 415 a month for clothes and other expenses.
I have not deducted for my pension plan (at least 4%).
The company does pay part of transport and health benefits as well.

Online calculators say my net income should be 50691. Or 4225  p/m.

Is this budget realistic, and am I right to think this will be tight? I am very doubtful of accepting. I would love to move here for the experience (both for my career and personal) but in my home country the job market is very good and I am not stressed about becoming jobless and could earn better there.

For context; I am 28 and single and would like to have a social life. Definitely want to learn French when moving here as well.

I am 23 earning decent money as an automation engineer for a biotech company. I feel lost as to what to start next.

Money too. I do want to get enough money to support my hobbies (motorcycles and cars lol). But my question is:

1. to the people who were confused as to which masters program, how did you resolve that issue? There is just so many programs that are interesting and fun but obviously, I can't do all of them and so, what was your first step in figuring out your program?

1jhlg78,Is It Too Late to Start Over?,"Well, I'm 30 now.  
For my career, I‚Äôve done the following: I completed an interior design apprenticeship, worked random retail jobs, and for the past 10 years, I‚Äôve been doing alright with a YouTube channel. On average, I made a bit more than I would‚Äôve in a regular 9-to-5, but I absolutely hate it by now, and it‚Äôs no longer enough to support myself. My motivation to keep doing it as a full-time career is gone. If I were to calculate the amount of hours I put in over the years compared to the money I made, I was probably working for less than minimum wage.

While I was doing YouTube, I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last forever, so I decided to go to university and get a bachelor‚Äôs degree. I had no clear direction, so I chose something relatively easy that would allow me to keep working‚Äîended up finishing a degree in Media & Communication Science.

Now, my situation feels kinda bleak. It seems like, for my degree to be worth anything, I‚Äôd need to be an extrovert with excellent networking skills, or someone who already has the right connections. The skills I used to make a living don‚Äôt seem to hold much value anymore either.

I'm considering learning to become a data analyst, since it looks like something I could actually enjoy‚Äîand from what I‚Äôve seen, it seems possible to learn the basics in a few months. But looking at job postings here in Austria, it seems like most companies are asking for people with math or statistics master‚Äôs degrees. So maybe this is just a pipe dream, and I‚Äôd end up sinking more time into something that doesn‚Äôt lead anywhere.

I also need to make money now, and I‚Äôd really love to avoid going back to retail. But after sending out around 100 applications for various marketing-related jobs, and with there being a lack of regular office jobs in rural Austria, I honestly just feel lost.

1jhjx8s,I need a job where I can sit. I feel limited with not a lot of experience. Does anybody have any advice?,"I have chronic pain and problems with mobility due to a health condition. I absolutely cannot be on my feet for several hours a day, as I will lose my ability to coordinate my movements and will not be able to stand or walk without falling. 

My job history is not great. My longest stretch of work was as an undergrad TA while I was in college. It would have been great experience if I had stayed in my field, but I changed majors and ultimately dropped out of school, which was a horrible decision that completely destroyed my life. I plan on going back to school, but I plan on working at the same time. 

Right now I have a job that's like, half call center and half data entry. It's office based, so I can sit. But I may be leaving to another state soon and I will most likely not be able to keep this job (even though it would be perfectly doable remotely... something about taxes, I don't really understand the problem but apparently there is one). 

I've only been at this job for a few months, and it's the only job I've had that has been office work. I only got it because I was already working for this company in a different position. I was getting limited accommodations, but they were honestly not adequate and my condition was worsening. Without a recommendation from a high level manager, I don't know if they would have considered me (I feel like it's entry level work... but every similar listing I see asks for AT LEAST two years of experience before even being considered...)

I'm worried that I will struggle to find office based work or anything where I can remain seated for at least the majority of the day. I also feel like I would struggle to find a job where speaking on the phone frequently is a requirement, even though that's what I do now. I am awkward and have a mild speech impediment, and I'm honestly surprised I got this job in the first place. I don't really know what I'm going to do once I move.

Does anybody have any recommendations for jobs that can be seated, and does not revolve around customer service / speech? I feel like it should be easy to find something where I can just work in spreadsheets all day (which I also do at my current job, processing receipts and keeping some financial records) but I just can't find anything like that for some reason. I also wish there was something that was at least tangentially related to what I'm going back to school for (biochemistry), but I would probably need to have finished my degree for anything resembling that... 

I am just really stressed about being unemployed once I move. My health problems are in that sweet spot of 'bad enough to mess up my life' but 'not bad enough to get support easily', so without a job where sitting is the default, I have pretty much nothing, except maybe after years more of physical therapy and maybe surgery. Any ideas are really helpful, thank you.

I have a general idea with what I want in life, and physiotherapy isn‚Äôt fitting the picture and I want a better job. (BONUS: list of pros/cons I picked out from the physiotherapy subreddit that sums up how I feel)



I graduated high school 2019, graduated bachelor of science in 2022 (major in anatomy - couldve majored in physiology because I did all the subjects for that too), just started 3rd year bachelor of physiotherapy and I‚Äôm regretting it now. Where do I go? Im 23y/o male and an introvert. Is there any other careers with a BSc/physiotherapy I could transition to or is it worth trying to do a switch to something else?

the straw that broke the camels back is that the pay is abysmal for such a demanding job. I was earning $33-35 at 17 as a swim teacher and $35 isn‚Äôt far fetched as a base pay for a physiotherapist with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Australia.¬†

I feel that I understand myself well (know what makes me happy), and that I already know that I don‚Äôt want to be stressed at work or bring it home with me. My partner is in her first year as a full-time radiographer, we are both now arbitrarily saving/investing as best we can to eventually own a house in the distant future (f\*\*k house prices amirite). I‚Äôm not a big spender and don‚Äôt live a luxury life (nor care to), but I like the idea of having a larger property for my gardening hobby, and earning some good money early on and then going more part time and living off the interest from my savings/letting it compound (as best it can at least). I want to live comfortably and being financially secure essentially. I live with parents still (parents pay for me to live at uni which is 3.5hrs away from home), no debt/bills, HECS will be slowly paid off anyways with work, 10k in commsec pocket, 1.7k super (only earnt \~10k with swim teaching until I left for uni), probably have $30k in assets, not all of which are easily sold though (trading cards, cacti and succulents, items in video games, etc.). Growing succulents and cacti is a hobby but also a side hustle as I‚Äôm able to turn a nice profit when I find the right things and also grow them bigger/propagation. Other hobbies include bone carving and I want to get into pottery (for my plants), so im not short on hobbies that will keep me busy! Im an alright artist with my carving.

Im 195cm tall with broad shoulders (showing that im at more risk of injuring my legs by being tall and heavier). I have a super high foot arch, tore both my menisci, when I was 17 and so standing on my feet all day will wear me out so much if it became my job to run around with patients all day, and I‚Äôve heard physiotherapists often get hurt from all the physical/mental work + burnout.  Being an introvert and not really a peoples person, i feel its the wrong career. And I‚Äôm a male in a female dominant field, so Im likely to have patients that will be a bit uncomfortable with me treating/handling them.

From reading basically every post on the physiotherapy subreddit, I copied a list of things that stuck out to me on what makes/breaks it for making physiotherapy worthwhile:

CONS:

* most salaries falling between $68,660 and $122,150 (APA, 2023)

* To earn $100k a year you‚Äôre seeing a full caseload of patients, working solidly 5 days a week (perhaps even a Saturday). Lots of hands on, massage, full assessment and treatment of every patient and a lot can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt get better (20 years of a bung hip with psychosocial issues++ that just want to come in for a massage coz it makes them feel better). playing part time psychologist for their range of psychosocial issues.

* Because of the level of responsibility it entails. You are a trusted profession to help diagnose and treat a human being. You need to be able to consider lots of different things about a person while understanding the human body to a tee!¬†
* Know how to manage different types of injuries and conditions, but also how to manage different types of people and how to connect with them on a more personal level

* Lots of hands on skills and assessment, and the recommendations you make about a person can have a massive impact on their life (ie advocating for your clients to insurance companies). ¬†

* you need to be a people person or nobody will want to be your client. Socially draining

* It‚Äôs a pretty taxing career mentally and physically and the reward doesn‚Äôt really rectify that either

* Even the patients who WANT to get better; there‚Äôs a huge question mark on how effective Physiotherapy treatment actually is, outside of giving them some strengthening/mobility work.

* Documentation and Proficiencies: Depending on where in the world you're practicing, you'll have proficiencies or standards of work, and documentation, time management, goal setting, patient return and follow up, report writing etc

* learning curve - constant pushing into continuing education (CPD professional development)

* stressful caseload/ productivity and documentation expectations, difficult patients,

* High burn out for physiotherapists

PROS:

* You learn a lot about people and health, you literally will never stop learning as a physiotherapist

* You meet new people every day

* You have a 'trade'. You are suddenly hugely useful and helpful in your daily life and to your family",Fizzy_Fizzure,1,1.0,0,1742680109,2025-03-22 21:48:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jhjlki/23yo_having_a_change_of_heart_as_i_pass_the/,3,2025
1jhiy7i,Applied to 800 Jobs Since January‚ÄîStill Jobless. Feeling Defeated.,"
I‚Äôve applied to 800 jobs since January and still haven‚Äôt landed anything. I‚Äôve had a couple of interviews, but they‚Äôve led nowhere. One company changed the role to part-time after my first interview and wouldn‚Äôt offer insurance, so I had to stop the process. Another canceled my second interview because they paused hiring. I genuinely don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm struggling this much.

I have three internships and four years of retail experience, and I‚Äôve worked across multiple sectors, from wholesale to marketing to authentication. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my experience:

	‚Ä¢	Retail & Customer Service (4+ years): Worked at stores like 2nd Street, PACSUN, Earthbound Trading, and 260 Sample Sale. I have experience in sales, visual merchandising, and luxury authentication. At 2nd Street, I was an assistant buyer, responsible for authenticating and curating vintage and designer pieces.
	‚Ä¢	Wholesale & Showrooms: Worked at Les Aimants, Haus Incubator, and Find Me Now, gaining experience in showroom coordination, buyer outreach, and managing platforms like JOOR and Shopify. Assisted in planning market weeks, organizing samples, and working with stockists.
	‚Ä¢	Marketing & Social Media: At Find Me Now, I directed four influencer campaigns, handled outreach, negotiated collaborations, and assisted in photoshoot styling. I also have experience with content creation, brand storytelling, and e-commerce management.
	‚Ä¢	Other Skills: Highly proficient in Excel (pivot tables, analytics), Google Analytics, and data visualization. I‚Äôve also worked in PR, event planning, and creative marketing.

I‚Äôve revamped my resume (made it ATS-friendly, bolded key skills, formatted it properly), networked, and applied to jobs in wholesale, marketing, bridal, fashion, beauty, and vintage‚Äîbut I keep hitting a wall.

1jhi4l9,Need some Guidance regarding Job Responsibilities,"Hi all, first timer here looking for some advice on a... Kind of precarious situation with my current employer.

So I work in the Defense space, doing commonly recognized project management for a large scale program. Been doing this for years so I'm intimately familiar with the standard reporting processes that are required by government contracts.

The issue I'm currently facing is involving root cause analysis. At my previous employer we recognized reporting requirements to the government based on the latest documentation put out by the government. At my current employer, the recognized reporting requirements are based on documents that were retired in 2018. The issue I'm having is that my manager is requiring me to report based on the new requirements. This would essentially mean that reports he is requesting I generate do not follow standard procedures outlined by our company even though they are current industry standards. Additionally, because these are not standard to the company, my program would be the only program beholden to these new standards.

I can see both sides of the coin and the merits behind doing one course of action or the other. I see three possible courses of action to take.

1) Escalate the discrepancies and try to get corporate policies to recognize the new reporting standards.
2) Ignore my manager's requirements and create reports using the standards outlined by corporate guidelines.
3) Do neither.

I'd love to hear what would you recommend as the best course of action for such a situation. In my current job role I am not in an authoritative position to make sweeping changes to the entire company.

1jhi17b,"Laid off and now facing a job offer dilemma, which job should I choose?","
Hello, Reddit! 

I was one of the workers laid off due to the change in administration, and it‚Äôs been a tough few weeks. However, I‚Äôve managed to land a new job, which I‚Äôve only been at for two days. The thing is, I‚Äôve just received another offer from a company that offers a role much more in line with my interests, and I‚Äôm torn about how to handle the situation. I‚Äôve listed out the pros and cons of both options below.

What would you do in my position? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts or advice.

Company 1 (Current Job)

PROS:
100k salary.
I would be supporting a federal agency I‚Äôve been offered a full-time role with as a government employee.
I work next to my career development officer who helps connect new hires like me with jobs within the agency.

CONS:
The project manager (PM) is unsure if the role will be extended past the end of the summer.
The type of work I‚Äôd be doing is undetermined, and my boss mentioned this program was ""forgotten"" and ""not sure why it was funded.""
I‚Äôm unsure if I want to continue working in federal government under this administration, but would like to come back in the next four years.
5 days a week ‚Äì but hours and super flexibility.
The PM mentioned they wanted to have a say in my hiring but didn‚Äôt get the chance to.


Company 2 (Offer)

PROS:
The work is in a field that‚Äôs more marketable to the private sector, aligning with my interests and goals of moving away from the federal government and federal contracting for a bit
The role is also as a federal contractor but guaranteed for at least two years.
The entire team has already assessed me and determined that they‚Äôd like me to join.
4 days in the office with 1 remote day, offering a better work-life balance.

CONS:
I‚Äôd need to get a car.
The salary is a bit lower at 90k.


I‚Äôm torn between staying with my current job, which offers a solid salary and super friendly team but has a lot of uncertainties, and moving to a role that‚Äôs more aligned with my interests but comes with a lower salary and a few logistical hurdles.

1jhhe3f,To quit or not to quit?,"I am a journalist by profession, working for one of the biggest media houses in my home country (somewhere in Asia). Before I begin explaining my problem, I'd like to clarify that labour laws in my country are absolutely shit. Besides, I have no money to hire a lawyer, so please don't suggest me to sue the company.

I have been in this industry for the last 12 years, and right now, I'm a newsroom manager. I joined this company last year, mainly because of its prestige. I even took a paycut to come here. 

The company doesn‚Äôt cover my medical insurance and has absolutely no other perks. The salary is horribly low, so much so that I have to live paycheck to paycheck. However, I'm passionate about my work, and this company's name on my CV is surely valuable. People who didn't know me before now know me, and they're often envious I made it to this company (of course, they have no idea what I have been going through). My bosses also told me that since the pay is low, I can take up freelance or part-time work and the company won't object to it.  


The initial few months were good, but after a coworker quit, my bosses told me they'd ""stretch me for a few month"" while they look for another person to fill the coworkers' position. I have more than 10 people working in my team. The company wants to maintain high-quality work, so there is a lot of stress. I literally have to edit each and every news article before it's published all while juggling other tasks, such as looking into my teams' issues, answering my bosses, replying to freelancers' emails, commissioning tasks, coordinating with reporters, etc. For the last 8 months, I have been working **12 to 14 hours** per day, six days a week. Not to mention, my boss sometimes micromanages, pointing out if there's a missing comma, all in the name of maintaining quality. It would have been understandable if I was able to pay attention, but I am a human and can only do so much. When we hold meetings, the boss talks about the importance of maintaining a work-life balance, saying things like ""efficient managers don't have to overwork"". This infuriates me, because it's impossible to publish anything without editing it. There have been a few oversights in the past and all hell broke loose. I was questioned. 

They recently hired another person, but they're unable to take the workload off me since they're new. I am burnt out, frustrated, broke, and have zero motivation to go to work each day. Can't take up any freelance or part-time work because of the crazy hours. 

Another company recently offered me a position (one which isn't managerial) but pays better. I have worked there before, and the environment could get toxic, but they keep you well compensated, at least. Also pay for medical insurance. I want to take that offer, but feeling confused about quitting this senior managerial position to become a trainer. 

I have been in the industry for 12 years, and have never been this confused. If I take this position, which is a demotion of sorts, would it impact my future prospects? I don't know whether to prioritize well being or position.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! ",M0llyH0llyInDaH0us3,2,0.75,7,1742674048,2025-03-22 20:07:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jhhe3f/to_quit_or_not_to_quit/,3,2025

1jhebru,Exploring Alternate Careers to Current Comfortable One,"If there was a scale from -1 to 1, with things in the negative territory bringing you bad vibes, and things in the positive territory bringing you fulfillment, I think I‚Äôve done a good job of getting to ‚Äú0‚Äù, or a neutral stance. However, the skills to eliminate negativity are not the same as building positivity.¬†

I currently work as a materials engineer with \~10 years YoE with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from a T25 school. On paper, everything seems to be going well. I‚Äôm the SME at my startup, with relative job autonomy and almost non-existent micromanagement. TC is \~$250k, with about a quarter in stock options. General working hours don‚Äôt typically exceed 40-45 hours a week outside of crunch time. As far as job security, the startup seems to be going in a positive trajectory, and I don‚Äôt really have a fear of being fired/laid off, unless the whole company goes under. Live in a VHCOL. However I don‚Äôt feel fulfilled at my current job, in terms of my day to day responsibilities, even if I feel like my company is working on something net-positive for the world. Hence I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs next.¬†

During the pandemic, I was at a big aerospace firm where my working hours were closer to \~30 hours a week. I felt a similar malaise toward my work situation, with even less fulfillment (with the general question of ‚Äúdoes my work even matter?‚Äù, and explored going into data science at the time. I took a bunch of Coursera classes and taught myself how to do basic coding. I was able to switch jobs with a \~60% raise in comp in the same field, so the data science exploration was tabled. This was \~4 years ago. I don‚Äôt think I particularly enjoy coding though, and explored it more due to how ‚Äúversatile‚Äù the skillset was. Not sure if it‚Äôs worth reopening that exploration. Part of the reason I want to explore switching careers is because I feel like my skillset is quite niche; although companies may not need very many materials engineers (especially in aerospace materials), they will always need some, meaning that job openings may not be as frequent, and limits the companies and therefore locations that are open for me.¬†

I also looked into doing an MBA. However on the financial side, over two years, the combined opportunity + actual cost is \~700k (500k from current earnings + 200k tuition/expenses). It seems like a pretty steep price to pay to explore something that may or may not pan out, especially if the lucrative fields are tech, finance and consulting, with the 60-80 hour workweeks, for an ‚Äúentry level‚Äù comp that I‚Äôm making right now, even if the ceiling is quite a bit higher. If this were 5 years earlier, I wouldn‚Äôt mind the travel lifestyle of MBB consulting but at this point I don‚Äôt think I could do it. ¬†

I recognize that I am in an extremely privileged position that many others would love to find themselves in. But any ideas or advice from anyone who may have been in a similar situation would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR: Do I stay the course and try to make the most of my life outside of work/find fulfillment in life, or try to find an alternative career path that allows me to not want to question my day to day?¬†And if the latter, how do I explore other options that I haven't thought of yet?",cartagenahatsu,1,1.0,0,1742666053,2025-03-22 17:54:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jhebru/exploring_alternate_careers_to_current/,3,2025

1jhcr21,Mislead about comp,"I've been with my current company, a small tech company that's been around for 18 years, in a customer success role. I've done really well and earned a leadership role a little over a year ago.

This last winter, our CEO brought in some c-suite level VPs to help our company scale and restructure for that scale.

This lead to me having a new boss - one of the VP's. He's dismantled a lot of what I thought was great about the company structurally - it was startling. But he respected me and our cs team.

He quickly fought to improve our compensation and bonus structure - it was a little chaotic but overall got everyone excited.

I effectively got a 40% base raise with a new opportunity for a bonus annually. This came with the caveat that I would be moving into an expanded role with no job description or offer. 

It made me feel off, but overall the tasks I've been asked to do were things I enjoyed. It's a little stressful feeling like I was moved into a role without being told any details, but I figured I could see how things played out.

I have a new title now, but still not job description or offer. My title is used with clients, but has not been updated on our internal org chart.

That said, my team also received a new bonus opportunity to incentivize urgent revenue growth. They have the opportunity to work extra, especially during goal-urgent weeks, to earn significant commission on growth specific revenue (as compared to maintenance revenue). We recently presented to each team member what their potential earnings for 2025 would be based on if we hit our goals.

Well, I just found out that that has not actually been approved - our new boss simply presented the new bonus structure to incentivize our team in the immediate so he can lift numbers for potential investors. 

He hopes to have the approval for the structure before the summer (when the first half of the bonus would pay out). Note that this doesn't affect my bonus, just my team's.

He is also though considering reducing the bonus.

He's asked myself and my colleague to not tell the team - but to only communicate the promised bonus structure so as to not affect the team's successful progress.

I'm torn. I cannot lie to my team but we're a small enough company there's no benefit in whistleblowing to our part time hr rep.

The only thing I can think of doing is preparing to look for another job knowing ill likely be in a weird spot when I refuse to lie.

Are there other solutions I am not considering? What would you do? It's scary in this current job market.

1jhbpwh,I need advice,"I‚Äôm 21 and just finished my 6 month contract as a junior office administrator. This was my first job in an office, before this I worked for 3 years in retail and other industries. In my job I wasn‚Äôt really working on computers too much, I was mostly doing physical work or basic work on the computer (basically intern work). As my contract came to an end, I desperately applied for every job that I qualified for as to not remain jobless. I applied for a senior office administrator position that required 3 years of office admin and 3 years of Microsoft excel experience (preferred). I did the interview and actually passed it surprisingly lol, I didn‚Äôt lie about my experience or about knowledge and they still somehow chose me over 15 other cantitates of whom had degrees and/or relevant experience. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm writing this to ask for advice. I‚Äôm going to be starting on Monday and I wish to know what I should touch up on (I‚Äôll do some studying for Microsoft excel). The manager also told me to make a mood board of where I want to be in 6 months and the steps I will take to get there (I think she means what skills I want to develop and improve on), but I really need help with that as I don‚Äôt know what to put down for it. 

I am slightly panicking because part of me feels as if this is too good to be true, if you know what I mean. It‚Äôs a relatively new company and in the office there‚Äôs only 2 directors and one manager, so I‚Äôll be having to do all of the work and will have nobody to help me as they told me that they don‚Äôt stick around in the office (they travel around for business meetings and for clients).

1jha943,Considering move out of state for new job would need to sell house,"I currently live in the Denver metro with my partner and bought a house about 2 years ago. We both are public workers with little savings, the house is not expected to have any equity if we were to sell. I have a job opportunity in OR in a small community, that would be much larger in responsibility (managing multiple programs and overseeing a staff of 10-15) versus my current role that is not supervisory nor managing whole programs. It is an expected salary increase of 20-30k (from 70k to 90-110k). I am also interviewing for various local positions that would be equal pay, but not the growth in responsibility. The job in Oregon would set me up down the line for a future director role and expand my areas of expertise to have more flexibility in my field. 

I‚Äôm waiting for a second interview for a local job that oversees a whole program with a staff of about 20. I am also waiting for an internal interview that isn‚Äôt supervisory but changes the type of work I do. All these opportunities pay roughly the same. 

I have concerns about moving, selling such a recent house purchase and losing the downpayment (would come out with $0 or a few thousand owed). It would also mean my partner would have to quit his job (80k/yr) which he enjoys and I think we need for retirement as we don‚Äôt have any of our own. He works for the federal government, which is unsteady right now but we see his job as safe. I am also concerned about moving to a much smaller community and the lack of social and cultural amenities in comparison to Denver.

Am I overthinking? Does the career growth and potential trajectory outweigh the short term loss of house and money? Does it make sense to stay where I am with the potential opportunities locally even if they aren‚Äôt as good with level of responsibility?

1jh9ry3,Looking for Advice From Medical Billers/Coders and Healthcare Admin Professionals ‚Äì Is This a Good Starting Point?,"Good evening everyone,

I‚Äôm hoping to get some honest advice from folks currently working in healthcare‚Äîespecially those in medical billing, coding, or administrative roles.

Right now, I‚Äôm working full-time as a carpenter and part-time at a construction retail store in the evenings (about 5 days a week). Neither job pays great, but I took them out of necessity. I recently moved and had to pivot fast after losing my tech job. I previously worked in the tech industry for about 10 years, mostly in call centers and as a desktop support technician (I even earned a certification in that field).

After the layoff, I enrolled in a trade school and completed a pre-apprenticeship as a carpenter along with earning my OSHA-10 cert, which helped me land my current job. But I‚Äôve recently come to terms with the fact that tech might not be in my future anymore‚Äîand I‚Äôm ready to make a full transition into the healthcare field.

That said, I don‚Äôt want a clinical or patient-facing role. I‚Äôm very much interested in staying on the administrative side of healthcare.

I came across Penn Foster‚Äôs Medical Billing & Coding program, which is self-paced and costs about $1,200 total, with affordable monthly payments. I already have a decent computer and plan to complete the program within 9-10 months.

I‚Äôve been watching some medical coding YouTubers to get a feel for what the job is actually like, but I also understand a lot of that content is optimized for clicks and not always reflective of the reality.

So, here are my main questions for those who work in the field:

	‚Ä¢	Is a program like Penn Foster‚Äôs a legit and practical way to break into medical billing and coding, especially for someone with no healthcare experience?
	‚Ä¢	How hard is it to land that first job without any prior experience in healthcare?
	‚Ä¢	What certifications or additional steps would give me a competitive edge (e.g., CPC, CCS, RHIT)?
	‚Ä¢	If you started in billing/coding, how did you grow your career?
	‚Ä¢	My 3-year goal is to earn at least $75K working in healthcare.
	‚Ä¢	My 5-year goal is to break six figures, ideally in a compliance officer or auditing role. I feel like billing/coding could be a solid foundation because of the exposure to insurance, regulations, and documentation standards‚Äîbut I‚Äôd love to hear from people who‚Äôve made that kind of transition. With all the economic uncertainty lately, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about long-term stability. I want to get into a career that gives me the financial foundation to start funding my own business ventures within the next 3 to 5 years. As much as I appreciate carpentry and other hands-on work, I know it‚Äôs tough on the body, and I really don‚Äôt see myself doing physically demanding jobs for more than another three years max.

Any insight, advice, or even just sharing your journey would be hugely appreciated. I‚Äôm motivated, focused, and ready to put in the work‚ÄîI just want to make sure I‚Äôm heading in the right direction.

1jh8tyj,I'm a 29 year old FAANG engineer. I'm not really enjoying it and am considering moving into healthcare.,"I'm currently making a little over 200k a year, which is not bad for my age but I'm not a fan of the direction the industry is headed (offshoring, AI, tech debt, etc) and I don't really like software engineering that much. It's really killing me mentally and I need to probably take some time off, I might quit my current job.

Anyway, the hiring market is grim even for ex-FAANG engineers and even if I did get another job it's likely it would be as bad as my current one. I'm very isolated and depressed and yes I've tried doing things outside of work but at my age most of our socializing is going to be through work lets be real. 

Healthcare is a difficult industry but the hiring market is always pretty good and there's plenty of social interaction inherent to the job. I have a 3.8 GPA from my undergrad CS degree but no pre-med type classes so if I wanted to get into med or dental school I would need to take a year of undergrad classes first.

Yes I'm pretty old to be starting over but I've got a lot of savings and I don't wanna be a software engineer for the next 30-40 years so I need another option.

1jh8fvw,"Getting Laid off; Just got Job offer, negotiate salary?  Or be freakin' grateful!","TL;DR:  

* Just laid off, new job offer equal pay and benefits (but need to be onsite vs. have been remote)
* Offer is from US top 60 bank, so probably not much flexibility negotiations?
* Do I really want to keep plugging away in this job market, or take the easy way out?
* Do I not take this opportunity for more $$$ ?

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a little conflicted on how to approach this situation.  I have been working for 3+ years at my current large Fortune 100  company as a Business Systems Analyst.  We recently were told 35% of our IT work force are being outsourced, including me.  I have one week left.  (There was a reasonable severance offered).  I had been applying to jobs, and had a really good experience interviewing for a BSA role at a top 60 US bank.  I liked the team, they seemed to really like me.  I was very surprised I hadn't received any offer right away, ha ha.  I did get an offer 3 weeks later though (yesterday).

I was offered $85K, similar PTO, similar benefits but onsite 5 days a week (supposedly)

I mentioned I had another offer I am looking at currently (not true--total lie \[but, do have some interviews coming up that are higher pay tbh\]) offering $90K, and remote.

I told recruiter I really liked the team at the bank (true!)  and was very much looking forward to joining in that role.  But was concerned that the money was disparate.  He stated this was already at the upper end, and the manager was giving me a better title as well (""Asst Vice President"" and, I am pretty sure VP really doesn't mean anything in banks, right??)  He mentioned when he originally interviewed me that ""he had suggested range started at $70K, and I had told him I was fine with that.""  This is either purposeful revisionist history on his part, or some sort of standard negotiation ploy he uses--because in our original discussion, I had mentioned I currently make $85k (true) and that would not make sense, but $85 (upper end of the ""range"") would be worth moving forward if they were interested.  (No, I have not shared that I am actually unemployed this upcoming Friday).

So...I told him I would consider the actual offer and he will call me again Monday 3/24.

  
**Conflicted**, I can:

1) take the offer Monday, I won't feel any pain (aside from having to be on site) and be done with the uncertainty of my future for now, and I think it would be a good role for 2 years.  I would have no gap at all in my employment history, and my wallet would not take a hit.

2) Let him know I really would love to join, but would rather have the money match or better my other offer, always some risk.

3) Tell him I am  not ready to make a decision yet.

4) Accept offer but keep plugging away looking for a better job/pay

==============================================

* A bird in the hand, vs. really do want to be paid more, vs do I REALLY want to go through the stress of continuing to look in this difficult market?

1jh82wz,Did I make a mistake?,"I recently started a salaried training specialist in a new industry after being in warehousing as an hourly training facilitator. It‚Äôs been rough for the first few weeks in my new job.

Originally, I was frustrated and burnt out over my old role at the time and wanted to find something better. I interviewed with the new company over the span of four months before starting. I had some doubts and wasn‚Äôt sure I was 100% fit for it. Eventually, I thought it might be a good experience for me to try, plus it had a good salary. The new role I am in is the first of its kind at that site. We have a very small training team‚Äîjust the manager and me. They were very excited to have me.

Now that I am here, it‚Äôs been feeling like a constant whirlwind. The company culture is so different than what I‚Äôm used to and the work is a bit more than I expected. This is technically my first ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù job. In the last job, I always carried myself highly and excelled to be a top performer, but most of my coworkers and senior leadership were very unprofessional. For the most part, everyone has been nice so far, but I‚Äôm already starting to get a whiff of the traditional ‚Äúcorporate games‚Äù people play. 

I‚Äôve always had a natural ability to learn things, innovate over time, and teach but I‚Äôve been feeling so lost, dumb, and anxious during this time. I‚Äôm beginning to doubt myself. 

My manager hasn‚Äôt been exactly helpful. They‚Äôve been leaving me to my own devices, which I kind of expected, but I‚Äôve just been doing things that I think can help me learn right now. I‚Äôve been booking 1-on-1s with supervisors and leaders from various departments to learn more about the business and their roles, as well as shadowing other workers in their roles.  Despite doing this, I feel like I‚Äôm being left behind or milling around‚Äîthat I‚Äôm not good enough and it weighs on me.

Because of this, I don‚Äôt feel excited about the work or the people most of the time. I constantly shift between wanting to quit‚Äîgoing back to my old role‚Äîor staying‚Äîtoughing it out. I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well and sometimes I feel sick over thinking about the job. Other days, I‚Äôm able to go in with an attitude of being ready to conquer the day. I‚Äôve been trying to boost my confidence and outlook with positive self talk, watching self help videos, talking with friends and family. 

I am wondering if this will change over time or should I just get out now? Part of me wants to stay and grow, rolling with ambiguity and potentially making great things in the future. The other part is scared that I could crash and burn, hurting myself in process because I‚Äôve promoted myself too soon or that I fail in my role.

How have people navigated situations where you think you may be in over your head at a job? Where you have the need to overcome self doubt in your job? How do you succeed in a corporate world?

One of my coworkers came up to me and started giving me a hard time about it, so I told her to just ""please fuck off and leave me alone"". I've, understandably and rightfully so, been fired as a result. 

I have apologised to my manager since this happened and he has said that these things happen, but it does not change the outcome of my situation. I know what I've done was really immature, unproffessional and rude. 

I've given myself a few days to be upset about this and also started seeing a councellor to talk about these issues so I can begin to make more concious decisions to change my behaviour and try and actually learn from my mistake. 

Obviously being fired for conflict looks bad on a resume. This is my only real experience (I was 2IC at this store) that I believe will help get me into an admin or HR position (I also studied a relevant degree so I think HR is achievable for me). I can't remove this job off of my resume. 

Does anyone have any advice for things I should do next? Should I aim for an admin position or another retail job so that I can remove this experience from my resume and put this behind me? Should I apply for jobs in HR anyway and hope that they don't call my company? It's a fairly small company with about 100 staff members so I don't think (and hope) that they use an HRIS system where my name could be searched but if anyone has any advice about this that would be awesome! 



Thanks in advance.  ",Lucky-pass9001,1,0.6700000166893005,18,1742647533,2025-03-22 12:45:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jh7myh/advice_for_getting_a_new_job_after_being_fired/,3,2025
1jh7adf,Quitting Advice Needed,"So I am preparing to leave a company I have worked at for 3 years. My whole team has been incredible to work with. This company has treated me very well. Im only leaving because the new job would pay almost double my current salary. Im in a specialized field so it will be hard to replace me. I worry it will take longer than 2 weeks to even find a replacement. And I will need a couple of weeks to properly train someone, assuming they have a few years of experience in my trade already. I'd feel more comfortable giving them a month. Is this reasonable to ask of my potentially new employer?

1jh5qh9,How to build a good relationship with my manager?,"I've been working in a local cafe in Melbourne as an all-rounder. I still haven't become an official member yet but I've been doing training for a month at this moment. My manager is very perfectionist and she has very high standards for hygiene. 

I made a big mistake last week about washing a bowl for a dog in the washing machine and misordering. That seemed to have made her enraged, and she is now blaming all the things, even though it was not my mistake. 

For example, a customer (an elderly person but not an English native) wanted to order the curry but she did not fully understand the name on the menu since this cafe is Asian fusion and sometimes the customers don't even understand what that means. I checked twice that she ordered the other lunch set but not curry, like me: ""You're ordering this lunch set, right? (by pointing out with my finger on the menu) and she said ""Yes""- but she changed her mind and she said that she wanted to get a curry when my manager talked to her. Also, another customer ordered bread and I charged that item when they got the bill, but my manager told me that I didn't - that made me feel that she doesn't believe in me and doesn't like me in some ways. She didn't apologise to me when she realised I was right :(( 

I explained that I double-checked when taking orders but she gave me a silent treatment and I'm very nervous and feeling very stressed since I don't know what my action would make her angry.  Another manager even told me ""I don't know your status as you are making many mistakes"". 

I feel like, they are just trying to find out every action to find the judgment materials to blame me but not evaluating the good aspects -  (coming earlier time for cleaning, helping them even though I finish my shift etc).  I know they won't say anything if I can do better but I feel very pressured by their behavior. I want to quit there but I need to work as I need money to make a living.

1jh5f7y,Help me make the right choice as a fresh grad,"The last few years have been tough for new grads across the globe and I'm one of them. I would really appreciate advice from this community, both new grads as well as the experienced folks in hopefully not blowing up my life.

Background:  
I'm 23, a Electronics grad (2024) from a Tier-2/3 college in the tech hub of India. The placement season was nasty and I'm grateful to have at least landed a fairly decent job while about half of our batch has found it hard to find any. Yes they pay isn't great. I'd say bang on average of a Jr. SWE in the city. I've a strong academics with great GPA, publications and interesting projects.

I work in automotive electronics and actually enjoy what I do. My interest lies in CV / Perception. This was also the focus area for my final year project and¬†*really*¬†enjoy being involved in this.  
No, I'm not as strong with DSA/CP as half of my batch but I like to believe that I can think, solve and build for problems.

Dilemma:  
I considered the idea of Master's in Germany for understanding and working in this niche domain in a country with more opportunities. God bless, i got an admit from my preferred Uni but now I'm having second thoughts.

My current job might not be financially very rewarding but the work aligns with my interests. I did earlier reject off-campus roles with 50% higher pay as the domain was different. My manager has been extremely supportive and even though my team isn't directly involved in the CV workflow I've the support to experiment and learn from others. I'll be at 1YOE + 6m of Internship at this company at the time of leaving.

I'm not sure if the 2 years + finances I invest towards a Master's would be right or staying back and continuing in the industry help. The job market abroad is definitely hard but at this point I feel the talent pool in India is beyond overflowing and the limited roles add to the problems.

TLDR:

Fresh grad needs help in evaluating opportunity + financial cost of masters as compared to staying back and working in his home country.",Key-Comb2126,1,1.0,0,1742638981,2025-03-22 10:23:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jh5f7y/help_me_make_the_right_choice_as_a_fresh_grad/,3,2025

1jh4oah,At a crossroads in my life/career,"I completed nursing school with merit and trained as an anaesthetic assistant and then worked independently for a year. I've never worked as a ward nurse nor have interest in any other nursing role but I thought I'd give it a try as I wanted an actual career that I could support a potential family with if needed.

Doing this role exceeded my expectations of what nursing could offer me, it was quite good! but it was still unsustainable and took over my life so I couldn't imagine have a family alongside it. Blame culture and bullying occurred and my mental and physical health took too much of a hit for the compensation. 

My dad had been showing signs of dementia and was diagnosed and my brother then offered to support me financially if I move back home to watch over him and his safety and I was grateful to get this chance to leave on good terms with my bosses and recieved an unpaid career break (1 year) to reflect on. I was grateful to have a opportunity to support my family in a different way.

Thankfully dads needs are minimal so far. He's independent in his home nearby and I'm installed in my place and I have a lot of free time to reflect. 

My question is a niggling guilt for being underemployed, restlessness, knowing I should be using this time well because if and when dad's needs increase that'll be me stepping in.

Until then should I apply for another job in nursing  (seems like this may quickly interfere with caring for dad) or as something active and simpler (I'm thinking postie!) That would actually make picking up my nursing after dad duties have concluded that bit harder as I'd need to explain my pivot in career/break from nursing. 

There are other options of course but these are the ones circling my mind at the moment.

1jh3bxd,Next steps In career/life,"First post and not really sure how to frame it so I apologize if this isn‚Äôt concise.

I want to start by saying I‚Äôm 25(m) and want to stay roughly within the career path I have so far. I work in hospitality and have a major passion for Food and Beverage (I worked in both back and front fairly extensively), and Adventure tourism. Long term I would really love working with a company to open stores and restaurants  or some sort of task force team I think could be dope. I would also love to crack into your guide or cruise work potentially, but haven‚Äôt had a tone of luck and my current city isn‚Äôt a major port. I have a bachelors in culinary arts and hospitality management from a pretty well known school and have kept up with most food trends and fads within the industry.

Recently due to stress, personal health issues, and overwork I left. I live in the PNW of the United States in a town that just doesn‚Äôt seem to be a good fit for myself and growth within my career. The problem is my wife is finishing her PHD and we will be here for the next 2.5-4 years. I‚Äôm really struggling with what the next step is for me. I have a fairly solid resume on both experience and education for my field and feel really stuck. My last job was overall solid pay and I loved the team. Now I am kind of panicking because I the market where I am at just doesn‚Äôt seem to have a good transition for me to grow and learn in. So I‚Äôm kind of in this holding pattern of debating my options. I‚Äôm debating:
1)I try and go back to school and get my masters in a travel, food, or hospitality related area of study (current thoughts are culinary science, hospitality management, or food studies).
2) Focus on work and building a strong relationship with a company to grow in (if I find a place that‚Äôs actually respectable) and try to work my way up.
3) Work a job to pay the bills and look into certifications and specializations I feel would be long term options (Sommelier, dive master, and other tour guide type certifications)
4) just coast and try to let life tell me what‚Äôs next.
5) it‚Äôs not that deep and I‚Äôm just overwhelmed by life as a whole at the moment.
6) Move to a place that‚Äôs more career focused and better paying and go back to be with my wife whenever I can.

I read a few threads on here and I hope I‚Äôm not just coming off as someone who is trying to complain of farm assurance. I just really don‚Äôt know what the next steps are for me and don‚Äôt want to add to the stress of those in my personal life. I feel like I need a push and some direction but really am just unsure of where to get that. If this post isn‚Äôt within guidelines or doesn‚Äôt make sense please let me know and I will try and clarify or take it down if asked.

I recently got my schedule for this week at my job and noticed my hours were unusually low. I work a part time retail job. I've been at this job for multiple years and have never had a work week where my hours were as low as they are currently. Two weeks ago I was working about 24 hours a week. Prior to this week I was given 16 hours Now I am down to 10 hours for the entire next week. So went from 24 hours a week normally down to 16 and now 10 hours for the entire week. I have never had below 20 hours per week at this job the entire time I've worked there.

1jh1nfb,Confused if I should quit my job,"Hello there. I'm currently working in a school setting and the work is mostly monotonous, sometimes meaningful (when I work with students directly). I'm appointed in this school by a company where I'm employed. So I've 2 bosses. One is the school leader and the other is my company manager. I've been pretty good at my work except recently I had taken a lot of leaves and wasn't punctual. I've been burning out real bad and it feels so stupid to even say this because I'm very young and this is my first job and I'm already saying I'm burning out. My school leader gave me extra work which was beyond my job role and I didn't receive any support from my company, so I fulfilled it for months. I thought it was an one time thing. 

Now my school leader is adding another extra work on me, even though our contract clearly says I shouldn't be given this work. Now, both the bosses are using my leaves and punctuality as a reason to give me more work. Is the normal? I find that blackmailing tactic and very distasteful as I'm entitled to a certain number of leaves as mentioned on my offer letter.

Today I've a meeting with my school leader about this and after so many conversations with friends and colleagues, I've decided to take my stand and say no, no matter what reason anyone else pits forward. It's a temporary work load but they won't give me any timeframe by when it'll end, so that is suspicious, I'll get trapped into this. 

I'm a very anxious individual. I haven't slept properly in nights and have been wasting my time because my brain is stuck on this. I'm scared of being shouted at, being humiliated or not being able to put forward my statement without crying. I know I need to suck it up and do better. But the lack of management, very very poor communication and responsibility distribution has been causing me too much stress. When I talk to older I realise how normal this is. I am not sure if I should quit my job without having any job lined up, which will be financially burdening for my family if I go back to them.

He is currently a stay at home dad, but we live in a very high cost of living area now and will need his help staying afloat.

The biggest factor is my husband‚Äôs neurodivergence. He‚Äôs never been diagnosed but everyone close to him finds it quite clear. He‚Äôs extremely charismatic and very social but has an VERY tough time learning new tasks and feels almost overwhelming anxiety about it. Things don‚Äôt ‚Äúclick‚Äù easily for him, especially any kind of spatial task. He quickly shuts down and feels lost when learning something new from someone else. It‚Äôs extremely limiting and he‚Äôs VERY self conscious about it. 

Other factors are that he has a huge gap since he finished his schooling (masters in international finance (!) from a program in Ireland‚Äîwe live in the US) where he has literally nothing but some self employed tutoring and a little bit of soccer coaching on his resume. He also doesn‚Äôt drive so that really limits the gig economy type of stuff. 
We need something he can get into with zero experience that won‚Äôt just overlook him because he‚Äôs been out of the workforce for so long, AND something that is easy and low pressure to learn. I think he should work at Trader Joe‚Äôs (which he totally would do) because that‚Äôs where we shop, he‚Äôs familiar with the set up, and he would honestly be great at stocking and taking inventory, etc. We‚Äôre working on this possibility. 
Positives for him are that he‚Äôs very friendly and easy to get along with, is great with retired age people especially, he speaks Spanish, he‚Äôs extremely book smart, and is very culturally sensitive and empathetic. He can talk to anyone about almost anything. 

Does anyone have other ideas for relatively low-skilled ways to break into working? Literally a cafe or fast food place would be too technical of a first job for him. The learning differences are a real big challenge‚Ä¶",TrickyPea4283,2,0.6700000166893005,21,1742621627,2025-03-22 05:33:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jh1iiw/how_to_get_husband_into_the_workforce/,3,2025

1jh1d94,"What is Amoxicillin and How Does It Really Work? Uses, Side Effects & More Explained! üíäüß¨","Hello everyone! üëã

Amoxicillin is one of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics, but do you know how it works, what it's used for, and the potential side effects? As a pharmacy student (or professional), I wanted to break down the essential details about **Amoxicillin** in a simple and easy-to-understand way for anyone learning about pharmacology or medication safety.

üî¨ **How Amoxicillin Works**:

* **Mechanism of Action**: Amoxicillin is a **Œ≤-lactam antibiotic** that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis, leading to bacterial death.
* **Common Uses**: It's widely used to treat bacterial infections like **ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia**, and **urinary tract infections**.

‚öñÔ∏è **Safety & Side Effects**:

* **Side Effects**: Common side effects include **nausea**, **vomiting**, and **diarrhea**. Less common but more serious side effects can include **allergic reactions** (rash, anaphylaxis).
* **Precautions**: Always follow the prescribed dosage to avoid resistance, and take note if there are any history of allergies to penicillin or other antibiotics.

üí° To help explain these concepts further, I‚Äôve put together a **5-minute video** that goes over everything you need to know about **Amoxicillin**‚Äîperfect for students, pharmacy professionals, or anyone wanting to understand more about this medication!

Check it out here:

1jh1b57,Regret declining my offer,"A few days ago, I received an offer for a job that I really wanted.
However, just before I could accept, I learned that my grandmother, who raised me, had fallen seriously ill and needed major surgery. After the surgery, she would require continuous, round-the-clock care. She was deeply afraid she might not survive the surgery and wanted us to stay with her during her recovery.

Initially, my cousin took on the role of primary caregiver, but the responsibility quickly became overwhelming as a full-time, 24/7 job. After a lot of internal struggle, I made the difficult decision to return to my hometown to help my cousin care for my grandmother. As a result, I had to decline the job offer, despite how much I wanted it.

Looking back, I deeply regret my decision. I explained the situation to HR, and they kindly responded, ‚ÄúPlease do not hesitate to reach out if things change in the future.‚Äù

Although my grandmother‚Äôs condition has not yet stabilized, I still have a strong desire to join the company. I know their next graduate intake opens in two months, and I am wondering whether I should reapply at that time, or would it be better to reach out to HR first?  Is it possible for me to get the offer again? I‚Äôm actually afraid that the hr would hate me because I declined the offer.

1jh173w,Being sabotaged by director I am supposed to be replacing,"Hi,
I was hired by the director part of whose responsibilities I am supposed to take over. It seemed great for a long time and he was involving me in a lot, albeit not everything. The project that I was hired to take over from him is recurring and takes a year to prepare and he is quite chill so I thought things would go well.
More recently, things have not been going well for him and also for me. From the start it had seemed like he should be reluctant to let go, since none of the other projects he works on are as successful, and it now turns out that they have actually been operating at a loss. He has handed things over to me but he has not been able to replace lost honor with the work he was always meant to be doing in the meantime. Concretely with regards to my work, he had not invited me to a board meeting on time so that I shuffled plans around to make it to part of it, which he the dismissed as saying it would be better for me if I just stayed away that day. I fear, and have reason to think he has created a narrative about me that suggests that I am not fit for the job and that will result in my contract not being renewed. The most important 2 months are now starting and I find myself in a very difficult situation. I have to make the work of the past year count to show to the board that I am ready for the big job while steering clear of his sabotage and staying friends with him, since he will undoubtedly stay at the organisation and is still in the director seat in the meantime. The people on the board are smart, and I think it would be most tactful to prove to them that any narrative about incompetence is a fabrication, and I would prefer to avoid conflict that can jeopardise the project in these essential stages, but maybe it is better to meet the challenge head on and to limit the risk of job-ending sabotage? I am not sure who has the best cards and it feels like it can go both ways: I stay and get the promotion or I don‚Äôt get my contract renewed and he clings on the the project.",4nr-,1,1.0,0,1742620375,2025-03-22 05:12:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jh173w/being_sabotaged_by_director_i_am_supposed_to_be/,3,2025

1jh0sem,"Career advice (NP, CRNA, & tech)","Hello everyone, I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I could really use some guidance on choosing a career path. When I was younger, I aspired to be a nurse practitioner, so I went to nursing school. I‚Äôve worked in various roles, including research & ICU, as a student nurse, and then as a nurse in rehab, IMC/PCU, MedSurg/tele, and aesthetics. Recently, I‚Äôve applied to nurse practitioner programs, specifically for FNP, but with my current student loan debt, it doesn‚Äôt seem financially feasible to pursue them right now.

Currently, I‚Äôm working on an IMC/MedSurg tele unit, but I‚Äôve been thinking about going back to the ICU for more critical care experience. Lately, I‚Äôve also considered going to CRNA school instead after gaining a few years of ICU experience. Another option I‚Äôve been thinking about is pursuing a computer science degree or transitioning into nursing informatics or healthcare IT.

I‚Äôve also wondered whether I should stay in aesthetics as a nurse, since in my state, nurse practitioners and nurses make similar salaries. I‚Äôm unsure whether pursuing NP school is worth it, or if I should focus on paying off my debt first.

In my heart, I still see myself becoming an FNP, particularly because I‚Äôd love to work in dermatology and women‚Äôs health, which are my passions. But I‚Äôve also had such a fulfilling experience working in psych during nursing school and feel drawn to that field as well.

At this point, I‚Äôm considering a couple of years of travel nursing experience in MedSurg/tele, then moving to ICU for a while to get my CCRN before deciding between CRNA or NP school once I‚Äôve paid off my debt. I‚Äôve also thought about pursuing some IT certifications to work in healthcare technology behind the scenes.

I‚Äôm feeling torn because I have so many interests, and I‚Äôm not sure which path to take. If anyone has experience with navigating a similar crossroads or can share how they reached their career decision, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice. I do enjoy my current nursing specialty, but I feel like I could be doing more, and there are other paths that excite me as well.

Thank you in advance for any guidance!",Dear-Solid-8039,1,1.0,0,1742618824,2025-03-22 04:47:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jh0sem/career_advice_np_crna_tech/,3,2025
1jh0mi1,Advice about problems in an internship,"Hi, I‚Äôve been having some problems in my internship and don‚Äôt know how to make things better or just some perspective. I would appreciate any thoughts! 

I started a public relations internship in January and things have not gone as expected. This is my first internship in pr, but I‚Äôve developed transferable skills in my previous internships and throughout school. My tasks are manageable, or at least I thought. It‚Äôs mostly monitoring media coverage, making media lists, or sending pr packages. Nothing crazy, but last week my supervisors set up a meeting with all the interns pretty much telling us we‚Äôre not doing well and have since had a few messages or conversations with the same sentiment. They addressed some issues and I‚Äôll list a few bellow, some I thought were  fair but others seemed to be unhelpful. This is what I would appreciate advice on, am I being shortsighted or is this a leadership issue? 

Here are some of the issues:
Naming documents: I‚Äôve followed the suggested format starting with the date and I‚Äôve been consistent with it writing it out as 03.10.25 as an example. I‚Äôve sent in documents for two months and have made edits if something was wrong, like a typo in the name, but the date has never been addressed. I assumed I was doing it correctly because that‚Äôs what I was told initially, it has never been pointed out, and I‚Äôve been consistent with all the brands. In the meeting last week the way the name was brought up. They said names have to be either 03.10.25 or 3.10.25 but there is a right option and it depends on the brand and month. It depending on how it is written in the tracker, but that is not steady by month or brand. It is just not consistent and honestly I hadn‚Äôt even noticed the difference or the extra 0. I think this should have been mentioned so I could be aware that it changes and to take action appropriately.

Prioritizing tasks: We have an sheet with assignments for all the interns. We get the assignment information, like brand, due date, and sometimes notes. Today, I worked on an ongoing assignment that was due today. There was assignment assigned today with an upcoming due date, but it is due next week so I didn‚Äôt prioritize it. My supervisors were upset that I didn‚Äôt prioritize on this new assignment. I will get to some more details in the next section.

Lack of communication or miscommunication: I have been told I need to answer emails more quickly, which is totally reasonable and have made adjustments. There is also some things that are not getting through for me and my supervisors. Back to the example mentioned before. The new assignment was on something I had never done, so I messaged my supervisor with a few questions. He suggested we hop on a call, to go through it easier. We had this call and I thought it was productive I got my questions answered and thought I understood. Later on in the day, my supervisors expressed dissatisfaction that I did not prioritize this new assignment. From the call I understood that I had time to complete this assignment, since it was due next week. I was told to start it, and I did, but they wanted me to prioritize it. There was a complete misunderstanding. 

I will acknowledge my errors in this role, but I think it‚Äôs not a one sided issue. This is my first pr internship and it‚Äôs a learning experience, so I don‚Äôt know every task. I occasionally make mistakes, that could be avoided, like typos or missing media coverage. And I have been hesitant, until after the meeting, to ask questions. They seem to answer in a unkind tone. This part could be in my head and I might just be reading too much into it. I also think they‚Äôre not delegating well or getting me and the other interns mixed up. Some of the information or updates are just not coming through to me, so I can‚Äôt take action to fix them.

One of the suggestions was to start sending end of day check ins, with updates on what I spent my day working on and what is left. And I‚Äôve been asking more questions about assignments and tasks. I didn‚Äôt think I was doing poorly to start, but I also didn‚Äôt think I would be getting a full time offer. I figured I was doing just average, which isn‚Äôt ideal but it‚Äôs just not the right fit. I do want to see it through but I don‚Äôt want it to continue to be a stressful experience. What can I do to improve my performance and meet their expectations better? Does anyone have any advice on how to communicate better?

1jh0ics,What should i do,"Okay so im a ASM at a retail (FD) and im having some problems. The SM allowed another ASM to disrespect me multiple times and she doesnt say anything. When i say something back she tells me to leave it alone. On top of that i am in college, i was pledging and i was doing part time. The ASM felt some way because i had a set schedule where i didnt work weekends due to me being in school and trying to catch up with work. I was already working over 25 hours.

The SM called me and asked if i wanted me bumped up to full time and i kinda was hesitant. I asked her could i have the weekends off or rotate thats the only way i can do full time. She agreed and said okay and she was going to try to find someone to do part time and possibly rotate.
About a week later im getting over 40 hours and im closing the store by myself and it keeps being petty remarks in the work gc. I called the SM if i can be bumped back down to part time because i seen an academic change that i did not like. She told me i can only be fired and i cant be demoted but she was going to ask the DM.

Prior to this i asked months in advance for my birthday weekend off and she said ""thats not promised unless i work two weekends back to back"" i also gave her my dates for my sorority stuff and she said okay. I told her also weeks before that i needed a specific day off because i have a mandatory meeting with this sorority.
She said i needed to work my days and no nobody is going to take my shift. Mind you the SM said she cant work weekends because she not supposed to and can only work certain week days.

I find it funny because she took pto for the weekend. So i told her ima just have to figure something out. Going back to me wanting part time, the next day i come in she told me she hired someone for part time but they can only do mornings for the weekend not nights and that now i have to work every weekend and all my 42 hours. After i told her before i took part time i will not be able to work every weekends but majority i will be able to work. I feel like i have been set up for failure i dont wanna quit but i feel like thats what everyone will tell me. She doesnt let us talk to the DM and she always listen to the other ASM. When the other ASM ask for days off she gets it and the SM always works her shifts that she cant do.

1jgyx21,Is dropping a resume off in person too old fashioned or weird when I‚Äôve already applied online?,"

I‚Äôve been applying to jobs with city governments in my area. I have a masters degree from an Ivy League in the relevant field, I‚Äôm qualified for the stuff I‚Äôm applying for, no issues at former jobs and people who will enthusiastically recommend me, but I‚Äôm just not hearing back from anywhere. 

It feels like everything is depersonalized with online apps and screenings. Places don‚Äôt want to see resumes and cover letters it seems, everything is explicitly through the online systems. I feel like a robot is just gonna screen my app and toss me to the curb if I didn‚Äôt put enough keywords in the right places. 

Back to the point‚Äîthere‚Äôs a city government  job I just applied to online that is a fantastic fit for me as far as location, pay, duties. Im qualified enough for it to apply and early career enough in my field that I‚Äôm super eager to learn and grow in the role. I‚Äôm tired of not hearing anything and I want to set myself apart because apparently my education and experience isn‚Äôt cutting it in everything else I‚Äôve applied to. 

I feel the urge to just go into the office and say‚Ä¶hello? Drop something off? Bring a resume even though I already applied online and just hope it ends up on a desk? Say hi to the receptionist??? Anything just to not be clicking ‚Äúsend‚Äù and putting my application off into the void. I really want this job. 

Are there any cons to this plan? Will it come off weird, over eager, or desperate (I mean I am)? Would going in person somehow back fire when the apps are online and I‚Äôve already applied? Is there something you‚Äôd bring other than a resume if you do recommend going? Should I write a note? Should I ask to talk to the director?

Personally I always get a little suspicious when an employer starts asking about what your goals are. Like they‚Äôre trying to check where your head is at for their own benefit.

Anyways it‚Äôs funny that this is coming up because on the low I have actually been job hunting and have made it a personal goal to grow and have moved on to something else by this time next year. However I don‚Äôt have any final job offers yet despite having interviews and actively being in several hiring processes currently (looking to work for the government). I‚Äôm just not sure what I will say. I mean I‚Äôm aware that I‚Äôm close to hitting the wage cap for my current position but Theres isn‚Äôt going to be any managerial openings for me at least not in the realm of what I‚Äôve been doing here. So idk I think it‚Äôs kind of obvious if I say I want growth they‚Äôre gonna be able to tell from a mile away that I already have one foot out the door. Then they may have a hard on for trying to find reasons to can me.

1jgw5v6,Student crisis,"I'm in a bit of a messy situation. I'm a freshman in college, and I encountered a huge crisis. Last summer, when I had to choose a faculty, I was considering two options: pharmacy and general medicine. Most of my family members work in healthcare, so the direction was clear and after a huge dilemma I finally chose pharmacy. The main reason for that was that my family actually owns a pharmacy and my dad is currently the ""boss"", and it was pretty clear that I'd have a relatively easy way up (of course that was not my only reason), but lately I started questioning this decision.
Studying is not a problem, thankfully I am a pretty good student. I started thinking frequently about being a surgeon of some sort, and I feel like I'd rather study more anatomy and less chemistry.
There are also some aspects of being a pharmacist that I find really annoying, for example the lack of social appreciation. I am not sure of the salary I'd make as the leader of a pharmacy (after at least 10-15 years of experience, of course), I never asked my dad but I'm pretty sure I'd be better off financially as well by being a doctor.
It's also possible that it's just a phase, but it scares me a lot, now that my whole career is at stake, but I'm also too embarrassed to tell people I'm feeling this way.
I tried to sum it up but if something isn't clear, ask me.

\- Previous experience: Nanny, retail sales, daycare, CNA

\- Education: High school diploma, CNA training

1jguygj,How to deal with a terrible manager? Just leave?,"What should I do about a new terrible manager? leave or try not to care?

The company I am working for had a restructuring/layoff a while back and almost all my teammates got laid off or left on their own afterward.

After this, they set one of my teammates as the team's manager. **The issue is that he has major personality problems and absolutely no management skills!** I could go on about how terrible of a manager and person he is but I don't think that would be helpful here.

I have been applying to jobs every now and then, depending on how tired of my manager I am feeling. I have a few promising interviews going on at the moment.

**I am worried about changing my job and my new job being even worse!** Also, I am a foreigner in the country I live in and am a bit worried about the probation period as it would be much easier to get fired during that 2-3 months unlike now (I live in the EU). I guess I am simply tired of the known evil but too worried to try to unknown evil!

I have been trying to make it work with my current manager but it just does not work. I feel like I am less productive than ever as I am constantly attacked and questioned.

With all my previous managers I would feel like someone is rooting for me. But now, I feel the exact opposite! Which is terrible... **I feel nervous about doing everything perfectly just so they cannot use it against me.** As far as I know, getting fired here is pretty difficult so I am not exactly worried about that, it is just uncomfortable and unrewarding to work here.

Am I just caring too much about work? should I just care less? Log in, do work with no emotion or worry, log out, and do not think about work outside of work.

1jgunee,At My Wits End,"3/21 Purchasing Department Nightmare

I have been with this company for 2 years. One running their retail location and one year in corporate as a Purchasing Agent/Buyer. I have previously been employed in the pool industry for 4 years, so I do have knowledge and experience.

I Asked Guy my manager for help. He ""jokingly"" said why do I even pay you. I asked for him to print a to buy report ( which I have asked in the past and never showed me but did it for me). I then had printer issues since they changed the terminal on my P21 system. Asked him to print the P.O for me due to this.. then he made the remark of ""paying me"" laughing. I felt undermined and very angry. Mind you the CEO and COO dont behave as such. Opposed to the other workers in our department ( One always calling out or coming in late.. amd one being out for 4 months for surgery) It's becoming am environment i dislike. Lack of communication, throwing work on me that isn't mine to help out co workers, and asking for help I'm barely coached by my manager.

I want to go to HR with this issues, but I feel it won't be taken seriously. There is a lot of nepotism and favoritism that occurs. A lot of gossip also occurs, which I hate to hear or partake in. The environment is emotionally exhausting.

Mind you I get to work 15 minutes early every day and before my boss. Start time is 8am, and always arrive at 7:45am to get prepared for the day. I only ask questions if I am unsure, due to that fact I am essentially left in my own and don't want to make a mistake if I am unsure especially with Purchasing orders. I feel asking more questions than not is beneficial to make sure I'm doing my part correctly. Instead I feel I am being a nuisance, especially with lack of guidance from my supervisor.

I have had had a senior Co worker that helps me more than he does. I also have a cubicle mate who is usually late or doesn't come in due to drinking issues, but yet I feel I get more thrown on me. I am so burnt out. I'm wondering if I should just leave. I work with a lot of old 50-60 white men and women and feel they are racist. This makes me on edge every day and I have to bite my tounge. I'm a mixed individual. I try to keep it professional, but the best way to do so is with no social interaction unless work related.

Mind you I have my bachelor's in business and I feel this isn't good enough. May be time to look for other employment. ",Loose_Ad3270,1,1.0,0,1742599491,2025-03-21 23:24:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jgunee/at_my_wits_end/,3,2025
1jgtelj,Erosion of Confidence,"I‚Äôm a highly ambitious software engineer who takes immense pride in my craft. My solutions are innovative and impactful, and I work quickly, leveraging my extensive experience to deliver results. Collaboration is a core value of mine‚ÄîI firmly believe it‚Äôs the key to achieving greatness. I actively coordinate with others and strategically seek help from the right people for specific tasks.

However, I struggle with deep-seated fears. I‚Äôm terrified of being seen as incompetent or failing, and this fear often holds me back. Despite my efforts, I feel undervalued at work. I have two managers, and both have expressed that my social skills don‚Äôt meet their expectations. They also seem to believe that my colleague is significantly more skilled than I am. Whenever I propose an idea or solution, they ask if I‚Äôve consulted this colleague. This reaction is deeply demoralizing. It implies that I don‚Äôt collaborate‚Äîwhich I do, passionately‚Äîand suggests that my ideas are only valid if they have my colleague‚Äôs endorsement. It feels like a part of me dies every time this happens.

My colleague is undeniably skilled and humble, and working with him is always productive and pleasant. But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm not viewed as highly as he is. This perception eats away at me, even though I know my contributions are valuable.

The project I‚Äôm working on is a golden opportunity to showcase my skills. It‚Äôs a challenging, unsolved problem, and the solution I‚Äôve developed has the potential to change lives. Yet, when I present my work, there‚Äôs little to no enthusiasm from my managers, even though they stand to benefit the most from it. I don‚Äôt receive extra compensation for my innovations‚Äîthey do. Their lack of support feels illogical and counterproductive, but it persists.

Years ago, I expressed disinterest in designing databases, but times have changed. Now, we‚Äôre working on a program that requires advanced data handling, and I‚Äôve developed a database design that exceeds the demands. Yet, my past statement is still held against me, and my ideas are met with suspicion rather than excitement. Software engineering is a field that evolves rapidly, and engineers grow and adapt. Statements made years ago shouldn‚Äôt define my capabilities today.

I don‚Äôt blame my managers‚Äîthey‚Äôre entitled to their opinions, and they have more experience working with engineers. I understand the spectrum of engineers out there, from the unmotivated to the exceptional. But I hate feeling like I‚Äôm being lumped into the ‚Äúlazy, socially awkward‚Äù category. That‚Äôs not who I am, and it‚Äôs not how I want to be seen.

I‚Äôve seen others cope with similar situations by lowering their standards and meeting management‚Äôs low expectations. But I can‚Äôt live like that. When I look back on my life, I want to be remembered as a loving father who played with his kids, raised them well, and provided for his family. That‚Äôs the legacy I want to leave. But I also want to reach my full potential and achieve my dreams. Right now, my environment isn‚Äôt helping me get there.

I‚Äôve tried talking to one of my managers about this. He apologized and assured me that he trusts me, but I couldn‚Äôt fully believe him. I‚Äôm not sure why, but his words didn‚Äôt resonate deeply with me. I‚Äôm good at handling conflicts at work, but my reputation means everything to me, and I feel like it‚Äôs slipping away.

Recently, I was talking to another colleague about the breakthroughs we‚Äôve made with the skilled engineer. He praised my colleague as the greatest engineer we have, without a single word about my contributions. It stung. I tell myself I don‚Äôt care about credit, but the truth is, I do. I want to be recognized for the work I do and the ideas I bring to the table. But it feels like no matter how much I collaborate or innovate, the credit always goes to someone else.

I have a habit of praising the people I work with, but I rarely hear anyone say a kind word about me. I don‚Äôt understand why. I can‚Äôt imagine working with someone and not acknowledging their strengths, yet it seems others don‚Äôt feel the same way about me.

I‚Äôve considered changing jobs, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll face the same dynamics elsewhere. Starting over in a new place would mean spending years proving myself again, and by then, more senior or extroverted engineers might have already taken the spotlight.

1jgruf1,"I‚Äôm smart, I‚Äôm a mom, and I‚Äôm scared.","I have always been a successful performing artist. I have made a living at it for over 20 years, and have also taught at a college along the way. I really don‚Äôt enjoy teaching, so I think it‚Äôs best left for people who have a passion for it.

I‚Äôve reached a point where traveling (basically a requirement in order for me to make a living) is more of a challenge for my husband and kids than it used to be. 

It has taken me a long time to come to this conclusion. Years. But I have finally decided, I‚Äôm ready to let it go. 

So now I need to find something new.
To be clear, if I didn‚Äôt work at all, we would financially be fine. But I think I would be incredibly bored and feel purposeless.

There is the driven part of me that wants to use all of my experience and apply it to the corporate side of the performing arts. Possibly pursue a certificate in arts administration and go after a great new career. 

But there is also the side of me that has had more time home with the kids lately and doesn‚Äôt want the pressure of a job that requires me to bring my work home with me. My high schooler will be a junior next year and we‚Äôll have college planning to do. And my younger son is 8.

So the other thing I consider doing is something mindless or at least fairly stress-free. Something where people are not depending on me to move mountains. Something where I‚Äôm engaged while I‚Äôm there and free when I‚Äôm home. Even something physical that keeps my body moving. I don‚Äôt think these jobs would pay much, entry level. But I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm in the early stages of thinking it through.

I wasn't sure about what to pursue in post-secondary and didn‚Äôt want to spend money on a program without knowing what I actually wanted to do.

1jgriie,I am writing this part for myself and part for others who resonates,"Some background: I grew up with Asian parents and never thought about what I wanted to do in life. My only goal growing up was always getting the best grade I can, which I succeed. Fast forward, now I just turned 30 with a son and have been in a career field that I hate. Others might think I am crazy because my work is not super demanding, fully remote, decent pay. Lots of people would probably settle now and even my husband told me that we are perfectly comfortable.

Well, I am not. I am depressed and anxious in my current life. When I imagined myself being at the top of this field 20 years from now and I don‚Äôt feel I am happy at all. I read a lot of books (from people I respect such as Charlie Munger) and every single one of them is telling me that I should spend my time doing things I love. If my final goal is to live a fulfilled life, thinking backwards, what would prevent me from getting there?

1. Wasting 8 hours a day doing something I don‚Äôt like.
2. Not dedicated enough to pursue true passion.
3. Not spending meaningful time with my family.

However, obstacles are obvious, I won‚Äôt be making as much money if I pursue my dream at least at the beginning. This will bring instability, potential other anxiety or struggles. Although my husband makes enough money to support us if we live a very very very frugal live, it is still very scary to make the decision.

I constantly asking myself if I am throwing my son‚Äôs future away if I quit my job? But then debate with - what about my life. I also only live once and when my son grow up, I hope him can live his life instead of for his offsprings. 

If I lose after I quit my current job, I could potentially come back. At minimum, I can find a low paying job and make life do. But the upside is infinite. This on theory or from a lot of the book I read, seem like a very obvious decision to make, but we all know it‚Äôs not in reality. The scare of losing what we already have is so powerful that makes people stuck in the analysis paralysis.

I am in the middle of making the decision/transition. Would love to hear some of your opinion if you are also considering or if you have been there or if you just want to discuss.

I have a kid with my husband, so we need to be financially responsible, although we have some savings but won‚Äôt last long if we don‚Äôt downgrade our life. My husband makes ok money - less than me but should be able to support the family if we cut expenses (renting our house out and moving to an RV, stop using full time nanny and I will provide child care).

I don‚Äôt think I will come back to this field if I can make something else work (have couple side gigs, nothing provide substantial money yet) Would FMLA be a good option?

1jgpml5,Side gigs and conflicts while working full time,"I work for a small NPO right now (10-13 staff). We recently got a new CEO who has pretty much gutted and restructured the place and the environment had been quite toxic, demoralizing, and generally unsafe (ive spent waaaay too many crying nights, panic attacks on Sunday nights, etc.) The CEO has gone on a little rampage and fired a bunch of people to ""restructure"" and brought on her friend in an executive role. 

In trying to find another job, I was approached by another NPO for a role, though it would be as a consultant/contractor for a year type of gig. It's not fulltime but it looks interesting, something I care about and genuinely would enjoy it, and it would allow me to feel a whole better about my current job because a lot of the anxiety is fear of being fired. So a small back up would alleviate that for me.

My question: should i do this freelance gig while continuing at my current role? If so, should i tell my current job? 

The employee rule is outside employment is allowed as long as it doesnt interfere with your role and there is no conflict. The conflict piece worries me. This side gig is with a NPO that issues small business loans to many types of businesses. The current NPO i am at is in the corporate finance (capital markets, wealth, investment banking, etc.) space. There is to my knowledge some overlap but not really a conflict of interest per se but i am not sure. They are not competiting in the same space or serving the same demographic. 

In both roles, i would be a policy analyst btw, so im not actually gonna be dealing with funds or anything. 

Ideally, Id love to just find another full time job but i keep applying and other than part time job, no call backs.

1jgo4wp,Job opportunity,"I‚Äôve been in my current construction corporate job for seven months now, and overall, it‚Äôs been a great experience.

Within this short time, I‚Äôve already received a generous $15k salary increase. I have the flexibility to make my own schedule‚Äîas long as I get my tasks done, I can leave early. The group of guys I work with makes the job enjoyable, and the environment is easygoing. I also receive bonuses, solid benefits, and overall, it‚Äôs a pretty comfortable setup.

The only real downside is having to deal with homeowners, trades, office staff, and inspectors, which can sometimes be a headache.

However, for the past three months, a homeowner I helped close on his home has been trying to recruit me to work for him.

He‚Äôs offering to match or increase my current salary and provide a company truck (that I could also use for personal use) or pay off my current truck. On top of that, I‚Äôd get a gas card, big bonuses, PTO, paid vacations, and full benefits. I‚Äôd have the flexibility to make my own schedule and would manage 3-5 crews‚Äîwithout having to deal with homeowners. I would still interact with trades and inspectors, but not at the level I do now.

The only catch is that I would need to spend some time working alongside one of the crews first. The owner wants me to be hands-on to fully understand the work before stepping into the project manager role. While he estimates I‚Äôd only need to be in this role for 2-3 jobs, there‚Äôs no definitive timeline since the current project manager (whom I‚Äôd be replacing) doesn‚Äôt have a set date for moving to the Carolinas to take on a similar role.

The company itself isn‚Äôt corporate but has been around for many years and, according to everyone I‚Äôve spoken to, is considered ‚Äúrecession-proof.‚Äù

I‚Äôm torn because I genuinely enjoy where I am. The pay is good, the environment is fun, and I see room for long-term growth in my current company. Plus, I wouldn‚Äôt have to start from scratch. However, the offer on the table is incredibly tempting‚Äîno truck payment, free gas, phone bill covered, and significant bonuses.

I‚Äôm not sure which path offers the better long-term opportunity, but both have serious pros and cons. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Forgot to mention in my current job, I just drive to one spot. In the new job I may have to drive to different cities within my state 1-3 times a month or less then that to drop off Material.

He's constantly taking updates for each hour and assigned a new joinee as another team lead on us to track our progress even tho he's a frontend engineer.

I had the red flags of being ousted on 12th of this month but i decided to stick till this month so i can atleast get the salary and then resign.

The product MVP will most probably launch in the next month so there are high chances he cant fire me before that.

1jgmkim,Dental hygienist or electrician?,"I (19f) know these are very different career paths but I‚Äôm torn between the two. For dental hygiene I like the fact that you can work full time or part time (I‚Äôd  love to go part time in the future after starting a family), I‚Äôm more attracted to the job in general and would love to do that and instruct Pilates or something on the side. The things I‚Äôm concerned about with hygiene is the high rate of carpal tunnel and other physical chronic issues that develop that may leave you unable to work, and since people usually can‚Äôt work full time their whole careers in this field due to physical chronic issues and with the economy being so bad where I live (Canada) I‚Äôm afraid it might not bring in enough money in the future although the hourly rate is still good for hygienists here (around 40). I am also just a worry wort and worry about if another pandemic were to happen I would have to work in peoples mouths or not work at all. Hygienists often don‚Äôt get benefits or retirement plans where I live (but saving for my own retirement doesn‚Äôt seem like the worst case scenario) and I can always but my own benefits for around 100-200 a month. I am just more drawn to a more ‚Äúgirly‚Äù job if you will. On the other hand, electrician offers good income, good stability, benefits and retirement. It doesn‚Äôt allow the ability to go part time later in life (as far as I‚Äôm aware) and honestly just something I would do for more money and stability.

1jgmdwc,Are marketing jobs for Americans doomed to offshoring and AI?,"Upfront preface: everybody around the world deserves successful careers. Global competition is just simply frustrating.

Okay, so in the last five years, I've been laid off three times. In each instance, there was someone on the other side of the globe able to do my job for a fraction of the cost.

In my most recent situation, I was laid off from a Fortune 500 company that replaced thousands of employees below the VP level with someone from a low labor cost country. It happened slowly, and I watched talented folks with 15-20 years of tenure at the company (developers, designers, email marketers, social media folks, strategists) all get wiped out and replaced with someone with 2 or fewer years of professional experience. The cherry on top was getting to train my replacements (they hired 6 people to fill my web strategy role) so I could collect my meager separation bonus.

There are so many job seekers vying for the same small set of jobs it seems. In my 15 year career, I've never felt this level of competition before.

Between offshoring and AI, are there any roles or functions under the marketing umbrella that feel somewhat safe these days?

1jgm8ju,Need advice on whether to go to this interview,"Hi, so I've been underemployed for a year with a small minimum wage part-time job that's remote keeping me slightly afloat. My boyfriend and I had to move in with his mother to survive two months ago. I finally got an interview but now since we moved, the location is two hours away. 

They want me to come in on Monday in person. My issue is that while I'm barely making ends meet, relocating would cost me thousands and while the pay would be decent, with rent (minimum 2500 a month), down payment, bills, groceries, fixing my car which is rotting away from nonuse, I wouldn't have much left over a month until my boyfriend can get a job as he was laid off as well.  I don't know when he'd be able to get one. (He has no money right now)

Ideally I'd find a job that is partially remote and we could stay at his mother's until we can recover financially from the last year of unemployment, but this job - while the pay is 95,000 a year, doesn't mean much in Boston and to move, I'd be looking at about 8 or 9 k just to settle in as my boyfriend can't pay for anything currently.

I also don't want to live where this job is at all, so to be stuck here with a lease for a year sounds awful. But it's nearly impossible to get a job  anywhere for me and impossible when I don't live in the same state. 

Also, most good jobs in my industry (marketing) allow for some remote work and that's ideally what I want but this job doesn't allow for that. I guess I just don't know what to do.

 Is going to the interview worth it at this point? I have a bit of savings but ...it's slowly dwindling. ",rayvin4000,1,1.0,0,1742577764,2025-03-21 17:22:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jgm8ju/need_advice_on_whether_to_go_to_this_interview/,3,2025

2.	My first-choice university is my top preference, but its Computer Science program is insanely competitive, and there‚Äôs a high chance I won‚Äôt get accepted.

3.	The same university is offering a new Bachelor‚Äôs program in Economics, Computer Science, and Data Science (all together), which I have also applied for. I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll get in.

Cons: This program is being offered for the first time this year, so there isn‚Äôt much information about it‚Äîno seniors, no established track record. Also, I find it odd that this program is being offered by the humanities school rather than the engineering school, which seems weird.

1jgm6q1,Feeling trapped. Not sure what my next move needs to be.,"Long story short. My career journey has been...unconventional. My early 20s was filled with short stints of sales, customer service, and odd jobs. I was out of the work force in my mid 20s due to health reasons. In 2020 I decided I wanted to pursue what I originally had planned on pursuing which was cyber security. 

Got some certifications and started looking for a job. I miraculously landed a job in the IT field that was far above entry level. Learned tons and was promoted up in the company several times. 5 years later things have started to become less than ideal. 

This has been a remote position and I have built my life around that. A few weeks ago, management sent out a notice that we were returning to office full time. This is an issue for me for many reasons but the biggest being transportation (no car) and living quite a distance away from the office. The pay is not worth me purchasing a car and all of the costs associated with it. So its going from a semi-decent paying job, to a really bad paying job. I have another 3ish weeks before the return to office. 

So I decided I was done, and started looking for a new job. I am now finding that the job market (especially IT) is in really rough shape. So now I am lost. 

Do I change careers? Do I suck it up and stay where I am? Has anyone delt with a similar problem? 

The idea of going back to sales scares me. I dont want to throw away the work that I have put in. ",IntentlyFaulty,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1742577643,2025-03-21 17:20:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jgm6q1/feeling_trapped_not_sure_what_my_next_move_needs/,3,2025
1jgly0w,Applying for Internal Promotion. Is it too early?,"I was hired and started on December 2nd, 2024 as a Records Technician for the Admissions and Records Department at a Community College. I do have a Bachelors Degree as well as 4-5 years or professional experience and that got me a pay bump (very small). 

I‚Äôm now going on month 4 and I love working here. The overall culture is great and I have great benefits. The admissions role was always seen as a foot in the door and a stepping stone to move up in the college. I‚Äôd love for this to be my last employer. But with a bachelors degree I just refuse to work in admissions forever. I have learned a lot in my 3-4 months here and this has been very helpful to understanding the admissions process. 

 I see a role has opened for a Financial Aid Analyst that pays roughly $9,000 more per year than the role I‚Äôm in now. I am very much qualified for the role and I feel like not only would this be a good advancement for my career but also further my ability to round out my learning of the entire admissions process (Admissions, Financial Aid, Advising) as all of these processes work together and are held in the same Division. 

I am not super close to the Financial Aid Director but we have spoken many times in the past (including when I was a student) and we have a good rapport. I was considering reaching out to her first regarding the role and whether she thinks it would be a good fit.  

My fear is coming off as uncommitted to my current supervisor and that I‚Äôm just trying to work my way up the chain. However I have had coworkers who have been here for a few years tell me that they don‚Äôt expect me to be here very long (due to my education) and that they could see me applying for a promotion sooner rather than later. This was nice to hear and certainly makes me feel more confident in doing so. I‚Äôve also reached out to HR to see if there‚Äôs any internal policies for time required in a position before promotion. 

So what should I do? Should I wait since I‚Äôm only 3-4 months in? Should I be ambitious and go for it? Frankly I need to improve my income as I‚Äôm the only income for my family and I‚Äôve got a second child on the way. But I don‚Äôt want to risk losing my job here. I‚Äôd like to be here for the long haul. 

Ideally I‚Äôd like to end up in an HR position one day at the college. Worst case I wait until closer to my 1 year mark and then apply for promotions then.

Cut to the owner of the company that my job was outsourced to calls me. Things were presented to him in a different light. He asked around and my reputation was so solid that there may be an opportunity to work for them. Better pay and benefits too.

1jglba6,Are You Working for Passion or Just to Pay the Bills?,"Ever wake up and wonder, ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù

You‚Äôre not alone.

Most people work jobs they don‚Äôt love because the bills don‚Äôt pay themselves.

But here‚Äôs the thing:

When you only work to pay bills, burnout is never far behind.

Why?

Because doing something you don‚Äôt enjoy‚Äîday after day‚Äîdrains your energy. It empties your heart. It wears you down.

**The Truth About ‚ÄúFollowing Your Passion‚Äù**

People love saying, ‚ÄúFollow your passion!‚Äù

It sounds great, right?

But there‚Äôs a catch: passion alone won‚Äôt pay your bills.

At least, not at first.

So you‚Äôre stuck. You work jobs that feel empty just to survive. And slowly, stress piles up. You become exhausted, frustrated, burned out.

You might think, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm lazy. Maybe I just need to work harder.‚Äù

Nope. It‚Äôs deeper than that.

**Why Money Stress Causes Burnout**

Here‚Äôs the truth:

Money stress is one of the biggest causes of burnout.

It quietly drains your energy, day after day.

It makes work feel meaningless. It steals joy from your personal life.

I‚Äôve been there.

I used to work long shifts in jobs I didn‚Äôt care about, just to earn enough. It felt like running on a treadmill. I was tired, stressed, and unhappy.

That changed when I realized something important:

**Financial freedom is the real key to avoiding burnout.**

*Financial Freedom Doesn‚Äôt Mean Getting Rich*

Let‚Äôs clear something up right now:

Financial freedom isn‚Äôt about being super rich. It‚Äôs about having enough money to choose the life you want.

It‚Äôs about:

‚Ä¢ Not worrying about next month‚Äôs rent.

‚Ä¢ Having a little saved for emergencies.

‚Ä¢ Feeling secure, so you can take chances and try new things.

When you feel financially safe, work becomes less stressful. You can choose work that brings meaning‚Äînot just paychecks.

**Simple Steps to Financial Freedom (and Less Burnout)**

You don‚Äôt need to win the lottery to be free from money stress.

Here are simple ways to move toward financial freedom and away from burnout:

**1. Face Your Finances Honestly**

Once a month, look clearly at your money. Write down your income, expenses, and debts.

Knowing exactly where you stand helps lower stress.

**2. Start an Emergency Fund**

Even a small savings fund helps you sleep better at night. Aim to save a little each month until you have enough for basic emergencies.

**3. Spend Less Than You Earn**

This sounds simple, but most people miss it. If you spend less than you earn, you create freedom for yourself.

Less debt, less stress.

**4. Plan for the Long Term**

Where do you want to be in 5 years? What kind of work do you want to do?

Having clear goals makes daily decisions easier and less stressful.

**5. Invest in Yourself**

Learn new skills that could help you find meaningful work later. Read, take courses, or develop new talents.

This builds confidence and opens doors.

**Why This Helps You Beat Burnout**

When money stress goes down, your energy and passion go up.

Suddenly, work feels different. It feels better.

When you have financial freedom, you can say ‚Äúno‚Äù to jobs you hate. You can say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to opportunities you love. You feel in control‚Äînot trapped.

That‚Äôs the real key to avoiding burnout.",ApprehensiveCar4900,0,0.25,0,1742575482,2025-03-21 16:44:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jglba6/are_you_working_for_passion_or_just_to_pay_the/,3,2025

So that I can gain a better understanding of the situation, I've requested access to the full review, so I know exactly what needs to be changed for the next review period. It helps me to have things black on white to avoid over thinking and ""reading between lines"" etc.

I applied Tuesday night and had a conversation with the district manager on Wednesday. Told him I would like to be considered and that I applied. His immediate response was ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to give (coworker) a shot at it.‚Äù I was immediately taken aback as I have way more experience and have been taking on these managerial tasks and roles for months now. I have been with the company 2 years to his 6 but I have been in the same position for 7 where he has only been in the position for 3. I was told it is not about length of service or tenure. He said that coworker will need support in the role and would like to offer me an assistant manager position in 90 days. He also said he sees me becoming a manager at a different location in the next year. Personally, we are friends but due to his personal life and attitude I don‚Äôt see it working out for anyone. 

This coworker has made multiple jabs (ie- if you get promoted before me i‚Äôll quit, you are not more qualified or better at the job than i am, asking our past boss why i‚Äôm his ‚Äúnew favorite‚Äù) Mind you these were all unprompted comments. After sleeping on it I went back to my district manager and asked what went into making the decision of choosing coworker. The answer I was given was that he feels that we are both fully qualified and coworker is not any better or well suited for the job but coworker has asked for promotions in the past and was turned down due to his personal life and attitude and has made progress on those items. 

After this conversation district manager proceeded to ask me for help with 5 different tasks. I don‚Äôt know how to not feel unsettled or slighted by the answers I was given, maybe it‚Äôs just me thinking selfishly but I don‚Äôt think I would have such an issue with it if I didn‚Äôt know this coworkers attitude, was given a reason other than ‚Äúthey asked first‚Äù, or had not been told that upper management knows he will need help in this role.

I just started a fully remote corporate job a month ago, so I‚Äôm still new. It‚Äôs been going well and my boss seems very nice and understanding.

The situation: 
To make a long story short, last Friday in the am my cat had an emergency and I had to take her to the emergency vet. It was sudden and she‚Äôs only 5 / healthy and I live alone so I was a mess of worry. She‚Äôs my little baby. 

I emailed my boss at lunch time after I finally got her settled / found out she wasn‚Äôt dying, and asked for his number. I called him in tears and explained the situation, that I hadn‚Äôt logged on yet and what happened with my cat. I told him I was very sorry for missing the morning. He told me to take the rest of the day off. I went back the next day (even though he said I could take it off), and my cat ended up okay. 

My boss has asked me how she‚Äôs been doing this week. But I‚Äôm wondering if I should apologize for how I handled things? It wasn‚Äôt very professional.

1jghqs0,15 years in IT. How can I progress?,"I'd really appreciate some help deciding what to do next.

I am 40 now and been in IT for 15 years. My progression looks like: full-stack developer, software engineer, tech lead, project manager. 

I liked building things. I like novelty and get board with repetition. I enjoyed the creativity and problem solving aspects associated with software development work, but I don't wish to remain in that track, because I'd feel like I have not made progress/moved ahead.

My current title is project manager, but I think it isn't probably my thing. I don't enjoy chasing people to do their work and the drudgery of arranging and minuting meetings. Most of the managers in the company are of the ""commander"" type (according to the model that categorizes people into commander, cheerleader, controller, caretaker). They are energetic, loud, aggressive, outgoing and outspoken. This is what is valued and seen as ""leadership"". I don't fit that profile, so I feel inadequate.

Now that the project is closed, my manager is trying to get me do drudgery work related to change requests in exchange for a seemingly glamorous title like ""Delivery Manager"". The vendor doing the development is sloppy and incapable, and I know I'll be miserable.  He also said that I can claim any title I wanted and select the department/project.

Here's a list of what I have thought of doing next. I took courses and certificates and tried to apply to these jobs, but got no interviews. May be I can use my manager's offer to claim one of these titles - although I'm not sure if the actual work will be fulfilling - in order to have some experience that can land me offers in the future:

- DevOps Engineer: At some point, I felt like this is somthing that I can be pationate about, since I have delivered software the non-DevOps way and wss enthusiastic about exploring how DevOps can help overcome the problems that I struggled with. I was disappointed to receive no offers. I think employers favor a system admin background and I'm worried that it's becoming an entry-level job for which I'm too old. I'm worried it's going to be a downgrade embarking on this journey from zero. My company does not do in-house development. They deploy COTS.

- Solution Architect or Enterprise Architect. I think I can be good at these and I'm interested to learn. We have a new project coming, but my manager hinted that this spot is reserved to one of his buddies (a current solution architect). I cannot compete because I know he favors that person and thinks he's more capable. I know I am as capable, if not more, but I don't think I can convince them and I'm starting to doubt my capabilities because I'm not getting interviews.

- Cloud somthing. The company is a small cloud provider, but there isn't much business. There already a ""Cloud Solution Architect"" - a big title for an account manager. I don't know if ""Cloud Engineer"" is a good idea. I don't have a background in system administration. Will it be a wise move to take on an entry-level job in cloud? Is it woth starting from zero at this stage?

I'm interested to get into a data or AI career, but worried that I'm starting too late and that employers are not willing to give one a chance if they don't have the same exact experience they're asking for. I'll be then on the same level as any fresh grad.

I don't think I have the stamina to get into consulting now. I prefer being dedicated to product/project.",Adorable_Tie1147,1,1.0,2,1742566322,2025-03-21 14:12:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jghqs0/15_years_in_it_how_can_i_progress/,3,2025

1jgh45b,Seeking Advice on Pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at 28: Is It the Right Path?,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently facing a tough decision and would appreciate your insights on whether pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics (specifically targeting machine learning or finance applications) is the right move for me.

**A bit about me:**

* **Background:** I'm 27 (would start at 28), from Italy, holding both BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My master's program was somewhat experimental and provided broad but superficial knowledge across various topics (ML, numerical methods, PDEs, CFD, ecc).
* **Master's Thesis Experience:** My thesis was a mix of theoretical work, data analysis, and simulations, conducted fully within academia. Unfortunately, my advisor was unresponsive (one email per month at best), providing minimal feedback and guidance. Despite this, I genuinely enjoyed the research aspects‚Äîexploring literature, coding, simulations, and teaching first-year students. The lack of supervision and feedback, however, was extremely frustrating.
* **Grades and Graduation:** Due to personal issues (Covid, family losses, mental health), I graduated 1.5 years late with relatively low grades (approx. 3.7/4.0, or 2:1 UK scale, 100/110 Italian scale).
* **Work Experience:** Post-graduation, I did a short internship where I mostly performed ""grunt work,"" gaining minimal valuable experience. This made me think that perhaps, in fields I'm interested in (Applied Scientist/Data Scientist roles, or R&D positions), not having a PhD may severely limit career growth, or even entering the job.

**Why I'm considering a PhD:**

* Career-wise, I believe a PhD might significantly increase my chances of landing interesting applied research roles, specifically in industries or fields such as machine learning, finance, or advanced data science. Given the current job market dynamics, I feel strongly that having a PhD could position me better in terms of career opportunities and access to roles involving meaningful and innovative research projects. 

**My concerns:**

1. **Funding and Competitiveness:** I can't afford to self-fund a PhD, so I need a fully-funded program (preferably abroad, as I want to leave Italy). Given my academic record, how realistically achievable is it to secure fully-funded positions, and what might improve my chances?
2. **Age and Timing:** Starting at 28 means finishing around 32-33. I'm concerned about whether entering the job market at this age, especially in fields like ML or finance, could negatively impact my career trajectory or employability. Is age a significant barrier in these fields?
3. **Grades and Delay:** My academic performance and delayed graduation due to personal and mental health reasons worry me, especially regarding how competitive my application would be compared to other candidates who graduated on time and with higher grades. How can I best mitigate or explain this aspect of my profile?
4. **Career Alternatives:** Beyond a PhD, I'm wondering if there are other viable career paths or alternatives (such as entry-level jobs, industry-specific training, boot camps, or specialized certifications) that could realistically lead me to my desired roles without the commitment of a PhD. Are these alternative paths credible and achievable?

**Additional Context:**

* I have no published research or conference presentations, which might further limit my competitiveness.
* I haven't yet applied for roles explicitly requiring PhDs, mainly due to insecurity over my academic record and fear of rejection.
* I'm geographically very flexible, with no personal constraints‚Äîindeed, my preference would be to find opportunities as far away from Italy as possible due to personal reasons.
* I'm open to additional preparation, training, or bridging courses if these could significantly enhance my profile and increase my competitiveness for PhD applications (if these do not delay my applications more).

I would appreciate any advice, especially from those who pursued a PhD later, or those who overcame similar academic or personal setbacks. If you think I‚Äôve missed crucial considerations, please let me know!

1jgfxov,New at job / about to go on maternity leave,"Need some career advice please!!! My post is a bit long but appreciate any advice, TIA! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I am 8.5 months pregnant and I started a new job 2 months ago, with the understanding I‚Äôd be going on maternity leave for 3 months after I started in January. I was the 2nd hire on a new team in my area of specialization (marketing and design), helping to build out processes and service offerings on this new team. The 1st person hired for this newly created team (6 months before me), has 15 years less experience than me. We basically have the same exact role as far as job description, but I have a slightly elevated staff level (senior associate vs associate), and salary, and we both report directly up to the leader of the team (me directly to the team head, and her through one of her deputies).  

To the rest of the team, we have been positioned as essentially having the same role. My boss has mentioned to me in a few 1-on-1s that she wants me to take the lead on certain initiatives currently happening, however that hasn‚Äôt been possible considering that some of these initiatives were already being worked on by my less senior colleague before I started, and I wasn‚Äôt able to really take them over b/c of other things I got involved in, and the fact that I am about to go on maternity leave for 3 months, while the project continues without me.

One of the things she wanted me to take over strategically is continuing while I am away, and she didn‚Äôt directly communicate to my colleague that she wanted me to take it over, so I just kind of shadowed as best as I could and made my opinions about certain things known, because I knew there was only so much I could do if I was going to be out for 3 months while the project continued on while I was out.

My boss has made references to me in our previous 1-on-1s that in time our roles will be more clearly defined in time, and will have clearer lanes from each other. I have been doing as much while I‚Äôve been here to take on a more strategic and higher level approach to things  to prove that I wanted to be seen as someone who wants to eventually lead the team.

Considering I am taking maternity leave in another 2 weeks and things have been pretty loose about what is expected of me in these short 2 months since I started, what would be the best way to position myself and communicate my clear desire to take her up on some of her longer term strategic goals and to position myself as more senior without coming across as too pushy? I will set up one final 1-on-1 with her next week and I am thinking of outlining goals for when I come back, but wanted to get any advice here on what might also be helpful as part of the meeting.

1jgf06q,being laid off for standing up every 30mins in the office,"Hey guys, i am in shock discovering the reason behind my being laid off atm. 

I got my first job out of uni last year. its design in the office. for months i worked so hard to learn and get the work done as fast as i can to prove myself. I barely used my phone at work.  i also tried to make friends with everyone because i thought its important that we know each other and it makes it easier for me to ask questions and learn.  

I worked so hard that sometimes i even dreamt of working at night (which i didnt enjoy!!)

I used the tomato clock (pomodoro) to work. every 30 or 40mins of intensive work, i would get up from my seat, walk a bit to the company kitchen to get some water, or go to toilet. usually its a 5 to 10mins break. sometimes in the kitchen, i would stare outside the window for 2mins to relax my eyes. this is because i know sitting for long period of time in front of the screen is bad for my back and eyes. i am very conscious of this. 

in the afternoon, sometimes i would need a 5/10 mins brisk walk outdoors to refresh myself to keep my efficiency up. 

Then the company removed me saying that the company doesnt have enough work for me. 

its been a few months since that happened. i have already passed the stage of being sad and moved on. because people say that laying off in companies are very common and there is nothing i can do about it. 

Today i caught up with my friends in the company. They told me something explosive. they overheard that the reason why i was removed was that i stood up and walked away too much from my desk. i was often not there. the HR got this information when she discussed my performance with my team. 

i have always thought that i was in a great team. people are kind and patient when i asked questions. i also joined in their chat from time to time just to be involved, even though i prefer working than chit-chating (i am the type that focus on results - thats why i put a lot of pressure on myself and worked very hard as well). if it was a problem, why no one told me? 

and why would it even be a problem? standing up every 30mins to stretch, or relax my eyes is completely reasonble to me. 

this is my first job. i took my work seriously and treated everyone sincerely. the end result felt horrible. and i am fxxking crying again writing this. 

what is your work style in the office? is there any problem with my style? 

in the company, i barely saw anyone in the kitchen. very rarely i would see someone else staring outside to relax their eyes like i did. but i noticed that a lot of people are not working. the guy sitting opposite me is on the phone the whole day. he would put it away and looked at the computer screen when people walk past and resumed when people leave. some people told me they only worked 1 day out of 5. i am very confused! we are all in the office. there is no flexibiltiy/work from home option. How did they not get noticed? They also talked a lot/sent each other funny pictures during work. some also have a problem with efficiency. i saw a person just staring at the screen without using his brain to solve the problem. 

I felt stupid. it felt like i was one of those actually working but i was removed. 

Thank you so much for reading my loooong post. i just wanted to share to feel better. any insights about workplace/culture would be very helpful for me or those who just started their career as well.

1jgcq1h,Should I take a job unrelated to my field? Graduating soon and I'm nervous..,"Hi everyone. Looking for advice for my first full time job out of college. I'm graduating with a MS in data analytics this May and I'm pretty nervous about the job market. I'm trying to figure out if it's best to take a job not in my field or to hold tight and apply for jobs directly related to data analytics (or tech broadly).

Some info: The job is HR assistant with an hourly pay range of $25-30 an hour (rough estimate of $52,000-$62,000 per year). Located in CA. The commute is something around 35-45 minutes as well. This position would be overseeing around 400+ employees, managing staff contracts, onboard/off-boarding, processing payroll, and other communications. 

A friend of a friend asked me to apply. I've gone through the interviews and I'm nearly guaranteed the position if I let her know. The job itself seems to be tedious and my prospective supervisor is sort of a 'jack of all trades' type. If I took the job, I'd only want to work there a year before branching off into something more relevant. 

I do have loans to pay after graduation and I'm hoping to save for a new car and moving out. At the same time, I really want a foot in the door with data analytics so I can get past entry-level positions. 

I guess I'm just not sure if it's a good idea to be locked into this job for the sake of money. Quite frankly, I'm not even sure if the pay is good for the amount of work to be done, so I'd appreciate some perspective on that too. 

tl;dr, Graduating with a master's degree in may, unsure if I should take a job in an unrelated field because i'm broke/the job market looks bad. ü•≤ Thanks friends

1jgbvd8,Advice on career path?,"I just began a social work program (BA) with the plan of possibly doing art therapy after. I live in Germany, where art therapy is not particularly respected, and wanted to have a foundation (SW) with many job prospects to fall back on in case I realized art therapy was too difficult/unfitting after doing a masters.

I have always loved visual art, would say I am quite competent at it, and I would love to integrate helping people with this passion.

My problem is, any time I spend not working on art or music (I also sing as a hobby) leaves me feeling this constant urge in the back of my mind that is pushing me back to creating. It‚Äôs like something has been screaming at me for years telling me I‚Äôm wasting my life, even though I‚Äôm trying to build stepping stones to something bigger and that takes time.

And because we live in a world run by money, and I have a job on top of this, most of my time is spent not making art. I also long for a community of people who are like minded and with whom I can share those things. I‚Äôve never really had that in my school spaces. And I can imagine that if I was finally in a space like that where I truly felt in harmony, I could build the sense of community I seek and help the world in other ways, expand my voice and message via those channels and also online, etc etc. Which is why I‚Äôm considering just switching to fine arts and if I decide later on, I can always do an art therapy training on top of that.

But I‚Äôm really worried if I leave social work after taking so long to get there and switch to fine arts, which has even fewer financial prospects, I‚Äôll totally regret it, because I also feel that in a broad sense I‚Äôm good with connecting with a lot of different kinds of people and helping them, and social work offers a lot more variety and job options. and seeing as I‚Äôve already finished a bachelors in Journalism as well, I‚Äôm getting to this point in life where I want to settle on a path a bit‚Ä¶

Anyone who has applicable (serious) advice on art therapy or fine arts (or heck, even social work), I would love to hear from you.

But eventually I reduced that habit which holds me back and eventually came to decide of which job should I have.  
**Plan:**

* a Job which mostly depends on my intellectuality (At this time its improvedüôÉ) and creativity more like a job with art nature (Content writing, Copy writing, Marketing Boardley)
* And for the second option i had a plan of doing sales as a job particularly in B2B Nature, where there will a scope for future and personal development as well I believe.

(*And this is what I don't want, Job which is mundane like depends on physical reliability rather then intellectual)*

  
The irony is even with plan I'm still unemployed rn. I don't know what to do next bcoz i already tired of hittin the wall so many times, Just thought someone will give a hand at this situation coz i was also cornered by financially, loans, comprising necessities now.

I have this fear if life force me to do which I'm not intended to. what if I end up in a place even worse.

1jg8s6i,Why do I keep attracting narcissistic bosses?,"I have had the good the amazing, left the amazing because I was young and didn't know how bad your life would be with a toxoc boss dod not even experience that and I had about 7 years into my career. I let stupid crap set me off and that was my favorite job in hindsight. I took a position for a lower level at the same company and it did not feel right I could tell that I wasn't going to like the person I was going to be working for. I had that intuition and I listened to my gut, withdrew my application. Then they BEGGED me to join made a ton of false promises and treated me like garbage. Life lesson number 2. It was not anything SO intolerable I couldn't deal until I had a new job. Life lesson number 3. I was desperate to get another job and I fell right into the hands of the most evil psychopath/narcissist ever. I could write a novel. But I will get physically ill again and just trust me like I was begging crying to my entire family to please just let me quit. The fact that I got sick over a person threatening my lively hood everyday, making me work late until 3 AM alone, setting me up to fail for 2 years, my mental health went and so did my physical health. 

I got laid off FINALLY I was begging for it. It was the only way to get away from this monster. I was very upset to have to leave a company I did so well at and loved all because of one monster but thankful I got unemployment and a big package. 

I was at peace finally my mental health and my physical health recovered. I was just enjoying life, but I felt ready. I felt like a loser for not having a job. That's how I knew I was ready and once I started applying, I was getting interview interviews like crazy it's kind of wild. I couldn't get a single interview when I was in that horrible situation for two years. 

I took a job and a smaller company for way less than what I was wort in hopes I would be happy. Maybe they sensed some desperation, but I really wasn't desperate. I just wanted to be happy I didn't care about pay for that.  
I did not start to collect unemployment yet and I forgot to notify them because this all happened so fast but I'm supposed to start soon. I haven't even gotten my first paycheck yet. I've been there for a week and I already know it's not going to work out. I made a promise to myself that I absolutely refuse to ever deal with that again because it's just not worth it. It's not worth being miserable for and I can't even help it because I have to commute there now I was willing to do that, even though they offered remote, but then my boss doesn't even want to be in the same days as me like I'm commuting very far and I'm working very late like I'm already being so undervalued because I was not provided the level that I was interviewed for or the salary that I wanted. I wasn't even provided the minimum salary that I wanted. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I really thought I would be happy at this place and everyone is so scared that I'm going to quit. I am quite literally being bombed by HR. They are literally leaving bouquets of flowers on my desk.

I need to do what I need to do for me. I know this is not going to work I know that and I'm very sad about it because I just wanted to be hopeful that this would work out and I got my hopes up. I feel like maybe corporate america isnt for me anymore because only people with mental illness want to hire me. My empathy attracts this and I know people can say just ignore and just ignore it after what I just went through like I can never know it's just not worth it. I I can't do that and my PTSD is just like I can't. I got physically ill not worth it for me ever again. 

Is it me? Is this just not for me anymore? What else can I do with my life? When do I quit if I already know? This really sucks





 why am I gonna go in like that was my like red flag and then there were so many other others but you know I did get interviewed for a higher position and they were only hiring one level and I had the amount of experience I had more experience. This person made me feel like I wasn't good enough for that hired me for less than I wanted, and I accepted in hopes that I would be happy so maybe it's my fault but I can't believe I'm here again and I didn't want this to happen to me because my mental piece is so important.

I don't feel like I'm supported by anyone in my family or my husband because they don't understand what I've been through. I have horrible horrible PTSD and it's not like I'm just looking at these things and having PTSD I thought maybe I was. I was giving things a fair chance I was putting boundaries in place but like it's not changing anything and I'm not I don't really understand what's going on here, but I already feel undervalued underpaid, overworked, confused like I'm not happy. I'm not gonna be happy for less money no way, but what do I do? Do I quit and I mean I haven't even gotten a paycheck yet it was my it's my first week and I already know that this isn't gonna work that's like I don't know. I asked to be a remote and I'll see what happens but if the answer is no, and that is an option I have per company policy then I'm leaving because I can't do that. That's that's not a good use of my time at all and I'm not gonna like lose sleep. I'm literally losing sleep because I get home so late and I can't get work done there's no point to that it's i'm not even getting paid enough to do that. I just don't understand why I attract these people it's like ever since I screwed up. I just have been making you know I I want to see the good in people. I guess I should've demanded what I wanted and if they weren't willing to give me that it wasn't meant to be, but if you don't have a job, it's scary how picky can you be but now I didn't even collect unemployment yet. I didn't even start yet and I didn't get a paycheck yet so if I leave now, my question is, can I still collect unemployment because I could seriously cry this is like my worst nightmare coming to life and I thought this could not happen again like there's no way that this could happen again. 

i'm starting to just think maybe this isn't for me at all maybe corporate is not for me but if that's not for me, I don't know what else to do with my life and I just don't know why I can't have a regular boss. This person seems so regular but in hindsight, it's like you're OK you're nice but it's not very nice to make me feel undervalued underpaid confused there's not clear expectations making me work late coming in when you're not commuting all that way it's not nice behavior so I'm not dealing with it I don't want to and I don't know what to do and I don't feel supported, and I don't know why I keep attacking these people like I guess it's me. It must be me. Is that just what exist these days like why can't I find some a boss? That's actually normal who wants to pay me what I'm worth and treat me well like they should be like literally I'm not even trying to brag, but they should be lucky to have me HR is love bombing me sending me bouquets of flower. They're so scared. I'm gonna quit. I'm not kidding everyone so scared. I'm gonna quit. I'm like the big shiny toy in the object because I came from a very big company with many years of experience a great experience so why are you paying me what I'm worse I don't I made such a bad mistake and I was just hoping and it was allowed to put myself out there and fail and get my hopes up and I don't wanna do it again and this is just not fun at all. Do I lose my unemployment now what do I do? I just feel like this is my fault like it must be my fault. I don't know how to attract the right environment. It's just not something that happens to me and at this point people think it's me it's not me. It's not me. I've had normal bosses what I deal with is not normal. I think it's my fault. I'm not seeing I'm not able to take the blinders off. I don't know. Does anyone have any advice? What do I do? I can't. I cannot mentally go through that again I won't be well like it's been too much too many. This would be the third job in a row where I had toxic. I can't do it. I got too sick. I got literally got sick with my last boss with the PTSD I can't I can't do it. I cannot be miserable, but I can't lose that unemployment that I didn't even get yet and I didn't even get paid. I don't know what the right thing to do is does anyone have any advice if corporate is not for me? What else can I do?

1jg8fsy,I got a verbal confirmation for a job sometime back but still no official confirmation letter. Is this normal or is something up?,"
In late February I got a job offer from a peer & was interested & applied. The job has really good benefits & I'll be earning more than I've ever earned. It's a foreign company so they pay higher than local companies. Plus I'll be able to step into a field that I don't have much experience in that can allow me to get another job in the field. 
Initially he told me that ideally it was for joining in mid March. I had to do an assessment which I was told I passed & afterwards the communication gets unclear, since I don't know what they're hiring process is like. I was told I passed but I wasn't sure if this was a confirmation. & I wasn't given clear information on the next steps. So I was confused since I thought the candidate was supposed to join in mid-March & therefore they would be doing things faster. Additionally, in my experience if a person is confirmed for the job you either receive the next steps if there are more interview rounds, or you get a confirmation letter or something where it's officially confirmed right? However these were jist confirmations over text. 
I continued to wait and then sometime later around the first week of March I followed up because I was told the letter would be sent around that time. Then was told that the director actually wanted the start date to be moved to May instead of March (which is fine by me) and that I would probably have an interview with another director (which wasn't told to me and confused me because I was told verbally that I got the job) who is ""happy to go ahead with me""
Therefore I still brought up the confirmation letter thing, given that this was all said to me & my friend said that it'll be sent by next week. But I still hadn't received anything. I don't even know if I've gotten the job for sure because the lack of official confirmed. Without it I can't even give in my resignation, even though I really really want to quit ASAP. 

So I followed up this week, and then my friend said that since they're looking to onboard mid May that I will be sent the confirmation letter ""late March/early April"" & I said that the only reason I'm asking is so I know I have the job & that I can resign because right now because I can't do so without it being officalised. He said he'll drop HR a message & then said that HR will get in contact with me setting up an appointment with the director (there was no follow-up on this after it was mentioned the first time so I thought it wasn't even happening) Yet no one has contacted me.

I'm frustrated because I'm just waiting for them to officalise this so I can quit and it's bugging me that I can't and I'm not getting a proper reply. I'm too nervous to quit with just a verbal confirmation. & it's just giving red flag energy which I really don't want it to have because I need this job. 

So is this normal and just a case of a a disorganised growing organisation or is something really up?

Sigh.

1jg8b28,Cloud engineering advice.,"Need help identifying if I am underpaid and how I can improve.

Please bear with me as this will be a slightly long post. I don't know if its appropriate to share here but I will. I have been a cloud engineer for about two years now. I began with 80k in 2023, then got a small adjust to 81k at the end of that year. When I started, I lacked a huge understanding of AWS and its services, Terraform, Python, JSON, YAML, etc. I required an insane amount of assistance and help, and the learning curve was quite high. I didn't know how to even start tickets, what our team products were and how that tied into what I was doing. The following year in 2024, I improved a lot. I was able to handle those module updates fairly quickly, I had a baseline understanding of our products, I could handle support tickets a lot more easily, I was still new but I was much more proficient in yaml, terraform, json and python. I understood AWS basic services a lot more like IAM, S3, codebuild, step functions, CI/CD, EC2, VPCs, EBS, Cloudfront, DynamoDB etc. In the fall I got a 10k increase to 91k.   
  
This year I have been recently adjust to 93k as a merit increase. I am much more confident now taking on jira tickets. I am able to look at the ticket and know how to start right away. About 2 months ago I took on and finished an entire sync alarm project which notifies users about modules out of sync across landing zones and regions and sends that using SNS and a cloudevent rule which does that every week and using a codebuild job, it runs the script to ensure that happens effectively. I created documentation for it and I was really proud of it because with so many different changes, I was able to create a product that helps our team. The impact is small but nonetheless supplements my understanding of AWS. Now I have been feeling a little bit uneasy because I believe I am underpaid. I have no certifications which I want to prioritize that right now. Maybe the CCP and hashicorps terraform associate for starters. I would like some guidance preferably as to where you think I stand and am I paid well. I live in NYC and the company is based in Chicago. I would also like to know how I can improve. I had a talk with one of the senior engineers who has now been promoted to architect but I really don't know what more to do. He said I need to start identifying problems ahead of time and provide impact analysis for that. I want to start approaching that senior status so I have been really trying to take on initiative but without burning myself out too much. 

If you have any questions let me know. But yeah overall just need some guidance and advice on how I can make more, where do I stand and what more can I do.",Siddyboyhya,1,1.0,0,1742529866,2025-03-21 04:04:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jg8b28/cloud_engineering_advice/,3,2025

1jg6ur0,Bad full time job or seeking the travel dream?,"Hi everyone, I graduated about 1 year ago (CS, AI minor) with relatively good GPA and grad project. However, the salaries in my country (3rd world MENA country) is so low. Most of my friends are working with about 300-400 usd per month.

I started some freelancing and worked on annotation platforms (like scale AI) and I'd been able to get like at least 5 times this salary. I also have quite good GitHub (+500 stars on total, some good contributions and projects)

I know in long term this is not good and I'm not getting any REAL experience, I got accepted to many full time jobs but I refuse each time due to different reasons. tbh the market in my country is trash at all and most startups do nothing meaningful.

I also thought about getting a masters degree from a decent university , most **good** AI companies require at least a masters. I applied to many unis in US, Canada and UK but the funding options are so limited and I'm not able to pay the tuitions.

Now I'm feeling I'm getting older, with no experience and I'm chasing travel dreams with no real options available. I'm getting the fear that even If I travelled I won't be able to work anywhere beside masters because I have no experience compared to students in 1st world countries.

So I applied for some Full time jobs again in my country, I got accepted easily tbh (the job is trash + low salary + overtime hours etc.) but **should I accept it just to get some experience in my CV?** Or focus more on travel options.

1jg51ar,Advice about conflict with boss/mentor,"Seeking advice about a boss/coworker conflict. I don‚Äôt know if I should quit and find a better job for me or stick it out because this job offers me a lot of opportunities. Alright for starters I am a 20F sophomore media student at a medium sized state university and I have worked as a student photographer in the university‚Äôs digital creative media department since August 2024. My actual boss on paperwork is Kevin (names have been changed), but I mainly work with the university photographer, Katie because my speciality is photography. Kevin mainly works with video production so I rarely work with him. I started this past August and off the bat there was little to no structure. The work schedule was made the week or even sometimes day of and barely any of my photos were reviewed for constructive criticism. I recall there were maybe two times we sat down and looked at my photos, we would just look through them and Katie would gave little to no comments. 

As the year went on, I tagged along and second shot events and eventually started tagging and organizing our photo storage system. I began to shoot athletic events with Katie just to get experience because I‚Äôd never done sports photography and I was given access to upload directly to our photo storage system that is used campuswide. There was never any issue and I was a big help to Katie because she is one person doing the job of three. I was a big help to our volleyball team and they used a lot of my photos rather than Katie‚Äòs during this past season. 

A few months later in November, I was shooting a basketball game alone and a guy that worked for basketball asked if he could use some of my photos and me being a nice people pleaser I said yes and uploaded some photos to the photo storage system for him to use. He used a particular photo of mine and so did the university social media manager, but the next day Katie called me into her office and told me I‚Äôm not allowed to upload anymore to the photo storage system and that basketball photo that was used was a bad photo. There was no constructive criticism or reason why it was a bad photo just that she didn‚Äôt like it. I was confused because obviously some people liked it enough to use it. To be honest, that situation really hindered my motivation for that job and dampened my self-confidence and my photography skills at work. But I still went to work and went above and beyond because that‚Äôs the kind of person I am. I always bend over backwards for people and work overtime. 

Around this time, I started experiencing a lot of health issues and started missing classes and it started affecting work. I would have to call out last minute because I got sick and had no energy to get up and go. Please note I have accommodations through my university for my various disabilities that contribute to me getting sick more often than a normal person. One of the biggest events of the fall semester was graduation commencement, and I was going to help, but I woke up and felt super sick and couldn‚Äôt make it. Every time I had to call out or reschedule or miss something there was always a, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay. I understand. Hope you feel better,‚Äù message. As a chronic people pleaser and ambitious person I naturally felt bad but physically, I am dealing with challenges that hinder me from my full potential. So that brings me here with the newest conflict in my job. 

After our Christmas break in January I had a meeting with Katie and Kevin and they told me that I had become a little bit unreliable which I completely understand. You never know when somebody will get sick and have to call out, but that is something I physically cannot help. I felt super bad and I was proactive about getting them my schedule so everything was clear and there was no hindrance in communication. This spring semester has been less busy than the fall semester so I haven‚Äôt had as much work to do so I haven‚Äôt been in the office as much. But I have gone to the basketball games and shot them just get more experience. Athletics does not use my photos anymore after the incident in November but I go to get experience because I love taking photos. 

This past week we had a postseason basketball game that was a tournament game so it was not university affiliated. We were just hosting. I go like I normally do and use my media pass that is provided through my university job. Please note that Kevin told me I can use this media pass and go to the sports games and get experience that is a perk of this internship. I don‚Äôt set my stuff where Katie normally does because I‚Äôm not working with her or clocked in. I am there independently on my own. I‚Äôve done this for the last few games because I have slowly been fed up with helping her at the games and not getting paid. Sometimes I would offer to carry a heavy camera for her and sometimes she would ask me to carry it, and I would gladly do it because I want to help. 

At this tournament game a few days ago, she comes up to me right after it starts and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to have to leave. The sideline is only for working media and you‚Äôre not working. We don‚Äôt need your photos. I‚Äôve got it covered. We don‚Äôt even use your photos.‚Äù I‚Äôve sat here and replayed how it went, and I‚Äôve tried to see it from a neutral standpoint, but she was talking to me in a tone that she‚Äôs never used with me before, and it was very demeaning and harsh. It hurt my feelings in the moment and it was a little insulting because she did it in front of peers and the public but I am not just there for that university job. I‚Äôm there to get experience and I also work for the band who is there and sometimes help out the basketball team or university student newspaper, so I have plenty of reasons to be there and have a right to be there.  I‚Äôm not in the way of anyone. A few minutes goes by and during a timeout she comes up to me and she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not trying to be rude or hurt your feelings, but there‚Äôs just a lot of media here and if somebody needs a spot you‚Äôre gonna have to get up and move or leave.‚Äù One thing is there were plenty of spots on the sideline. It wasn‚Äôt like we were shoulder to shoulder and squished. There was plenty of room for people and I would‚Äôve gladly moved for people if they‚Äôd asked. I have no problem with that but what I have a problem with is her tone and attitude coming out of nowhere. I say to her, ‚ÄúI understand, but you were rude and the way you delivered it hurt my feelings. And I don‚Äôt just work for a state. I work for other organizations. I have a right to be here,‚Äù I was trying to stand up for myself because I don‚Äôt tolerate people being rude to me for little to no reason. After I reply, she has to go sit down and she doesn‚Äôt bother me for another 40 minutes. At this point, it is halftime, we switched sides and I‚Äôm sitting by my media friends and she comes up to me and is talking in that same harsh tone. She says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to have to have a meeting with Kevin because if you‚Äôre selling your photos or shooting for other people but using your university media pass, that‚Äôs going to be a big problem and I don‚Äôt wanna get in trouble. I don‚Äôt wanna get fired this is my career. I can‚Äôt lose my job.‚Äù I reply, ‚ÄúI understand this is my career too. I don‚Äôt want you or me to get in trouble.‚Äù She cuts me off before I can finish my thought and tell her I‚Äôm not actually shooting for anyone or selling my photos. A matter of fact, I have never done sold any photos I‚Äôve shot for my university job even though I have been offered several times. She replies, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just gonna have to talk to Kevin.‚Äù I reply to Katie. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand. I come to almost all of the basketball games even some you‚Äôre not at and I help you without even being scheduled or paid. I carry your heavy camera or save you a spot on the sideline..‚Äù She replies in that harsh, demeaning tone. ‚ÄúNo one asked you to do that,‚Äù her rebuttal really hurt my feelings because I‚Äôve never been anything but nice and helping to her. A lot of our coworkers complain about her work ethic and some of the photos she takes, but I have always defended her. After her rebuttal, I was too shocked to say anything, but she adds this final note and says ‚Äúand sometimes you can‚Äôt even show up when you are scheduled.‚Äù I acknowledge there is some truth in this statement because I have had to miss and call out of work but that is all because of sicknesses or university sanctioned events. Regardless of her opinion, I am not the type of person to skip an event just because I don‚Äôt want to do it. I personally think that comment was very unprofessional and uncalled for especially for a mentor figure to say that to their pupil or their student employee. Please let me know if that is a rational opinion of the situation and what I should do. Some of my friends and family think I should go to the university HR or title IX office and report it because most of those absences have been due to sickness caused by my disabilities or university sanctioned events. However I don‚Äôt want to make the situation bigger and worse than it is. My university job opens a lot of connections for me and I don‚Äôt want to burn bridges. I plan to talk to my boss Kevin tomorrow about the situation. Thank you for reading. :) ",ricochetedtears,1,1.0,0,1742519377,2025-03-21 01:09:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jg51ar/advice_about_conflict_with_bossmentor/,3,2025

I (25F) recently left my job at a small company sign shop where I was being pushed into sales, project management, and design. The owner‚Äôs son (27M) is starting to take over the business and I have been working with him the entire time since out of college. I really enjoyed the job when it was design focused and I don‚Äôt mind talking to clients but I had no support in the role and got overwhelmed by the volume. The owner‚Äôs son called me back in November asking me if I had feelings for him which I politely declined and ever since that call I felt our relationship changed in the way he was avoiding me more and so that channel of communication felt shaky. I found a new job and jumped and really hate it. The organization and office culture really threw me for a loop and they seemed much bigger than they actually are. I also just feel like I took a step back and so I left not wanting to get too involved on the projects and for them to not waste any more resources. To be fair I have a good amount of money saved up so I‚Äôll be fine. I am in good standing at my old job and reached out to come back without the project management and they‚Äôre going to keep me updated on a timeline. Is it worth going back or should I keep looking?

1jg33cj,Any decent IT-adjacent careers or job paths I could go down?,"I will admit out the gate that I'm still new to IT. I've only ever worked in a help desk role and have been with my current employer for three years. But I don't want to stay here. I'm at the point where I'm tired of taking calls every day and helping users with the most basic stuff. 

But my problem is either burnout, laziness , depression or all three. I know that higher paying positions don't just grow off of trees. I need the skills to move up the ladder into networking, sys admin, SOC, business analysis, what have you. But for some reason, trying to teach myself the skills necessary for these upper echelon positions just doesn't ""excite me"" for lack of a better term. For example, when I do a PowerShell or BA course for a week or so, it feels like a chore to me. It just doesn't interest me. I genuinely wish it did. I really, really do. But I feel like I'm just sitting here forcing myself to learn this stuff, not really **wanting to do it**. I feel the same way for learning Networking concepts. It's a slog. 

I don't mean to come off like a lazy s.o.b. I just am stating how I feel. But I also don't know what else is out there for me for a career. I want something I can transfer my technical and soft skills from help desk to but also don't want to feel like my undergrad was a waste of money.

I love the people, I have benefits, pension, vacation pay, sick pay, extremely flexible and laid back. 

I have an option to take a job with slightly better pay at about $25 (hopefully more, still negotiating) as a junior environmental scientist. Job is one hour away from home and daycare.

1jg2pv4,more college-ish related advice from graduates who know anything about temple and lasalle or just anything,"SORRY THIS IS PRETTY LENGTHY I JUST NEED ADVICE 

I am a current highschool senior recieving college decisions. I am pretty broke so I want to go to a college that completely funds me (or funds me the most). I recieved two opportunities but I do not know what to do. The first, LaSalle University (Philly) offered me a full scholarship. The catch is that I have to attend and pass classes during the summer (5 days/week, 6 weeks, 8am-3pm) and that honestly put me off a lot. I wanted to travel with my family this summer or enjoy that last break before college (which I was looking forward to since middle school. I am considering going into accounting (and maybe minoring in data analytics as I might want to do that in the future). This university has a good program where you can graduate with a bachelors and a masters in business administration in four years (also providing enough credits for the CPA exam I believe). However, this university does not offer double majors for accounting and data analytics which I wanted to do. Another con is that the school is a 30-45 minute commute and I feel that it would burden me a lot (I genuinely hate long distances everyday). They do have co-op opportunities I believe.

On the other hand, I got a full scholarship to Temple. I heard their business school is pretty good (though I haven't looked into the opportunities in depth) and super easy (so less stress!). However, I heard this was a con because you learn nothing and are not prepared to work after college. They do have MIS and data analytics which I can minor is (and maybe double major in? i didn't ask yet). The main reason why I want to go to Temple is because it is in the city. I am a huge city person as I have always attended school in the city. I always looked forward to going to cafes and restaurants or walking around the city after school or when I felt confined. I feel depressed with the thought of going to a school with a long commute and far from the city it feels so unpractical and I feel like it would be so sad (maybe because I am so used to the city).

1jg244d,Was I expecting too much or is it just time to move on? Advice needed,"Hey reddit,
I‚Äôm at a crossroads and need perspective. Was I expecting too much, or is it just time to move on?

I‚Äôm a digital marketer with 10 years of experience, at my current company for 3.5 years.

Last year, after a key team member left, I pitched leadership a proposal: Instead of just replacing the role, let‚Äôs think bigger. We need a strategist to tie digital marketing together and drive growth. I can be that person.

I have great results to back me and my strategies up, so leadership agreed.

Then, even more people left. Instead of hiring replacements, they kept shifting workloads onto me. I was doing strategy (barely lol because if I focused on strategy, execution stalled), execution, firefighting, and taking on responsibilities that weren‚Äôt mine. When I pointed out this was unrealistic, I was dismissed with ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not increasing headcount.‚Äù

I was passed over for a marketing director promotion with the reasoning: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a client-facing role, and we know you don‚Äôt like talking to clients.‚Äù (I‚Äôm fine with talking to them.)

Eventually, they gave me a manager title. With no training, no support, and no actual authority. Just more work and no expectations outlined.

To their credit, they increased my pay significantly, but not enough to cover for the fact that I was doing three jobs.

Three months after I became a manager, they ‚Äúflattened the structure.‚Äù They kept my title as a manager and kept my pay but removed team management responsibilities. I assumed I was still overseeing work overall, but then they hired two more people, gave them my exact title, and had them oversee their own areas.

Meanwhile, leadership kept telling me:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too good at digital marketing, we don‚Äôt want to lose you to management.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a unicorn, it‚Äôs hard to find people like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt afford to lose you.‚Äù

At this point, I‚Äôm angry, exhausted, and honestly just sad. The entire story took maybe 10 months. I can't figure out if I screwed up and that's why I got sidelined or if I was just not given proper tools.

1jg1iff,27 with no job,"I don't want to complain or cry about my current situation but it's gotten to the point that I'm not sure what to do. I'm 27 feeling like I'm pushing 30 and have absolutely nothing to show for it career wise.

I've always said I'm a quitter and felt proud with that because it meant that I just didn't settle for anything but now l'm starting to wonder if I should have.

I tried to do a political major after highschool and after a couple years, I quit to pursue design. In hindsight, I loved the idea of trying so many different things and ""quitting"" because I ended up being a jack of all trades but unfortunately a master at none.

I finished my design degree and worked in the construction industry for 2 years after that but realized it was not for me and I could not stand working another very long day for people who seemed as though they didn't respect me. I left and tried finding other jobs but sheesh was it tough - no one was hiring. So I went back to school for a year to try and figure it out. After all that it has now been another year of me just doing absolutely nothing.

I've applied to countless of jobs anywhere from service industry to my own career path so far.
Nothing. I've reached out to network and connect with others (friends, ex coworkers, etc.) but it seems as though that goes nowhere as well. I've tried to create my own business ventures, but unfortunately that costs more to succeed than I have. I've now been out of any working industry for 2 years and I have absolutely no idea what to do.

1jg17ad,Advice for breaking into aerospace welding and fabrication industry,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for career advice on breaking into the aerospace industry as a welder/fabricator. I recently finished my AWS Stick Welding certification and am currently working on my D17.1 aerospace TIG certifications. My experience includes structural welding (ER70S-6, 232 flux core), heavy machinery repair, and CNC press brake operation, but I want to transition into aerospace fabrication and welding.

I recently had a phone interview with an aerospace company, and while I‚Äôm hopeful, I want to strengthen my resume to be a more competitive candidate. Are there any certifications, skills, or quick qualifications that would make me stand out more?

Some things I‚Äôm considering:
	‚Ä¢	Lean Six Sigma Yellow Belt (would this help in a welding/fabrication role?)
	‚Ä¢	Additional TIG certs for aluminum & stainless
	‚Ä¢	Blueprint reading or GD&T courses

If anyone has experience in aerospace welding/fabrication or hiring in this field, I‚Äôd love to hear your insights on the best path forward.",Imaginary_Garage_936,1,1.0,0,1742508702,2025-03-20 22:11:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jg17ad/advice_for_breaking_into_aerospace_welding_and/,3,2025
1jg0xd0,How to cope with feeling stuck at a job that doesn't even pay well and hostile work environment,"I've been applying for jobs for at least 6 months with barely anyone reaching out for an interview. And the interviews I do get, it ends up them hiring someone else because I am trying to switch fields so I obviously dont have any experience. But I try to highlight skills from my career that could easily translate or be desired to what I'm going for. I feel like giving up and every day is entirely too exhausting dealing with with what I have to at my current spot, not enough pay/benefits to even make it somewhat worthwhile or even somewhat tolerable while simultaneously applying for jobs every day. I have to work 2 jobs to support myself  and i'd rather not go full time at my other job because it takes up too much gas that isnt reimbursed and honestly some times the boss prices things way too low for how long it takes to get the job done(not super frequently, and there are really slow periods so the work doesnt feel as ""steady""). The only reason why I don't outright quit is because bills obviously - and if it's taking me this long to find work with no luck it's not magically going to change if i quit. 
I've worked in my current field for over 10 years and I find it to be taxing on my mental health no matter where I go. So I'm really not that eager to continue in this field any longer plus the pay rate for it in this economy is a joke (even with a degree and years of experience) and am looking into entry level health care related jobs that pay significantly better than whats being offered in my field. Even if I wanted to continue in my field - it seems like the only options with decent pay/benefits are 2 major cities I'd have to commute to (an hour -  hour and a half each way - with mostly unavoidable tolls) or relocate closer which I financially can't do at this moment. I feel like I had more employers interested in hiring me as a teenager with little/no work experience compared to 2025. I just want this chapter to end and to move on with my life already. Every day I feel like I'm wasting my time and my life doing something I've been over surrounded by people that suck. Literally every day feels exactly the same.
How do you cope in this situation/deal with coworkers that are also kinda cliquey and not the nicest towards you?
Any advice on how to help my job seeking process be a little more successful especially in switching fields?",lilbugzzz,1,1.0,0,1742508019,2025-03-20 22:00:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jg0xd0/how_to_cope_with_feeling_stuck_at_a_job_that/,3,2025
1jg0uqc,Would you leave a Secure Job for 50% More Pay?,"I‚Äôve (33F) been working in the public sector (municipal government in Canada) on a contract for almost 6 months. My contract ends in three months, and my manager is considering offering me a full-time position.

Before this, I spent 9 years in tech as a Supply Chain Specialist, making solid six figures. But working at a startup meant zero structure‚ÄîI was constantly overwhelmed, doing the work of five people. The company eventually ran out of funding, and layoffs hit hard, including the CEO. So, I left and moved to the public sector, but it came with a 40% pay cut.

Now, after 6 months, I‚Äôve realized how much red tape and politics come with government jobs. The pay cut has been brutal, and I even had to pick up a second job just to keep up. Right now, I get 13% pay in lieu, but if I go full-time, my salary will drop further after losing that and paying union and pension deductions.

Recently, a company where my former coworkers landed reached out. I interviewed and got an offer for a senior role with a 50% pay increase. The downside? It‚Äôs another tech startup, and after my last experience, I‚Äôm hesitant.

I‚Äôm planning to start a family in a few years, so I need financial stability. But given how unstable the job market is, wouldn‚Äôt it be smarter to work in private, stack cash, and invest rather than relying on a pension?

Would you stay in the public sector for security or jump back into private for better pay and financial growth?",wjddls3636,33,0.9200000166893005,50,1742507831,2025-03-20 21:57:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jg0uqc/would_you_leave_a_secure_job_for_50_more_pay/,3,2025
1jg0mnn,Choosing a path,"I'm 30 and have struggled to choose a path for myself for many years. While I am passionate about education, I'm equally passionate about books. My current major is in education for high school with an emphasis on literature. I've considered teaching high school and continuing to pursue my degree and maybe teaching a mythology/folklore course at a local college or university. If, like most people, you wonder about if it's a thing;I promise it is. That course is used for degrees in archaeology and anthropology and sometimes political science due to cultural links. All of this being said; I'm an avid reader and find myself annotating my books and finding typos, grammar mistakes, and questionable scenarios that should've been researched prior to publishing. So I'm questioning of if I would enjoy being an editor in the publishing industry, which I don't even know how to get to that point. Or just continue to try to pursue a career in teaching.

1jfzeqn,Corporate gaslighting or am I crazy. Raise negotiation,"
Sorry this is long. 
just went through a frustrating salary negotiation, and I‚Äôm struggling to figure out if my ask was actually unreasonable or if my company is just trying to lowball me. I‚Äôd love some outside perspective.
Also fyi my meeting I was invited to was titled social media acceptance, and it ended up being a rejection, HAHA. ü§° anyway I‚Äôve been in tears. 

Background

I was originally hired in a consultant/sales role, but in addition to my main job, I also took on social media management and content creation‚Äîentirely pro bono‚Äî at first to prove what I could build. I did everything from ideation to execution, including:
	‚Ä¢	Developing content strategies and planning videos.
	‚Ä¢	Filming and editing everything myself.
	‚Ä¢	Running the social accounts and engaging with audiences.
	‚Ä¢	Producing a mix of short-form (TikToks, Reels) and longer 3-5 min informational videos. In a niche medical setting. 

The Results I Delivered
	‚Ä¢	95 reels in 5 months, compared to 36 reels in 14 months from the person before me (300% increase in productivity). ( really two people before me, they fired someone who did nothing for one year before I offered to do some of it) 
	‚Ä¢	30% increase in overall reach, with 91% of that audience being non-followers (meaning major growth in visibility).
I also assisted in rewriting website content, helping plan the flow for website ui changes with the website company we use. And assisting in the launch of an online store involving meetings and trainings on the shop manager none of which my other sales colleges did. This is all my extra Role. 
I didn‚Äôt just edit videos‚ÄîI gave them my creative vision and expertise, (niche expertise in the field I have worked in for 5+ years. )

The Workload
Jan-April probono. April measly 5k raise. I voiced my concern with this but I continued to power through to show them
More growth statistics. 
Got approved a raise in September, then was in corporate limbo. They don‚Äôt allow salaries to anyone who isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù at this company, but they also don‚Äôt want to give me a pay bump AND overtime. So I‚Äôm kinda stuck because even if they thought $20/ increase per hour was fair, they don‚Äôt want to pay me the overtime on that increase  which is fine. I don‚Äôt want that lmao. I just want 20 more an  an hour to do both roles. My min ask is 10 more per hour. 
From October to now, I‚Äôve been working 6-10 hours of overtime per week to balance both roles. It‚Äôs not something I can just ‚Äúturn off‚Äù‚Äîsocial media is a background process running in my mind all the time.
I
Negotiation Recap

I finally had a meeting with corporate to discuss fair pay, and here‚Äôs how it went:
	‚Ä¢	They asked what I wanted, and I said $20 more /hour to reflect both roles.
	‚Ä¢	They immediately said that was ‚Äúabove market‚Äù, but they never actually defined what ‚Äúmarket‚Äù they were comparing me to. I feel like yes the overall pay combined would be above market but there‚Äôs no such thing as a consultant full time with half time social media this role is unique and can‚Äôt be compared to anything else. 
	‚Ä¢	They kept framing my pay around overtime instead of a raise, asking if I‚Äôd still do OT.
	‚Ä¢	I said no, I don‚Äôt want OT‚ÄîI want a pay bump to reflect the work I do.
	‚Ä¢	They then said not reporting OT is illegal, which I agreed with, but they also said they want OT to ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù if they give me $4 more /hour.
	‚Ä¢	This didn‚Äôt make sense to me‚Äîif my workload required overtime at my current rate, why would it suddenly not require OT at $4 more /hour?, and why was that their logic for not offering me $20 more? Both are illegal if I‚Äôm not reporting overtime. Why they can‚Äôt make me salaried or give me a separate contract salary on the side I don‚Äôt understand. Again, they don‚Äôt allow any one with a non managerial role to be salaried at this company. 
	‚Ä¢	They dismissed my contributions, saying I wasn‚Äôt doing ‚Äúcreative director-level‚Äù work‚Äîeven though I‚Äôve been single-handedly running social media strategy, production, and engagement.

What They Offered
	‚Ä¢	The most they would go up to is $4/hour, which is about a $10K base salary increase. That doesn‚Äôt justify content creation which is a full time part time job, it would always be on my mind, like a background process running. I kind of dip in and out throughout the day on both roles, yet they want to partition it into minutes and seconds and overtime. 
	‚Ä¢	When I said that I thought a $30K increase wasn‚Äôt unreasonable given the scope of work, and that it‚Äôs a fraction of a full
Time person and I clearly can deliver full time results at part time hours, they called it ‚Äúegregious‚Äù and ‚Äúout of touch.‚Äù My minimum overall ask would be at least 20k increase. Thats Half to a third of what someone being paid the bare minimum for this kind of work would be paid. 

I feel like they used negotiation tactics to make me feel bad for advocating for myself. A $10K base pay increase sounds nice, but considering I was already earning extra through OT, it barely makes a financial difference. It also doesn‚Äôt reflect the actual value and results I‚Äôve brought to the company. I can‚Äôt justify spending an entire evening a few times a week editing videos at home for what ends up being $150-200 per week. It also isn‚Äôt really contributing to the company‚Äôs socials anymore since I‚Äôm not being paid for anything during the day extra that I do- only overtime, I can no longer check socials and network on socials and reply to comments and dms during the day. I can‚Äôt feel excited enough to brainstorm fun ideas for the team. I just edit videos I‚Äôm asked to make, I don‚Äôt create anything myself. If they have an idea and tell me to make it I make it and that‚Äôs that. I used to come up with fun stuff, props, costumes, learn new editing skills for them, now for overtime only and that‚Äôs it. My corporate manager even emailed me a year ago about professional video editors charging 150 an hour. Asking forwhat I was asking for is NOT egregious. 

I was being paid $42 an hour to run a tiktok meme account for an educational company company part time two years ago. And this was reposted memes and some created memes. I‚Äôm not an idiot. 

But their gaslighting has me thinking ‚Äîdid I actually ask for too much? Or are they just trying to underpay me while benefiting from my work?

TL;DR:
	‚Ä¢	Hired as a consultant/sales rep, but took on social media management for free to prove myself. Part of the reason I did this is yes I enjoy it, but also the MARKETING person before me was FIRED FOR NOT DOING ANYTHING AND RAKING IN 85k for a year. 
	‚Ä¢	From October to now, I‚Äôve worked 6-10 hours of overtime per week balancing both roles.
	‚Ä¢	My work led to a 300% increase in content production from the person prior to the person prior to me.  (95 reels in 5 months vs. 36 in 14 months from the prior employee. Despite my full time position on top of this work). 
	‚Ä¢	Reach increased 30%, with 91% of it coming from non-followers.
	‚Ä¢	I asked for $20k increase  base (for part time social media); they called it ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù and only offered $4/ hour increase. 
	‚Ä¢	They expect overtime to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù at $4/hour increase, contradicting their argument that OT is necessary now. Which was their reason they couldn‚Äôt give me $20/hr increase. 
	‚Ä¢	Now I feel like they gaslit me into thinking my ask was unreasonable, and I don‚Äôt know if I should fight for more or start looking elsewhere. They also said my conversions and sales were low lately. My direct
Manager in person on the phone call with me looked at me funny, they‚Äôve been telling me how proud they are of me of my growth lately. So that is contradictory. 

Would love advice from people who‚Äôve been in similar situations. Did I ask for too much, or is my company just lowballing me? Also I bring in million+ in sales of high ticket luxury items and I feel like I‚Äôm not asking for much. They also don‚Äôt spend much on their marketing at all outside of this. I can barely scrape by living where I do, I really feel for everyone feeling inflation rn because these raises aren‚Äôt cutting it. We also are capped at 3% raises per year for ‚Äúmerit‚Äù. 
I feel like I‚Äôm trapped in the IRL lumon lol. ",Taro_smoothie,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1742504173,2025-03-20 20:56:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfzeqn/corporate_gaslighting_or_am_i_crazy_raise/,3,2025

Hello there, please anybody help me out  , I'm struggling very much in my academics. If you have time please please read this post.

I'm a final year B.Tech. Computer Science student at college ( not so good )in india. As from first semester till now the subject came we studied a bit get passed and over. But till now I haven't got any expertise in any such skill which can lead me to some fancy salary packages.

From my childhood it was my dream to do a job in country like USA , Europe. But as i see my condition, i don't think any company will place me into their organisation.

I'm eager to learn new technologies, but i am not able to find good resources which explains topics in depth. Everytime I visit on platforms like YouTube, most of the videos i see for a particular topic are just introduction which i already know by myself and if something i don't know ,i end up finding confusing topic. This frustrates me a lot and i feel very low and stresses after it.

I am interested in AI/ML field but to explore other fiels of IT as well. This is my last year of college and if in this year i managed to get some skills which makes me eligible for even applying for H1 B visa sponsored it will be great for my career.

If you people can help me out in finding some of the best courses (most preferably video lectures) even the paid ones, it will be a very kind of you. I want some of the certification courses , interview preparation courses, skill enhancement courses and anything which you think will help me out.term resources which could ultimately give me path or atleast guide me to there.

Once again thank you for reading till here, if you think you can help me a little bit also then please its an humble request. üôè

Working at a different organization possibly, with old job organization I left
Hello. I I had a job I left due to an interpersonal work conflict that was poorly handled. I was being discriminated against and communication at the job was not good. Toxic. When I left, it was hard on the supervisor and I visibly saw her crying. I was being reprimanded unfairly for gossiping and disrespect and BS such as 'you're kinda mean' and 'you give too many compliments'. And 'unprofessionalism'. And even 'too talkative' None of which were really valid and I was being unfairly treated. Even supervisor said it may seem 'unfair' I was being warned about something that made zero sense.

Before leaving, I made a point of telling HR exactly how I felt and called out supervisor too. This did not end well because supervisors tone completely changed. Once they spoke to HR, where I was ok with her sharing to supervisor what I said about, I was asked not to come to work the next day and to instead join a zoom meeting with another higher up and supervisor. I had already accepted a different job so I just said that, and I never returned.

I just interviewed for a promising job, for the city. However, I learned the position would be working sort of close with a low income housing building I worked at before (old job). But in a different capacity.

I may or may not take this job if offered, but I am stressed about working close to a work environment that was toxic. New company is great and seem totally different. I'm just worried about how immature and disrespectfully I may be treated and if I will be 'welcomed' into that role by old company. Mainly by the supervisor and a particular employee there who verbally attacked me while I was at work for made up gossip reasons like 'I said not so nice things about other people' and that I was 'telling her how to do her job' in reality, I was instructed to share pertinent client information relevant to her role in our team directly by superviser (one who cried when she found out I was quitting) and insulted me in front of other coworkers while insinuating I was being disrespectful to her because she was a 'therapist' and had just completed a full assessment of said individual and did not need my supposed unnecessary statement. It was utterly bizarre.

I was super excited about this new role, found it would be refreshing and they seem to be much more open to open dialogue and discussion compared to old company. This is a job working for the city like I mentioned, and in a different capacity. Before was case management this one is more property management.

I would potentially be working with that same building but with this new organization. I left that old job about 6 months ago. I left right when I was being treated unfairly in response to unacceptable work conflicts. Old supervisor was program manager there. I got along well with the actual case managers there. I actually trained most of them! lol.

New company just knows I left and felt communication could be better at old company. They asked my opinion on said company.

Thoughts? Should I just abandon this potential role due to this or try for it? I'm concerned that one therapist and old supervisor will cause trouble. That old company, there was a group of a few women who were older (probably jealous) who spread lies about me. Supervisor at the time said she had to give me a warning cause of the people talking about Me.",Pale-Kitchen752,1,0.6700000166893005,10,1742496407,2025-03-20 18:46:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfw9ev/interviewed_for_a_role_that_would_work_close_with/,3,2025
1jfw0c3,I'm having serious doubts about my career choice,"TLDR: I like marketing a lot but am thinking of switching to law because I want to go into a field with the highest pay possible. Smart choice or dumb choice?  
  
For context I'm a 21 year old university student pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree.

I have always enjoyed marketing as a field. While it is not directly linked to my degree, I have completed many case competitions and internships over the years (to learn and gain skills). Unfortunately I am facing serious doubts about choosing marketing as a career.  
  
Some of my close friends have passed the LSAT this year and accepted offers to (top) law schools across the country. Many a conversation I've had with them lately has been about how great they think law is as a field, how they think I'd be an excellent fit, and how it's easy enough to pass the LSAT with some dedicated revisions. And especially, how good the money is, way better than marketing could ever pay me (or so they say). I'm wondering if anyone on here could advise me a little because I'm seriously second-guessing my choices. It could be FOMO. Is there a legal field related to marketing maybe? Can law be enjoyable even if you don't find studying it interesting?   
  
If law school is a smarter option I can always pivot. Despite my total lack of interest towards law as a field, I'm willing to suck it up if it does provide a more stable, and more importantly, significantly higher income over the next 10-20 years.

Accruing debt kinda sucks but not a dealbreaker if it gets me what I want. Same thing with 3 extra years of studies. ",Ethan-Lore,1,1.0,1,1742495764,2025-03-20 18:36:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfw0c3/im_having_serious_doubts_about_my_career_choice/,3,2025
1jfvsus,I Don't Know What to Do. Please Help,"Warning: Unfortunately, this is a long post, but I believe I need to provide details so you can understand the predicament I‚Äôm in (or at least how I see it).

To start, I live with a grandmother and an aunt who hate me. I‚Äôm unhappy at home.

I'm almost 28 years old. I studied mechanical engineering for two years at an associate degree level and then four years for a bachelor's degree. After graduating, since I‚Äôve always been interested in games and the job search process was taking too long, I wanted to try game development. So, I enrolled in a course. After about four months, with the game industry booming during the pandemic, I landed a job. However, after six months, my employer decided not to renew my contract, and the company shut down, leaving me unemployed.

After that, I started looking for software-related jobs, but due to family pressure, after 3-4 months, I was forced to take a job as a mechanical engineer. I‚Äôll list my workplaces as 1, 2, 3, etc.

**2nd workplace:** It was 1.5 hours away, and I made amazing friends, but the company had payment issues, and I couldn't improve myself there. After complaining about the poor office conditions, I was told to leave if I didn‚Äôt like it, so I quit. (6 months)

**3rd workplace:** Everything started off great. However, my managers, who were younger than me, were incompetent and constantly assigned meaningless tasks just to impress the bosses. I fell into a deep depression. Additionally, the promises made when I was hired were not kept, and I found myself sitting in the office all day doing nothing. That wasn‚Äôt for me, so I left. (6 months)

**4th workplace:** It was like a dream job with great colleagues. I was solving problems using my past software knowledge, managing inventory, and organizing work. I quickly adapted and was highly appreciated by my managers and the boss. However, the boss had severe anger issues and would constantly yell at employees, creating a toxic environment. I feared that one day, I‚Äôd be his next target. One day, I used data from two different people's inventory spreadsheets in Excel. When my boss claimed it was incorrect, I explained that it couldn‚Äôt be wrong since both sources showed the same numbers. The next day, I was excluded from a meeting, ignored childishly, and subjected to mobbing. After three days, I resigned. (4 months)

**5th workplace:** A natural gas company in a different city that was required to have a mechanical engineer (due to certification regulations). For the first month, I worked from 9 AM to midnight, including weekends, to catch up on pending projects and learn a new program. My salary was delayed by 2-3 weeks. However, since I had already changed jobs too many times, I tried to endure it. After three months, the previous engineer who had left the company returned, and a week before he started, I was fired.

I feel terrible. At every job I‚Äôve had, I used Python, Excel VBA, etc., to automate inventory tracking, CRM systems, and data analysis. I enjoy working with data and linking tables together. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve always wanted to learn new things, and software seems like the perfect field for that. While learning Unity, I also learned .NET and SQL. During my current unemployment, I‚Äôve been working on projects again, completing courses every day, and improving my portfolio.

I‚Äôve applied to over 100 positions, including internships and unpaid internships, but I don‚Äôt even get responses. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my age or my frequent job changes. My family is pressuring me to continue as a mechanical engineer, but I feel like, given my personality, I should be a software developer. I‚Äôve been passionate about computers since childhood, and working with them truly makes me happy. However, not being able to find a job, the shrinking job market in software, the rise of AI, and the industry's preference for hiring only computer science graduates for junior positions are all discouraging me. On top of that, I‚Äôm running out of savings, which is stressing me out even more.

Should I return to a mechanical engineering job that I don‚Äôt enjoy?  
Or should I keep improving myself for a career in software, which I believe would make me happy?  
Should I insist on pursuing a career in software, even if it means ending up homeless, jobless, and eventually becoming so inexperienced that I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to work as a mechanical engineer?

1jfswnq,Hospital Job Offer - Negotiable?,I am currently a Radiology fellow in Texas and being offered a position by the chair with a base of 400-450k. I know in private I could probably get more but I do like the hospital I'm at and don't mind being here for the next 2-4 years. Are the hospital offers negotiable usually or is that set in stone because of budgets? Is it worth taking the offer/contract to a 3rd party contract reviewer? How much room do I have to be able to get a better base or ask more for time off? ,Beginning_Funny9024,1,1.0,0,1742488054,2025-03-20 16:27:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfswnq/hospital_job_offer_negotiable/,3,2025
1jfsv9y,Is this a bad sign?,"I was laid off due to a salesforce reduction at the beginning of January. I‚Äôve had a few interviews since but nothing that really felt right.

Applied for a role I was extremely interested in and was contacted by the recruiter to schedule an interview last Tuesday. Things moved quickly last week and all felt very positive. I spoke with the recruiter first on Wednesday last week and then the hiring manager right after. The hiring manager was easy to talk to, the conversation flowed well and he told me at the end that he liked me, my style and had no doubts I could do the job. He concluded by saying I had his cell (he ended up texting me because we had issues logging into teams) and could reach out if I had any additional questions. Within a few hours, I was contacted again by the recruiter to schedule my next 2 interviews, which were this past Friday, with another regional manager and sales trainer. I felt both went great as well.

Now, I‚Äôm struggling with the fact that it‚Äôs Thursday, almost a week after my last interviews, and I‚Äôve heard nothing. How do you go from moving so quickly to nothing?

1jfs601,Career advice for starting out,"Hello, I am a recent highschool graduate and I am going to a bachelor in accounting online and will probably get a CPA. I aim to work in a feild like finance working as an accountant.

I also currently work full time in a pretty respectable trades job. I've been working this job for just under a year now, and it's definitely not want I want to do forever, but it does have some good experiences that I think will carry over into future jobs,  makes decent money, and it's pretty low impact, allowing me to focus on school.

I also have a internship lined up for May 2026 at a financial company. 

My question is how much longer should I stay at this job. I've seen some opportunities come up in finance that I think I could get, it's more along the lines of what I want to do so I'd get better experiences and probably enjoy it more. I am worried that if I quit this job, and go get another one, that I may ultimately end up quitting in another year for my internship, I'll start looking like a ""job-hopper"".

1jfrryr,Advice on hopping?,"So, i used to bartend but in 2020 bc of covid, i got involved in construction. I started out as a laborer and got promoted to foreman, supervisor, coordinator. Ive gained over 20k in salary in a 4 year period. But thats mostly because of hopping. Ive mostly hopped because people ive worked work have been kind of jerks. It sounds like a me problem but reasons i have left are for these type of people : people who drink and drive on the job (who i reported and was told they cant do anything because they are the bosses family), meth users who stole from company who were also awful to me telling me my fsther died because he couldnt deal with a gay son (not even gay), and currently someone who deals *serious* drugs at work who was also kind to of an asshole to me. Probably because i replaced him. And i dont snitch so please don‚Äôt recommend that (i did about the drinking and driving but that was different. It endangers peoples lifes). Anyways, i leave these companies because these people are just awful humans to work with or be around and i prefer my peace. So ya, ive left spots. I have hopped. And its worked out because now im interviewing for jobs 30k above my start in 2020. Well, i had an interview last week i got the job. So ill be leaving another job after a year. On my resume every job ive left early, the next one pays a lot more and it has a better job title. Writing it out feels really good, to me, but on paper it looks like im a job hopper which sometimes doesnt look good. Its not fair that i have to look bad for these type of places but cant really tell potential interviews that bc it just looks bad.  Companies arent loyal to you so theres no reason to be loyal to them imo. This new place is very serious about background checks on employees. 
I haven‚Äôt really asked any advice yet but im just looking for others opinions on this. Should i feel as awful as i do about being a hopper even though ive almost doubled my salary and ive left places for moral reasons, to me? Sorry about the rant but Someone throw a bone or something.

1jfrf9z,Career dilemna,"So I just turned 18, (I graduated HS at 16 through penn foster). I am a current CNA and in a LPN program in wisconsin. (I graduate in december.) Afterwards I will need to decide what my career should be. I currently work long term care as a CNA and the toll on my back is annoying. The reason why I am getting my LPN is because I want experience before jumping into a potential RN role, and to have a stable job while I figure out my life. (I see what the LPNS at my job do and I want to do that while I figure this career stuff out) 

I want to be in the critical care setting such as the ICU or ER, I have bad ADHD and work well in fast paced enviorments. I used to play hospital games on ROBLOX which required a good amount of medical knowledge since 9 years old. I also want to travel the world and have a good income (I dont want kids or marriage, I want to take lots of roadtrips and see hopefully most of the countries on this earth). I took my first one to florida in february in between semesters, and plan to take a major one after I graduate my LPN. 



Heres the thing, I love what I am studying and the pathophysiology of things. I do love medicine. I can‚Äôt decide between being a CRNA or MD. (I could theoretically be a CRNA by 27-28 and a attending by 29-30). I don‚Äôt know if I want to throwout my 20s to medical school as being a ICU RN would have a good work life balance. I also want to travel once I finish my schooling and I see talk about CRNA locums all the time and nothing about travel MDs. If I did become a MD, I would want to do anesthesia or something in the critical care setting. CRNAs also pay really well (200k+) and I feel that income would be more than enough if it was just me (although in this economy situation thats debateable I surely wouldnt be rich) but maybe a nice car a small house and a RV to cross country travel with. (I like to go everywhere not settle down) 



Basically my two routes would be:
Bridge to get my RN through a LPN-BSN bridge program which takes two ish years at my school then go to the ICU, do some traveling here and there and get to CRNA school. 


Graduate my LPN then take med school prerequisites and onwards from there.



I simply dont know if I could get into medical school or handle it and whether my brain is capable of if. Plus if I don‚Äôt match into anesthesia or something in critical care I wouldn‚Äôt be happy doing primary care or anything of the sort. 

I prefer a work life balance and I‚Äôve heard you don‚Äôt get that as a MD. I want to travel and hike some mountains, go to concerts and festivals and enjoy my life.


My LPN program is for sure hard (6 HESIS in 8 weeks as in 3 for each class) and I study pretty much everyday. I enjoy what I learn and the labs are fun I find. The human body intrigues me as I have several chronic conditions of my own one being nailpetulla syndrome. But I will say its stressful and my blood sugars reflect that right now (t1d)

I don‚Äôt want to work 60 hour weeks as an attending, I could push through it during residency but once I am in my career I want to travel to hospitals , work critical care and maybe even a flight MD or RN and see what the world has to offer.


My underlying value is I get one life and its a short one. I don‚Äôt want to miss out either. Then I feel I could sacrafice my 20s and enjoy my life in my 30s and onward doing what I‚Äôd enjoy. Hell I‚Äôd still go to concerts and metal fests moshing as a MD in my 30s.

1jfqtch,Just not sure where to start,"So, I got laid off from the convenience store I was working at on 12/31. They sold the store and let everyone go. Now, three months into 2025, I'm still jobless, and that's at least partially my own fault. I didn't do much of anything in February, because I broke my hand (long story), but it's mostly healed now. I can finally type and write again! So now, I'm trying to figure out my next steps.

My work history is all customer service of one kind or another - gas stations, food service, call centers (though, one of those was actually collections). I'm about a semester short of my bachelor's in IT system design, but when my funding ran out and I didn't have $12k, my school dropped me. I have a little over $60k in debt, but no degree. 

I read stories about people managing to break into the IT field without a degree or experience, but they all sound like fairy tales. When I ask, ""How?"" the answer usually includes two things: build a portfolio and do some networking (i.e. via LinkedIn or attending local events, etc.) Well, that sounds great, but where do I even start? 

Here's some of the advice I've seen and the problems I've had, maybe someone here can help:

**Follower industry leaders on social media (usually LinkedIn)**

I honestly don't know who to follow that would be useful here, or how it's really going to help. I tend to avoid social media as much as possible most of the time, so I really don't understand what following someone even does for me, especially when it's someone who already has thousands or millions of followers.

**Attend local events or webinars**

I live about an hour north of Austin, TX. That's the closest place I ever see any kind of events happening, but getting there is not always an easy task. There are no ""local"" events, and as for webinars, I don't even know where to begin looking for one to attend or what to do if I did.

**Build a portfolio**

This one is just a personal shortcoming, I guess. I know how to code. I'm good at solving problems, and given a set of parameters, I can usually design a system that would work. The problem I have is actually completing a project on my own to the point that it would be worth showing a potential employer. For example, I have a project I'm working on now that I haven't given up on yet, but I feel like I'm hitting a wall with it. That's what usually happens.

Anyway, before I just end up whining, does anyone have any advice for me? I appreciate any help.",Naive_Touch_6870,1,1.0,0,1742482646,2025-03-20 14:57:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfqtch/just_not_sure_where_to_start/,3,2025

Yesterday they called me to offer the job and offered me $65k plus potential to earn up to a 7% yearly bonus. I was in the middle of a stressful day in my current job when I answered the call so was a little frazzled and not in the headspace to negotiate right that instant. I mostly just listened as they went though the offer and then asked for a few days to look over everything. 

I would like to politely ask if they‚Äôd be willing to bump to $70k (keeping in mind they may counteroffer a bit lower like 67k-68k), though I would be comfortable with the current offer. On one hand Ive heard to always ask just in case, on the other hand I‚Äôve heard that could make them rescind it and that a range given of $5-10k means there‚Äôs no negotiating especially since they gave the max.

Here's the issue, during my pre-screening interview, I told HR that I was looking for 100k. They told me that the highest they could offer was 95k. I told them that I am making way more than that in my current role (100k) but might consider 96k depending on how the interview goes.

Anyway, after getting the interview and connecting with people with similar roles, I found out the actual range is 85K to 124K with the company most likely willing to offer 100K.

I was thinking of saying this during negotiations: **""After the interview, I gained a deeper understanding of the role‚Äôs complexity, especially as it involves establishing a relatively new team, which I know from experience requires significant effort and expertise.**

1jflruw,30M wasted my career opportunity as a lawyer. Now I‚Äôm stuck and don‚Äôt know what to do.,"I graduated with a law degree, and then went on to do a vocational training course that I passed but never finished. Because I'm useless. I spent the next 5 years dealing with my mums death, inheritance and doing absolutely nothing. I feel like such a waste of space and I derailed my own life path for no reason. 

So now I have a massive (5-6 year) career gap. It's a huge stain on my resume. 

I feel like I am bright in real life, but all my achievements speak against it. I have a dad and friends that are willing to act as references, but that aside I feel like I still don't know what to do with my life. 

What are some potential career paths that I can land? I don't mind working as a paralegal forever, but I'm not sure if firms will even take me.

1jfln0v,Job becoming unbearable,"Hello

As the title suggests.

I started with this company a year ago and during the interview a lot was promises on how I will be promoted and all. 

Faat forward to today I have just been told that 1 of my colleague is leaving for another position within the company and an ex-employee is coming back (whose position I'm in at the moment) to get the promotion that I was promised!!!! I am really gutted and don't know what to do as leaving isn't an option! 

To address all this, here is the backstory: The colleague I was working with was put in this position as an emergency basis due to the ex-employee leaving in anger for low pay. I work in a chemical lab with dangerous chemicals so it is really difficult for one person to handle them all in a timely manner. The guy I am working with is not qualified as he does not have a Chemistry related background (but more of engineering), so knowing that he won't be progressing he applied to another position in the company and got it. 

The ex-employee (who also doesn't have a Chemistry degree) has 7 years experience and on that basis is being brought back to support the manager even though I had been working hard and was on the road to be gaining that position but it all went down the drain. 

At first overtime wasn't available but all of a sudden it is and I am expected to handle everything in the lab myself on top of no increment in my wage (doing 2 people's work now). The manager kept on saying there is support and my progression route is still there but I did not get anything in writing and on top of that all of the responsiblities are falling on me. 

Everything was going smoothly as I was doing a part time job due to low wage from the first and my expenses were in check, now I will have to leave my part time job (which I highly enjoy) because I have to give more time here and if they hire someone else I will have no overtime and would have lost my other job too. 

Why does life have to be so unfair. I just need advice whether to stick here for another year or so before leaving or if I find a better opportunity I should make a run for it?

Sorry for the long rant but this is my shit situation at the moment!

1jfle01,How was I supposed to succeed in high school?,"I already graduated a long time ago, and I don‚Äôt get how I was supposed to excel. It hurts seeing so many of my peers get into prestigious colleges and land six figure jobs.

It was hard (for me) to get good grades without a ton of studying while others get straight As in their sleep. Maybe I didn‚Äôt study effectively, but it was hard to know that as a teenager.

And I don‚Äôt know how I was supposed to do well in extracurriculars. So many people online dismiss extracurriculars and say they are a waste of time, but they do matter for colleges a lot. I couldn‚Äôt pass tryouts for sports and sucked at debate and robotics. I don‚Äôt get how others managed to be the varsity captain and get straight As or crush national competitors.

1jfl720,What would you do in my position?,"I‚Äôm a recent college graduate with four years of post-graduation experience. I spent 3.5 years with Company A, where I was promoted to manager in my third year to oversee a new customers operations. I played a key role in launching the  successful $20+ million operation and was on track for another promotion before leaving.

A few months ago, I transitioned to Company B through an acquisition, taking on a slightly different role with a better title and a 30% salary increase. While the company is strong in many ways, they‚Äôre operating in the red. I believe they have the potential to recover, but I‚Äôm unsure who may be affected in the process. With ongoing economic uncertainty (tariffs, etc.), this instability has me somewhat concerned.

Recently, I was approached by Company C for a director-level position. While I don‚Äôt feel entirely ready, I don‚Äôt want to pass up an opportunity for rapid career advancement and a significant increase in earning potential. I‚Äôve made it past the headhunter stage and will soon be interviewing directly with the hiring company.

I was told this role is a replacement for the current director, who is struggling with cultural fit and collaboration across teams.

Going from $50K to just over $100K‚Äîand now interviewing for a $180K‚Äì$260K position in only four years‚Äîis surreal.

What would you do in my position?

I work from home and, after covering my expenses, have around ¬£750‚Äì¬£800 in disposable income each month (excluding any extra commission I earn). I would also have a mortgage for my own property.  

I've been offered a promotion that comes with an ¬£18K salary increase, but it would require me to move down South to a relatively dull town about 40 minutes outside of London by train (Surrey area).

Additionally, I wouldn‚Äôt receive monthly commissions anymore, but I'd get an annual bonus ranging from ¬£5K upwards (potentially double, but not guaranteed).  

I feel torn. On one hand, I want to progress in my career, but on the other, I value financial stability and home ownership. I don‚Äôt want to move and end up feeling trapped due to higher expenses. At the same time, I feel some pressure to own a property and build that for myself.

1jfkxyv,"I hate my mid-level administration job, what should I do next?","I need to keep details vague, but here goes: 

I have several degrees in very specific areas of science/health/medicine and happily applied those degrees to 20 years in the applicable fields. The schedule and stress was brutal and absolutely not working for my family, so I started pursuing areas outside of my very specific career experience. I ended up accepting a position in administration for a large local health system. Initially, there was a learning curve for me but I believe I was able to settle in well. 

The last year has been a downward spiral of negativity. I feel like all my colleagues hate me because I don‚Äôt play the corporate politics games and *everyone* seems to think they know what I do (they don‚Äôt) and that I don‚Äôt ‚Äúprioritize the needs of others‚Äù enough. I am the only person in my job role. In researching my specific position, other corporations have 3-5 people doing this job, not just one. The volume of work I have is overwhelming, as I get about 10-20 ‚Äòurgent‚Äô requests daily, on top of my already existing tasks and projects. I took a significant pay decrease for this job. I‚Äôm not a director nor do I manage others. I‚Äôve found that some of the judgement on me is because I don‚Äôt answer emails at all hours of the day/night. I‚Äôve been told (not by the person I report to, but others) that even when on vacation I should be answering emails and phone calls. I think that‚Äôs complete crap. I should not have to compromise my time off or after hours (family time) *STILL* working! And for what?! It‚Äôs not like I make $300K a year, I‚Äôm hardly touching $100k. 

The good things about the jobs is that my schedule is flexible as I can WFH when I want, I can block my calendar for appointments, etc but the unrealistic expectation that I make myself available 24/7 is killing me. I‚Äôve also noticed people being more accusatory towards me, saying things about me ‚Äúmaking excuses‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing unsupportive‚Äù towards others. I HAVE BOUNDARIES. 

I‚Äôm really fed up with this. Im doing 4 people‚Äôs jobs and feel like I was set up to fail. Everyone thinks I‚Äôm a failure because I can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt act on things outside of my 40+ stressful hours per week. I have to move on but I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1jfkx6h,What Career Path suits my Background?,"Hey everyone,  
  
I‚Äôm feeling pretty frustrated with my current job situation and would love to get some advice or suggestions.  
  
About Me:  
I‚Äôm 24 years old and currently working in the east of Germany. I completed a dual study program in Mechanical Engineering, which included an apprenticeship as a Mechatronics Technician at Volkswagen. After that, I earned a master‚Äôs degree in Industrial Engineering and wrote my thesis at a large corporation under IG Metall standards. During this time, I was able to work with a cool team on the project to install an MES-System in production.(Currently there is no possibility to come back to this team/project)  
  
My Current Situation:  
Right now, I‚Äôm working in the IT department of a company, but I‚Äôm feeling completely unfulfilled. The tasks are dull, my colleagues seem like they have zero energy, and I feel trapped at a desk all day. It‚Äôs just not what I pictured for myself.  
  
During my studies and especially throughout the COVID period, I explored other fields:  
I worked as a Mystery Shopper in the automotive sector, which involved interacting directly with customers. I also worked on construction sites, where I enjoyed the hands-on tasks and the clear, tangible results of my work.

What I‚Äôve Realized:  
I genuinely enjoy working with customers and creating real, practical results. Being part of a young, dynamic team with a casual, collaborative atmosphere gives me energy. My current job offers none of that. It feels like I‚Äôm wasting my potential.  
  
  
My Questions:  
1. What kinds of careers or industries could be a better fit for my background and interests?  
2. Does anyone know of roles that effectively combine technical work with customer interaction?  
3. Has anyone here successfully transitioned from an IT-based role to something more hands-on and dynamic? How did you make it happen?  
4. Are there industries or job roles out there that I might not even be aware of but would suit my skill set and interests?  
  
I would really appreciate any advice or ideas. Thanks in advance!

When I left two years ago I had savings, 
I paid rent upfront for a couple of years, and my savings are almost gone.

1jfh2oj,Requesting a later start date after signing the offer,"Would you ask for the possibility of a later start date after already asking for a higher offer? 

Some background info: I am graduating college this April. After a lot of applications, I finally received an offer. They lowballed me (compared to what my classmates got, I got \~20% less) but I negotiated the salary for 10% more and they gave it to me. Out of happiness (and a little bit of desperation due to the lack of internships and not-so-good grades) I told them I could start after my exams ended. I signed the offer and sent it to them the next day. 

I talked to my classmates, and their new employers almost pushed them to have some break between exams and work (some have 3 weeks, some 3 months). This made me have doubts about how I handled it and I regret not asking for a later start date. 

Would it be too much to ask for a later start date despite having a signed agreement with a start date on it (1 week after exams)? I am thinking of saying that I am perfectly fine starting on the agreed date, but if it is possible, I would like to have 1-2 extra weeks off.",ftredoc,1,1.0,2,1742445566,2025-03-20 04:39:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfh2oj/requesting_a_later_start_date_after_signing_the/,3,2025
1jfh01k,34F Wasted my law degree working as a stewardess. How to get back on track?,"Hi everyone!
So I (34F) got my bachelor's degree in corporate law at 23, worked at the bank as a legal assistant for 2 years and then got the sudden urge to travel, see the world, enjoy my twenties. So I applied as a stewardess for one of the world's top airlines and got hired. 
What followed were the best years of my life. I got paid to see the world, fell in love with a passenger, got married, had two kids.

Now that I'm 34 and both kids are in school I feel like I should wear my big girl pants and go back to the legal field. I'm just not sure how to go about this.
I found a job about a year ago as an admin assistant and that's what I'm currently doing, but I'm living paycheck to paycheck and don't have extra funds to go back to law school to get my master's. 
I've been looking for legal assistant jobs, but since my last experience as a legal assistant was in 2014, I imagine I'm not the most interesting candidate. 
Do you have any tips for me how to go about this?

1jfgzyp,Need career advice,"I work as a financial analyst for a F500 company. I just found out my company is doing layoffs and cutting 5 percent of the workforce.

I was working towards a promotion for the last 3 years at my company but now I have been told that that role may no longer be available.

I don't really think I will be laid off this round. But I also don't know where is my future within the company with all this turmoil.

I also had a bad stint during COVID where I had to change jobs due to various lay off and restructuring. So this would be my 6th job if I jump. My job tenures are all close to 2 years each and one at 3 years.

I feel really stressed out and unsure what to do. 

I have an interview with another F500 company as a senior financial analyst. I do not know whether it is right to move or just wait things out at my current company and hope I am not laid off.

Any inputs?

1jfgxtr,What should I do?

She asked me to text her some info and that she would call me back. I waited for her to call me this Monday but I didn't receive a call so I called her around 4pm but there was a voicemail. Yesterday, I was able to reach the recruiter again after I called around 4pm. She scheduled to meet me on Friday for an interview. She also informed me that another recruiter from her staffing agency will be interviewing me as well. I have tried twice today to get a hold of the other recruiter (in the morning and around 3pm) but I kept receiving an automatic text message that she was conducting interviews but that I could text her. I called her again at 5:20pm today but no response (not even text). I texted her in the morning but she never actually responded to my text. I have tried twice today to call the original recruiter as well but no avail. I have new questions and I'm afraid that I may not be able to speak to either of them again until Friday, which is when I'm supposed to meet them. The interview will be at a supply chain company.

1jff7k7,Left a New Job in 3 Months‚ÄîBack to My Old Company. Did I Mess Up?,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent career experience and get some insights from you all. Last year, I was working as a structural design engineer at a medium-scale firm when I received two job offers‚Äîone with a lower salary in a different city and another with a higher salary in my home city. Naturally, I went for the better-paying offer and joined the new company in October 2024.

However, within three months, I realized the work environment was toxic and unbearable. The workload itself wasn‚Äôt the problem‚Äîit was the culture and management. One of my managers even mocked my name, which made me uncomfortable. I didn‚Äôt see a future there, and it just didn‚Äôt feel right.

By January 2025, I decided to leave and reached out to my previous employer. To my surprise, they welcomed me back warmly, offered me a senior position, and gave me the opportunity to work on more complex projects.

Now, I can‚Äôt help but wonder:
	1.	Did I make a mistake by leaving the new company so soon?
	2.	Will this short stint hurt my resume in the long run?
	3.	How do I explain this situation in future job interviews without it sounding bad?
	4.	How can I mentally overcome the regret and self-doubt that come with making such a quick career move?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would love to hear your thoughts on whether I should just focus on my growth at my current company or if there‚Äôs something else I should consider. Thanks in advance!

1jfdysa,Applying to a role right after starting a new job,I returned to my previous company about a month and a half ago in a new role after being recruited to come back. The role is but I just saw a very exciting and lucrative opportunity posted on linked in. I know that leaving this early into a role will burn a bridge but I think I will kick myself if I don‚Äôt apply. Would you recommend I wait out the standard year or two or take a leap and apply to the new company? If I apply do I leave this role off my resume.

1jfdxl6,Feeling Stuck at 20 ‚Äì Looking for Career Advice and a Better Path,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 20 (turning 21 in November) and feeling really stuck in life. I didn‚Äôt get my license until I was 19 and finally got a car about four months ago, but I wrecked it in January. Currently having to rebuild from that loss I‚Äôm feeling very lost & unmotivated. Right now, I‚Äôm working as a cart pusher at Sam‚Äôs, making a little over $1,000 biweekly, but it‚Äôs physically draining with bad management and no work-life balance.

I tried college briefly (general studies) but didn‚Äôt fully apply myself, and I didn‚Äôt really enjoy it. I do have high interest in the healthcare field, but right now, I just need something with more immediate results‚Äîsomething that will get me out of meaningless hourly jobs, help me become independent, and stop living paycheck to paycheck at my parents‚Äô house.

I want a career that gives me financial stability, the ability to travel, and the freedom to enjoy life without constantly struggling. I feel like I‚Äôm wasting time, especially compared to my peers, and I don‚Äôt know where to start.

I‚Äôve looked into quick certifications in healthcare that I can complete in under nine months with just a high school diploma, like:
	‚Ä¢	Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) (4-12 weeks)
	‚Ä¢	Phlebotomy Technician (4-6 months)
	‚Ä¢	Medical Assistant (6-9 months)
	‚Ä¢	Pharmacy Technician (3-6 months)
	
I‚Äôm open to other suggestions as well. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has advice on where to start, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. What‚Äôs the best way to transition into something stable without feeling like I‚Äôm wasting more time? Thankyou in advance ",Mindless_Cut_3922,0,0.5,1,1742435160,2025-03-20 01:46:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jfdxl6/feeling_stuck_at_20_looking_for_career_advice_and/,3,2025
1jfd92e,Advice in the current market??,"The current market has been tough, and that‚Äôs only added to the uncertainty and fear around career decisions. My current role has been quite stressful‚Äîand frankly, getting more toxic by the day. Most of my experience has been in SRE and Platform Engineering, though I started out as a developer about 15 years ago.

There are a few things I‚Äôm seeking suggestions on:
	1.	Is this a good time to explore new opportunities or make a move?
Any insights on whether the market is expected to improve soon?
	2.	What are the most valuable skills to build today?
AI is obviously trending, but beyond that, what technologies or skills would you recommend focusing on?
Also, is hands-on development experience still considered the most critical skill in today‚Äôs landscape?
	3.	Is it worth considering a shift into IC roles like Technical Program Management (TPM)?
I‚Äôm wondering if transitioning into such a role now, learning the ropes, and eventually launching myself into higher leadership roles in a year or two makes sense.

Lastly, due to the stress and burnout, I‚Äôm struggling to even enjoy what I‚Äôve achieved so far. If anyone has been in a similar place and made a pivot that helped‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear your story.

B) 80k full time job in NJ, crappy PTO policy but otherwise has decent benefits

The nature of my career was cut short due to changes in the company so instead of having 2-3 of SDR management I have 1.5 years of a mix bag of three different roles. Ultimately the company was horrible and I had saved up so I took a career break, spend 1.5 years doing shit I loved, seeing the world, volunteering a lot, learning a new language.

Now I'm trying to get back into the working world, I am getting rejected for management jobs for lack of experience and sales development representative jobs for having too much experience. I feel like I've accidentally taken a step backwards. I was so confident in my abilities and how I was performing that I didn't realize getting back into work would be so challenging.

I'm 29 going on 30. I know I always want to work in either promoting my home country's companies abroad, or doing something at home to benefit the country. Basically I've always been quite passionate about helping the country due to this situation of the struggle that comes with working here, finding jobs, it's who you know. When I lived abroad and worked it all felt so easy. Here it feels quite difficult.

Will a masters (MBA, International Business, etc. Etc.) Help me at all? 

Or is it a bit of another step sidewards instead of holding out??

Mary also lost her adult daughter 5 years ago. In a show of appreciation for helping build my career, I have let down many of my usual work boundaries to the extent that it is beginning to impact my sanity. I field her weekly 2+ hour phone calls that touch on work topics mixed with family drama and grief for her daughter. I‚Äôm not qualified for this! She loud talks and talks over me constantly and can not take constructive criticism. I‚Äôm her first ever report, and she is on her senior slide in the corporate world. She does not properly advocate for our small department in a field where information is currency.

I have a terminal degree in my field and also have‚Ä¶you know, experience and adult skills. Mary micromanages me so closely it‚Äôs insulting. She has asked me to work through FMLA time, and has even showed up at my house unexpectedly. My patience is wearing thin.

I‚Äôve never officially complained about her, only casually to peers from other departments. She is tone deaf and I know she corners others into uncomfortable conversations where she trauma dumps. I‚Äôm her only report so I shoulder the burden. 

What do I do? Wait it out 16 months? Look for another job and forgo the 6 weeks PTO I was banking on for a surgery later this year? Wait for her to self implode??

1jfcsx5,Torn between pursuing being a pilot or sticking with my entrepreneurship path,"Hello! I‚Äôm a junior entrepreneurship major in college who was interested in being a pilot in high school but never took a discovery flight or pursued it. Recently I started thinking about it again and I have been stressing myself out so much if I do become a pilot because it is more time and money than using what I already went to school for. I am grateful to be debt free for college, but if I do want to be a pilot I wish I spent the money on that. The only thing I‚Äôm worried about is that I do take lexapro and I hear a lot about first-class medical and everything and I have been seeing a counselor. If I am disqualified I would like to know asap so I don‚Äôt spend money on lessons. My mom is supportive and my dad is not. My dad said being a pilot is like being an engineer and I‚Äôm not sure I believe that. I used to be a financial technology major and hated it, so he thought that I would not like anything technical/analytical. I have a goal of getting enough money to put a down payment on a condo, so just not sure if being a pilot would severely delay that. I am also 20 and a girl. What I like about being an entrepreneur is that you can be creative and the sky is the limit with what you make. I just really want time freedom. I do not want a 9-5 business office job. I want to be my own boss/pilot is its own thing. There‚Äôs a girl that went to my HS who is a pilot and I really want to have her lifestyle. I love that you can work a lot for a while and then have time off. I prefer a ‚Äúweird‚Äù schedule to a more normal daytime schedule and I seriously dread the thought of getting any sort of office job. I am considering buying a franchise after college if I don‚Äôt become a pilot. My grandparents and dad really do not want me to be a pilot but I think they have an outdated mindset. I just don‚Äôt know what the smartest decision for me is. I would appreciate any advice or if anyone would be willing to talk more with me that would be great.

1jfbsal,Feeling singled out by over the top praise in front of coworkers,"Within the last year our facility had a new plant manager take over. They are not new to the facility or the industry and have decades of experience. I on the other hand only have a couple of years in the industry, but in the short period have worked really hard to learn all that I can and try to make an impact where I can. Honestly I feel like I'm just doing my job and I'm not really overachieving at all. I don't work crazy hours or extend myself too far as to not have a good work life balance. I try to take credit for the positive things I've done and I try to work as a team with my coworkers and make sure they get acknowledged for their hard work as well.

Well ever since the new plant manager took over, they have been very complementary towards my work, to the point where I'm starting to feel singled out. They will make it a point in meetings and in front of my coworkers to say that I'm ""the smartest one in the room"". They will even say ""if I had a bunch of u/raptor464's in this room, we would be better off"". Today when I walked into a meeting they said ""well the IQ in the room just went up 20 points"". I appreciate a little bit of praise and recognition for my efforts, but I'm starting to feel like my coworkers are being alienated when I'm singled out.

How would you handle this kind of situation? The plant manager isn't even my boss, as I report to the engineering manager. I do appreciate the praise, but am starting to feel embarrassed by it and I don't want my coworkers to feel alienated.

Another point I saw was that she constantly kept writing that I ‚Äòrefused to work with other departments‚Äô when I don‚Äôt aggressively follow up on emails that were sent 2 days ago. Other comments she made was ‚Äòwasted my time‚Äô and ‚Äòyou can lead a horse to water only so much‚Äô (which I admittedly laughed at a little).

I‚Äôm confused, irritated, and upset because I thought I was fine with her.

1jfbadg,31 and potentially leaving 10 year employment?,"Hello,

I am 31 and potentially may leave my current 10 year employment where I‚Äôve been my entire career in my industry. I‚Äôve been interviewing for a job at a local hospital in the oral surgery unit. The job would pay me 4$ more an hour, offer me a pension, health benefits and a union, 3 weeks vacation, and sick days. This is a full time 5 days a week monday to friday 8-4 job. 35 hours a week once lunch breaks are taken out.  15 min commute that turns into maybe 45min on heavy traffic days as it‚Äôs downtown.. parking can be an issue too. 

My current job is like my home.. i love everyone i work with especially 2 ladies i‚Äôve worked with for years. It‚Äôs a small office and there are only 3 other people aside from the owner who work there. I should note I also really enjoy working for my boss, and it‚Äôs a pretty chill atmosphere other than our day to day schedule. This job offers 4 weeks paid vacation, licensing paid for (400$) and 2 sick days a year. It also pays 4$ less and doesn‚Äôt offer any other benefits or pension. This job is 4 days a week so it offers me good work life balance and provides good hours where we start early but get off early. Approx 30 hours a week. 25 min commute by car. lots of parking. 


 Now that i‚Äôm in my 30s I‚Äôm starting to think about my retirement plan, and with the economy i don‚Äôt think anything i save myself will ever allow me to retire.. which is the real reason i‚Äôve been considering this. They want to contact my current employer as it‚Äôs a hospital job, it‚Äôs a requirement. I was hoping to keep my application confidential until a job offer was made.. but now I have to let them know about the reference situation i‚Äôll need to the hospital job.

I mean what would you guys do if a job offer is made? i‚Äôm so torn cause i care about my current workplace and im worried ill regret my decision or end up hating it. Again, basically considering doing this for my future self‚Äôs benefit.

1jfamgm,My leadership got canned. Is it too soon to look elsewhere?,"I‚Äôve been in my role as a Learning & Development Manager at a non-profit for about 5 months now. This is my first dedicated L&D position after previously working as a Sr. Program Manager at an education-based non-profit ‚Äî my previous role involved a lot of staff training and development, so L&D felt like a good next step for me. For some additional context, my team (including my role) is funded by a grant that runs through March 2026. This job was a great opportunity to make a career pivot, get some experience, and assess after ~18 months if it was a direction I wanted to continue pursuing.

I‚Äôve been really enjoying the work, but last week my boss‚Äô boss (Chief of HR, Legal, and Compliance ‚Äî yes, they oversaw all three departments) was fired, and our Sr. HR Director resigned in solidarity. The change management has been understandably chaotic, but the good news is that my L&D team exists in a unique little enclave within the org that more or less protects our jobs and shouldn‚Äôt prevent from us achieving our grant deliverables. As you can imagine, though, there is a ton of uncertainty in our department, and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if it‚Äôs best for me to stick around. Even if my team will be able to continue our work relatively unscathed, there is a lot of mess brewing in other teams and I fear that the overall culture of this workplace is about to take a nosedive.

Will it seem like I‚Äôm just trying to jump ship and job-hop rather than persevere and lead my team through hardship?

Though I have a ton of formal and transferable skills for another L&D role, I‚Äôm also concerned that I haven‚Äôt been in this role long enough to convince interviewers that I‚Äôm experienced enough. Would it be better to wait things out a bit longer to have a few more months under my belt?

Feeling rather down at the moment in regard to work and career, I‚Äôm only in my 30‚Äôs but feeling like I‚Äôve majorly let myself down, I should have put a career first years back, but I helped my husbands career and focused on our children and I‚Äôm left with nothing to my name, apart from savings from our house, that I‚Äôve spent on rent bills and food, the last couple of years 

Any advice? The job market is very competitive at the moment and only a few jobs advertised a day and mainly specialised roles ie nurse or teacher, which obviously I don‚Äôt have a degree in, my CV isn‚Äôt even getting looked at for simple positions.

ideas for careers? Or starting a simple small buisness from home? Or anything I can do for my CV to be noticed. Ideally would like to work part time 20 hours. For work and home life balance.

1jf9qhv,Looking for a bit of a fresh start.,"Hello, made a throwaway for this one. Worked at my current place of employment for 6 or 7 years now. Started in quailty and then transitioned to a CNC operator and set up (I get bored easily and can't site at a desk very long). I've worked mainly in manufacturing most of my life and did 3 years worth of an engineering degree, last job was destructive weld testing and CMM programming and setup.

 Ive been experiencing health related struggle due to stress and the company has been having issues since COVID. I don't mind working in manufacturing and am decent enough at it but wondering if I can keep at it for the next 30 years. I always loved the science of things and the testing of it got me out of the office enough to keep me happy. Always kind of thought I'd work in R&D but seems like a lot of companies pivot away from that these days.


 I'm wondering what I could do to try to pivot into something a bit more stable than manufacturing given the current climate in my country and still feed my hands on yet inquisitive nature.",joeyjojowiliamshaba2,1,1.0,0,1742423321,2025-03-19 22:28:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jf9qhv/looking_for_a_bit_of_a_fresh_start/,3,2025

1jf8y01,New Graduate Laid Off After 9 Weeks due to work force reduction,"Hey everyone,

I recently graduated in December and landed my first full-time job at a major tech company. Before accepting, I had better offers from companies like Verizon, Dell, AT&T, and JPMorgan, paying $100K‚Äì$110K, compared to my $70K offer. However, those offers all had summer start dates, meaning I would have had to wait nine months after graduation to start working. The $70K offer had an immediate start date, and since I was just one week away from being homeless after graduation, I had no choice but to take it. I have no family or support system, so waiting that long without income simply wasn‚Äôt an option.

At the time, many of my friends recommended that I accept all offers and then see how my first job went, leaving later in the year if I didn‚Äôt like it. But I felt that was unethical‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to take a job only to quit six months in. I believed that if I worked hard and stayed committed, it would pay off in the long run. I was just happy to have any income, even if it meant earning less than I could have.

Now, just 9 weeks in, I‚Äôve been laid off due to a ""Reduction in Workforce."" No severance, no relocation reimbursement‚ÄîI had to move at my own expense, and now I‚Äôm stuck with $10K in debt and no income. I‚Äôll be filing for unemployment and doing Uber just to survive.

The reason I was let go is that I was still in my training phase, which was supposed to last five months. Since I wasn‚Äôt supporting any programs yet, cutting me had no immediate impact on the business, making me an easy target for layoffs. It had nothing to do with my performance‚ÄîI was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

What hurts the most is that I‚Äôve always prided myself on being ethical and honoring my commitments. Even during my internship search, I once had a $10/hr internship, and just two days before starting, I got a dream offer from a defense contractor. I turned it down because I had already committed to the lower-paying job. At the time, it felt like a mistake, but I trusted that doing the right thing would be rewarded in the long run, and in a way, it did. That experience helped me develop strong skills for behavioral interviews, which later helped me secure three amazing internships.

But I guess I was the fool here, choosing to be ethical, only to be left in a position where I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll be able to feed myself next week. I‚Äôm stuck, desperate, and completely lost. I graduated with what I thought was a perfect resume‚Äîperfect GPA, four internships, extracurriculars‚Äîyou name it.

And now, I‚Äôm worried that if I take any job just for the sake of income, I‚Äôll lose all my opportunities to pursue my dream jobs and work in the environment I always envisioned and worked hard for. It feels like if I take a different path now, it will be much harder to pivot back, and I may have to start all over again. but I'm also at the point where I'm just trying to find any job that will help me survive.",born123321,11,0.8700000047683716,34,1742421247,2025-03-19 21:54:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jf8y01/new_graduate_laid_off_after_9_weeks_due_to_work/,3,2025

1jf8dah,Unsure about future and wanting to pivot,"This might be a lengthy post but hopefully it gives you the background info to help me. 

I am now 24. Graduated when I was 22 and went straight into job. 

Worked at a top tier asset manager (building investment products) for over 1.5 years before being made redundant because of restructurings. However, wanted to experience a role within startups (and also have a job prepared as I foresaw the redundancy) so went to a startup doing sales immediately after (had job secured before I left). Spent 7 months at that startup (which was a fintech) before being headhunted to join a new asset manager specialising in alternatives. Currently, been here for 8 months and they‚Äôve just terminated without warning my boss who was the person who hired me and who I was looking forward to growing with. The long term outlook on the company looks bleak now. Honestly the change has got me thinking about if this is the right career path and future for me. 

I have always been interested in learning how to grow businesses and invest in businesses. I am now thinking some experience in strategy consultancy or private equity/credit or Venture capitalism is more up my street and has the learning opportunities I want. 

How to pivot / how to think about the risk on my cv of jumping around?

1jf8bnu,Thoughts ?,"I'm in a bit of a situation at my workplace that's been on my mind. A year ago, one of my former coworkers from another job recruited me to work with her at her new place of employment. Initially, we were quite close at our old job, but over time when I joined at the new job we drifted apart‚Äîsomething I'm fine with, as I'm here primarily to earn a living.

However, she's become the center of attention at this job. She's from a different country and in her mid-40s and has been in America since she was 10. Her accent isn't strong, but it's definitely noticeable, and everyone seems to love it. The moment she starts talking, it's like a comedy club‚Äîeveryone laughing and mimics her accent. She even plays up her accent for them, which I think is really weird, she probably does it presumably because she enjoys the attention.

Honestly, I feel like people are laughing at her, not with her, and I'm conflicted. I want to tell her what I perceive, but we're not close anymore. Plus, she‚Äôs part of a clique that goes out to lunch and gossips about others (she's mentioned this to me before). I also feel like she's starting to get an ego from all the attention.

I don't understand why my coworkers constantly talk about how much they love her and how funny she is every time she speaks. It gets even more distracting because she starts getting loud and obnoxious once people start laughing. It's becoming a distraction, taking up to ten minutes away from our work whenever she talks.

How should I handle this situation? Should I say something to her or just let it be? Anyone else deal with something similar?

1jf80k1,I hate my new job,"I just started as a Registrar at a high school in December and i absolutely hate it.  At the time when I took the job I was looking for something closer to home as i was commuting 40 min everyday at my old job, which was a secretary in a transportation department at a school which also sucked.  This new job is a so much more work and it‚Äôs not even a pay raise.  I feel like I‚Äôve been played.  I thought because the pay was the same it would be at the same level of work but I was so wrong.  I barely have enough time to do all more work in a day, the training process was nonexistent. They gave me a packet of a timeline of what I need through out the year never actually gave me any real training with another person.  Whenever I ask my supervisor a question, who is a school counselor, she never knows the answer.  I guess the women who had my position before me was there for almost 10 years so my supervisor never needed to help them but I am struggling and need help and there is literally no one there to help me.

1jf7y87,Time to look for a new job?,"As the title suggests I suspect I may be about to be let go, but I want alternate perspectives/opinions on this to make sure I'm not overthinking this.

Basically I am currently 2 months into my new job in a sales role. I am on a 6 month probation period, so I know I can be let go at any time for almost no reason and I accepted this when I started.

But here's where things get interesting; when I first interviewed for this job I was told there was ONE open position, but by the end of the interview process they actually ended up hiring me AND another person into the same role and on the same team. Now this other person, let's call them H, started with me, we've done all the training together and we've basically become best friends at work already so this was something I was actually really happy with, but it always struck me as odd that the company hired 2 of us when they originally wanted 1 person.

My new bosses reasoning for this was that she couldn't pick between us as we were both great candidates, so she decided she could use the extra help anyway. So ok, I accepted this I guess it makes sense.

But I am a bit of a (slightly) paranoid person, so I always had the idea in the back of my mind she may have hired us both to try us out, see who's better at the job, and get rid of the other in the 6 month probation period. But I had literally no proof or reason to suspect this outside of my seemingly unfounded hunch, so I ignored it.

Then came LinkedIn. Now at this company LinkedIn is big, everyone uses it and everyone adds everyone else. So I didn't think it would be a big deal if I added my boss to grow my network which I did in my first month on the job.

Now, my boss never accepted by LinkedIn request. This struck as a bit odd but again, I thought nothing of it, no point getting worked up over a simply LinkedIn request. But here's really fun part, I then asked H earlier this week if they had added our boss on LinkedIn, H said no. H then added our boss on LinkedIn and guess what? My boss accepted H in a day.

I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I see no good reason for my boss to accept H on LinkedIn but ignore me. There's no way she could have missed my request, because the connection requests appear in a list when you accept someone.

I know the hunch still has no solid proof, but am I being crazy here? Is it time for me to start looking for a new job or should have a smoke and chill out a bit?",bongripperwaluigi74,1,1.0,0,1742418699,2025-03-19 21:11:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jf7y87/time_to_look_for_a_new_job/,3,2025

I currently am finishing my masters degree. during this time I took law adjacent courses and learned that I want to become a lawyer.

My degree is In criminology and I‚Äôd really want to work as a paralegal or in police dispatch/ something close to the criminal justice field before I even try to commit to the idea. My issue is that I‚Äôm 25, gonna be 26 not too soon and I‚Äôm gonna get kicked from my dads insurance (US). I am set to graduate this spring and my plan was to work 2 years and study for the LSAT, then apply. 

My diagnostic lsat was in the 150s but I haven‚Äôt begun studying fully. I thought if I work full time I‚Äôll have benefits (hopefully) from work. That way I could attend a part time program (I‚Äôm thinking about CUNY law or St.Johns in nyc) but then I heard most schools only offer scholarship to full time students. If my lsat is high enough do I risk it and apply full time? Also cuny law focuses on public defense, which I‚Äôm not sure I want to do. Further as a part time student if I work full time then what about the summer internships/ externships I hear people do in the summer of 1L and 2L plus clinic hours? I also am not guaranteed admission to CUNY or St.Johns, I know this, so I shouldn‚Äôt put my eggs in 1 basket. 

I just worry if I work 2 years full time or something that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll be set if I commit to be a student fulltime. I heard you aren‚Äôt allowed or it‚Äôs not favored to work during 1L. I‚Äôve heard people say they do work part time the other 2 years but I just have so many questions and no one to ask.

1jf5qka,"Funding has been withdrawn from my charity job, not sure what to do. Any advice?","**TL/DR at the bottom of post.**

I currently work for a small charity in Scotland as an administrator and I have been for just shy of two years - it will be two years in June.

Our charity runs on funding to support the work we do which is working with children/young people and their families through therapeutic work. We assist families who have gone through trauma such as domestic and sexual abuse, fleeing war torn countries. We have been around since 1931 and we have built up an extremely positive rapport within the community and city and even beyond that.

I absolutely love my job and the people are lovely. However, we got some news last week that the funding we have has been withdrawn just shy of the full contract. Everyone, as you can imagine, is heart broken and devastated. We are aware of cuts being made to social work and health, but this is a massive hit to us. Our manager is speaking to the MSP of our area and he is angry and annoyed that this has happened, even calling it ""unethical and cruel"". He was there when the same people tried to cut our funding by 54% several years ago. He fought and and they ended up giving us all our funding back.

Here is some information:

* Teachers are not happy and they are upset that the service is being cut and runs the risk of closing down due to the lack of funding and many are going to the head of education to discuss this as they are aware the importance of the service.
* Another mental health organisation who send us referrals are devastated and said that they would not be able to cope nor provide the service we do if we were to close.
* Letters have gone out to head of education and health by the MSP as a matter of urgency.
* the case is going to be brought up in parliament either this Thursday or next - depends on other matters that are being brought up.
* Senior journalists have been spoken to and two are interested in covering the story and are waiting for a clear run in covering it so it gets as much attention as possible. Some parents (current and past service users) are happy to be covered in the story and are absolutely outraged this could happen as they think favourably of the service.

The board are speaking about talking about redundancies but only as a precaution. The funders are going to cover us until June and that is when all funding from them will cease. We have been given statutory funding by these same people since the 1960s.

It is not 100% clear that we will be shutting down and our manager is working really hard to make sure that we can get the funding re-instated until the end of the contract so we can then get the opportunity to look for other ways to fund our service.

Here is my issue: I don't want to jump ship just yet, but I am aware what is against us. I am currently looking for other jobs and getting a feel of what is out there and I have spoken to recruitment agencies to make them aware of my situation. One of which is the lady who got me the job in the first place and she is very understanding and said she has temp work to keep me going if she can't find a permanent job first. I feel it is too early to make a call but I don't want to be here when it is clear that the ship cannot be saved but that can take some time before I know if that is the case.

I am only 26 years old so I feel like there are options out there for me, but it is just a horrible situation to be in.

1jf5nah,Need help to choose between these 2 offers,"Hi,

Please I need help deciding on which job offer to accept. 

I got 2 offers, one from GOA (Alberta) as a Provincial
prosecutor $94k and another from one of the big 5 banks as a Senior Trust Officer at 85k plus bonus.

For context, I am going to be called as a lawyer later this year, I‚Äôm also a single mom. I would like to know which of these offers seem more promising. 

My biggest fear is the job security that seems nonexistent in this country and also work life balance. The bank and government roles seem secure but I fear that in the bank if your one-up doesn‚Äôt like you then you can be fired. I understand that as Prosecutor I would have trials and its office based but the bank role is 4 days a week in the office (after probation lol). 

Also for the bank, one of the conditions is that I have to complete 2 industry related exams within one year of my employment. 

For the GOA role, I‚Äôve heard that the pay deduction is much and I could potentially be getting about $2,300 biweekly and that seems a bit small compared to the biweekly I would get at the bank on an 85k salary. Also, with the govt role I get to take the extra days off from when court closes for the year from the 23rd of December into the new year. 

Please help.

1jf5a25,How happy can I reasonably be at a job?,"I (30f) am in the field of NGO communication and private donor fundraising.

 After a year of job search I started a new job last May, as private donor fundraiser at a small NGO in Berlin (I am German). 

Apart from the cookie cutter style of fundraising communication which I am not a fan of, the team is reasonably nice. My salary is rather low, but not as outrageously low as some of the other offers I had. 

Now, my team is technically quite nice. But: They are truffle pigs when it comes to finding things to tell you to do differently of finding mistakes. Today, I was called into a meeting because of a typo, that sparked a 30 minute discussion. I have had similar meetings about the Teamspace system, where every folder and subfolder has it's own naming conventions different people have come up with through the years. I even have been called on days off for those things, or had entire copy rewritten without my consent because someone else simply had a different vision for a product. It's driving me crazy. 

Every time I give my all to fulfill all their wishes, and not to repeat mistakes, they find something new to complain about. The last: I was made responsible for a colleague who is located in a different country not delivering adequate photo material, though he has received the exact same instructions as any other colleague for the last couple years (I just used their old versions of the briefings). 

I am pretty much at my wits end, because there is NOTHING I can do, no amount of effort I can out put in, that would ever lead to a good result. 

I wasn't happy in my old job either, but back then it was due to an evidently toxic work environment. Shortly after I left there the entire team was dismantled because it was that dysfunctional. 

But now, I am really wondering whether I might simply be in the wrong job and sector. 

If I am always frustrated anyway, I feel I could at least be that frustrated for more money. 

SO, how happy can you really be in a job? Do I have to be okay with being just okay? Does our current work environment we have created simply suck? 

And how could I find an alternative in a different field that might be more fulfilling? 

Thank you for your input.

1jf50pl,Seeking Advice on Requesting a Schedule Change for a Second Job?? SORRY LONG READ ADVICE HIGHLY APPRECIATED,"Hello, peeps! I hope I can get some advice here because I‚Äôm really conflicted.

I have a full-time ‚Äúday job‚Äù where I‚Äôve been for almost five years. My relationship with my boss is unique‚Äîpartly because he‚Äôs a psychologist, partly because we started from the bottom together, and partly because, thanks to ADHD, I tend to overshare (ugh).

For context, I‚Äôve had my own mental health struggles, and at one point, I hit a breaking point and had to be upfront with my employer for my literal safety. To their credit, they were very gracious, gave me two weeks off, and even set me up with an excellent psychiatrist. However, while they were kind, they also demoted me, which cut my pay in half.

That was two years ago. Since then, I‚Äôve significantly improved and have gone above and beyond at my job. But financially, I‚Äôm struggling. I recently asked for a raise, and my request was completely ignored.

After exhausting my options for better-paying jobs and receiving only rejections, I‚Äôve reluctantly started searching for a second job out of sheer necessity. This is not something I want to do, but I have no choice‚ÄîI need the additional income to survive.

My current role has some flexibility, and realistically, I could complete my work in about 25 hours per week. However, my employer is firmly against remote work, so despite my efficiency, I‚Äôm still required to be on-site for 40 hours a week.

Here‚Äôs where I need advice:

I have a strong feeling I‚Äôll be offered a second job after my interview tomorrow. To make it work, I‚Äôd need to request a significant schedule change from my primary employer. My proposed schedule would be:

Four days a week: three 11-hour days and one 7-hour day

Three days off


Scheduling flexibility isn‚Äôt unheard of at my workplace‚Äîsome employees have unique arrangements, such as a co-worker with three days off and one ‚Äúon-call‚Äù day, and another who transitioned to remote work after moving out of state. Even the COO only works 30-hour weeks.

My dilemma: Should I mention that I‚Äôm taking on a second job when requesting the schedule change?

If I don‚Äôt explain that I need this for financial survival, I worry they won‚Äôt take my request seriously.

But if I do mention the second job, I fear they‚Äôll see it as a sign that I‚Äôm on my way out or assume I can‚Äôt handle both roles.


I‚Äôm genuinely loyal to this company, but I have to do what‚Äôs necessary to stay afloat. How do I frame this request in a way that maximizes my chances of approval without creating unnecessary concerns?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any real advice‚Äîplease, no snarky comments. üôè",Sad-Macaron-5253,1,1.0,0,1742411459,2025-03-19 19:10:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jf50pl/seeking_advice_on_requesting_a_schedule_change/,3,2025

I want mundane work. Work that is predictable and not too high up on the ladder (aka lower responsibility. I'm fine with the lower pay that comes with it). I don't want the stakes of a company or a person's life to be reliant on me. I'm fine with skilled or specialized work as long as it's typical. I also hear that a lot of office jobs don't actually require 40 hours a week. I want something like that where I'm not so busy to the point where I can't take a lunch. An industry where remote/hybrid work is a thing is preferable.

1jf3eq2,Stuck at entry level,"I got hired for a starting position at a well-respected financial institution after years of teaching and various customer service. I didn't major in Finance, so the job would entail a completely new set of duties, apart from communication skills and sales which I had plenty of experience in. During the orientation I was being ""sold"" the job so hard: core values, growth, tuition, benefits, etc. Low pay (so low, that if I were single, I wouldn't have made rent), but the opportunities and benefits! I was made to believe the position was ""a stepping stone"" and a way of ""putting your foot in the door."" 

After orientation and training, which took 90 days, I caught up with basic job requirements and I started exploring the options. Inially, I planned to take classes, that would align with the current position: accounting, finance, etc. 

The first road block: the company would not pay for certifications, only college classes that you take towards a Bachelor's degree; 2 classes per semester. You pay out of pocket and get reembursed if you pass. Got to be pre-approved by the HR. The road towards a degree would take 4 years this way. Mind you, the paycheck amount doesn't allow you to put anything aside towards the tuition costs.

By the time I was eligible to enroll in their health insurance group plan, the premiums went up, so that my already sad paycheck could only extend to basic necessities and health insurance. I opted out of 401K contributions as I couldn't afford them. 

The opportunity to transfer between departments was initially advertised to me as another perk, so I applied for a slightly higher paying position. My immediate supervisor was annoyed by it: ""You should really tell me first, 'cause I have to recommend you."" Got interviewed, transfer request denied with no feedback. 

Close to a year into my employment, the HR sent out an email, informing everyone that transferring between jobs is now only allowed after 12 months of employment and based on a favourable performance evaluation report. I decided to tough it out a  little longer, got a part time weekend job to get some extra income. My yearly evaluation was coming up and I was sure I'd do great. Boy was I wrong. 

On a scale of 1-5 in multiple areas of evaluation (appearance, attendance, ability to learn, policy knowledge, etc.) I scored 3.5 (meets expectations). Surprised by the mediocre results, I approached my supervisor for clarification on how exactly those criteria were measured and what can be done better to get a higher score. That's all the feedback I got:  ""Everyone gets 3.5 their first year."" ""You are not better than the others."" ""I don't know, what exactly you don't know about your job, but you can't know everything."" ""If you want to give yourself grief, sign that you don't agree with it."" When I inquired what the purpose of the evaluation was if everyone gets 3.5 their first year, I was told that I could be graded lower and should be grateful for my yearly 3% raise (30 cents an hour more, I'm not joking). I signed ""don't agree"", was told the issue was elevated to the HR. Never heard back from anyone. 

Afterwards, I applied for a couple of other vacancies in the company, got interviewed, just to learn they ended up hiring from the outside. 

I'm not the only one who was ""sold"" this job as an opportunity to grow within the company and most new hires already left the department or the company altogether. I'm nearing my  second year evaluation and cringing at the thought of having to listen to someone's subjective opinion about my performance and receiving criticism without guidance. I've pretty much lost all the hope for any progress in the company and barely dragging my feet to work every morning. At this point it's clear, they want me just where I am: the lowest paying position. It took me some time to realize what a toxic, stagnant environment I'm in and I've just wasted two years of my life, hurting myself financially in hopes of a better future.

1jf30qw,"Blind, late 20s, is law school my only path to a comfortable life?","I feel, in a way, trapped into a corner. It would be great to get some advice.

I'm in my late 20s, have always been legally blind and only recently have started using a cane and screen reader. Since I was a kid, my parents have been telling me I needed to become a  lawyer. I interned at a law firm during my Capstone in highschool and found the work generally enoyable, if dull.. family law. I went for a degree in political science, aiming to work for think tanks researching on East Asia. That did not work, as I graduated during COVID.


I spent several years working in back-office hospitality work (think buying the chemicals/equipment - logistics) and while I found the work enjoyable and predictable, it was a very small company in a rural-ish area, there ust wasnt any room for advancement. In 2023 I lost a lot of the remaining vision I had, and it has taken over a year to be deemed medically stable. In that time, I've ran three half marathons and decided to really buckle down on my writing and try to study or the LSAT. While I have always desired to see the world and leave the USA for a more socially understanding country (I have dual citizenship to an EU country), that doesn't feel very realistic right now.

So why law school? Social prestige, and money. Secondarily, I did read a lot of Han Fei in college while I studied Mandarin.

While law is in general a conservative field, blind lawyers are a known quantity. Even in an era of anti-""DEIA"" rhetoric, there's precedent for blind attorneys practicing. I wouldn't be aiming for Big Law, but a middle of the road firm where I am able to clear 75-100k a year, pay off my loans and get to live abroad for a while would be very nice. I would not attend law school without significant scholarship(s), as my parents are retired and my US family (who have F-you levels of money) are extremely distant.


While I have other skills - writing, audio engineering, I can speak Mandarin conversationally.. None of these skills have been able to earn me enough to keep my head above water. I'm not living off of SSDI, only be the grace of my parents am I avoiding homelessness. Law school would be 3 very intense years... but I'd come out with a shot to make it like everyone else.",UniqueUnseen,6,0.8100000023841858,17,1742406547,2025-03-19 17:49:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jf30qw/blind_late_20s_is_law_school_my_only_path_to_a/,3,2025

I work in nonprofit in a union position. It's not glamorous, but I get paid very well for what I do because it is a very large org. It is a respectable job, just lower on the food chain, if that makes sense.

I am in the running for a contract position that will only last 1.5 years, non-union. It would be incredible for my career and a step up from my current job. My pay would increase, though not a life changing amount. The head of that department also personally asked me to apply for it because I worked for them a few years ago in a different role, so I applied.

I am getting scared, though, about the job market, especially with cuts to federal funding for nonprofits, that I am thinking of pulling out and staying in my current job where i have job security. I'm worried about offending the  head of the department and essentially burning that bridge. I would love to accept this role, but under the current circumstances I am scared it is ultimately the wrong move to give up job security for a better but temporary job.

Current job: 
60k base as a Risk Analyst paid semi monthly

Matching 3% i put in 401k

New Job: 
62.5k Base as a Business Analyst paid Weekly
Remote
72 USD for health insurance & dental (taken out weekly)
Matching 0.10 cents for every dollar up to 1% in 401k

The current job is counter offering with a 75k base & a promotion. There is nothing I have against the current company, a few days I hate being there while other days I love that I solve their problems. Work Life Balance is cool as I leave my work in the office. However it only deals with Risk. I do not think I am at the risk of being replaced, as I am the only one who can so far do the task (SQL, Excel) and there is too much going on to try and interview another candidate. (This is from what I see, been here 4 years)

New job offer in my opinion is definitely not great, they initially only could do 60k to which I brought it up to 62.5k. The reason I am thinking of leaving for this is the growth, this is a consulting services company so I will be constantly exposed to their clients' data, which are huge known companies. So the experience is definitely there. (PowerBI, DAX, Hubspot)

1jezbpm,4 key steps to get promoted and advance your career,"I've been at my current company for 8 years, which, as a 31-year-old, gets me a lot of weird looks and stares since everyone believes you should constantly job-hop.

Staying at a company long-term has benefits, but today, I wanted to talk about how you can grow and level up. After speaking with the SVP of the engineering organization I am a part of, I was inspired and came up with the following framework. I hope to help some of you who want to do the same.

## Settle into your new role.

You're at this stage if you just joined the company or were recently promoted. At this stage, you should focus on the following:

‚Äì Learning the company culture
‚Äì Identifying key players
‚Äì Learning the expectations of the team and people higher up
‚Äì Building strong relationships

A common mistake I see at this stage is trying to stand out too early. I made this mistake when I attempted to take on a large project early in my career, thinking I could do it alone.

Fortunately, my manager then brought me back to reality and suggested I work on it with other engineers.

## Become effective and identify key impact areas.

Once you've settled into your new role, you'll start to notice areas where you can make a difference and have a real impact. This stage is all about research.

‚Äì Learn the company's key performance indicators and measure success against them
‚Äì Gather feedback from managers, executives, and your peers
‚Äì Begin creating and sharing a list of action items with your manager for feedback

A common mistake I see here is waiting for others to tell you what to do. You want to be proactive in finding opportunities and analyzing all the processes in place to see where you can improve.

## Develop and implement impactful solutions.

With your list in hand, it's time to do the thing.

‚Äì Communicate your efforts to leadership. This will help you introduce yourself and let the broader team know what you're working on.
‚Äì Over-deliver and craft something special. Be different.
‚Äì Align your actions with the business's needs.

Speak to executives or PMs and learn what the business needs to thrive.

A common mistake here is doing work in private. You want to be vocal about what you're working on and get out there as much as possible. Do demos, join meetings, and talk to people. All of this will move the needle in the right direction.

## Get promoted

Now, you have a case for yourself. You've done the work and have a lot to show for it.

‚Äì Advocate for yourself. Speak to your manager and say, ""I want a promotion because of...""
‚Äì Demonstrate your newfound leadership
‚Äì Express an interest in career growth

Remember, a promotion is not automatic, and if you do all this and still don't get promoted, it doesn't mean your efforts were put to waste.

All of these minor incremental improvements will pay off no matter what, and by the end of it, you will most likely be a more effective and efficient employee than when you started.

I'm in the process of getting back into the workforce after 2 years of unemployment,  and I don't know how I should address this gap on my resume, as well as in interviews. I have no problem being honest, but don't want to make potential employers uncomfortable/turn the interview into a therapy dump.

Although I can try to hide it on a resume by creating a functional resume, I know it will make employers leery of hiring me. To anyone who's ever been on a hiring panel, or who has experienced this situation,  any advice of how I can navigate this? Thanks in advance....

Ok, so what happened?

SHORT VERSION: 2019-2022 kicked the shit out of me- went through a complete upheaval in my personal life, leading to an intense bout of depression and burnout. 

THE LONG(ish!) VERSION (if you're bored,  or want a better understanding):
2022 kicked the shit out of me mentally. In the years leading up, I was going through the ringer in terms of personal upheaval: -left my common law partner of 8 years, had to move back with my parents in a less than ideal home situation
-watched my elderly father's health take a nosedive (in and out of hospital, the stress it had on my family)
-living the COVID life
-because of a toxic work environment, I decided to step down from my management position in order to work part-time while completing an online schooling program

All this mess came to a head in 2022.

After 7 years of working in a job that (despite the toxic work environment) I'd become rather enmeshed with, out of desperation I took the first job related to my new diploma.  This turned out to be another ""less than ideal"" job (poor management, toxic environment, company upheaval due to change in ownership). 

And then, a month into my new job, my Dad passed away. 

Around this time I got offered 2 part-time gigs (serving on Saturday nights, gardening on Sunday mornings, as bookends to a physically-intense 45 hour work week). I said ""sure, I can help you out!"", rather than ""no, I need to take care of myself and focus on my work-life balance"". To sum up the overlap: I was typing up my father's obituary at the same time I was taking my online smart-serve course so that I start serving, the same week as his funeral. 

I did not address the building mental-health and burnout I was experiencing. So when my seasonal jobs were all wrapped up by the end of the year....I was DONE. 

Thought I just needed a bit of rest. Then the following year, my mom had a health scare, and it fell on me to be her chauffer to medical appointments and driving (she lost her license for 6 months). I was busy being a parent to my parent and not taking care of myself.. and here we are.

If you made it this far...thanks for reading, and for any advice you might have.

She had already skipped out on an opportunity 2 years ago because I was set for a better role at my workplace, so I don't want to hold her back this time.

So if we end up relocating, do I move as a dropout and continue elsewhere, de some certifications in Cyber, or just get more experience before we move?

The issues I had were not a lot of contact with head office and the supervisor in my branch across the country was a lazy POS. He slept at his desk, cherry picked the emails that came in taking the big, easy orders and ignoring all the hard ones, didn't train the new guy or answer his questions, etc. The building was old and crappy and depressing. I said all this in my exit interview. In fact the POS went as far to send a disgusting email to people in our office the day I resigned. I was asked if I would stay if they got rid of him and I said no because it felt like he should be let go regardless. New job I was excited for. People are nice, building is new, love my space but the job is boring as hell. Very little to do, I am unhappy and feeling unmotivated and uninspired. Spoke to a friend from the old job who works in another office yesterday and she said they changed everything. Fired the guy, and had a meeting stating the changes coming because of what was said in an exit interview (mine). They are spiffing up the office too and have hired one new person and need another.

I have three job offers and need advice on which to choose.
	‚Ä¢	Company A (Current Employer, CPG Industry, $3.84B revenue in 2024)
	‚Ä¢	Recently laid off, must find a role by May 31.
	‚Ä¢	Two internal offers:
	1.	Financial Planning Analyst ‚Äì $69K base, 10% bonus (not guaranteed), 20 vacation days, hybrid (3 WFH). New role.
	2.	Financial Analyst (Supply Chain) ‚Äì Same pay/benefits, more established role, management recommended.
	‚Ä¢	Concern: Company has had layoffs and may not be stable long-term.
	‚Ä¢	Company B (New Employer, $55B revenue in 2024)
	‚Ä¢	Risk Operations Analyst ‚Äì $75K base (negotiating for $80K), 5% bonus, 17 vacation days, 12 holidays.
	‚Ä¢	More financially stable, better career growth, resume booster.
	‚Ä¢	Downside: 5 days in-office requirement.

torn between stability and career growth at Company B vs. keeping WFH flexibility at Company A (but with layoff risk). Given market conditions, I am leaning toward stability but struggling with the in-office requirement. I‚Äôm also thinking about job growth as well, the risk operations role seems like it‚Äôll be a mixture of handling clients and analysis. I want to be in more of an analytical role, so not sure if I take company B then move into an analytical later at that company. Or to just take the financial analyst role and have that risk again of being laid off potentially. company A is not doing that well. But I have also seen that I‚Äôve been able to move positions in company A not only due to the lay off.

1jew85e,Europe for UAE,"Hello all,
I‚Äôm a little lost over this decision and I require your insight to try to see the problem from an outside perspective.
I (32m) am currently in a well paid job that I don‚Äôt necessarily love in Europe. I still make decent money, the stability is great and progression seems close at the moment (unless the economy really sinks).
I was offered a job in the UAE that I would enjoy more in a reputable company. I would get a bit more money, housing allowance and education for my 2 children.
All fine up to this point.
The issue is my wife does not want to go with me and the solution would be for me to go alone and family would join in seasons. I am really conflicted about this, because I enjoy spending time with them and staying where I am would be the obvious choice. However, the dream job perspective makes this a really though decision for me. 
Is there any additional insight that I should consider?
Any advice?

1jevcjl,Negotiate the offer or take it as is?,"I‚Äôm currently in a job I really dislike at a large corporate company, making $5K more in base salary than my new offer, but with no bonuses. On top of that, there are signs of potential layoffs ahead, so I‚Äôve been actively looking to get out.

I just got an offer for a role that genuinely excites me at a much smaller, startup-style company that‚Äôs a dream role in an awesome industry. 

The new offer:
	‚Ä¢	Base salary is $5K lower than my current role; bonuses range from $5K to $15K, depending on company-wide goals.
	‚Ä¢	The company has hit their goals every year and usually exceeds them.
	‚Ä¢	Much more flexibility ‚Äì hybrid/remote-friendly work environment.
	‚Ä¢	Better career alignment ‚Äì this role is more in line with where I want to grow long-term.

My Dilemma:

The difference in base salary is about $208 per paycheck before taxes (~$150 after taxes), which isn‚Äôt a massive gap. However, I‚Äôm wondering if I should try to negotiate it up just to match my current earnings. I don‚Äôt want to seem greedy, especially since this is a small company where culture and fit matter.

Things to consider:
	‚Ä¢	The base salary gap is $5K, but the bonuses could make up for it (or more).
	‚Ä¢	The company is small, so I don‚Äôt know how much wiggle room they have.
	‚Ä¢	More flexibility and remote work options make this a better lifestyle fit.
	‚Ä¢	Stronger career alignment ‚Äì this job sets me up for the future, unlike my current one.
	‚Ä¢	Potential layoffs at my current company make leaving sooner a priority.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm already planning to take the job, but I don‚Äôt want to leave money on the table if negotiating is expected.

Would you negotiate for the $5K difference, or just take the offer and focus on the new opportunity?",ElChiChiPapa,1,1.0,4,1742385734,2025-03-19 12:02:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jevcjl/negotiate_the_offer_or_take_it_as_is/,3,2025

1jeu28u,"no raise in 2 years, what can I do?","I‚Äôve been in an in-house content team for almost 2 years as a junior designer (in a large company). The team has a senior designer in it. Around 10 months ago, I brought up the possibility of a raise or promotion with my line manager, and he kind of said neither yes or no‚Ä¶ He said because it‚Äôs a big company it‚Äôs more complicated and would have to go through HR and such, and that the other designer would basically need a promotion before me, so that I‚Äôd be moving into his role. He said that right now I‚Äôm earning the top pay for my current ‚Äòband‚Äô as a junior. (but also that he'd look into it potentially)

In the past 6 months, there‚Äôs been lots of redundancies and cost cutting, which included stopping the use of design/ad agencies. Therefore all of this work has gone to me and the other designer. Lately, the other designer has been in charge of some other work, so it‚Äôs just me doing all of the work that used to go to an agency. I‚Äôve been getting really frustrated lately because in every meeting the higher-ups bring up how much money they‚Äôre saving by using our in-house team instead of agencies like in the past. I remember recently they said they saved over ¬£500,000. And yet I haven‚Äôt seen any sort of raise or compensation in my whole time working there!!¬†

When I started here, the environment was fantastic with helpful and friendly coworkers. However, over the last 5 years, things have gradually went downhill since the launch of a major company-wide project that seems to have no end in sight.



During my initial period with the company, I was constantly growing professionally. However, for the past two years, I've felt stagnant. My work has become increasingly repetitive with the major company project, which frustrates me because I don't consider it genuine professional development. It's the same ""year of exp."" repeated again and again..



On the positive side, the job is stress free after working hours. My coworkers are great people to work with, however, I'm not surrounded by coworkers who are more senior than me that i can learn from/discuss decisions with.



Recently, i got a job offer from a F500 company, around 50% increase in pay with benefits, life changing if you ask me. After asking around, I've heard positive feedback about the organization. 



**I signed the offer, but every now and then I'm having second thoughts, What if I dislike the position? What if I under-perform in my new role? What if the stress level isn't justified by the salary?**



It's worth noting that I'm based in the MENA region, job mobility is limited, and finding comparable or better-paying opportunities than my current position is extremely hard.



On one hand, I feel this opportunity could be exactly what I need to break free from my fears. The extra money will allow me to accomplish life goals at a much faster rate.



On the other hand, I recognize the value in my current situation, a job that doesn't invade my personal time and colleagues who make the workplace enjoyable.

My district manger told me he didn‚Äôt understand where all this emotion was coming from since I‚Äôm ‚Äúseasoned in the day to day‚Äù.  I‚Äôve been faking it till I make it since day one. He knows how poorly our branch was run and how bad our numbers are so I‚Äôm kind of shocked he‚Äôs so shocked I finally broke. I literally taped a closed sign on the door and went home leaving the office empty. It‚Äôs a finance company were we have people who come in to make payments on loans and also have a pretty high level of delinquency so I‚Äôm supposed to make a ridiculous amount of calls daily and also work up loans and have appointments to close them. So it‚Äôs a big deal there was no one there. I feel so defeated and I don‚Äôt know how to handle my situation. I spent all day looking for a new job because I can‚Äôt just quit without screwing myself financially. I‚Äôve never worked for a company with such a bad work environment and I feel like I‚Äôm drowning. I‚Äôm definitely going to be spoken to by my district supervisor when I go in tomorrow and I‚Äôm unsure of how to approach the conversation. He‚Äôs always asked for complete brutal honesty but corporate brutal honesty doesn‚Äôt have the same definition. Ive had exactly zero positive experiences here.

1jepzl7,Work fight,"So I work at a hotel as a food and beverage assistant and have been there about 4 months. Yesterday I‚Äôm working in the kitchen running the food out, towards the end of my shift the other f&b members start clearing out our sections for the day, this is where the issue arises. There is this one colleague who talks and behaves like a supervisor/ manager always rude and bossy to all other staff members. He is taking the rubbish from his section out and he‚Äôs meant to put it outside in the bins, but he is so lazy even whilst being so bossy, he brings it into the kitchen and just dumps it with the kitchen porters rubbish, didn‚Äôt bother asking if he could take it for him just chucked it. KP gets annoyed at him because he‚Äôs done this multiple times and he‚Äôs not allowed to so they start arguing, also this KP is new and from east Asia so his English is very poor. The bossy staff member, who I will refer to as Alex for now, starts shouting louder and louder and overwhelming the KP because he can‚Äôt speak English proper. I‚Äôm in the kitchen I‚Äôve head about this going on before but now I‚Äôve seen it, so I start shouting at Alex calling him out for it, he‚Äôs already using vulgar language so I use it too, it goes as a back and forth now then he approaches me trying to intimidate me, I‚Äôm 19 and taller than this guy so I walk closer to him myself and ask what he‚Äôs gna do to me, he puts his hands near my face and I slap it away, he does it again and I slap it even harder. He walks out the kitchen I go back to working cool, I go outside after to put the cutlery in their sections and he‚Äôs there next to the manger, not saying anything he‚Äôs just there, and he‚Äôs giving me a dirty look so I tell him ‚Äòwhat are you looking at‚Äô etc manager does it down and thinks little of it. I go back into the kitchen, my back is to the door and he runs through the door immediately swinging punches at me. I dodge every single punch grab him and start pushing him away from me because I know if I punch him back I‚Äôll get in deep shit regardless if he started it. I‚Äôm holding my own pushing him away whilst still dodging, then people come inside and separate us. I explain the situation to all senior members of staff and they all understand he is in the wrong and I did nothing wrong. Today I go in for a meeting at work, and on the way my friend on shift told me Alex is working, whilst my shift got canceled which is insane. Anyways the director of F&B essentially is saying it‚Äôs my fault that this happened because of my vulgar language that escalated the situation which led to him punching me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so baffled, all I did was try helping a friend out and now I‚Äôm the one in deep shit. I think it‚Äôs fine though my brother is a lawyer and has told me to just wait and let them finish their investigation but if I am the one who suffers out of this situation then we will be taking this to court because seriously wtf. Can I just get others opinions and thoughts be brutally honest about this. Oh yeah and they started talking about you have to inform a manager etc about him not take it into your own hands, this I found hilarious because this workplace is known for managers not giving a toss. And also this Alex guy is like 2/3 times my age.

1jep21z,I got 3 job offers which one should I choose?,"Hi!

TLDR:

I have three job offers and need advice on which to choose.
	‚Ä¢	Company A (Current Employer, CPG Industry, $3.84B revenue in 2024)
	‚Ä¢	Recently laid off, must find a role by May 31.
	‚Ä¢	Two internal offers:
	1.	Financial Planning Analyst ‚Äì $69K base, 10% bonus (not guaranteed), 20 vacation days, hybrid (3 WFH). New role.
	2.	Financial Analyst (Supply Chain) ‚Äì Same pay/benefits, more established role, management recommended.
	‚Ä¢	Concern: Company has had layoffs and may not be stable long-term.
	‚Ä¢	Company B (New Employer, $55B revenue in 2024)
	‚Ä¢	Risk Operations Analyst ‚Äì $75K base (negotiating for $80K), 5% bonus, 17 vacation days, 12 holidays.
	‚Ä¢	More financially stable, better career growth, resume booster.
	‚Ä¢	Downside: 5 days in-office requirement.

torn between stability and career growth at Company B vs. keeping WFH flexibility at Company A (but with layoff risk). Given market conditions, I am leaning toward stability but struggling with the in-office requirement.



So I got offered two positions for my company that I am currently working (Company A)for. Here is some back story for Company A. Company A is part of the CPG industry and I was just laid off from my current role and have until May 31st to find a job. Company A had 3.84 billion in revenue in 2024. During that time management has been helpful in recommending me to jobs currently within my company. I currently make 63k with 5% bonus in my role. Here are the offer details for both roles and some additional details. 

Financial Planning Analyst: 69k base 10% bonus bringing it to 75,900 IF I get 10%. The 10% bonus is not guaranteed. 20 vacation days Hybrid schedule 3 WFH 2 in office. It is a new position within the company.

Financial Analyst for supply chain: same pay as above and same wfh days. More established position. Management recommended me for this position. 


Now I‚Äôm skeptical about working for my company again. Company is not doing that well and already had lay offs, so it is possible could happen again. I got another offer at a different company (Company B). 

Company B is a big company had 55 billion in revenue for 2024. They offered me a position today. Now I‚Äôm interested in this company because it seems more stable. The company is financially healthy. Room for growth and also a resume booster. Please see offer details below. 

Risk Operations Analyst: 75k base 5% bonus brining total to 78,750. 17 vacation days 12 company holidays I am also trying to negotiate to 80k base and I am just waiting to hear back. They require 5 days in office which personally is little bit of a bummer.  

I‚Äôm really am thankful to have options I know the market is tough right now, but just want some advice on which to choose? Im hoping I get details regarding my counter, but I‚Äôm not sure if to just do the 5 days in office in Company B since it is stable and it could possibly open more opportunities within the company. Or to stay where I‚Äôm at and keep my wfh days with company A, but then there is a risk that the company could do more lay offs since business is not doing too well. I really enjoy my wfh days, but I know companies are switching into office lately. Any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you in advance.

1jeoiy3,Rant: Wasting my life,"I am 28 years old and unemployed. My life feels like a joke as i am currently very lost and don't know what to do.

I studied maths and mechanical engineering at the university, and ended up with 2 master degrees. The reason being, these were the best possible fields that could describe me. With Math, i could understand everything and with mechanical engineering, i can build everything. 

While studying i work did internship and vatious working student jobs providing me with a solid 4 years of ecperience in Frontend/Backend/Datascience/Embedded Systems/Machine Learning.

At the end of 2022, i took out of curiousity a job in embedded systems development. As i really liked building devices, this would also be a good change from my abstract studies in Maths.

I worked like crazy at the work, reaching an average of 10 hours of daily work. I was also such a good dev that people would sit down and study my code. This would however create jealousy! My colleagues were starting to attack me, bully me and find the smallest of issues to complain to me. It also didn't help that i was only 26/27 years old. Every single time, i would defend myself and manage to win arguments. Well last year my team lead who was also the chief of department started bullying me. Everything i was doing was wrong! Fixed this bug? Well you did it poorly and should have noticed it sooner. Added this feature? Why! Noone needs it (despite the fact that there is a ticket for it). Create a ticket to fix issues? Only MY tickets and merge requests would get rejected for no reason, even when the work directly came from the scrum master. 

I got pissed off and had noone to complain to. At least if the money is ok, i don't mind what happens to my work as long as they pay me fairly. Well i was paid below the industry standard. Just like someone with a bachelor degree with 0 experience. I asked my team lead to increase my salary, he told me: ""What you are earning is ok for your age"". What the heck? Since when are people getting payed by their age? All this culminated in my leaving the company.

Ok. I have two masters degrees, 4 years experience as working student, 2 years full time. What could go wrong? Well i have been applying for the last 6 months and nothing! The worse, all the jobs that replied have been embedded systems jobs. I am however trying to switch to machine learning or data science. 

It has been 4 months been unemployed and i am feeling like shit. It feels like i am been punished for something i have never done. All these have turned me into a bitter person, as i realize politeness, respect, consideration and hard work only lead to jealousy and resentment.

Don't know what to do currently but keep applying for work and hope i don't starve to death. ",PuzzleheadedTune1366,3,1.0,5,1742356741,2025-03-19 03:59:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jeoiy3/rant_wasting_my_life/,3,2025

(STEM Roles),"So I started Job hunting since September (I am a Data Scientist with 3y of exp) and I've been able to land an interview at a rate of 1 or two a month. I've received interest from 8 companies, 6 of which I actually had interviews with. 2 were technical assessments for roles I realized weren't good for me so I knew I was going to fail and wasn't bothered. 6 of these I actually tried for. Two of these companies were FAANG level companies, 1 was the biggest financial company in the world, and the others were respectable large companies. All of these roles had really good pay(3-4 times what I'm getting paid now). But I keep failing the interviews. I mention these facts not to brag, but to show how bad it feels to get rejected from these companies. I know others would kill to interview at these companies and I blew it multiple times.

My first interview was one of my best ones, but i had just mispoken on an ML concept and received 1 pass and 1 fail in a technical concepts and coding round (this was like the 5th interview and the hardest part of the process). There was one more interview if I passed this round. Their feedback mentioned my blunder, which I accepted (it was my first interview).

My second I was my coding questions went much slower than I would have liked, but I completed them. Then I completely messed up on the explanation of an ML concept that I needed more practice on, panicked, and completely gave a BS answer (which doesn't work talking to Subject matter experts). I knew it was over after I answered the question. If I hadn't panicked an rushed into the answer, I might have passed the interview.

Third was at my Dream FAANG company, and I did pretty good for preparation, but when I got to the onsite rounds, both my interviewers failed me. I thought I did pretty good, but I also knew there was room for improvement. Got no feedback which sucked.

4th I probably should have taken more seriously. It would be a dream company for some, but just wasn't a dream company for me. Also, they were taking me through a SWE interviewing process before branching me out to Data Science which I didn't like since I didn't learn all the things SWE have learned in school yet. So I didn't really try, but regretted it since the questions were ones I could have pulled off if I studied as hard as I did for the others.

5th I was interviewed by the head of Data Science at a FAANG company. He seemed to like me a lot and thought my resume and experience was impressive. He was by far the most accomplished person who has interviewed me with 30 years of DS experience, and yet was the least intimidating person I interviewed with. I think I could have gotten along well with him if we worked together. He was able to stump me a couple of times, although I realized one of my explanations for a concept I hail mary'd was actually correct. I did give him some good explanations on a few hard ML concepts though, so that is something.

6th time, I was interviewed by a decent company that would have been great for me since the work is similar to what I do now. However, they asked me to code K-means from scratch and I was flustered and couldn't bring myself to completeing a function for it. It's techinically not a hard algorithm to create or implement, but it's just not something I can do yet for the first time without practice during an interview. I gave up and told them I could not do it. They tried to walk me through it after I explained how the algorithm worked, but I was just stressed out because I felt like it was over.

**TLDR:**  
How can I deal with these rejections? How can I improve? These interviews have been affecting me at work and irl. I've noticed I've been depressed, and not as productive, especially since the beginning of this year. There is a lot in my life that depends on when I get my next job, and it is just depressing since I feel like my life is on hold until I'm finally able to land this new job. It's a crummy situation and I have been questioning whether I am even good enough to be a data scientist since I became one through an internship. I get underpaid severely, and just don't have options to move forward in my life without making at least another 25-30% more(which would take me another 1-2 years at my company at best), and these companies are teasing 200-400% salary increases. It sucks. Especially when people ask me how I'm getting interviews at all due to how bad the market is. Makes me feel like I don't deserve the interviews or that I am taking them for granted some how...",FellowZellow,1,1.0,1,1742345249,2025-03-19 00:47:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jekwfk/how_do_i_deal_with_failing_so_many_interviews_at/,3,2025

Now with that being said they‚Äôre offering me a role where I am the representative that shows face to the client locally while the rest of the team supports them remotely. If I understand them correctly, I will be in the office four days a week. The commute would be one hour and 45 minutes due to the rush-hour traffic of that area.

As of right now, I have a Plan B to join the heavy equipment union here locally  it would require some travel but as of right now using my VA benefits, I would start out in the union at a little over $40 an hour. The only downside is I would sometimes be driving over two hours away for work. The benefits are the opportunity for overtime would be nonstop pretty much.

1jejxat,Are any of these majors worth pursuing?,"21 years old, took a break from college for a bit, and I'm unsure of what I want to do as a career. I'm currently studying Business at a two-year. I'm on track to graduate this semester, and my intentions were to transfer to a four-year and earn a B.S. in Accounting, which I know is a stable career with the potential to earn six figures, but Accounting isn't really my passion.

I've taken Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting as part of my program, and the material was somewhat of a chore to get through, not in the sense that it was complex/difficult, just that the material didn't really appeal to me. I don't have a strong dislike for Accounting or anything, so it's still on the table.

I am interested in life sciences such as environmental science and zoology, and also social sciences like psychology and sociology. I've had political science recommended to me, as well, but I haven't done much research on it yet. 

I find all of these majors interesting, and I am passionate about climate change, wildlife conservation, helping people and animals, etc, but I'm not sure if any of them are actually worth pursuing. With psychology in particular, it seems you need a master's degree for it to be worth it if you want to work in that field (if I did, I would be an LPC), and I'm not sure if I could do another four years of school, mostly for cost-related reasons. 

I have considered nursing and rad tech as well, which I know are also stable careers that pay well in the Healthcare sector. If I did pursue nursing, it would be in a hospital setting. I'm going to try to get some volunteer experience at a hospital to see if I could tolerate working in that setting. Nurses, do you get used to the aggressive patients and dealing with bodily fluids? 

Regardless, can anyone offer some insight on these majors, (especially if you have experience in the aforementioned fields)? 

**TL;DR, currently studying Business, and my original intention was to pursue an Accounting degree afterwards. Not very passionate about it, but it's not completely off the table yet. Interested in environmental science, zoology, psychology, sociology, and PoliSci(?). Maybe nursing or rad tech. Looking for some insight on these careers.**",bucksln6ix,1,1.0,0,1742342461,2025-03-19 00:01:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jejxat/are_any_of_these_majors_worth_pursuing/,3,2025
1jejh3t,Seeking advice on delaying a job offer while awaiting other interviews.,"Hi all,

I have been job hunting consistently for the past 2 months. I finally received an offer from Company A on Monday. When asked when they would need an answer by, they informed me they would want an answer no later than Thursday (two days from now). However I also interviewed for another similar position at Company B on Monday which I felt went well, and was told that I would be contacted next week for another interview should they decide to move forward with my application.

Company B's position is much more desirable - closer to home, higher pay, small local business, full benefits, paid time off, and holidays off. Company A only offers health insurance and no PTO for the first year of employment, but they also provide yearly raises and there are ample opportunities for growth and promotions. Plus, it's a very small office (only 3 other people) and the folks there are very warm, welcoming, and laid back, which is a huge plus for me.

My current dilemma is that I want to wait and see if I get called in for a second interview with Company B, but knowing that it might take them a week to get back to me puts me in the predicament of deciding if I accept the offer from Company A now. Company A's operating hours are the same as Company B's, so there would be no way I could make time to go in for an interview at Company B.

I have been considering calling the HR office of Company A and asking if they would be willing to negotiate additional time to consider, but I of course don't want to mention that it's due to waiting on other opportunities because then they might rescind their offer, and if Company B weren't to follow through, I'd basically be back at square one in my job hunting process. But I have a bird in the hand now and I worry that delaying too long, or asking for too much time to consider, would make me lose it.

I'm looking for some guidance from folks who have been in this position, as this isn't a problem I've faced before and I'm unsure how to proceed. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

1jej86p,How do I justify not sharing a very useful tool I developed with my team since I am not being promoted?,"Throwaway since some of these details are very identifying. I'm in a bit of a professional predicament and need some sage guidance. Sorry this is so long. 

I (Annie) was hired into my current unit in early 2024. I have three years experience in my title, ten years with our company. My co-worker (Poppy) has been with my current unit for four years, and has been at the same title level as myself for two years. Co-worker (Rose) is brand new to our job. Poppy and Rose are friends.

Several months ago, our team's manager left the department suddenly, and since then, we've had other team members leave, as well. Our team is currently at 50% staffing. When this happened, I took on 200% of the work that the other team members absorbed due to my general level of experience, and so that Poppy could start training Rose on a daily basis. 

I have worked 60 hour weeks since our manager left (I am salaried). I canceled every single one of my requested days off over the holidays to make sure that work was covered, so that other team members could take their holidays. 

Today, I received the news that my co-worker Poppy is getting the promotion that I have been working for since I was hired by this unit. The justification is that she has been with the unit longer, and that she took over training Rose, which shows ""increased levels of responsibility"". 

My feelings are that Poppy was only able to take over Rose's training because I shouldered a massive workload increase to allow her to have time for that, meaning that her promotion was earned through my sweat and (literal) tears. I was told that I'd be able to be promoted within a year after I took over training staff - which I have previous experience with, but cannot possibly do with my current workload.

The dilemma: I am a dashboard expert. Our unit currently uses very outdated reporting and hand-entry methods to manage our projects. I have developed a new automated dashboard (I worked on it on weekends and during my free time) that will make some of our work take a fraction of the time it takes us currently - think 6-7 business days of work reduced to 1-2 for each team member, per month. I have started using the dashboard with some of my own projects.

The team is asking me to share the dashboard with them. So far I have not done so, as I told them I needed to test the dashboard with a variety of real-life situations to ensure that it performed as expected.

However, not to be a bitter b\*tch, but since I'm not being promoted, and since I feel that my time, generosity, and skills have been taken advantage of and are not being rewarded, I don't want to share the new dashboard with the team. Selfish? Perhaps. However, this team and my manager have been selfish and have taken advantage of my generosity for months.

There is a 0% chance they could figure out how to use the dashboard without me, as it operates based on custom reports that I have created and I have not shared access to those reports. None of my team has advanced enough skills to replicate these reports. 

So... How do I justify (in an email) my decision to not share a ""work life""-changing tool that I developed because I am not being promoted, without coming off like a total asshole? Every email I write sounds pretty terrible. I do plan on continuing to use the dashboard for myself, as it is making my own excessive workload somewhat more manageable. 

If it matters, I am not at-will and I cannot be fired. My job is also in demand, and I do have high mobility within this company, though the particular promotion opportunity I want is slightly less common.

If you've made it this far, I appreciate you. I am very burned out, and this news today feels like the final blow to my professional mental health.",HaveBeenMustEverBe,40,0.8500000238418579,132,1742340536,2025-03-18 23:28:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jej86p/how_do_i_justify_not_sharing_a_very_useful_tool_i/,3,2025

1jeix6r,"Genuinely, what career is right for me?","I feel like there‚Äôs no job/career out there that‚Äôs right for me. I‚Äôve done countless searches on Reddit and the internet about what types of roles I might fit into based on my interests and knowledge. Nothing seems to stick.

Let me start out by saying I did go to college and get a degree in something. What I went for was graphic design, as art is actually my one passion in life and graphic design was the closest career to it. I was actually so excited for the future of my career, I couldn‚Äôt wait to work as a graphic designer. Then I graduated and couldn‚Äôt get a job in the field for shit! I‚Äôve really tried everything, but the market for graphic design has just been terrible. I thought about marketing as another option, but turns out that‚Äôs also a very oversaturated field right now. Plus I don‚Äôt have skills in marketing (only design) so I don‚Äôt know how likely it is for me to be hired for that type of role.

So here I am with a degree in graphic design, can‚Äôt find a job in my field, and am unsure what else I can do with it. I‚Äôm also very introverted and have ADHD and social anxiety, so I hate any job that involves too much social interaction. So anything customer service or sales is a weak spot for me.. Well, let‚Äôs just go down the list.

‚Ä¢Healthcare? Couldn‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs not my thing, not passionate about it, not good at science, couldn‚Äôt go back to school for it.
‚Ä¢Teacher? Definitely not my style either. Too much social interaction, and dealing with kids. Also just dont think I‚Äôd be good at it.
‚Ä¢Engineering? Can‚Äôt wrap my brain around any of those concepts. I‚Äôm also not going back to school for it.
‚Ä¢Anything math related? I‚Äôm actually pretty good at math, but I don‚Äôt like it. I also can‚Äôt solve math without an example to go off of. 
‚Ä¢Trades? I cannot do physical labor.. also none of them really interest me.
‚Ä¢Simple office job like an administrative assistant? Currently working as that and I hate it because i‚Äôm just doing a bunch of little tasks for another person when I want to have my own position with my own responsibilities, I also am extremely bored in this type of role.

I‚Äôm not sure what other industries i‚Äôm missing.. i‚Äôm just doing this off the top of my head, but yeah really my only interest is graphic design as it‚Äôs currently going to shit! So what am I supposed to do instead?? I feel so lost, i literally hate my job and am trying to apply to other jobs but don‚Äôt even know what to apply to. I‚Äôm still trying for graphic design, but I don‚Äôt have much hope for it. As i‚Äôm also desperate to leave my current job, I can‚Äôt sit here and wait around for the perfect design opportunity to show up either. I wish there were other options for me.. any advice?

1jegpet,What should I do if I hate coding but like corporate culture?,"A little background about myself
I am a 24 year female who graduated in 2024 with a degree in btech CSE from IGDTUW.

Since always I was into physics and maths and that got me into this jee rat race. My teenage dream was to become a scientist in ISRO but my rank was way low to get myself admitted into any reputed research college .

I left behind my dream of being a scientist and went with the most attractive and promising dream , a developer.

I have never coded earlier so I was overconfident of my capabilities and got into CSE.

Since then, I have been suffering. People told me that coding is an acquired taste and once I start working I will start liking it . But it does make me feel dyslexic . I cry silently and get panic attacks whenever I have to deal with coding which now I have to do a lot because I m working as a software developer albeit its only 6 months but they sure feel like dreadful years of torture.

But what I realised lately that I kind of like corporate culture of 9-5 , meetings, lunch breaks and having a scheduled life which includes everything.

What I utterly dislike is coding. And no dont get me wrong, I m a hard-worker but coding drains the all of me. 

I m sorry for this long paragraph but I had to share my side before merely posting a question.

What I feel is I need your advice to what switch should I make so as my pay is similar(my salary rn is 15-20 lpa), the corporate culture of a MNC is there but no coding is involved.

I m thinking of doing MBA but I dont know what scope does that have and if that aligns with my needs? (I have always been good in maths and economics)

1jefsyp,May have made the wrong move (DA>MDM)?,"About a month ago I got onboarded to my new role as Master Data Specialist for a ‚Äùbig‚Äù company (2000+ people), the company is seems great and may offer room for career development further down the line. Ive previously worked as a data analyst for a smaller tech company (200 people) and enjoyd doing analysis, working mainly in big query and qlik with visualisations and creating some data models, working a lot with stakeholders, storytelling etc. which I enjoyed a lot and since it was a smaller tech company things moved fast.

In my new role however Im working exclusively with Salesforce (SF) and SF data, something thats new to me (I‚Äôve worked with SF data before in big query tables  to some extent but not in the actual platform) and the idea is that my new responsibility is to own the SF customer data which is extremely messy with 100+ objects and even more fields where some are decades old but have not been depreciated and manage access and map dependencies etc. Basically all of their customer data is stored in SF and not a DW.

Ive realised (correct me if Im wrong) that MDM is almost exclusively about data governnance & quality which seems extremely boring to me, not something I would want to further my career in and would probably not benefit me in terms of salary development either. I feel like my new manager finally found someone that was willing to come clean up a mess that has been building up for years and was very happy about onboarding me.

The reason I took the job was that I strive to be a product owner/manager some day and I felt to some extent that my job as a DA had reached a point to where I needed to develop more technical skills (learn python for ex. Im good with SQL and Excel) to stay competetive or pivot in that role and it was hard to move in to product development without experience and this new role entailed more ownership but perhaps in the wrong context. So Im not sure the trade off is worth it, since working with this SF data and learning the new processes of data generation in SF and what fields or objects relate to eachother will take a lot of time (prob a year) and honestly its depressing to work with since the quality is so bad and confusing and to me a bit hard to understand the relationships etc. and the ownership of data governance does not really appeal to me either.

So the question is do I stay and try and stick it out for maybe a 6-12 months or try and move back into analytics in a different company as a DA or perhaps a BA? Has anyone made a similar move to MDM and could tell me about their experience?

Sorry for the long text, feeling a bit overwhelmed and like my career may have took a turn in the wrong direction.",kennypowersballs,1,1.0,2,1742331627,2025-03-18 21:00:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jefsyp/may_have_made_the_wrong_move_damdm/,3,2025
1jeflr4,Is there a place in radiology for techs to work mainly on analysing imaging without major physical strain?,"Hi,

english is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes!

I posted about a year ago in r/radilogy about me spending time on understanding my own scans:   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/1ai7ki0/bored\_because\_waiting\_for\_appointment\_with\_ortho/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiology/comments/1ai7ki0/bored_because_waiting_for_appointment_with_ortho/)

Turns out I was right, there where undiagnosed issues that nobody picked up on.  
  
*(clay-shoveler fracture that caused rupture of my ligamentum supraspinale and the rhomboid minor on the right side, leading to a dislocation of the fragment, as well as C7 slipping to the front and Th1 rotating to the left resulting in an assymmetric deformation of my upper back with onsetting scoliosis at the endvertex in the upper lumbar region)*  
  
I actually managed to teach myself enough within a few months to proof radiologists, pain therapists, neurologists and orthopeds across three Hospitals wrong and managed to get my orthopedic surgeon to perform a surgery that isn't on the list of officialy indicated procedures, luckily he did an incredible job and my situation is way better now.  
*(Btw I'm in a country where it's really hard to get any payout for medicinal malpractice, so I don't really care much about the legal part of that whole odysee, hope nobody feels attacked for how I phrased that, but I had to fight hard to get treatment and I'm a little bit proud that I managed to do so, no offense to any of the above)*

Anyway, multiple of those doctors gave me a lot of praise about both my ability to analyse my situation, my CT and MRI scans as well as how I communicated about my findings both verbally and by digital visualisation.  
  
I've even had some of them asking me if I wouldn't consider   
a career in radiology as they are quite short of personnel  
and I already got the OK from a few to use them as references when applying to clinics.

Now, due to neglect in childhood, I never managed to get any higher education after Highschool and I'm already close to 40 years old, so the job that would make most sense considering my situation would be as a technician.  
  
I went through the necessary tests to get access to the corresponding studies and did so with 96%.

The problems started when I tried applying for a position for the clinical part of the studies, I was told   
(quite harshly) that if I had issues with my back, radiology technician wouldn't be the right job as I would need to be able to assist in patient transport which means physical strain.

And further, I'm mostly interested in analysing Xrays, CTs and MRIs as I seem to have a natural talent for  
visualisazing of anatomy and pattern recognition in that matter and while I don't mind working with patients,  
what really tickles me is hunting for clues on what is relevant for the case at hand and employing my abilities   
in reading, editing and communicating imaging results in a way that helps doctors make well differentiated  
decisions.

Now I understand that the actual diagnosis always has to be made by a doctor,  
but I was wondering if it is possible for a technician to work like what I described  
or if it really is impossible to work in the field if I'm not able to do heavy physical lifting?

I'll probably be supported by invalidity insurance in getting into a new job, as I used to work  
as a machinist so far and won't be able to return due to the physical burden,  
so financing wouldn't really be a huge problem either.

If there's any info or tips you can offer I would be really grateful, I just didn't want to press any further in applying for internships before trying to gain better understanding of what even is possible.

I'll also crosspost this to the career thread in r/radiology, but thought this might be the sub that is actually meant for that kind of question.  
  
Also, I'm located in switzerland.

1jef8gv,Very lost biomedical engineer,"I'm a sophomore biomedical engineering major at a top 10 engineering school. In hindsight I should've gone with MechE or ECE but I didn't really have anyone guiding me when I was choosing majors as I'm first gen and I thought I might be pre med. 

My freshman year was horrible for personal reasons and I didn't really do much school wise but study abroad in Spain, I taught engineering to kids in Mexico, and competed in a design competition. Over the summer I had an internship at a local non-profit as a data scientist and took some summer classes. Fall of my sophomore year I did research in paintable electrodes and my job was more on the recipe side so like chemical stuff. And then this spring I got a job at a hospital and took a bunch of pre med classes that tanked my GPA (3.8>3.6 prob lower), tutored foster kids, and studied for the MCAT. I took a break from research.

Now I want to quit my job at the hospital because I realized I don't want to work 12 hour shifts every weekend and I don't want this to be my life until its halfway over. I realized that I want to live a minimal stress life with as much remote work and traveling as possible. I know that's like duh you and everyone else but I genuinely thought I wanted to work in healthcare for the altruism of it.

I got two classes into a computer science minor and one class into a business minor until I realized it wasn't worth. But I will say we have maybe the best CS and Business schools in the nation so maybe it would be idk y'all tell me.

Also I struggled with my premed classes the most. Like my engineering classes I study the material for like an hour per week and get As but the pre med classes where you have to memorize a bunch of stuff I study for 24+ hours and I still don't even pass sometimes. But those are my most interesting classes. I feel like CS and engineering are boring.

So idk wtf to do I have no summer plans except studying abroad in Japan for a month and taking summer classes. I applied for internships but nobody wanted me except I got two interviews for JP Morgan for business tech roles that I randomly applied to but ultimately was rejected.

Other things I put on my resume were like academic projects like building an EKG from scratch. And also I should mention I got into this SEO thing so maybe I'll do business idk. And also I'm a chair for one of the biggest engineering orgs at my uni. 

Ik that was a lot and probably hard to read but imagine how I feel. I feel like I'm doing a little bit of everything and I'm not really super interested AND good at one thing. So idk what should I focus on?? I got a scholarship that covers the total COA for my bachelors but I still have GI bill so I'm planning for another 4 years of schooling after this. What do y'all think?? Consulting?? AI??? How would I get into those things ASAP? I need an internship for junior summer and I gotta start applying now. I feel like that internship will decide my fate.",Maleficent_Shine_138,1,1.0,0,1742330228,2025-03-18 20:37:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jef8gv/very_lost_biomedical_engineer/,3,2025

All that said, how do I explain that to a potential employer in an interview? Or if they don't ask about the career change specifically, how do I answer the, ""Why do you want this job?""

1jed10o,"Upskilling from Carpentry, should I be an Electrician or Draftsman?","Hello! I am a Carpenter in NZ, I have been a carpenter for around a decade now and am pretty over it. I have realized that it isn't for me as my body is always sore, the liability of overseeing all build aspects and managing subtrades is stressful, the system for compliance in NZ is messy and inconsistent, and I find my interest and engagement on long projects fading. I also don't like that I have to cart around a van full of tools and need a vehicle that costs the earth to run just because I need to tow heavy materials around daily. 

I began study as a draftsman (architectural technologist) however paused study after the first block due to uncertainty that this was what I would actually like to do. I discovered it is heavily focused on legislation and compliance, and less on the design aspect that I wanted to upskill on. I think drafting would be great when I am older and looking to work remotely or work part time for myself, however, I don't know if it is for me now. I ultimately would like to be able to travel with my work, and be out of a physically demanding job. The draw to Drafting was the vision to work from home designing sustainable relocatable homes that perform well. These are important values of mine. 

I have wondered about becoming an electrician, the appeals are job variety, higher pay for less responsibility (no being the main contractor), far less large tools required, no towing heavy materials, and shorter jobs. I am very good at working alone, and feel that I would excel as a sole contractor. Thing is, I would be taking a pay cut to retrain and would have to be an employee again. I like the idea of specialising in renewable energy, or finding ways to encourage sustainable energy use. 

I'd love to hear any and all thoughts on this, if anyone has perspectives to share that would be amazing.

I can't believe I am saying this because I obviously I knew these things ahead of time but didn't realize how I would feel about it until living it. I really don't like the atmosphere in the school. It is very judgmental. I get along with co-workers but I just don't care about all of the same things they do. I am very envious of positions in the health care field where you can work 3 12's or 4 10's. Especially with having babies. I know once my kids are school age it would be beneficial, but right now it feels like I am away from them so much. There isn't any part time options and definitely none that would pay well enough. I have a masters in special ed and it feels like such a waste if I completely changed fields but I am really thinking about it.

  
I was considering radiology. It's decent pay and more flexible scheduling. I also thought about tutoring next year and maybe cleaning on the side just for a year or two while my kids aren't in school yet.

I‚Äôm very lost right now, not sure what to do.

I‚Äôm aware some stuff is more realistic than other stuff, just naming stuff that I‚Äôm interested in so you guys can get an idea of what I like. 

I‚Äôm interested in animals (specifically taking care of them), office work (I really enjoy doing clerical tasks, HR interests me too), criminal justice, fashion (not so much the design aspect, but more so the logistics of fashion brands or fashion journalism), paralegal, beauty, graphic design, marketing, library work, archives, law enforcement and social work.

1je2aej,Struggling to Pass IT Job Interviews? Here‚Äôs What Helped Me,"Hey everyone,



I know how frustrating it can be to break into IT when you get stuck at the phone screen or entry-level interviews. I was in the same spot a few years ago‚Äîsending out resumes, getting rejection emails, and freezing up on technical questions.



Through trial and error, I finally figured out:

How to answer phone screen questions even when I didn't know everything



 How to talk about my home lab and certs like real-world experience

 Why most people fail phone screens (and what to do instead)

Now that I work in IT, I want to share what I learned so others don't struggle as much. What are your biggest struggles with interviews if you're trying to land Help Desk, IT Support, or Junior Network Tech roles?

1je1v9h,State vs University job,"Hi all, I'm very conflicted on next steps here and was wanting to get some input from others. I recently started a state job, and to be honest it is perfect for me. The issue is it is grant-funded and at a HHS agency. That feels pretty unsafe/precarious. I got an offer for a position at a university, which I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like as much, same salary, same benefits, but also largely funded by a grant.

I am essentially just trying to decide which of these jobs has a better shot at remaining stable given the political issues with the federal government. I understand going private would be ideal, but I am pursuing PSLF for a high amount of student loans and it is the most financially feasible option for me.

1je1uqw,I can't find an engineering job,"A year ago I graduated with a master's degree in mechanical engineering and started looking for a job. I joined a company with a very toxic culture but I decided to stay for a year because ‚Äúit feels bad to leave before a year.‚Äù 
Three months ago I searched again for a new job on LinkedIn and I haven't had any luck. I have had two final offers for temporary jobs that I couldn't make ends meet with and that I turned down. However, most of the time they don't even call me after sending my CV. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I know that many companies don't care, but I have had the second best record of my career and I have won an award for my TFM. I am seeing many of my colleagues changing after two weeks and I can't stop wondering how ugly this problem is.

1je1c56,Job aligned with studies or job with better pay?,"I would like advice on my current job opportunities. I am almost 50% done with a bachelor's degree. I have kids and my decision affects my family.

  
I already accepted an offer for a job that is somewhat aligned with my studies. I'm supposed to start in one month. It's only a 6-month contract with potential for an extension or direct hire. The company is one of the biggest companies in the industry associated with my studies. They also have frequent layoffs, so it's highly competitive. The pay is slightly better than at my last job but nothing spectacular. However, I'm excited about the job and I feel like I would learn relevant skills and be motivated towards my future career as a result. It also feels like a foot in the door. This would be my second job in this industry (the last one also had a limited contract that was extended only half a year).

In the last few months, out of economic desperation, I applied to a lot of jobs that weren't exactly my preference.  

I was just invited to the next step in the application process for a better-paid job that doesn't require much experience and isn't likely to help me in my career. I would also likely work different shifts that would mess up my sleep habits and probably make studying more difficult. Also, it's likely to have a psychological toll on me because of the nature of the work. However, the pay would be almost twice as much as the job I am supposed to start. If I succeed, it would likely be a more stable job. I'm going to submit the questionnaire for the next step in the application process either way but I am not excited about the prospect of working that job. But money is money.

A couple years ago, my wife encouraged me to get a degree (something I was talking about for a while). 

So far, I have covered my tuition with financial aid, a small loan, and my salary. However, my wife contributes more to our household expenses. And she recently encouraged me to take a break from work and concentrate on my studies for a semester, which means she has been subsidizing my studies even though I've covered the tuition and some household expenses with my unemployment. I have passed all courses and I am learning more and more job-relevant skills as I advance in my courses.

My wife earns much more than me but job security is a big concern. She was laid off a couple years ago, got a new job with a toxic work environment where she was overworked, and then got fired. She recently started a new job that seems to be a much healthier work environment, is fully remote, and pays well. However, she's very nervous since she was hired to take on tasks that almost no-one in the company can help her with. She often expresses her fear that she won't succeed and she'll get fired. 

Her anxiety would be alleviated to some extent if I had a stable job. However, I feel that the job offer I already have is a better opportunity that will increase my chances of earning much more in the future.

I will speak to my wife about this again but I wanted some feedback from other people first.",Tulkoju,2,1.0,0,1742291716,2025-03-18 09:55:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1je1c56/job_aligned_with_studies_or_job_with_better_pay/,3,2025
1je16v1,Any advice on getting out of HR?,"I've been in Human Resources for about 8 years and it's been... underwhelming to say the least. I got into HR to support organizational wellness and employee success and have found that, at least at the companies I've worked for, all that matters is the company's bottom line, playing political games, and maintaining the status quo - even if it means high turnover rates, dissatisfied employees, and 0 mechanisms to actually deal with bad managers (either though proactive training, mentoring, or formal performance improvement plans). 


Quite honestly, I'm tired of dealing with bad leadership making selfish decisions, not being able to effectively support employees on their career journey, and I'm tired of managers and leaders complaining about inefficiencies yet doing nothing to fix them even when practical ideas are brought to the table. I'm tired of useless initiatives that are great ideas being downgraded to soundbites / blurbs on job postings that make the org sound good but are not actively making a difference in the company or in the experience of employees.

I'm just tired of the garbage HR does/has to put up with and I'm ready for a change. Not a transition into consulting or an HR specialty (like training and development or compliance). I literally want out of HR, but have no idea how to make the move. Any advice?

1je0t9v,Offered more money to move from a well-known bank to a unknown one,"I (25M) have been working in the credit risk area with predictive models in a well-known international bank for the last few years. It's been good so far, despite the lack of respect for working hours (I'm not allowed to work reduced hours in the summer and I'm expected to work overtime without thanks).

The other dilemma is money. I have a fairly ""good"" salary for my age in my country (salaries in my country are shit) and a good bonus. Despite this, pay rises are ridiculous and due to 'budget problems' I was denied the promotion I should have received. This was devastating news for me, and although I did get a pay rise, I feel a bit betrayed because even my manager had promised me the promotion. I worked really hard for this promotion, even taking work calls from my boss on my holidays; I still remember him calling me when I was about to have lunch when I was in Italy last summer.

I was also told to be grateful as people who joined at the same time as me did not receive a promotion or a pay rise, plus my pay rise is bigger than some people received when they were promoted (wild I know).

With all this in mind, I started looking for other opportunities and now I've been offered a lot more money (money that would take me up to 5 years to make in my current job if all goes well) in a really unknown bank in my country. They told me that they respect the working hours, but I do not believe it as it is the exception in my country.

I can't make up my mind, should I stay where I am, as it will be good for my CV, or should I take the money and go to the ""unreliable"" bank?",ItsTecnoDavid,1,1.0,3,1742289326,2025-03-18 09:15:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1je0t9v/offered_more_money_to_move_from_a_wellknown_bank/,3,2025
1je004c,Unexpected PIP - possible retaliation? AUS.,"About 8 months ago, a month after I returned back to work from my maternity leave, I was sexually assaulted by a member of my team  at a work event, held off site.
I reported this to my manager, and then HR. Nothing was done about it, as there was no ‚Äúproof‚Äù. We were told to not speak to each other. Either of us could have been separated or moved to a different building in the same town but it wasn‚Äôt offered as an option, even though I explained my anxiety when we would be alone in the office together.

Flash forward to now, I‚Äôve just come back from a 3 week vacation overseas. Our company has announced that everyone will receive a bonus in the coming weeks, due to the companies success in the last financial year. However, the bonus would not be applied to employees on a PIP. 

I just finished my second day back at work, when I get an email that says PIP, from HR. It‚Äôs addressed to my manager, and it says that they have added very ‚Äúsurface level‚Äù examples, however he needs to fill in specific ones and to urgently do so, so it can be approved and passed onto me on my first day back at work.

My manager has forwarded this to me by mistake. The PIP was attached and has 3 points on it. 

- One of them being that I use my personal phone during work hours too much.

- one of them being that the team struggles when I am not at work. I work part-time. Any sick leave I take, is because of a chronic medical condition I have, and I have supplied a letter from my specialist and the company have expressed they would support me in regards to this (maybe taking a few extra days of sick leave here and there)

- one of them being that I need to consult with team members more and collaborate. (How am I to do this, in a team of 3, when I was told specifically to avoid and not speak to my abuser) 


Manager called me straight after, said he was told to redact the email. I checked my inbox, it‚Äôs gone. I had already forwarded it to my personal email address. 

Is it fair or legal for me to be placed on a PIP when I haven‚Äôt been spoken to about my performance beforehand? Is this a way for them to not pay me my bonus? What can I do about this?

My manager is saying that he doesn‚Äôt agree with the PIP and feels it‚Äôs unfair. I‚Äôm not sure how much truth there is to this, or if they feel guilty. 

Can I fight the PIP so I can still receive the bonus? Can I ask them to provide concrete proof of what I am being accused of? 

I have been a hard worker and have received positive feedback and praise by colleagues and managers so I feel blindsided and shocked by the whole situation.

1jdzy92,Should I accept interview after 1 month in current role for position my wife also interviewed for.,"Working over 3 years at the same large international company as my wife. One month ago I took a new role with a pay bump. Wife has also been looking for a new role at the company and sent her a link for an internal role that is suited for her.

She interviewed for the role and wasn't positive about it. After discussing how her interview went and how we both agreed the role will be suited to me. I applied for it as well, felt bad because only been in new role for 1 month. But it is a step up in pay and is a management role. 

A week later she got asked for salary expectations for the new role. So we were excited that she may receive an offer.  I thought my application for the role would be denied soon. But out of the blue I now got a request to interview that will then notify my new manager of 1 month that I applied at this position. 

Question 1: Will this be detrimental if I take the interview and not get the position. As a manager would you right off this person in your team?

Question 2: Would I potentially be blocking my wife from this new position? Would it be worthwhile asking recruiter how many positions there are for the role?

1jdztaf,Career/job suggestions for an autistic person?,"Y'all probably get a million posts every day asking for job suggestions, but I'm pretty much at the end of my rope here, so figured I might as well add to the pile.

I (18NB, AFAB) have autism, ADHD, and chronic pain. This means I can't work anything with excessive physical activity, nor anything with excessive interaction with frustrating customers (although I can handle polite customers, or lesser levels of interactions) or overwhelming environments, and staring at massive paragraphs or big lists of numbers makes me want to rip my skin off. I'm sure there are a lot of jobs along those lines, but I'm *also* dealing with a lack of direction, which is honestly the hardest part.

I basically have zero idea of what to do. My hobbies include crocheting, drawing (but not really enough to become an artist about it...), reading, game/movie analysis, and making coffee (I have a barista qualification, currently working on a Cert 3 hospitality course at TAFE, but being a full-time barista would likely not pay enough for me to be comfortable, and it can be fairly physically demanding).

I really like simple, repetitive jobs where I feel like I'm doing something helpful and/or meaningful. For example, there is a website (zooniverse.org) where you can look at aerial images and tag trees, to assist with science research projects, and I can and have done this for hours while listening to music, just for fun. 

I'm not very good at maths, mostly because of the numbers and memorisation, but I'm fairly good at problem solving and common sense. I'm willing to put in the work to learn something if I think it will be rewarding. I don't need a career with insanely high salary numbers, just something comfortable where I have savings I can fall back on and I don't need to stress myself out over every purchase.

Please, I have been thinking and considering and researching options for weeks and I'm still struggling. Thoughtful suggestions or further questions are welcomed and encouraged.

1jdxpky,Did I Make the Wrong Career Move? Feeling Stuck and Regretful,"I worked at my previous company for almost three years and truly loved the job‚Äîexcept for one major issue: my boss. Early on, I noticed a shift in her behavior, and over time, it became clear that she was manipulative, insecure, and possibly even jealous of me. She would occasionally throw me a bone, but I constantly felt like I had to watch my back. It got to the point where I genuinely wondered if she had a recorder in my office.

Going to HR wasn‚Äôt an option‚ÄîI knew it wouldn‚Äôt help. The head of the department had already received multiple complaints about my boss but was frozen because she had promoted her. There had also been high turnover in that position under her leadership, so admitting there was a problem would‚Äôve reflected badly on her. I felt stuck.

So, I took the high road and left. I became a contractor for another company in the same industry, earning more and gaining flexibility. But the downside? The company is a startup, and the role is beneath me. I also received another great job offer with an amazing title, but it required me to move further from my family and friends, which wasn‚Äôt ideal‚Äîespecially since I‚Äôm engaged and planning my wedding next year.

When I initially resigned from my old job, they tried hard to keep me, telling me to ask for whatever I wanted. I did, and both my boss and hers supported me. But they said the promotion and raise wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed for a few months. At the time, I didn‚Äôt want to take that risk, so I walked away.

Now, here‚Äôs the kicker: the big boss, who acted as a shield for my awful manager, is gone. If I had just stuck it out a little longer, the workplace dynamics would have shifted in my favor. Looking back, I regret not staying and securing the promotion I worked so hard for. I also regret not taking the other job offer, despite the move, because at least it was a real step forward.

I feel completely lost. I come from immigrant parents, and most women in my culture don‚Äôt work, but I love my career and have had a great run‚Äîuntil now. I‚Äôm struggling with the feeling that I threw it all away because I was trying to escape a bad boss instead of playing the long game.

1jdws4a,X-Ray Psyching me out?,"So as a college student I've stereotypically ignored my body for a long time, trying to powerhouse through school. I'm in my last semester of college and have exams pounding down on me, but immense stress form losing a family member and getting sick with the flu and colds multiple times. Just last week I had woken up to my left knee being very sore and swollen, painful to the touch. The only pain is on my medial side where my MCL would be (I'm not great at anatomy so picture will help.)

  I recently discovered I share my grandma's hyper mobility.. just about EVERYWHERE. I'm talking neck to toes on moving joints and not realizing till now, this is not a super power. It's a bad thing. Now, I know she had many other problems, but my main concern is her Rheumatoid. Her hands were so disfigured and knuckles almost the size of tangerines!! My family seems to have lots of hereditary dieasss and while I can't post my full medical history here, all I ask is: 

Am I being a hypochondriac or is there really something OFF about my knee? To me, it looks like my poor cartilage is being grated down and explains why I cannot extend my knee without any pain, nor any pressure on it at all to walk. 
  I went to an Urgent Care, they checked mobility, she assessed with touch and sight, and then ordered the X-ray.  I was given a Toradol injection for pain which made my stomach cramp later on. I've been prescribed this in oils and I do not want to take it since it also did nothing for the pain. 
  Going to PCP in the morning to get referred to Ortho, but any thoughts on if maybe they actually completely overlooked my damn joint and told me I have a ligament sprain, or I'm psyching myself out before a true checkup. 
  I just really don't know what I did to it! I'm not an athlete at all, but I'm not completely sedentary, I work a fast food job and being on my feet for 8+ hours for atleast 4 days out of the week most definitely doesn't help, but that can't be the exact cause if not the only one, right?

1jdwqxk,Looking for Advice on My Job Search in Marketing,"I know the job market is tough right now, but any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I‚Äôm an immigrant from Europe (pernament resident, no sponsorship needed) with 2.5 years of U.S. experience. I got laid off in December 2024. I have a Math degree and 10+ years in marketing, specializing in MarTech and analytics despite having generalist marketing titles. Since I‚Äôm not strong in content creation, I‚Äôve shifted my job search from Senior Marketing Manager to Marketing Operations Manager and updated my resume and LinkedIn accordingly. I‚Äôm not interested in purely Marketing Analytics roles.

Questions:

a. My last role (Senior Manager) paid $80K, but I started in U.S. lower than I should have. I‚Äôm now targeting Marketing Operations roles around $100K. Is this realistic?

b. I have broad experience with MarTech tools, including HubSpot, but not Salesforce or Marketo. How hard is it to land a mid-level Marketing Ops role without hands-on experience in those?

c. My interview rate has dropped. Three years ago, I applied for 400 jobs and got 40 interviews. Now, after 200 applications, I‚Äôve had only 4 interviews. I am living in a kind of rural area so it's almost only remote jobs. How can I improve my job search?

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing so far:
Created 4 ATS-friendly resume versions, optimizing them frequently along with my LinkedIn profile.
Sending cover letters and reaching out to hiring managers (25% of applications)‚Äîno responses so far.
Actively networking (new connections, mentors, communities, and 3-4 referrals), but my network is limited since most of my contacts until recently were outside the U.S.

1jdvbz2,I don‚Äôt want to do my masters anymore,"I am about 2 weeks into my degree and I have come to the realisation that I don‚Äôt want to study anymore.

A bit of background and how I got to where I am right now:
I (23) have a fine arts undergrad degree, which has opened up a few opportunities but nothing major. After I finished my degree I became severely burnt out and hadn‚Äôt made any art anymore. During my degree I began an afterschool art tutoring job which I loved and still love. At this point I‚Äôve been out of uni for about a year and one of my coworkers encouraged me to get a masters in teaching as they all thought that I would make a really great teacher (It goes for a year and a half). At the same time I would have family members constantly ask what my plans are for the future and would suggest many different jobs and avenues, which made me quite uncomfortable but I never really stood up for myself to tell them to stop. I had quite a lot of pressure to decide on something as my family are all high achievers, earners and workaholics, and they want me to get a job to be able to support myself fully. After a bit of thought I decided on doing the masters. I was never really that enthusiastic about it and when I received the offer I wasn‚Äôt all that excited. I have begun the course and listening to the lecturers talk about it being an amazing career path for the rest of your life it made me really scared. 

I would love to take my art somewhere as I have recently found a medium that allows me to have fun and not overanalyse and start a small business but I‚Äôm afraid of the disappointment from those around me, especially my family. I‚Äôm afraid that quitting this masters is the wrong thing to do and that I should just stick it out, but I don‚Äôt want to take time away from doing something that could potentially work. I don‚Äôt earn much, the point of doing this masters is to get a full time job and earn much more than what I already do. I‚Äôm just so conflicted.

I keep seeing all of these ads for different schools / training programs that will supposedly get you ready for a good paying job in the tech field in a fairly short amount of time. But I honestly just don‚Äôt know what to believe at this point. I do not have the extra income or time to take a course etc that isn‚Äôt actually going to do what it advertises.

1jdupuc,Feeling lost in my career. What should I do?,"I (30m) have been feeling pretty lost about my career recently. Just thought I‚Äôd type out some thoughts to vent and see what others say. I‚Äôve posted about this before. I‚Äôll try to be brief. 

I currently work as a communications manager for a fairly large organization. I have a team of two under me. I got promoted when my old manager left. I‚Äôm starting to see why they left. 

The executive director is my boss. The old ED retired when I started. Since then, it has been a revolving door of ED‚Äôs. I‚Äôve had three bosses in the last two years. One didn‚Äôt even realize they were my boss. So, I‚Äôm getting kind tired of my current job. I‚Äôve been there about 4 years in total. 2 as manager. Currently making $50 an hour. 

I‚Äôve been looking for other jobs for about a year now. After a sudden meeting three weeks ago about restructuring, I‚Äôve really had a fire under my ass to get out. 

I‚Äôm struggling to find the next move. One of the directors at my current job noticed I was kind annoyed. So, he reached out to the ED at his old job, the hospital, and asked if they need comms guys. That was very kind of him. I‚Äôve since had a meeting with the ED at the hospital. We got a long well. I think he liked me. He said there are no open comms jobs right now. He does hope to grow the team though - which is currently one person. He said he would reach back out in a week with the possibility of getting me some contract work. 

Two weeks ago, I met with a guy that runs a marketing agency. He also said he may be able to offer contract work in the future. He was honest and said he could not pay what I make now. 

So, I can‚Äôt figure out what I want. That makes me feel stuck in my head, constantly trying to solve this problem. I‚Äôm getting married this summer and I‚Äôd much rather think about that :( 

I guess my options are, stay where I am and try to accept things, while looking for another job or, quit and fill my time with contract work until something else comes up. 

A few other things:

I live in a smallish city. We moved here 5 years ago when my partner got a job. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôve hit the top here. 

other jobs I‚Äôve done:

Tv camera, audio, and editing
Radio reporting and writing 
Newspaper writing
Livestreaming and coordinating as part of a film festival

All those jobs were way more fulfilling. But I chased some money and now I hate it.

1jdtq4t,6 weeks and still training?,"As the title suggests, I started a new job 6 weeks ago and I‚Äôm still in ‚Äútraining.‚Äù When I started, the lady training me was adamant that we are connected at the hip and involved in everything together. A couple of weeks later, she made a comment that once I‚Äôm trained and part of my team she stills want make sure we‚Äôre connected and in tune with each others projects. 

Firstly, I agree that we should have a handle on what the other is doing. Just in case the other is out randomly or for whatever reason we have to pick up where the other left off. 

What bothers me is it‚Äôs been six weeks and I‚Äôm feeling more her assistant than anything. I brought it up to our boss today that ‚Äúhey I think im ready to be more independent‚Äù and I got immediate pushback. She was worried I‚Äôd focus on the wrong things based on prior employees ‚Ä¶not my performance at all. The comment was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want it to end like <past coworker> and you‚Äôre not getting your work done.‚Äù I dropped it and just said I didn‚Äôt have any other concerns after that. 

I‚Äôve never been trained this long at a job, ever. At my two previous jobs, I was considered one of their top performers. So on my end, it‚Äôs not a lack of work ethic or drive. I know I‚Äôve been catching on quickly because they‚Äôll comment how fast I‚Äôm getting it. 

I‚Äôm at a loss what to do. Do I bother bringing this up again? Do I start my job search again? I‚Äôm getting depressed over my work life and it really sucks.

1jdtmfs,"Artist looking to get into tech, maybe a software engineer","Hello!

I'm in need of some guidance as I'm not even sure a good starting point. I am wanting to do a career change and go into tech, I'm just not sure exactly where. My degree is in film production and I'm an artist so I'm trying to figure out any programs/schools I can go to and get another degree or a masters degree. The most tech I have in my background was some html coding as a teen and working on various photo and video editing softwares. I'm savvy with computers, but not like a genius. I would like to go into either UX-design or software developing, but I worry that software developing is too difficult to learn. Any artists here been able to learn it without already dabbling in it?

I'm working with the Department of Rehabilitation because I am disabled and it's a really wonderful program that helps us get into a career and pay our tuition, so I'm looking for the more traditional route of a university or community college and not a boot camp. I live in the SF bay area so I'm curious if theres any good programs around here.

1jdtkbq,Feeling Trapped In Current Job Looking For Career Change,"Hi everyone. I am a 26 M living in a big city. I have autism but I manage. I am currently in a management position for a food retailer working on average 55 hours a week not including the work that I have to bring home. I am feeling very trapped in life. I dislike the work-life balance of my current job. I am not a lazy person, every place that I have worked I have been one of the hardest workers but I am so burnt out and I have little to nothing to show for it(rent, student loans for a degree I never obtained, etc)

I recently re-enrolled in community college in order to find a career change that might be better suited for me but I feel I currently work too much and my depression, anxiety, and burnout will hinder my performance in school. I need advice on what career paths might be good for someone with autism and what work I could possible switch to in order to support myself going back to school. My rent costs about $1500 for a studio so I would like to have something that brings in at least 3x that amount per month. My current job makes about 3.3x that amount but with the constant meetings/phone calls from my employees/ and the lack of time off it is unsustainable for me. I have thought about moving into my car but I have pets that would not be able to handle the restriction in space and I would rather not hinder their lives. I have no family in the city that I live in and not much of a support system, so moving in with a relative is not an option and I am willing to pay the rent if I am able to afford it. I also love the city that I am in and don't wish to move.

My skills:

* I am decently good at math and programming but I dislike the tech industry and don't have a degree which is a requirement for nearly all companies near me.
* I can be a pretty personable person and am typically well liked by people I interact with but I burn out from masking very easily so I would prefer something non-customer facing
* I am very organized
* I have great problem solving abilities
* I am decent with working with my hands

I am not opposed to working a remote job along side a part time job or two part time jobs as I have had two jobs for most of my time since moving to the big city. I would like something that is no more than 50 hours a week and is less socially taxing than managing fast-food.

If you know of any career paths that are suited for someone with autism and these skills please let me know. I am getting desperate and thinking about quitting my current job but I have nothing lined up and not much of a safety net. Any encouraging messages or advice is greatly appreciated.

1jdtclt,My (27m) husband may be fired from his job and I'm slightly panicking.,"My (27m) husband and I (28f) made an agreement that he would work while I raise the kids. However, I'm not going to get too far into our agreement but he's been working for almost the last 5 years as state employee. He's been doing well but recently a SGT (sergeant) got introduced and he got stuck in the mix of it. Now, I'm not in this job so I don't know the specifics but what I do know it's been going on for a month now. The investigation was sparked after the SGT did something sketchy and my husband unfortunately forgot to report it until a day later after another SGT told him to him too. Essentially the item was out in the van and they thought he stole it but it was eventually retrieved after a day or so. We'll today, he finally had a meeting, they asked him 3 questions (yes and no) and the union rep said ""this could go either way"" the SGT who initiated this was also questioned last Monday but still has her job. He's worried he's going to get fired and so am I. Our son is due any day now and I'm freaking out, but I will work if I have to. I have degrees I can work off of but I'm concerned on what's going to happen during my recovery and he's worried about finding another job and losing his pension. Should we really be concerned or? The comment ""this could go either way"" freaks me out.

1jdsvde,3 months at new job and I've been experiencing anxiety attacks. Is it just me being sensitive?,"3 months at new job and I've been experiencing anxiety attacks. Is it just me being sensitive?

Just as the title states, I've been experiencing anxiety attacks since my 2nd month. I've already started taking a prescribed medication by a family doctor and have been looking for a psychotherapy which I've never done nor experienced from my previous jobs despite how stressful they were.

I'm currently working as an Admin Coordinator for a specific service company and so far I've already understood all of the responsibilities of my role. The thing is, my manager wants what she says to be precisely done and if I miss them just one day despite there's no ""end of the world"" deadline, she'll speak to me in a degrading, insulting way in front of my colleagues. 

It's been a few times already where I've experienced extreme shakiness out of fear while at work when she's there and brain fog as well.

Knowing myself when learning new things is that, I have have to do them a few more times and I definitely learn from my errors.

But with my manager, I'm now just working with full anxiety that I just think everything I do is incorrect.

They don't know how to communicate well, often use me as a punching bag and micromanage me for the dumbest reasons.

My manager also has this license and we're worried that she and subsequently the owner will get weird about this. Like me trying to steal my manager's job. 

I've been so fed up with my treatment over the last few days that I'm starting to look at other jobs. This has me conflicted, because I feel like I'm giving up a great opportunity.

I was clear about this before I took my position and was told that my boss would help out if there ever needed to be a shift covered (ie splitting the shift with me) but hasn't done that or offered since I've started as a manager. I am young, only 22, and I just feel like I shouldn't be so stressed about my job at this young of an age. Let alone, having to be on call all the time when I want to do fun things. I've also gotten some backlash from my staff members for ""not being willing to cover shifts"" and it really is just dragging me down and making me super unmotivated to do my day to day job of taking care of clients. The stress of being on call isn't the only reason I feel this way. The job as a whole is insanely stressful for me. I don't like being a manager, I don't like having hard conversations with my staff members, as it gives me so much anxiety. I think I bit off more than I can chew with this position. I want to talk with my boss about this when I get the chance and the possibilities of taking a step down, but I am not sure how to bring this up in a professional way or what I should say.

1jdojnm,"Graduated with a BS in Software Development, but fallen out of love with coding","Hey All. I just feel stuck in life at the moment. I feel like I took too long to get where I am and just behind in life. Minor backstory. I went to college in 2014 for game development (programming specifically) and had issues adapting to college life. It would lead me to change majors to software development, be academically dismissed a few times on and off, fail out completely, and try again online where I would eventually succeed in 2023. Within that time I had two software jobs in QA (one manual QA and one automated QA). The first I left due to Covid-19 and no remote work being put in place at the time. The second I was let go due to company offshoring of my job.

I've still been applying to jobs like crazy, even after being out of work for \~2 years. But that time span between jobs is not attractive to employers, even if I explain in my cover letter (if it ever gets read). Most of my searching leads to ghosting or denials with the handful of interviews still leading to dead ends.

Throughout all this, I've fallen out of love with the act of coding and I'm tired. But I still want to be in software and tech. I feel my skills becoming rusty while having no desire to keep it in practice. I'm nearing 30 years old and I just feel lost. What are some possible directions I can go in life and is it worth trying to find a whole other career choice at this point?",Overloaded_Wolf,1,1.0,1,1742247344,2025-03-17 21:35:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jdojnm/graduated_with_a_bs_in_software_development_but/,3,2025

So I recieved a really good offer from a company just a few days ago that I could not pass up, and I just got it my start date confirmed as of very recently, which is in mid April. 

I would like to give my current employer notice, and since I work at a hospital, they require 3 weeks notice. However, I have scheduled PTO upcoming this week, and they already found coverage for me as I requested this months ago. Additionally, I have a planned family vacation after my last working date, which would be in early April.

Should I tell my supervisor I wanted to give him my 3 weeks today, my start date would be right before I leave on my family trip, which would technecally be two working weeks. What would be the best way to navigate around this situation in order for everyone to be satisfied without me cancelling my trip, if possible?

I started a new project manager job with an engineering company beginning of the year. My company is small and I‚Äôm subcontracted to a larger company. I‚Äôve been working there 2 months and the program manager (PM) has submitted 2 negative reviews to my company, both of which were a shock to me.

What‚Äôs most concerning is we have 1-1s daily and he doesn‚Äôt provide me feedback. I tell him what I‚Äôm working, he says sounds good and ends the meeting, but now he‚Äôs provided negative feedback to my company twice.

The PM compared my lack of productivity against another in my role who‚Äôs been there over a year. I‚Äôm not slacking and as a subcontractor just getting admin access to everything took 2 weeks, so I‚Äôve been working 6 weeks really.

1jdmzjm,How to actually WFH??,"Little back story: when I was in high school I always had a very difficult relationship with the school system. I could never pay attention and was ultimately failing my way through school. Eventually I started to skip my classes and get in a lot of trouble. At some point a counselor mentioned independent studies to me and I began looking into it. I mentioned it to my parents who believe that I would fail even worse with no one to keep me accountable. I basically told them to let me try and send me back to public school if there was no improvement. Immediately my grades improved and I continued to stay on the independent program for 3 out of my 4 years. I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and got my diploma. Fast forward to now and I am 26. I have worked many jobs from food service to electrical, warehouses and even trucking. I do fine at these jobs but am never really happy. I talk to other people around me such as neighbors and distant family that work remote jobs including insurance, workers comp claims, asset protection ect. After my high school experience I feel that something like that would fit my lifestyle perfectly but when I ask them how to go about it they all just kind of shrug me off. I am interested in knowing just exactly how one would go about truly working from home. I am not against work or working hard but am very independent and like to be in my comfort zone.

1jdmhls,Should I go for psychology?,"Hi there, having a bit of a crisis concerning my current educational route, so hoping for advice and guidance!

I have a bachelor's degree in English Language and Literature (graduated in 2017) with the intention of going into publishing. It seemed like that field would work out at the time (outside of understanding that publishing is hard to get into unless you have connections), but those job opportunities dried up back when COVID hit in 2020.

I've been bouncing around from job to job since that point with no clear direction and having done nothing with my degree. So I am now back in college going for a Computer Science degree, since CS fields are generally more available and more lucrative.

I am in my first semester back, and while I am interested in programming, the math involved is killing me. I've never been mathematically inclined (hence the English degree) so knowing how much math is involved with this degree was something I had considered. But getting into the weeds with the math, I am extremely concerned that I'm not going to be able to keep up.

I'm trying to come up with backup plans in case I can't go through with the Computer Science program, and my first idea is to go through a psychology program (with the intention of going into grad school). I've read so many posts and articles detailing how difficult it is to make it in psychology, but quite a few are dated, so I'm hoping to get some current opinions. 

Is a psychology degree worth it? Especially if I want to try for clinical psychology? Are there other fields that would be better?

**Job 2: Previous Employer**

* **Pros**: The company really likes me, offers a great work culture, and better pay than my current position. If I take this, I could still upskill and go into business. The company is stable, though it‚Äôs small with slower growth.
* **Cons**: If I take this, I‚Äôd likely have to give up pursuing Job 1‚Äôs field. I don‚Äôt have a college degree, and while this company is great, growth might not be as fast as I want.

**Job 3: Current Employer**

1jdhaeg,"Early career move between fields, need advice","Hoping for some early (roughly 3 YOE) career advice

I moved from being a cost analyst at a larger company to a higher paying cost accountant role at a smaller company back in September. I was looking for a company with more potential advancement, which my prior position didn‚Äôt offer.

This move, while great financially and a fantastic chance to sharpen my Excel/BI skills, has been a complete shitshow otherwise. For many reasons, I am looking to pivot out of here and potentially costing as a whole to move into auditing instead. My worry is that to make that move, I will have to go back to an entry level salary despite my work and excel/bi experience I have now.

I am having my transcript reviewed currently to see if I am eligible to sit for the CPA, but am looking at my options in the shorter term while doing so. It is my understanding other certs just wouldn‚Äôt be worth the effort otherwise.

People who have been in a similar situation, were you able to pivot elsewhere without getting your salary set back to entry level?

1jdggt7,I‚Äôm working on a side project ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What I‚Äôve Learned About Career Success in the process,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been working on a side project called GetHiredNow, an AI-powered tool to help the job seekers.

I started this project because I kept seeing the same struggles‚Äîpeople applying to dozens (or hundreds) of jobs with little response, getting ghosted after interviews, or feeling lost in the job search process. The more I researched, the more I realized how much the system works against job seekers.

Building this tool has been a journey in itself, and I‚Äôve picked up some **valuable insights** along the way. Thought I‚Äôd share them here in case they help anyone currently job hunting.



# 1. The Job Search is a Game ‚Äì Know the Rules

Most hiring today is **automated**. Your resume is likely going through an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** before a human even sees it.

* If your resume **doesn‚Äôt match** the job description, it might get rejected automatically.
* **Keywords matter**‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt mean stuffing them in unnaturally.
* **Formatting is crucial**‚Äîcomplex designs can break in ATS systems.

**Tip:** Always tailor your resume to each job posting. Even small tweaks to wording can increase your chances of passing the initial screening.



# 2. The Resume is Only Step One ‚Äì You Need a Strategy

A strong resume gets you **in the door**, but it won‚Äôt guarantee a job. I‚Äôve spoken to so many people who say:

* ‚ÄúI‚Äôve applied to 200+ jobs and haven‚Äôt heard back.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI keep getting interviews, but no offers.‚Äù

If this sounds familiar, here‚Äôs what might be happening:

* **Applying everywhere without a targeted approach** ‚Üí A generic resume doesn‚Äôt stand out.
* **Lack of networking** ‚Üí Many jobs are filled before they‚Äôre even posted.
* **Weak interview performance** ‚Üí Interviews are about proving **you‚Äôre the solution to a company‚Äôs problem**, not just listing experience.

**Tip:** Spend as much time **networking and preparing for interviews** as you do applying. A warm referral can increase your chances dramatically.



# 3. AI Can Help ‚Äì But You Still Need a Human Touch

While building **GetHiredNow**, I tested different AI methods to improve job search outcomes. AI is a **great tool**, but here‚Äôs what I learned:

* **AI can optimize resumes**, but it‚Äôs best when used as a guide, not a replacement.
* **It can suggest interview answers**, but you still need to sound natural.
* **It can generate LinkedIn networking messages**, but authenticity wins over automation.

**Tip:** Use AI as a **coach**, not a crutch. Let it help with structure, but make sure your unique personality and experiences shine through.



# 4. Most People Don‚Äôt Follow Up ‚Äì That‚Äôs a Mistake

One of the biggest patterns I‚Äôve seen? **People submit applications and wait.**

* They don‚Äôt follow up with recruiters.
* They don‚Äôt send a thank-you email after an interview.
* They don‚Äôt check back in after being ghosted.

**Tip:** A well-timed follow-up email can bring your application back to the top of a recruiter‚Äôs inbox. If you‚Äôre not getting responses, **be politely persistent.**



# 5. Rejection is Inevitable ‚Äì But It‚Äôs Data, Not a Judgment

Job searching can be frustrating, and rejection feels personal. I‚Äôve seen so many people get discouraged after just a few rejections. But the reality is:

* You‚Äôre **competing with hundreds (sometimes thousands) of applicants**.
* Companies have **internal candidates and hiring biases** that you can‚Äôt control.
* Sometimes it‚Äôs just **bad timing**‚Äînot a reflection of your skills.

**Tip:** Track your applications, interviews, and outcomes. Look for patterns. **Are you getting interviews but not offers? Improve your interview skills. Not getting interviews? Adjust your resume.** Treat the job search like a **process** you can refine over time.



# Final Thoughts

Building GetHiredNow has shown me just how much **job seekers are up against**‚Äîand how small tweaks can make a huge difference.

If you‚Äôre job searching right now, **don‚Äôt give up**. There are ways to improve your odds, get noticed, and land that next role.

Would love to hear from you‚Äî**what‚Äôs been your biggest challenge in the job search?** Let‚Äôs help each other out!",AdiLaxman,1,1.0,0,1742227991,2025-03-17 16:13:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jdggt7/im_working_on_a_side_project_heres_what_ive/,3,2025

1jdfmt6,Almost 2 years since graduation,"This coming June will be my official 2 years since graduation. I'm slowly starting to lose motivation for anything really. I did a major in math and a minor in computer science (hoping to do data/business analysis). I'm not sure what to do anymore though. I currently work as a math teacher at a learning center so my resume isn't empty (which is the one thing keeping my soft skills alive). I've done networking, career fairs, cold emailing, offering volunteer time- nothing back. Everyone keeps saying ""just keep applying"" but I feel demoralized- especially seeing people i know actually having a proper career. 

I know this economy is rough on everyone and I'm not alone, but it feels like everyone around me is moving on and I can't even land something as basic as a proper job. I've slowly stopped practicing (sql, Python, excel, Java, etc) because this feels like a hopeless endeavor. I've considered doing more certs (recently completed the Google Data Analytics cert) but idk what would even help me at this point. It's especially rough because it's a career path is hate (and also my field of study stressed out so much it caused major health issues to me that are borderline irreversible).

1jdeldy,CNA with Social Science degree,"Hi, it's my first time posting on here so I feel like coming on here to ask for advice is just me getting desperate.

I'm currently majoring in Social Science and plan to minor in Psychology once I transfer. I initially planned to go into social work (either CPS or healthcare) but after thinking for a bit and doing more research, I'm just not sure if being a social worker specifically in healthcare is cut out for me.

After talking with a friend, he suggested that I look into taking a CNA course. I did my research and if I take this course, it'll open more career opportunities for me to enter into in the near future.

1jdek7c,"We built a 1,016-job career browser to help you filter by work-life balance, pay, and more","I‚Äôve spent years watching people struggle with career decisions, and I‚Äôve noticed we often have the same questions: *What‚Äôs the work-life balance like? How quickly can I start earning? Is it remote, hybrid, or on-site? Will I have flexibility and control over my schedule? How does the salary stack up, and is there room to grow?*

These questions can be total deal-breakers when you‚Äôre picking a job or switching careers. I‚Äôve also seen that we switch jobs more than ever before - on average, 12-13 times in a lifetime - so **pivot potential and skill transfer** matter a lot. Sometimes we jump into a career, only to discover later we can‚Äôt easily pivot if we want something new.

So my team and I have been working on a platform that tries to respond to these very questions:

[**list.careermanager.ai**](https://list.careermanager.ai/)

We‚Äôve gathered a *ton* of data (currently over **1,000 occupations**) and built filters around everything from work-life balance and salary to how freelance-friendly it is, typical work settings (remote vs. on-site), and even how fast you can start earning in that field. We also factored in pivot potential - how transferable the skills are - because none of us want to feel stuck if we ever need a change.

We‚Äôre still refining it, and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd love your feedback. If you have a minute to poke around, let me know:

‚Ä¢ Does it give you helpful info you can‚Äôt easily get elsewhere?

‚Ä¢ Are there specific features or data points you‚Äôd want to see?

1jde969,"How to deal with this situation? In person, virtual meeting?","About 2 weeks ago, I started a new job. Non-profit organisation, everyone super nice. Pay lower than my previous job - I was made redundant just before Christmas, so I was not in a position to say no to anything. Meanwhile, I had already been successful for another position with a different company, with the caveat that they would only be able to offer me the job if a government contract came through which, according to them, was just a matter of time.

During my job search, I was ghosted, sometimes even after being offered the job verbally, way too many times. So I just disregarded the other job offer, assumed that I was going to get ghosted, and accepted the job offer at the non-profit organisation. Yeah, it turns out that they didn't ghost me and now offered me a job. Not only that, but it is a considerable increase in pay. With a 1-year old daughter with nursery expenses, a dog with vet bills, and mortgage to pay, I cannot really say no. I will go from having to carefully budgeting my expenses to be almost carefree. Besides, I will still be doing something that I enjoy, albeit in a for-profit organisation.

But I am feeling extremely guilty. If it was a for-profit, I would be feeling less guilty. But given that everyone is so nice + the organisation is helping people, I feel selfish. And I will have to give my notice to my line manager, who is also a really nice guy. I don't think I can't do it just by e-mail, as I think that would be disrespectful. But I also feel extremely anxious to do it in person and then have to cross the entire office full of my colleagues. The job is hybrid, so I could also do it virtually. My wife though thinks that I need to do it in person. I am also autistic so, not only this is a very anxiety-inducing situation, I am also terrible at diplomacy and social skills.

1jddrma,Trying to figure out my next move,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. If someone knows of a better sub, please let me know. 

A little background about me: I am a very hard worker and an extremely fast learner. I don't particularly like to toot my own horn, but every job I've had I've moved up very very quickly and am always praised by management. I feel like an imposter most of the time. I have done all sorts of jobs including customer service, retail, glazing, sales, managing restaurants, property management, deliveries, cooking, data entry, and probably more I can't think of right now. My favorite was data entry I did for the post office 20 years ago. That position was phased out due to everything going digital.

I am also on the spectrum but I have low support needs. The things I struggle with the most is socializing, and overstimulation from noise. I get extreme anxiety that causes me to go mute at times and a lot of noises literally hurt. And I have trouble with words all the time. I think in the right environment, my autism is a huge plus because of my pattern recognition, and my attention to detail. I work so fast too! I can always find the most efficient way to do things. I have helped rewrite entire processes for a couple businesses I worked for. I always notice the small things no one else sees.

My most recent job was car sales. I have been doing it for 3 years and I just quit a week ago. It has been soul crushing. I don't know if a single day passed in 3 years where I didn't spend a good chunk of the day in the bathroom crying. Have been waiting tables to try to bring money in until I can find something better but I just don't know what is right for me. I've been looking so hard.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a job where I am not expected to socialize? Where I can make at least $4k a month? I do not mind long hours, and I want to work hard. I actually cannot stand to be at work and not be working. Down time is the enemy. I don't have a degree but I know any employer would be happy to have me and be impressed with my learning abilities as long as they don't expect me to socialize. 

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to give me guidance.

Anyways, ever since February I got burnt out. Firstly, all the money we raised through fundraising events were... vague in usage? Like when I asked the other executive members (I'm also an executive member), they were super confusing and vague on where the money will come from. I did digging and I was shocked that they paid 4k for each of the guests of the webinar, but didn't give me a single dime. I mean I kinda accepted it since I knew from the start this is a ""volunteer"" role, but I spent so many months sacrificing time and such. It also didn't align with the other things they said previously like they will all donate it to a public school, etc.

Where the money is going made me think a lot, and gave me no motivation to promote the products. I'm not really interested in the money so I don't feel offended they didn't pay me, but more about where the money is going.

More and more people in our volunteer group are becoming inactive. I feel like our volunteer group is all about webinars and posting informative graphics online about webinars and holidays, THATS IT. 

The president don't even want to allocate some funds for marketing, yet allocated a lot of them to product making and creating webinars.

Do I leave? But I feel like it's such a waste. I feel stupid not documenting the growth I made on the organization properly (like making screenshots etc). I can't check analytics from since October on Facebook. And also, I don't want my 5 months to go to waste if I quit. I feel like it'll be bad if I mentioned in my resume that I only lasted 5 months. Yes many people may say ""oh it's just a volunteer role"" but I was in an EXECUTIVE ROLE üò≠ü•≤ and it sucks that all that hard work ends up not being able to go on my resume because lack of documentation + not being able to last for atleast a year.

I don't even have an official document either stating that I've become a volunteer. I'm so stupid. A stupid 16 year old that time.

I'm currently working 2 freelancing jobs. I have a third one, with a person from the U.S., but he said that there's no deadline for the video so I'm going to do it immediately if I have the time. He didn't pay yet don't worry but the other 2 clients did.

I'm also trying to maintain my high honor title in school. I need to maintain an average grade of 95, and it's getting harder to juggle my time. I'm also studying for the UPCAT (University of the Philippines Assessment Test) for this upcoming August and it's almost exam season AND I HAVE SO MANY HOMEWORK. 

I'm procrastinating right now as we speak.

What do I do moving forward :( and no I can't drop my freelancing jobs, I need money to eat.  I don't wanna talk about my family much but just know that I'm a working student.

1jdc52w,Need a reality check for investment banker career.,"
Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm currently a Manager at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India‚Äôs central bank (similar to the Federal Reserve). My long-term goal is to transition into investment banking in the U.S., making use of my background in monetary policy, financial regulation, and risk management.

Here‚Äôs my tentative plan:

1. Continue working at RBI for the next 10-15 years, building deep expertise in financial regulation, banking supervision, and macroeconomic policy.

2. Leverage RBI‚Äôs study leave to pursue a top-tier MBA (preferably Ivy League or equivalent) with a finance focus.

3. Post-MBA, transition into investment banking‚Äîpotentially in a regulatory advisory, risk, or financial institutions group role,before working my way up to a VP or senior executive position.

I understand that IB is highly competitive, and most career changers start at the Associate level. Given my background, would I be at a disadvantage without direct deal experience? Would my central banking expertise be valued in certain areas of IB (e.g., FIG, risk, or capital markets)?

1jdc37z,"Going back to school at 30, radiology tech or psychometrist?","
Hello! I‚Äôm a 30F Texan who has a BA in psychology. After applying to my local community colleges Rad Tech program and getting waitlisted with an offer for a Limited program, I started to consider my options in other fields. Now I have until Friday to decide which path to go on, and I would love some advice or insight. 

About me: I like meeting new people and can easily small talk with anyone to help them feel comfortable. I‚Äôm very intuitive and flexible, meaning if you give me a task I will figure out a way to complete it independently. I can figure technology out pretty easily. Biology was difficult to me but I did make in A in my anatomy and physiology class. Psychology has always been interesting to me, but soon after my bachelors I found that therapy wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit for me. I do get queasy with blood (mine and other people‚Äôs) and I‚Äôm trying to work on it. 


Option 1: Become a radiology tech by beginning the 1 year limited program and applying for the bridge program into the Associates degree and certification. I do have a few geographical and financial issues to consider when taking this route that could hurt now but pay off later. The RT 2 year program is 10 minutes from my home and would‚Äôve made it so easy commute wise in Austin. However, the Limited program is out of Round Rock campus and is an hour of heavy traffic to and from school, 8am-4pm Monday-Thursday. Driving a dangerous highway that can be pretty unpredictable. The way they decide if I can bridge into the two year program is a letter of intent, they will count missing classes, and ask my professors how I did in class. It‚Äôs not guaranteed entry either. I also wouldn‚Äôt have a job, but my husbands salary and our savings could hold us, it would be tight. I‚Äôm thinking about emailing the director to ask if there‚Äôs anyway I can be considered for the similar classes to be taken at the campus close to me, but I don‚Äôt think it will happen. 

Salary range starting: $50-70k 


Option 2: I currently work with a psychologist that owns a private neuropsychological assessment office as an admin for the wellness center he is a part of. He has expressed to me that he can train me to be a psychometrist (a person who administers psychological testing and scores it for the psychologist to write their reports) to get extra hours. I have experience with research testing from undergrad and he thought that was perfect. He currently has two psychometrists that are in grad school and their availability is starting to slim down (which means he cannot schedule tests those days.) His plan is to scale the business over the US (already licensed in over 40 states) and at some point I could become a supervisor of the team of psychometrist that he would hire over time. With a bachelors, I would need 3,000 hours of psychometry experience under a psychologist to become Board Certified. This would mean I could work in hospitals and private centers, but I could also stick with this Drs office as a health start up (basically.) I would get paid the hours I work and would be less financially strained for now. The office is 20 minutes from my home. If I wanted to, I could get my masters in research psych, but I would rather not have to if I could make a similar salary. 

Salary range: $30-45/hr (unpredictable, until I get a contact in place.)",SmartWorkDone,1,1.0,0,1742216514,2025-03-17 13:01:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jdc37z/going_back_to_school_at_30_radiology_tech_or/,3,2025

He didn‚Äôt reply for a few hours. I was only expecting ‚Äúget well soon, no worries‚Äù or something along these lines. A few hours later I sent a work related message and he answered immediately but mentioned nothing about my situation.

I began job hunting because my role as a mid level manager kept expanding with projects but not so much in pay/help (even my office space was no longer just mine as we all had to share due to more people than there were desks). With Those conditions plus a three hour round trip commute, I was thankful I found something closer later a few months ago.

Here is where I think mistake #1 happened: The role I accepted was significantly below where I was. The salary was less and the scope of responsibilities was definitely less. It seemed worthwhile though because I would be getting my foot in the door into an organization that I had unsuccessfully tried to get hired onto before. I tried to embrace the positives like less decision making, not being in charge, it was basically an easy paycheck.

So why is it a mistake? I work under the WORST bosses. My direct sup is the definition of a micromanager. And their boss lacks any leadership or organizational skills. The department I am in has poor employee morale and high turnover.

Here is potentially mistake #2- one of my colleagues put in for a transfer recently (due to our awful boss) and was successful at landing something in another part of the company. I thought I could stick it out at least past my probation but I also submitted my transfer paperwork too. Why could this be a mistake? I would need to start my probationary period over again (which I am ok with) Id rather do that than risk getting a bad review by my nit-picky supervisor. It could also be bad because being so new, It may appear like a lack of commitment whereas it really is just a bad fit.

I need some perspective on whether I should stick it out or proceed with a transfer should the opportunity arise?

I first started my apprenticeship in Carpentry at 17 as a way to get out of school. Now at 29 I am a leading hand Carpenter for a local builder. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I am incredibly proud of my what I have been able to built but lately. 

Not getting on with my employer - never seeing eye to eye, un realistic deadlines, poor workmanship etc etc. That has caused a bit of tension between us. 

Back pain. I‚Äôm trying to manage it with Chiropractic work and it does help but it‚Äôs only a bandaid fix and I don‚Äôt want to be spending this money every month for the rest of my life. 

Loss of passion & drive

Come the weekend time I am so sore and tired from working O/T I have no time or motivation for any of my hobbies. 

All of that has been eating me alive lately and I struggle to not bring this all home with me resulting in a bit of a depression I‚Äôm falling into. I know the best thing moving forwards is for me to have a career change. 

My dream career has always been to become a Firefighter. Every recruitment campaign I have given it my all but as anyone who‚Äôs looked at the process would know how cut throat and competitive it is. 

Ideally my plan would be to stay as a Carpenter until I manage to score a role as a Firefighter but that could be 10+ years away and I don‚Äôt think I can push out that long. 

I understand that I do not know what‚Äôs on the horizon but I‚Äôve been trying to stick it out for the past 4-5 years already. 

I‚Äôve been considering the police force but after reading on reddit people‚Äôs experiences I‚Äôm not exactly sold on it. 

The other career I‚Äôm looking at is a fisheries officer job but I still need to do my research and I‚Äôm not exactly sure how often they recruit. 

If anyone has any advice or words of wisdom that would be great as I feel quite confused as what to do.

1jd5udr,I dont know what I want to do with my life,"I feel so lost. Everybody my age seems to have some general idea of where they're going. Me? Changes every couple of months. I came to college to become a software engineer, only to find that I didn't like technical science. I bounced ideas around between studying social sciences of music before I came to college, but now I understand that I'm not interested in a future in those fields. Im currently on a pre-law track and doubting my chances of getting into law school. If I dont get in, I doubt Ill be able to find something fulfilling to fall back on. I was lost on what I wanted to do with my life before I came to college, and now im just as lost in college.
 
Growing up I was constantly pushed to be at the top of my class. My parents always said they were so proud of me when I got an A in science or got into another AP Course. They always encouraged me to get a certain type of career: High playing with a direct positive impact on the world. When I told them I wanted to be a musician, they told me it wasn't even an option. My parents and my brothers act like I'm the golden goose of the family. I'm the one whose going to do great things and add to the legacy. Why is it that everytime I try to live up to that standard, I find myself becoming so disinterested? 

I'm not interested in math, science, engineering, tech, law, medicine, chemistry, etc. The only consistent in my life is that I'm interested in the arts but that would let everybody down. How many times can I tell them that I've switched my major until they stop caring about me. Stop feeling proud of me. If it just paid enough and was important enough to them: I'd be a screenwriter, or a camerawoman, or a journalist, or an art director, or a classical tubaist (I was in honors band in hs), or a photographer, or a graphic designer, or an author, or a librarian.

I dont know what to do. The only thing that I know is I can't afford to jump around in college until I find out. Maybe it would've been a better idea for me to join the army while I figured out what I wanted to do. But that's too late now. 

I dont know what I want to do with my life. I dont want to be rich, but I don't want to be just scraping by either. I dont want to be some sort of scientist, but I also don't want to let my family down. My mom said to just pick a career and stick to it, idk what to make of her advice. Am I being too dramatic? Should I stick to pre-law in spite of my doubts? What would you do if you were me?",Kitchen-Day6774,0,0.5,2,1742190836,2025-03-17 05:53:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jd5udr/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_do_with_my_life/,3,2025
1jd5s12,Aced my bootcamp... yet jobless for a year,"So I went through Flatiron ""School""'s data science bootcamp on the recommendation of a friend in software development. He seemed very sure that this would go very well, and he was very right. Learned what felt like a lot about Python, databases, machine learning, etc. It was great until it came time to get paid. 

We're given a career services advisor at the end of the camp, and it was only then that I learned that I'm dead in the water unless I can schmooze. Which I can't. I went to a meetup in NYC and awkwardly collected some LinkedIns. Got nowhere. My friend group had no leads (turns out things are much more partitioned and specialized than I understood). No bites on any resume posting sites or on any applications.

It's March. I graduated in April.

1jd233h,Career job vs higher pay,"I'm having a problem that most would dream of.  I'm currently in a director role, submitted for regional director role, and on the path to be a VP within 5 years of a large healthcare system.  By being in this role, it means that the pay is less than smaller systems, headaches are greater, and generally, I just work a lot.  I push something close to 60 hours a week, and I just don't see myself working any less anytime in the near future.  TC right now is 250, slated to be close to 300.  

I'm always applying/interviewing just to keep my interview skills sharp and get a general sense of the market, and at this point, I've had a couple of head hunters reach out to me.  Position is in pharma, away from hospitals/healthcare, but the TC is close to 400, remote, take home car, and generally, just a much easier lifestyle.  There is a quarterly travel event, but it's not any more than a day or two, and it's just mostly for meetings/events.  I've gone through the third interview so far, and looking at an offer coming in the next few weeks.

  
I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I want to leave the hospital system.  Grass isn't always greener.  

  
Pros in hospital  
\- really steady job.  The chance of me getting laid off/fired is almost nil.    
\- the devil I know vs the devil I don't. I'm very familiar with all the key players and just generally how everything works.  
\- the work is actually very easy, it's just volume.  I'm rarely stressed.    
\- we do good work; we're always working to be more efficient, better outcomes for patients, etc.

Cons in hospital  
\- pay is lower, and the chance of me getting pharma money is almost nil.

Pros in pharma  
\- pay  
\- lifestyle

Cons in pharma  
\- chance of layoff is higher by a significant margin.  My buddy was with pharma doing the same role, and while he touted his life being excellent (wfh, pay, etc.) he was laid off due to restructuring and he hasn't found another job in a year.

1jczkyc,Need insight into impending meeting with supervisor,"Hello Reddit!
I have a one on one meeting with my supervisor scheduled for this upcoming Monday, and I am in need of some advice.

Pertinent background information-

I work for a relatively small nonprofit in what is a two person department. I joined the team as a part-time employee in late 2023, and have remained somewhat stagnant in that position until recently. In December, my coworker (the manager of my department,) left in pursuit of new opportunities, and I have since taken on their workload which I have been managing with no additional hours. Initially, my former manager quietly told me not to apply for their role, as the hiring team was searching for an external hire with more experience. As the organizations luck would have it, the candidate that they extended the managerial role to has since declined, which has left us back at square one.

Now that I have obtained experience handling the job duty requirements and have met the expectations of what the manager position entails, I would like to be considered as an applicant.

I am curious if any folks here may have insight into how I may broach this topic professionally. I have been working on updating my portfolio with external freelance/contract projects, as well as obtaining new certifications that would build up my resume. If any of you have found yourself in a similar situation, I would love to hear your experience!

Thank you in advance!
(So sorry for the vagueness. I know I have coworkers on reddit, and I want to avoid any potential work weirdness.)

1jcz7rt,Want to pitch my employer on a new role for myself. Could that backfire?,"I'm at a crossroads in my career, and would appreciate any feedback on an idea I came up with on how to move forward. I've been at my current job for about 3.5 years now, and have been experiencing burnout for the past few months. More importantly, my spouse and I greatly want to move back to her hometown (hundreds of miles away) in order to be close to family. We have no family anywhere near where we currently live.

My job is unique at my company: I'm literally the only person who can do it, by virtue of where I'm located -- in a market we serve but don't have any other staff in. So, although I work mostly from home, it's not exactly a remote job, since I do occasionally need to go out into the field. All of this is to say that I wouldn't be able to relocate while working this job. (Sorry for being vague on details. I'm doing so out of an abundance of caution...hence the throwaway.)

What I'd like to do is pitch my boss on the creation of a new role for me -- one which I could do entirely remotely, from any location. I have a rough idea as to what it would entail, but would like to put together a formal pitch and perhaps even a proof of concept for the deliverables (sorry for the corporate-speak) that this new role would yield for the company.

Here's my concern: that if my boss and/or the other higher-ups reject my idea, they will look unfavorably at my job performance from that point forward. That is, they'll know that I'm burned out (because I will have just told them lol) and will look to replace me with a new hire. Or even if they don't try to rehire (since turnover and retraining is costly and time-consuming), they'll still judge me harshly, scrutinize my work extra hard, and make my job even more intolerable than it already is.

One last thing I'll note: my current job is *not* mission-critical to the company (again, sorry for the corporatespeak lol). That is, the company would certainly be fine without someone in my role, at least in the short term. My predecessor left partly due to burnout (I spoke with him to discuss the job before I accepted the offer), and the company was able to get by with the role vacant for the three months between when my predecessor left and when I began.

And, yes, I have been applying for other jobs at other companies, but to no avail. This ""alternate role"" idea is my only option at the moment, unless and until I can find another job elsewhere.",Due-Pomegranate-388,0,0.5,6,1742168691,2025-03-16 23:44:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jcz7rt/want_to_pitch_my_employer_on_a_new_role_for/,3,2025
1jcz729,Bad on boarding,"I started a new job in a creative industry at a very small West Coast company where many people have been there more than 10 years.

There were red flags during the interview process, but I ended up accepting a job offer.¬†

The position is a lower level than I‚Äôve been in the past, and a lower salary, but I‚Äôd added up the numbers and will be able to cover my bills and goals. With less staff, I was told it‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúall hands on deck‚Äù and everyone helps with everything.¬† It‚Äôs also a different product category than I‚Äôve worked on in the past. I was excited to get some new experience, and as we all know the job market is really competitive right now.

So, turns out this company likes to text each other‚Äôs personal devices, like all day long.¬† Rather than use email (creating a searchable paper trail), or an app like Teams.¬† They also start texting as early as 7am.¬† There was zero onboarding put in place for me and there is no one physically near to ask questions of so I‚Äôve been learning by trial and error.¬† I was not even given company equipment or assigned a company computer for more than 3 weeks.¬† Because the company is so small, I had to set it up myself.¬† Fine, I‚Äôm resourceful enough to do that.

I‚Äôm looking to land a remote IT job that‚Äôs fully asynchronous, like the one I had for 3 years before. I‚Äôve got a degree in Informatics with a focus on cybersecurity and I‚Äôm studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam right now.

In my last role, I worked in an agile/scrum environment, which meant a lot of independent work and time management without constant check-ins. I used tools like Teams, Confluence, and Jira to keep everything organized and communicate clearly across the team.

I also have experience in data analytics and use tools like Outlook, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Power BI to work with data and create reports. Now I‚Äôm wondering what steps I can take to keep improving my skills and make sure I‚Äôm competitive for remote roles. A few things I‚Äôd love advice on:

* How can I level up my skills even more (certs? new tools? anything else)?
* Where are the best places to find fully remote, asynchronous IT jobs?
* Any tips for staying productive and on track in an agile/scrum setup while working asynchronously?

I just gave an online assessments for a position at P&G and while the situational questions seemed to make sense and also the math ones, I completely lost it when it came to pattern recognition and remembering the order of dots appearing on the screen. I mean WTAF do these companies expect candidates to do to pass these assessments? There‚Äôs no way 98% of people can pass these assessments without some sort of external help, either in the form of another person solving questions with them or straight up cheating the system somehow. 


The worst part? I have worked in a top MNC before and seen how these assessments don‚Äôt mean shit cause many of the people hired are still quite dumb! But they somehow cleared such online assessments and managed their way through to the next interview stage and got hired. I felt I was pretty good for the position I applied for as my skills and experience matched it quite closely but I won‚Äôt get to interview stage because I did poorly on the online assessment.

1jctmma,"Higher position, less pay","Summary:

I got my CDL license three years ago in Illinois. There are plenty of job opportunities, especially for dump truck drivers hauling sand, gravel, asphalt, etc. In my second year, I met my current boss while working on a job for his asphalt, concrete, and underground company. The day I met him, he offered me a job through the winter. Before the regular season started, he asked me to stay on permanently.

After a year, I was talking with the superintendent and learned that the company needed a foreman or something similar. The company is growing quickly ‚Äî it had about 50 employees last year, and this year there are over 150.

Recently, I was offered a new position where I‚Äôd be managing workers on job sites. There isn‚Äôt an official title yet, but they said I‚Äôd essentially be a Junior Project Manager.

Previous Job (Driver):

Pay: $35/hour

Hours: averaged 70+ hours 5 days a week for 7 months. Around 60k

Season: Only 7 months long; everyone gets laid off until the next season

Setup: Drivers are treated like subcontractors ‚Äî no benefits, health insurance, 401(k), etc.


New Position:

Pros:

Company truck, phone, and a credit card for lunch expenses

After 90 days: paid holidays, sick days, PTO, and 401(k)

Year-round work


Cons:

Salary, so no overtime pay

If I work 40 hours a week (which I probably won‚Äôt), it comes out to about $23.50/hour

If I work 70+ hours a week during the 7-month busy season, it would average out to about $18/hour

Doing this job is basically working for half my hourly rate, i tried negotiating for better pay, but they kept saying I was a ""risk."" Still, they were interested in giving me the position. I know I don‚Äôt have the typical experience and that this job is usually reserved for people with a degree. However, they told me that my work ethic, leadership skills, and attitude are why I was offered the position. That gives me confidence that if I work hard, I can increase my pay over time.

I also see this as a rare opportunity. The superintendent is willing to mentor me and teach me the role, which makes me feel like this could be a major step forward. In three or so years, the company plans to hire more project managers and other skilled workers, so this could put me in a strong position long-term.

I did take a pay cut, but I feel like this could become a real career. I‚Äôm 33, and I‚Äôve spent nearly half my life working as a welder. I don‚Äôt want to get underpaid, but it‚Äôs hard to gauge the right salary for this role since the information I‚Äôve found is all over the place.

What advice would someone in this management field give me moving forward? Also, what can I do to position myself better when my work and pay are reviewed or audited?

1jcsh49,"Masters in Vocational Rehabilitation Counseling and I worked for a nonprofit, but I think I want to change careers to something in insurance (not sales) or finance.","I recently got my Masters Degree in Rehabilitation Counseling and I work for a nonprofit. I always thought that I would work at the nonprofit and move up making more money. I love the benefits I get there. I did ended up being offered a promotion I applied for, but the pay increase was not what I was expecting it to be. On top of this  when I did the math, I was going to technically end up losing money or make barely more. The position desired someone with a Masters degree, but they were offering less than a dollar more an hour and the job would have been more involved/more skill than what I was doing. I declined the promotion and ended up getting a raise for more than the promotion would have been. 

I have gotten into finance/budgeting over the last year for our family. My husband recently got a huge pay increase at his job, which is great. It was market adjustments/inflation. This made me look at my pay increase percentages over the last few years with my employer. All of my raises with the exception of one were performance based raises. I only had one market adjustment raise. Also, when I go back to look at my raises each year in relation to inflation they barely break even or fall short slightly. I am literally working harder to stay in the same spot when you compare my raises to inflation. When I realized this it made me feel so undervalued. 

The benefits I have are great: great health insurance, good amount of vacation time, sick time, 6% 401k match, 2% profit share. I would like to switch careers into something that pays well and offers similar benefits. From my initial brief research it looks like insurance and finance (I have heard there have been layoffs in this field) would have similar benefits and higher pay. I heard that some people with my degree go into insurance. I currently make in the mid $40k range. I would like to make $60k or more range. I would also like to be in a field that sees regular pay raises that keep pace or better with inflation. 

I keep going back and forth with whether to change jobs or stay where I am because my employer is nice and I have good benefits. I am willing to get a new job in a new field making a little more than I do now, while working on a degree online at a couple classes a semester in a related field that could lead to advancement after graduating. However, I would like to wait a year to change jobs, for childcare reasons. Waiting a year would give me more options, because my child would be riding the bus.

My rent is about to increase from ¬£825 to ¬£975 (not including bills), making my budget a bit too tight for comfort.

A recruiter recently contacted me about an industry role paying ¬£50K, with better holiday, a better pension, private medical, and a bonus‚Äîall benefits my current job doesn‚Äôt offer. While I may not get this specific job, I have had a look and I'm confident I could secure another similar role if not.

The dilemma is that I only recently returned to my current firm after a brief move to another practice. My employer was kind enough to take me back, and while there are potential long term career prospects here (my line partner is frequently telling me she sees me becoming a partner in the future), there are obviously no guarantees. Pay rises are likely to be around ¬£3K-¬£4K per year over the next few years.

I cannot tell you how awkward it would be to hand my notice in after only being back for a month or two and it would understandably completely burn all bridges with them.

Should I pursue jobs in industry in the ¬£50K range, or stick it out at my current firm in the hope that the long term prospects pay off (and avoid the awkwardness and disrespect of leaving)?

1jcpgiv,Any advice on how to navigate my current predicament?,"I have been working as an estimator for a defense contractor for the past 3 years. I don't have a college degree, and was working in a nursing home clinic before my last job. I am currently 30 years old and live in DFW.  

It was a great job because it was fully remote, and I was getting paid $36/hour. I got laid off for personal misconduct, although I am hopeful this won't come up during future interviews due to liability issues that companies face for disclosing too much information. 

How difficult will it be to get a new job? Any hope of getting something remote? Even if not remote, can I find something with a close to similar pay grade and a reasonable work life balance? 

Some routes i am considering are getting an AI certification or online degree, or a semiconductor certification and pursuing a career in those fields. 

Long term I would like to find a remote job so that I can perhaps live abroad and cut some expenses and save money. 

All feedback or comments are appreciated.

1jcndmf,Doubting whether to do an MBA or not - Tech background,"Qualifications : BTech in CS

Currently working as a software developer for a US bank. The money is decent (18L base), but honestly, I haven't really learned much in the past two years. To be fair, I was never that interested in coding, and I‚Äôve always felt this way about it. Now, I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm considering an MBA to transition into a different role‚Äîmaybe management, product, or something non-tech.

But the biggest question is: Is an MBA really worth it? I know it‚Äôs a common path for people looking to switch, but with the current job market, I wonder:

1. Can management roles be earned without an MBA, just through experience or certifications?

2. Do companies like Google, Amazon, etc., still value MBAs, or do they prefer internal promotions and experience?

3. Would I be making a mistake leaving behind a stable, well-paying job for the uncertainty of an MBA?

I feel like if I stay in software development long term, I might not grow much because I don‚Äôt have the natural inclination for it. But at the same time, my current salary is good, and the thought of giving that up for an MBA (and possibly lower pay for a while) is scary.

Has anyone made a similar switch or faced this dilemma? Would love to hear some perspectives!",UnluckyAsk0,1,1.0,5,1742137318,2025-03-16 15:01:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jcndmf/doubting_whether_to_do_an_mba_or_not_tech/,3,2025

I‚Äôm not really passionate about something particularly but I‚Äôve come to the realisation that I need to study or either do an apprenticeship to gain skills and experience.

A career that provides a salary for a comfortable life is ideal (as long as I‚Äôm not worried about bills). I‚Äôve looked into Accounting, Engineering and even Psychology in the university aspect and, Plumbing, Electrical/HVAC and Engineering Metal in the apprenticeship side.

In terms of what I‚Äôm good at/what I‚Äôve done; Basic Math, Beginner Physics, Engineering Metal, Visual Design (Architectural). So I do want something that doesn‚Äôt seem brand new to me.


I know I‚Äôm getting too picky‚Ä¶ but I do want something that I can ‚Äòmove up‚Äô in. The trades have really turned me off in that aspect since the only way to do this is to either start your own business or study more.

If you do recommend a university degree, please  advise me a career that won‚Äôt get replaced by AI.

1jclte6,"The stress of my job is killing me, but I'm stuck. Is this normal?","Hey guys, quick background/context-

Fresh grad here. 6 months of experience. It's very stressful, and quite frankly, between the two jobs I've had they both seem like a nightmare long-term. You're forced every day to deal with super serious stuff, make lose-lose decisions, and are expected to pull a rabbit out of a hat every day to fix them. In a normal situation, I'd say there's one ""big"" thing that would happen a week/every 2 weeks that I'd have to respond to in my job. We are having several a day. I am drowning.

My boss is even more overworked than I am, so any time I try to ask for guidance or support I can feel the irritation, despite my getting hired to have them mentor me. I also feel like the advice/feedback I do get then gets me in trouble when I use it if it doesn't work out. The stress is very quickly mounting because I feel like I'm set up for failure here and am trying my hardest to do my job as well as I can but don't have the resources or time. It's one massive, steep, uphill battle. 

Everybody at my company is very busy and stressed because we are in the middle of a unique and important time, and I do like my boss/coworkers, but it's just a lot. I'm working 11-12 hours a day, never get lunch, and I'm salaried and locked at my entry-level pay. I'm constantly told to make sure I don't burn out, but at the end of the day, I'll end up getting in trouble if it doesn't all get done so I just don't know what to do.

""Just quit"". 

I can't. I got my foot in the door with this job, which I am thankful for, as my degree is unrelated and not high value. Other positions want 2+ years of experience minimum, and I might end up in a worse company/situation anyways. I also don't want to look like a job hopper, as the market right now sucks. My long-term plan is to transition into an adjacent field, which would require more expierence and a $2000 certification, and the positions are competitive. I've been grinding very hard on my student loans while living with my parents and will have it paid off very soon. I want to move out but need a new car as I will have to give mine back soon so that's another massive expense (especially with the current political landscape). I also really want to start that certification as it takes almost a year to complete. I also need an emergency fund.

I feel like my job is sucking the air out of me, but I'm stuck. My parents want me to move out. I need the money, I need the expierence, I need the time. I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread at work, but can't leave. I'm sleeping less, eating less, and trying to stay sane. Is this just how life is for most? How do you all deal with this? I feel like I need some wisdom from somebody with more expierence than me because right now I'm up to my neck in it all.",Queasy-Chemist951,0,0.5,15,1742132877,2025-03-16 13:47:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jclte6/the_stress_of_my_job_is_killing_me_but_im_stuck/,3,2025

1jckq7o,Do I take the counter offer and stay comfortable in my job?,"I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female from the Southeast of England, and I could really use some advice on a work dilemma I‚Äôm in. My current job, while amazing for company culture and work-life balance, pays less than what I feel I deserve. I‚Äôve recently been offered a new role with a ¬£3k annual salary increase for the same job I currently do, but I‚Äôm struggling to decide between sticking with my current company or making the switch.

Here‚Äôs some context:
I‚Äôm in a fairly junior role with an annual salary band ranging from ¬£24k to ¬£27k. I‚Äôve been stuck at the bottom of that band for a while, despite working on major clients and stepping up to support my team in ways that go beyond my role. I even took on more clients to support someone else in my team at the suggestion of my manager to help my case for a promotion, but when I asked about a timeline, I was told I shouldn't expect a promotion for at least 12 months and was dismissed for even asking despite a promotion essentially being dangled above my head to get me to take on more work . Meanwhile, I found out that a new colleague (let's call her F) who joined my team with less experience than me is on a higher salary. Then, I learned that a new hire at my level was coming in with a salary matching mine, despite having little to no experience, which led me to believe that my salary wouldn‚Äôt be looked at anytime soon. This made me feel even more frustrated, as it seemed like others at my level were being paid the same or more despite having less experience. It seems in this job I am trusted to work on this big projects and clients compared to others at my level yet my salary doesn‚Äôt reflect this at all.

So, I started looking elsewhere, and after interviewing, I received an offer for ¬£27k, which is ¬£3k more than my current salary. I accepted the offer verbally, and the feedback I got from the interview process was so refreshing compared to the usual criticism I get in my current job. I also had a heart-to-heart with the head of my team about my frustrations, and he came back a few days later with a counteroffer: a ¬£2k pay rise starting next month and a promotion in 4 months, which would then put me at a higher salary than the new job offer.

Now, I‚Äôm really stuck on what to do. On one hand, my current job has the best culture and benefits I‚Äôve had in my career‚Äîthings like healthcare cashback, flexible hours, and a supportive team. I live fairly close to the office, and while the pay could be better, it‚Äôs the best place I‚Äôve worked in terms of environment. However, waiting 4 months for a promotion feels like too long, and the ¬£2k raise translates to only about ¬£120 more per month after tax, which isn‚Äôt much in the grand scheme.

On the other hand, the new job offers a slightly lower salary (for the new salary in 4 month) but is fully remote (with occasional meet-ups in Birmingham), meaning no travel costs, and the pay starts higher right away. It‚Äôs a smaller company, so I‚Äôm not sure how that will affect my career progression, but I‚Äôm also looking to move to London soon, and this remote role would allow me to do that without worrying about changing contracts. The only hesitation I have is that I‚Äôve worked remotely before and struggled with isolation, though I now have more of a social life and feel a bit more confident in handling it but still have concerns. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòdream job‚Äô by any means but it simply pays more, however where I currently am is a place I had been wanting to work for YEARS when first starting out in my career ( I didn‚Äôt go uni and have been working in my industry for around 5 years) 

I‚Äôm also aware that my current company might have a rough time if I leave, as one of my colleagues is going on sabbatical around the same time, leaving the team with less experience. But at the end of the day, I‚Äôm torn between staying for the culture and the security I have, or moving on for a better salary and more flexibility.

1jci6gj,How can I adjust this ergonomics to have less strain on my eyes and body? Is a workspace that is too bright or too dark worse? seems like those are my only 2 options.,"Hey everyone

Just started this new design job , and the workspace setup is really starting to take a toll on me. I‚Äôm crammed into a corner with a desk I can‚Äôt move much and there‚Äôs another desk right next to me and directly behind my chair‚Äîso basically, no space to adjust anything.

[https://imgur.com/a/SCAjwCC](https://imgur.com/a/SCAjwCC)

The main issues: 

1. The chair‚Äôs armrests are too low, and the desk is too high, making it hard to sit comfortably. 

2. There was a harsh overhead light shining directly at me, which I got maintenance to turn off, but now it‚Äôs too dark. 

3. There‚Äôs also constant glare, and I‚Äôm wondering if a desk lamp could help balance the lighting and reduce eye strain. The overhead light could not be dimmed... :(

4. It's really distracting all the issues of glare, bad lighting, pain in my whole body, and shooting nerve pain from the ergonomics, headaches, etc to focus on my work.  
  
I already have chronic pain and other issues before and this is making it worse and it's feeling quite depressing. Especially if I have to continue working until I die. I still have more than 40 years to go and I'm not looking forward to my health declining. 

At this point , I‚Äôm feeling constant eye strain, headaches, and just an overall urge to escape the office every day. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Would a desk lamp help with glare, or do you have other ergonomic tips to make this setup more bearable?

Would love to hear any advice‚Äîthanks in advance!

1jcf11b,Strange agreement situation,"Context: I‚Äôve been in a leadership role at a mid-sized company for a few years. Recently, I was told the company wants to make a change and that I‚Äôd be offered 2 months of severance + paying out my bonus as part of my exit.

Here‚Äôs the weird part: They told me my severance has already been processed, but they still haven‚Äôt sent me the written agreement. My boss is also pressuring me to announce my soon-to-be departure to my team, but I haven‚Äôt signed anything yet.  

What I‚Äôm wondering:
- Why would they process my severance before I sign anything?  
- What‚Äôs the best way to push for the written terms without losing leverage?  
- Since they‚Äôve already committed to paying me, should I be negotiating harder?  
- Should I tell my team now, or hold off until I have something in writing?
- I also have a piece of circumstantial evidence suggesting hiring bias against older candidates. is that worth bringing up as leverage?  
- Any other advice welcome!

1jce3ak,Got a great job offer 6 months into my first job‚Äîtorn on what to do.,"I started my first job out of college about six months ago in a tech field. I love my manager and my team‚Äîthey‚Äôre great mentors and have been really good to me. I‚Äôm learning a lot and still very much feel like a newbie. The pay is solid for my city, but it‚Äôs on the lower end for my field.

Recently, I got approached by another company for a role with more responsibility, less hand-holding, and a 35% pay increase. A friend works there and says the vibe is okay‚Äînot bad, just not as great as my current team.

The big con? The commute. Right now, I have a 30-minute bike ride to work in a really nice part of the city. The new job would be a 1-hour bus ride, though I‚Äôd only need to go in twice a week.

Ideally, I‚Äôd stay in my current job for another year to gain more experience before making a move like this. But there‚Äôs no guarantee a similar opportunity will be available later‚ÄîI have this offer right now.

I‚Äôm only 25, and jumping from $80K to $110K (and other bonuses) would make a big difference and might lead to home buying in the not-so distant future. The new company also seems to have better mid-to-long-term growth opportunities. But part of me feels underqualified‚Äîthis field is still new to me, and I worry about taking on too much too soon.

TL;DR: Got a great job offer 6 months into my first job. Current job = great manager, great location, good salary, but limited long-term growth. New job = way better pay, longer commute, potentially more stress. Ideally, I‚Äôd wait a year before making a move, but there‚Äôs no guarantee an offer like this will come again soon.",Infinite-Map3801,1,1.0,1,1742101072,2025-03-16 04:57:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jce3ak/got_a_great_job_offer_6_months_into_my_first/,3,2025
1jcdppn,How to navigate out of restaurant management?,"Hi! 

I‚Äôm looking for a field that will get me out of restaurants. My dream is to open my own place one day, but I‚Äôm tired of working for other people in this industry and the extreme stress that comes with it, so I need a break. I am 25 and have been doing food service management since I was 17, working in it since I was 15. 


An idea of my skills:
I have worked in both small mom and pop fine dining establishments, up to large corporate hotel chains. I have experience running all kinds of restaurants as well as bars and cafes. Obviously I can serve and bartend but I‚Äôm trying to avoid that. I have managed staff sizes of up to 30 people. I am well versed in payroll using multiple softwares, hiring, disciplinary actions, training, coaching, and scheduling. I have great Excel skills, and have done the bookkeeping for quite a few businesses I‚Äôve worked for, including using programs like Quickbooks. I have picked up lots of odds and ends skills like tons of knowledge of restaurant machinery (also sold restaurant machinery for a couple years), extensive wine knowledge, and how to fix coffee equipment. I have great people skills and customer service skills. I‚Äôve done all of the marketing, graphic design, and social media for several places I‚Äôve worked for. And finally I‚Äôve done a ton of cash handling, deposits, etc.

1jcdaty,Company is offering me additional salary instead of PTO,"Currently interviewing with a company that is offering me a base $150k salary but the recruiter explained that they do not offer any PTO.

 Instead the company takes 26 days of PTO and adds that to my overall salary that I would be paid instead. 

 So my actual salary would be 166k but no PTO, I would also get 7 days of sick leave each year as well.

 Is there anything I am missing with this offer?

The recruiter said that the company does offer unlimited unpaid time off and I can take it anytime I want with manager approval.

 It seems kind of weird to me, but technically it works out the same as just getting PTO paid out.

I wanted to share my¬†**bioinformatics job search experience**¬†and see if anyone has advice or has been in a similar situation.

I completed my¬†**Master‚Äôs in Bioinformatics from a top Russel group UK University**¬†and have been actively applying for¬†**bioinformatics, computational biology, and Research assistant roles**¬†for over a year now. I even started applying while I was still studying¬†**in 2024**. As an¬†**international graduate on a Graduate Visa (valid for two years),**¬†I will require sponsorship in the future, which adds an extra layer of challenge.

In¬†**mid-2024**,¬†**I secured two interviews**\- one role required an immediate start, which I couldn‚Äôt do as an international master's student in the UK, and the other ended up hiring a PhD candidate instead.¬†**After that, I didn‚Äôt receive any interview calls**¬†**until February 2025**.¬†**My most recent interview**¬†was a structured process with multiple panel members in a Q&A format, and I felt it went well. The team seemed happy and initially mentioned a two-week response time, and I received an update after following up that I am not selected.

At this point, I‚Äôm feeling quite exhausted. I‚Äôve had my¬†**CV and cover letter reviewed by career coaches**,¬†**alumni**, and¬†**even employees at top companies and hiring managers**¬†on LinkedIn. Everyone says it‚Äôs¬†**well-structured**, and my¬†**LinkedIn is optimised and am also updating my GitHub**.¬†**I customise my CV and Cover Letter for every application**, research companies, and ask thoughtful questions in interviews. Yet, I keep hearing that¬†**other candidates have more experience**, making it incredibly hard to break into the industry. Also,¬†**not everyone provides feedback**, even when I follow up post-interview.

**A little bit about me:**

**üß¨ NGS & Multi-Omics Expertis**e¬†‚Äì Experienced in RNA-Seq, Bulk RNA Sequencing, and High-Throughput Sequencing Pipelines to extract meaningful patterns.

I‚Äôve been expanding my skills in¬†**NGS pipelines, DNA/ RNA-seq, scRNA-seq data analysis and cloud computing (Nextflow, Snakemake)**, but I still feel like I‚Äôm struggling to break into the field.

# My Questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£¬†**If I‚Äôm constantly getting compared to more experienced candidates, what alternative routes should I consider?**¬†I am doing self-learning projects but is there any¬†**internships, contract roles, freelance or startup positions**¬†that could help me gain experience?  
2Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Are there any key skills UK recruiters are looking for that I may be missing?**  
3Ô∏è‚É£¬†**How important are publications?**¬†I‚Äôve done¬†**six bioinformatics projects**, gaining expertise in¬†**multi-omics integration, genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, machine learning, and NGS pipelines**, but I lack published papers due to project delays. How do I showcase my expertise without formal publications?  
4Ô∏è‚É£¬†**Should I include my part-time customer-facing job in the food industry on my resume?**¬†I worked there for a few months to support myself, but I‚Äôm unsure if it makes employers think I‚Äôve moved away from bioinformatics. Should I list it or remove it?  
5Ô∏è‚É£¬†**What else can I do to stand out more in interviews and applications?**¬†Apart from tailoring applications, researching companies, and preparing for interviews, is there anything else that helped you land a role?

1jc8bay,Why do I have such a negative attitude about my new middle management role? How can I at least stay for a year or two?,"Worker in my late 20s. I have 7 years experience in this niche (but great) industry. It has overall been very good to me.

I have largely been operations. I wanted to be more so on the 'brokerage' side. Now I'll say right off the bat that just about¬†***everyone***¬†wants to make this switch, so there is that dynamic in play. Brokerage is very saturated and competitive, but can be a very amazing life if it works out.

In my spot, let's say I am an¬†*amazing*¬†operations person, but also think I could be a good broker too. However, I have more immediate value and more of a competitive edge as an ops person.

And in my spot, my company¬†**did**¬†give me a brokerage shot. And I am 100% convinced that I inherited a very unfair situation...would go so far to say I actually got screwed.

So right now, I got transferred to an operations management job. And I actually think I¬†**should**¬†stick it out for a year or two, to get some actual management experience. And I'm still young, and will have plenty of time to get different/better jobs in my career if all goes well.

So here are the things in my job I should feel good about:

* My base pay package is great. I'm also earning a lot more than the individual contributors in my department, so I can't complain about 'management' not being worth it.
* I'm really good at my job, to the extent that I am comfortable/settled in, can help other departments, feel good about myself, etc. I am good enough at my job that I feel comfortable never really working late, etc.
* I never have had serious negative feedback, and I can't just assume I'd also be a top performer in a different kind of job.
* My team is amazing and hard working, so I don't often have to do the 'harder' and more negative parts of management.
* It's way easier to be a 'normal' person and have a normal life in this role. In brokerage, there was constant pressure to be on the road, to make it seem like you had all the answers, etc.

Now here are the things that are making me feel negative about my job.

* In my company, and industry wide, operations is just treated differently. Again, it's just not on an equal playing field and never will be. The actual brokerage people are still making quite a bit more than me. And again, in my head I'm kinda convinced I should be doing that job.
* I do plenty of things outside my job title, things that make a real difference for my company financially. And I don't always feel like I get a fair share of the cut.
* In general, I know the senior employees are getting a better deal relatively than I am. And the two senior partners are awful people personally, so that probably affects my opinion.
* I'm borderline convinced I'm 'too proficient at my job for my own good,' in the sense that I am probably too helpful for people and then get stuck doing stuff forever.
* I often feel like I don't get treated with respect of being a 'manager,' and I guarantee it would be different if I was 45 years old.
* In general, in my head I have a feeling that I'm a capable smart business person, and I should have more of a say on things. But I don't. Again though, I am comparing myself to senior employees who are 10 or 20 years older than me.

So...I am pretty convinced that this is not the right 'long term' job for me, but it's one that I'm good at. And I'm pretty convinced I should do it for AT LEAST a year, probably 2.

However, I have this burning chip on my shoulder that I should have a 'better' job. How can I calm down a bit?

I'm worried I'm not being pragmatic about it, and I'll instantly jump to any decent job (would probably pay a bit worse and set me back). I already did this once before, and really regret how I handled it all.

1jc671q,How much should I ask for PM role?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm currently uncertain about my starting salary and would like some advice. Here's a bit of background about my experience:

I worked in construction from ages 15 to 21, where I managed projects, subcontractors, and inspections. After being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, I shifted to an office job in real estate for three years. When COVID hit, I transitioned to target operations as a team lead, where I've been for the past four years.

Recently, I aimed for a role in property management but ended up in roofing instead, starting at a salary of $50,000 despite having no prior knowledge of the field. My initial responsibilities were limited to delivering materials and taking photos.

After a year and a half in this role, I would like to negotiate my salary back to $60,000, which I previously earned. I took a pay cut due to my lack of experience and a desire for a change. I am eager to grow my skills and want my salary to reflect my contributions to the business.

What I do know is that I love this job because it's a small, third-generation company where I can expand my role as long as the owner allows it. My current responsibilities include:

- Conducting walk-throughs with clients
- Taking photos
- Acting as an on-site supervisor
- Scheduling
- Engaging in warm selling (knocking around the block when we do a project)
- Organic marketing (writing blogs and DIYs)
- Creating YouTube Shorts and videos to the best of my ability
- Implementing site marketing (which the company had never done before I started)
- in charge of the entire shingle division *haven't don't commercial tpo yet*

What do you recommend I should learn to become a better asset to the company, helping me negotiate a better salary? I dislike asking for more if I don't feel like I am contributing enough. 

I really want to earn my pay, and I'm open to taking on more responsibilities as long as I can perform them correctly and efficiently.

1jc5vry,Skipping work due to Lack of motivation,"It's been a more than year since I have graduated in Electrical Engineering (major: electronics) and ever since I have been working at this company.

Previously I used to be a production line engineer working on machines installed on assembly lines but higher management decided to remove me from lines and changed my JD to just reporting for the department.

Recently I cannot be a regular employee skipping 
once or twice work days a week due to laziness, lack of sleep, lack of appreciation and respect. As a result I have developed a very bad reputation and manager especially keeps an eye on me.

How can I turn this around and how can I handle my manager professionally when he asks me about my attendance.

I am not blaming anyone but how can I escape this situation need help from senior engineers who have faced lack of motivation once in their careers.

1jc4siv,Opportunity for change or gambling with my sanity,"I have been working at my company for 8 years, current department for 2. I‚Äôve been unmotivated and just wanting a change for awhile, but I worry about being able to find something in a different industry since I‚Äôve worked the last 15 years in education. I like the type of work I do - like the actual tasks - I just want to be a different environment and industry.

Meanwhile, the boss I‚Äôve had is a bad boss. They mismanage and projects, share/keep information strategically, hide behind good employees, change expectations regularly, and essentially pushed my colleague out after they reported this boss for ethical concerns. I, however, am one of their ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù, i assume because I‚Äôm too disengaged to push back with any real energy. So I saw all this stuff but was more of a pawn than a victim to it (though I tried to support my colleagues wherever possible).

About a month ago this boss got a new job in finance and asked me to join their new team. I‚Äôve mostly thought I would do it because it would be a way to get a foot in the door, make more money, and I would plan to transfer to a different department as soon as I could. 

So, though they knew for a month, this boss decided to give 2 days notice before leaving my current company. In the week since, I‚Äôm getting to see how chaotic they‚Äôve left things (even more than I knew before). And so I called the colleague who got pushed out to ask if I would be making a huge mistake if I take a job with this boss. They basically said that if I‚Äôm not in need of the money (it‚Äôd be nice but I‚Äôm fine financially), it‚Äôs not worth it as the boss is emotionally unstable and the colleague is still recovering 6 months later, and that if I start any type of pushback, Ill get the same treatment. They were understanding though of the appeal of the job and also gave me tips about how to handle the boss and approach to ensure a quick transfer if I do take it.

I‚Äôm torn. I also haven‚Äôt received the official offer and of course the compensation will be a huge deciding factor. 

What should I do?

pros:
- [ ] More money (expecting about 15-20% more overall compensation) 
- [ ] Way out of a company I feel jaded working at and that I may have trouble finding a similar role
- [ ] Will give me experience in finance industry which is desirable in my field 
- [ ] May be able to transfer after a year into a better boss and better role once I get my foot in the door 

cons:
- [ ] Terrible, terrible boss so the stress would be 
- [ ] I may not be able to transfer quickly and worst case scenario, I get pushed out 
- [ ] It‚Äôs not really the same role I am currently in and that I like and ultimately want to stay in. It is adjacent 
- [ ] current job is very stable. I don‚Äôt think the offer is particularly unstable, but probably a bit less so ",EmergencyRaccoon7396,1,1.0,2,1742071705,2025-03-15 20:48:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jc4siv/opportunity_for_change_or_gambling_with_my_sanity/,3,2025

1jc393e,Ideas for freelancing jobs while pivoting careers?,"Hi. Sorry, I‚Äôll delete if this post is inappropriate here. I know this is probably better-suited for the Freelancer subreddits but the few there are seem either be inactive or require a minimum karma. I‚Äôve had this account for a while but am mainly active on my other account. I want this account to be more professionally-focused.

28F. I‚Äôve been wanting to start freelancing so I can get my feet wet & into consulting eventually for some time now. I will need some extra to make the bills this month, so I figured why not make a go of it now? Worst case, it doesn‚Äôt work out & I can drive DoorDash for a few days to stay afloat before figuring something out for next month. 

My niche will be in the financial industry for sure. I worked in banking for about 6-7 years (since I was 19) until getting a payroll processor job (which I recently left). Also, i‚Äôm on my last semester for a Bachelors of Business Admin in Management Info Systems if that matters. I think i‚Äôm really good at writing & have gotten many compliments on my professional writing style throughout my career, from emails to reports, i‚Äôm very detail-oriented & thorough. I actually want my consulting work to focus mainly on building training programs & skills development when I get there. I love stories & explaining/making sense of things to people (though how good I am at that is probably not for me to say legitimately), so I thought maybe technical writing to start but I don‚Äôt have a portfolio for that. I also have dabbled with creating instructional visuals like slide decks & infographics. 

I thought about trying Cx Consulting for financial business too because, reluctantly, customer service is my best skill; but that‚Äôs an actual discipline & i‚Äôll want to study for a bit to feel comfortable guiding clients. I‚Äôm also knowledgable in GRC & Info Security but likewise, not at the level where I feel confident offering services out the gate. 

I‚Äôm looking for something I can sort of just start & see what contracts I can come up with in 3 weeks. I have the time to put into it right now and with my professional experience I think that‚Äôs a reasonable ask & timeframe. What services do you guys think I should try to start out and what methods do you suggest to target clients?

I‚Äôm a female engineering tech at an underground mine, two months in, and I‚Äôm already done. They sold me on using my drafting skills, but I‚Äôm stuck installing ground monitors and rock bolts‚Äîphysically brutal and a total waste of my talents. Pay‚Äôs solid at $83K/year, but I relocated 600 km from my fianc√©‚Äôs family for this, and if I quit soon, they‚Äôll claw back $5K of my moving costs. I‚Äôve pushed my supervisor about growth, and he acted offended‚Äîlike I‚Äôm moving too fast by wanting more than grunt work. It‚Äôs a dead end, and my skills are rotting.

Here‚Äôs the twist: I just accepted a new offer as a mine technologist in ventilation‚Äî$88K base, 10% isolation bonus, 9% vacation pay (~$104K total), plus a $15K relocation bonus. It‚Äôs fly-in, fly-out (FIFO), leverages my drafting and planning skills, and gets me out of Ontario, which I‚Äôve been itching to do. The catch? I‚Äôd need to move to St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland, within 12 months‚Äî2,500 km east‚Äîand while my fianc√©‚Äôs on board now, it‚Äôs a big ask long-term. His job‚Äôs just a service writer gig, nothing major, but he‚Äôs comfy where we are.

The $15K relocation won‚Äôt fully offset the $5K clawback (my prorated vacation payout at ~$738 won‚Äôt cover it either), plus movers and rent for the move.

1jc0bmm,My employer did me wrong & is taking advantage right?,"[CA] One year ago, I was promoted to Business Director and then a week later, demoted down to assistant because corporate allegedly said I couldn't be hired at the low rate I accepted due to ""contracts"". It smelled like BS but I was ok with it because I wasn't sure I was ready for the responsibilities of a director. Between March-May of last year I was told I would get the director promotion in either June or December a long with a big raise. Radio silence until late December when my boss, who was promoted from business director to assistant executive director (AED) set her sights on an ED position at another location. It was the implied a few times that if she got promoted, I would finally get my promotion.

The writing has been on the wall and deep down, I've known I was being used and that to save $$$ (this is a horrible industry where EDs get bonuses based on profitability and occupancy) they would keep me in my current role doing 80% of the directors job. I've been watching it happen to another director who is severely underpaid and doing the work of 2 directors with no support. 

2 weeks ago, my boss got her promotion. Absolutely nothing has been said about mine but in preparation for her departure, she's slowly showing me how to do things I'll have to start doing until we get a new AED (they are about to promote someone from another property who will be our AED). No talk about additional compensation for taking on the final 20% of the directors job. The day she announced her promotion, during the morning huddle, she also announced that our location will not have a business director anymore, it will have an assistant director and an AED who is training to be an ED. 

I think considering they've dangled the carrot in front of me for a year and have now removed all possibility of me getting the original promotion they gave me a year ago, I think they should have told me about this major change sooner and not in a room full of people, am I right?

For the last year I have done 80% of the directors job. The other 20% are tasks I can't do because I can't have access since I am not a director. I also think some are things my boss just didn't want to give up control of. I have had very little training and now I know why. Shortly after I became an assistant director, I was asked to support a department that had no director. I ran that department for 4 months and got it back on track until a director was hired. Never got any thanks and yesterday when talking to the ED, apparently it is a problem that I am still the go-to person for that department. I have stepped back considerably, because the director of that department is failing miserably but as long as we aren't getting ombudsmen complaints, the ED and AED don't care. 

So there has been no discussion with me about changes to my role, since the AED is leaving. There should have been, since I have working outside of the scope of my position and using her credentials for some tasks. I also forgot to mention that I was the interim business director from June-November 2024 when the ED was on leave and the AED was the interim ED. 

I forgot to mention that the Business Director manages the 3-5 front desk employees. The assistant supervises and trains them. It's a butt in seat job that requires coverage from 7am-8pm per state regulations. When someone calls off or no-call no-shows, the director has to cover the front desk, period. So starting in June, I took on that responsibility. I came when no one else would. I stayed late to cover the front desk when no one else could. To this day I have done it. I have handled the call offs and found coverage on my days off or been the one to come in. All because I thought I would be promoted to director. I am an hourly
Employee so legally, they know they shouldn't be having me manage staffing issues off the clock. 

So now that my promotion isn't happening, I'm no longer willing to sacrifice my personal time and time with my family, when there is no coverage for the front desk. It's not the assistants responsibility, it is the directors. 

So I talked to the ED yesterday, because earlier this week I was offered a similar position elsewhere and I accepted it but then had serious doubts about it being a good fit and at the time, I was heartbroken to leave my coworkers and residents. But again, after all that has happened, I no longer want to be a slave to the front desk. So I asked if that would still be the expectation moving forward and I was told that yes, even though the AED is a business director training to be an ED, the assistant will still be responsible for front desk coverage and be required to cover the front desk when no one else could. FUCK!

4 times in 7 months, someone has resigned due to school, moving and/or getting a full time job. The front desk is a part time job that doesn't pay a competitive wage when it should because of what they have to deal with. So 4 times in 7 months, I have had to cover the front desk multiple days a week for 3-4 weeks someone was hired and trained. I had to cancel things, put things on hold, miss my kids football and softball games and I am done. I
Wasn't allowed to come in 2 hours early in the days I had to work the front desk, just to get stuff done because they didn't want to pay me overtime. So every time this happens, my work
Piles up and then in my haste to get caught up, I make mistakes that have to be fixed. 

One of my employees just let me know he's going to be giving notice because he too got a better job. Good for him, he's been taken advantage of here too. So this means, if I stay, I once again have to make sacrifices until the new person is hired and trained. 

I talked to my ED yesterday and told her I have an offer for similar role. She did not even attempt to get me to stay. When I told her my feeling were hurt when I had to find out in a room full of people, that there will not be a business director, I didn't get any sort of acknowledgment that my feelings were valid or that she and the AED could have handled this better.

I also, before she told me that the assistant IS responsible for front desk coverage, told her I didn't feel supported a month ago when an employee resigned and I told the AED we had no coverage for the PM shift 3 days a week. I did not want to have to pick up those shifts because they wouldn't let me come in 2hrs early to keep my work from piling up. She told me to ask the directors if any of their staff wanted to pick up hours at the front desk. That's all the advice I got. So I reached out and got ignored. So I had to work those shifts for 3 weeks. And again at that time, I thought all of these sacrifices would pay off in the end. I didn't know that this front desk BS was officially my responsibility because they never told me! So this doesn't surprise me because I've heard from other directors that anytime they tell the ED or AED that they feel unsupported, neither of them care and take no responsibility. They offer no words of encouragement, zero validation is given. They turn it around on you. The whole reason I even brought this up was because I don't want this responsibility anymore since it's a director-level responsibility and because they made me handle a staffing crisis when it wasn't my responsibility and then no one supported me--which I now know this WAS my problem to deal with. But again, they didn't tell me it was so in my mind, I felt like they pushed this responsibility on a low level employee who shouldn't have had to deal with it in the first place. 

I am scared to take this new position as I would be walking in to a dumpster fire that needs to be cleaned up. But after yesterdays discussion, I want out of here now. I've been used for a year. When the ED came back from leave, she publicly thanked the AED and the care coordinator who is lazy AF and keeps running off all the nurses. I got zero recognition for running 2 departments at once and supporting a 3rd (I still have to support the 3rd department to this day but have never once gotten a thank you or any recognition for). 

Am I right that these f*ckers have used me for a year and are willing to lose me since I won't put up with this anymore? I should just take the new job  but continue the job search and if the new jobs turns out to be horrible, get out as quick as I can? Anything is better than the way I am being treated now. I just can't believe it's come this. I am so stressed out here and it's taking a toll on my body and yet I'm still afraid to put in my notice. This is insane :(

Currently deciding between staying at my current firm or leaving for greener pastures. 

I‚Äôm young in my career, I like my gig, co workers are great. 
Hybrid Schedule, very laxed on this. 

However the pay, with the increase in everything lately is mediocre for Chicago. Currently make 60k.

If I have a good job, feel content here, should I risk leaving for only the pay. Current roles I‚Äôve interviewed at are hybrid more strict, increased responsibilities.

1jbzp7y,"Two very different positions and offers, scared to pick the wrong one.","I‚Äôve been in my current role for less than a year and decided it wasn‚Äôt going to work for me. Over the past few weeks I‚Äôve applied out elsewhere and have two different positions to consider at this point, both positions begin the start of next month. 

One is a position in facilitation. I am good at this and I enjoy it. I have about 6 years experience in facilitation and find it rewarding and fun. This position comes with a 2K pay cut from my current position but I feel like I would thrive in this position and it switches gears into a more relaxed career path than the one I am on and have been wanting to migrate from for way too long. I have pigeonholed myself in my field so this truly feels like a breath of fresh air for me. I really enjoyed my interview time and I loved giving a presentation to the hiring managers who wanted me on the spot. 

The second position is case management and coordination of a specialized program in social work more in line with what I‚Äôve done historically. It‚Äôs a 15-20K pay raise from my current position. I have 18 year experience with SOME of the tasks of this job and zero experience with other tasks of it (budget management and staffing my own team for example). I feel there will be a steep learning curve and it‚Äôs a new position in the company, I‚Äôd be the first one to take it on with all its growing pains. The demographics I would be working with in terms of program function, are also very specific and already feels like a bit of a ‚Äúboys club‚Äù during my three interviews. I‚Äôd be the only woman on my team that I‚Äôd be managing. I believe I have the skills to build relationships quickly, but I also know that there are many players in this position I‚Äôd have to appeal to, eventually there will be conflict, which I‚Äôm not inexperienced with professionally but am working with a very niche team built on their lived experiences (so they may always feel like their opinions weigh more heavily than someone who doesn‚Äôt have this lived experience). There are several things about this job I know I would love, but equal amounts of things that will be challenging and I will undoubtedly experience lateral violence in. The salary is higher than one I thought I could ever achieve. 

In the first option the pay cut seems to be the only downfall without actually being employed there to see the true underbelly. The second option pays extremely well and is culturally relevant to me which is a huge motivator, but I know I‚Äôll have challenges that will require a good supportive team which again I won‚Äôt know about until I‚Äôm there. 

Do I take the risk on the high paying career hoping the team is inherently working towards a common goal and will be excited to work with me, or do I take the position where I already feel so confident in despite the wage losses?

1jbysk6,Company trying to replace me as a lead,"Hello everyone, hopefully this is the right thread to ask this question. 

I have a tricky situation and I'm a bit lost on what to do. I'm working for an international company, but not directly - officially I'm working via local company - so I'm essentially a contractor for my client. Over the years I became a lead and successfully led a team, everything was and is great, I had multiple businesses trips and there were no questions in terms of my work as I was trying my best to deliver. 

A few days ago client said that for the business it's a big risk to rely so heavily on a contractor. And they will find a new lead and I will be led by him. 

Of course I get it from their business point of view. I asked many times if I can somehow become their permanent member of staff, but the answer was always no (even though I head about such cases and they client just bought out the worker and he became permanent). 

I was trying to find out how it will influence my job and my salary. Local company assured me that there will be no salary changes. 

I really like to lead people, this is my place. I love the project that I work on and I don't want to lose it. What should I do? What you would've done in my place? Should I just accept this fact or move the company? The fear is that eventually I might be fully replaced with this new lead and I will become useless.

1jbyn21,Trying to figure out what career I should do. Any advice is appreciated,"Hello all, 

On the advice of a close friend, I have decided to ask reddit for advice. I've had a lot of different jobs in my life (retail, grocery store, construction, landscaping, parking enforcement, security, warehouse, factory, city worker, postman etc.) 

I'm trying to find a career that I can do long-term and thoroughly enjoy. I really want to go to school for something as I have never completed any post-secondary education. 

Below is my criteria for a good career; 

* Generally working Monday to Friday, having weekends off 
* A job that lets me present information that I find important to people who actually want to listen
* A job that let's me be somewhat creative, maybe with writing or creating PowerPoints 
* Ideally 8 hour shifts a day, nothing to early or too late 
* Ideally at a reasonable time (8 or 9 am to 4 or 5 pm)¬†
* $50,000 income per year or more¬†
* Allows me to help people, make the world a better place¬†
* Mentally challenging and stimulating¬†
* Physically challenging and stimulating, keeps me somewhat active throughout the day
* Not too physically demanding as I am not the most resilient physical specimen 
* Future proof and recession proof, will not likely be replaced by AI in the next 30 years¬†
* I make friends at work each day instead of enemies¬†
* 3 - 4 weeks of paid vacation every year¬†
* A job that makes me a better person, that is exciting and allows for personal development¬†
* A job that I could possibly move up in, that is secure
* I don‚Äôt want to be concerned about being assaulted every day at work

I have already considered being a teacher but am not super interested, I was thinking more of a public speaker of some sort but I can't seem to find a subject I can specialize in. I love to travel and have traveled a fair bit in my life. I was currently thinking about sales in the travel in industry because it's something I'm passionate about. I don't mind dressing up and presenting, it's something that I enjoy.  

  
Any advice is helpful,

1jbx7ux,Thinking about quitting a job during onboarding,"I think I know where I stand on this but I figured I'd post it since it's been weighing a lot on me and maybe I can get a viewpoint I hadn't considered or some guidance. To keep this short, I just retired from the military and have been job hunting for six months. An insurance company that prides itself on employing and serving military members is in my hometown and for years I dreamed of working for them, however over time I've heard from multiple people who work there how the morale is awful there and lots of changes have caused it to go down hill. I initially applied to several staff positions with no luck when I finally applied to work their call center in property claims. 

About two months prior to that on a whim, I applied to a university that is the local ""off shoot"" of a bigger state level university to be an academic advisor. Initially this was out of desperation and I was trying different career paths that I hadn't considered since getting a job that related to my degree was becoming fruitless. While the university has been EXTREMELY slow with their hiring process, I've started to really get excited at the idea of working for them because I can really see myself liking that atmosphere, it allows me to pursue a master's degree, and after twenty years of being in the military I want to focus on my mental health which I believe this job will allow me to do that. Additionally, I've liked the communication between myself and my potential boss during this several month process and the vibes were great during both interviews. She reached out this week informing me that she would be contacting my references so this gives me the idea that I'm about to get an offer.

The insurance company reached out with a job offer this week, however, it went from property claims to auto claims which I've been told from several people to avoid auto at all costs (I've read stories of PTSD in auto on their subreddit here). To me that was a red flag but I was pressured to sign the offer letter immediately since they want me to start onboarding in a week. The insurance job is a good bit of more money but the schedule is hectic and I'm worried about my stress. I just got out of the military where I was working crazy schedules and stressed like crazy so I want some more stability in my life since I owe it to my kids and partner. 

Since the university job is taking so long to get back to me with the official offer (and who knows when the actual start date would be), how bad would it be to work the insurance job for a few weeks, start onboarding and training just to collect a paycheck since money is starting to get tight but then quit on the spot once I have something secure with the university? I feel this lets me confirm if the insurance job is right or not for me and gives me a back up in case I regret taking it. While shady, I don't think it's the worst thing since I know they'd let go of me in a heart beat but I do worry about getting black listed by them if the university job doesn't work out and I need something fast since the insurance company would hire me due to my military background.",Ov-Skorpius,3,1.0,1,1742051477,2025-03-15 15:11:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbx7ux/thinking_about_quitting_a_job_during_onboarding/,3,2025

I love great conversations but not so extroverted that any and all conversations will do. I'd much rather not have a conversation than have one with annoying people. That said, I absolutely love a good, positive conversation with a person or persons. It's like a drug to me. Feels me with so much positive energy.

I get too depressed at home.

It doesn't have to be astronomical, but I'd say at least 75-80k a year, which many jobs in my area happen to pay. I've got brain fog about what to do. I do need to pay the bills, but this is // much about finding fulfillment in my job, from an extrovert's perspective. I just don't know what that is and while I don't expect anyone here to know either, I was just hoping for some suggestions from anyone that can relate to this. Thank you üôè and sorry for writing so damn much. I'm often too descriptive.

1jbuxzj,NP or masters in ML/ MATH,"Hi. My goal has always been to own my own entertainment company ever since I was young. I didn‚Äôt know about machine learning, math,statistics, analysis or any of that when I was in college.

I graduated in 2020 I got a degree in Media and after a couple of corporate jobs, I was pressured into getting a degree in nursing because It offered me more flexibility and it made my parents happy.

now I can work on my true passion on the days that I‚Äôm not working, which is four days out of the week.

however they want me to get an advanced degree and I‚Äôm kind of interested in getting one too.

however, the next step for a nurse would be a nurse practitioner. I really don‚Äôt wanna be a nurse practitioner, I would just be going through the motions to make my parents happy.

I‚Äôm really deeply interested in how Computer science, data science, machine learning and math can help me grow my business. I didn‚Äôt realize how much technology and owning an entertainment business collided- like I said I didn‚Äôt have real world experience until after my first bachelors.

Anyways, I‚Äôm thinking- what if I get a masters in something Math, data science or a machine learning related to help me make real world decisions that help me grow my company?  or should I just stick to going to NP school get a better return on investment and learn all the other things myself since going to school isn‚Äôt required to be an entrepreneur. My question is what do you guys think? What has the better ROI considering my goals?",Low_Professional_253,1,1.0,5,1742044775,2025-03-15 13:19:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbuxzj/np_or_masters_in_ml_math/,3,2025

1jbuqx1,Is this even worth it for a dream job?,"So I‚Äôm in a weird position in work right now. I(21F) got promoted internally and before I actually start the position, they have me doing a test run. So I‚Äôm getting paid as a low tier employee but doing work that is senior level. I am a full time student that has class mon-Thursday 2 hours away and then have to come into work every weekend to ‚Äúprove‚Äù myself at this job. One problem with this alone is I feel like I‚Äôm living two different lives and neither are enjoyable. Another problem is the fact I only go in on the weekends makes me feel like every-time I go in I have to catch myself back up with the projects I‚Äôm doing. They are loading complex IT projects on me that usually are run by a project manager with a team of people, (I don‚Äôt even have my degree yet). Redesigning current systems, compiling tens of thousands of sheets into databases, writing lines of code for automation. It‚Äôs also high stakes because they have to buy expensive licensing to even be able to use some of the programs these projects need. I also really need the job when I graduate so I‚Äôve just been saying yes I can do that (again I know this is also a problem but my boss makes me so nervous I don‚Äôt know how to say no) and then spending all week teaching myself on YouTube, doing test runs on mock up data, reading textbooks, reading self help books (I do have prior experience in this but only from what I‚Äôve learned so far in my degree so not really). I so badly need a mentor or someone who can help me but all the data is confidential to even the people at my company. The part of my brain that thinks about work NEVER shuts off. 

Every Thursday after class I drive home for work, like clockwork the pit in my stomach comes back. I feel like I haven‚Äôt done enough to prepare to do my work (I don‚Äôt have a work computer so I can‚Äôt work on it outside of work hours), I picture myself sitting in the cubicle with no one to ask questions and my boss asking me when these projects will be done. Every morning before work I wake up with anxiety so bad it usually ends in puking. At work I used to have a really good reputation in my old job and I just feel like I‚Äôm ruining it by being the person I‚Äôve recently been at work. An anxious mess who loses their filter out of nervousness, is off putting and unable to have a conversation with even my coworkers who are really good friends but I just see in passing. It doesn‚Äôt help that my boss now is very and I mean very intimidating. Sometimes when I start talking and he gives me a disapproving look, it‚Äôs like I black out from anxiety, forget what I was saying, and then stutter to get the thought out. I just sound so stupid and I overcompensate by trying to sound smart using IT jargon but I don‚Äôt even know why I do that, it makes me cringe thinking about it. I feel like I have imposter syndrome but it‚Äôs deeper than that. There isn‚Äôt 1 person I work with that knows ANYTHING about IT. Every single time I leave work I picture all of the weird things I said and did and just cry in my car. I go home and just start troubleshooting the problems I ran into during the workday for the next week. I hate myself so much and the person I am at work I can‚Äôt even begin to go on. I never felt like this in my old role I genuinely loved being at work. The long term benefits are really good but I feel like I‚Äôm in hell right now and don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôll ever reach my goals because if I‚Äôm not able to deliver results and continue being this off putting weird little anxious person that no one can talk to I won‚Äôt even be kept in my old role. This job has been the best part of my life until they started this trial it makes me sick that it‚Äôs going this way.  Idk what to do. Did I mention the job I have I also am grossly under qualified for so I feel like I‚Äôm using 100% of my brain all the time. My ‚Äútrial‚Äù ends in May (my graduation). Aka if it doesn‚Äôt go well I‚Äôm also unemployed and have just wasted all the time I had with actual resources for a job hunt. Wish me luck I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll make it.

1jbumve,Stuck in a career that‚Äôs draining me‚Äîhow do I transition out?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm feeling completely stuck in my career and unsure how to move forward. I‚Äôm not just looking for advice on a specific path‚ÄîI need help figuring out a whole new direction because the one I‚Äôm on just isn‚Äôt working for me anymore.

# A little about me:

I just turned 30 and have come to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm not the type of person my career demands. Looking back, I realize I‚Äôve burned myself out by forcing a path that never truly fit me.

# My career background:

* Worked as a social media manager for the past 10 years while attending evening school.
* Chose media & communication science as my major because I wanted a degree but needed something I could manage while working full-time.
* Spent a few months in regular marketing before moving to a consulting agency.
* Worked for a year in marketing automation, SEO, and general digital strategy ‚Äîa highly flexible role that requires constant learning and often pretending to have experience with things I‚Äôm still figuring out.

# My current problem:

This career has completely shattered my confidence and self-esteem.

* I feel like I‚Äôve spent years faking expertise and constantly being in situations where I have to act like I know what I‚Äôm doing when, in reality, I‚Äôm always scrambling to keep up. It‚Äôs exhausting.
* Marketing (especially social media) is all about being creative, outgoing, and engaging ‚Äîbut I‚Äôm naturally an analytical, introverted person. I don‚Äôt enjoy brainstorming campaigns, writing catchy content, or coming up with creative visuals.
* For years, I thought I just needed to ‚Äúpush through,‚Äù but it‚Äôs only made things worse. Now, the thought of creating and posting content makes me deeply uncomfortable and anxious.
* I dread every single workday. I feel like I‚Äôve been forcing myself into a role I‚Äôm just not built for, and it‚Äôs draining me mentally.

# What I‚Äôm considering:

1. Switching to a structured office job with clear, defined tasks‚Äîeven if it means a pay cut‚Äîso I can focus on my mental health in my free time.
2. Figuring out how to explain my career switch in a way that makes sense, considering my marketing background looks good on paper (big channels, well-known international company).
3. Positioning myself as someone who can help with the early adoption of new tools, software, and processes in an office environment‚Äîespecially relevant with AI advancing so quickly. My CV shows I have experience with this.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice on how to approach this transition or insights from anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar situation. Thanks in advance!""",Purebtw,2,1.0,2,1742043760,2025-03-15 13:02:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbumve/stuck_in_a_career_thats_draining_mehow_do_i/,3,2025
1jbu3uf,I'm being demoted to a student position,"I'm a network engineer and joined a team of devops engineers under the premise they would teach me the work and I'll eventually be a network/devops engineer. 
Thing is, ever since I joined the company 6 months ago I didn't receive a single network related tasks, it's all devops, which means I had to learn on the job and my job so far hasn't been on par with my colleagues. It's certainly improved a lot but it's far from perfect. 

This caused my team members to question my abilities and to be extremely difficult with me in everything I do from code review, POC discussions, or even answering any questions I have, and my inability to provide quality work has made them frustrated since they have to pick up my slack. This issue has escalated beyond professional frustration - they have update group chats without me, don't invite me to any activity, they redo my work behind my back and even speak Russian when I'm around. I can tell they don't really like me but I kept saying it'll get better once my skills improve. I'm not really mad at them and I understand them, but I've grown extremely frustrated as well since I'm giving it my all. 

Few weeks ago we got a new boss and I had given him an explanation of the situation. I told him that working together is currently difficult since I hadn't proved myself yet, and I requested a solo task to prove my capabilities. He gave me a research task and asked me to write a summary of what I had found and send It to the team for review. 
When I did, I noticed my conclusions contradict our initial assumptions, and I sent it to my team to review so we can discuss this, but they simply ignored my request for more than a week. 

When I talked about it with my boss, he told me my work is not good and accused me of confirmation bias, and told me I'm at fault for not communicating well with the team. I told him I'm confident in my findings and that I don't mind being proven wrong but I need to know what I did wrong, and that wouldn't happen if he or the team aren't willing to come to a discussion. He dismissed my claim as an ego problem and has decided to demote me into a student position to learn under another senior. 

I feel like I received a very unfair treatment, I'm being judged on metrics of an experienced devops engineer whilst not getting any tasks that suit my expertise, and when I try and learn from my mistakes I'm being told I'm wrong without being supplied with any explanation as to why I'm wrong. I'm well aware of the fact my boss could be correct and I really am just bad at my job, but now I'm wondering if it's better to leave for an actual network engineering job, or bite my tongue and take the opportunity to learn the role from a student position. Even if the student position will teach me a lot, I don't like the idea of continuing working with a team that doesn't like me or trusts me. 

What would you do in this situation? Should I insist to get feedback on my work? Should I accept this student position and prove them wrong? Should I look for a job that better suits my skills?

1jbthk9,"Programmers / IT Professionals, which field / programming language is worth learning or investing time in?","

Hi!

I‚Äôm 27 years old, with a completed high school education in computer science and two years of university in that field (but I didn‚Äôt finish the degree).

I have some basic knowledge, but after dropping out of university I went in a different direction, so I don‚Äôt have any work experience in IT.

Now, I‚Äôd like to dedicate my free time to learning something in this field again, with the goal of switching back in a few months or years.

I‚Äôm curious, which direction is worth investing time and education in? Honestly, I‚Äôm not only interested in what‚Äôs currently popular, but something that will still be relevant for quite a while (I don‚Äôt want to spend time learning something that AI will take over in a few years).

Also, if anyone is kind enough to share‚Äîwhat do you do in this field, are you satisfied, what are the salaries like, and maybe which industries or programming languages are a bit less paid but fun and not too mentally exhausting? (I understand that the harder the language and the more money, the more stress it brings, but I‚Äôd love to hear all perspectives and options.)

And if there‚Äôs anyone here into trading / dropshipping / affiliate marketing, I‚Äôd appreciate hearing your thoughts too!

I am not going to lie, it was really excited for this opportunity at first, but now that I'm getting so close to the start day I am absolutely freaking out. I'm not sleeping. I don't feel like I'm OK. I don't know if it's because I'm not good with change. I wont know anyone, i'm not used to a small company and how they operate I already feel kind of exhausted and irritated but the manager seems really nice and the job seems like something I will like but I kust wont know unless I try. I am scared to try and be vulnerable and put myself out there. I'm really scared that I'm just gonna fail because I have severe PTSD from my last boss that was so abusive it wasn't even funny the boss before that was horrible and mean, but I could tolerate it. It wasn't that abusive the job I had before that was wonderful. I had great bosses I felt like I could conquer the world. What a mistake I may leaving, but can't take it back you live and learn, but I also had a major death in my family at the same time I came back from leave and I got laid off i've just been protecting my peace and I've been OK and I felt like I was ready, but I really wasn't expecting to get something so quick and I'm just really freaking out like what if this was a mistake. I'm so not used to this. 

I have been trying to get into my dream company this entire time. I had an offer from them before I got laid off and I was stupid, I was too scared to leave the company I was with. I thought it was better to stay with the devil I knew what a joke. Since then we've been in constant contact I've had really great interviews. They had a hiring freeze now they're hiring again. 

Do I interview just in case even though I literally am starting this job in 2 days?  this is the only job with a different company I applied to literally for ha ha's like it seemed like really interesting. Something I'd like to do and I said why not I probably won't get it anyways. Well, I ended up getting it but now my dream company wants to interview me seriously the timing is so bad. want to interview me problem is I just accepted a job offer and I'm starting this week. 

I feel really bad and I know I shouldn't be loyal to any company but what do I do? I don't want to look bad either to the dream company like hey just started a new role this week but I'm still interviewing...

Should I tell them no or should I go on it just in case? if I should go on it, should I even mention the company I mean I think they're putting it on LinkedIn. They probably do it on purpose, but I don't know. I have no idea. I've never been in this situation before and I'm just like really pissed off about the timing. I do want to give this place a fair chance but I'm not gonna lie. I've already like had so many red flags and I don't think it's the manager's fault I think it's HR at a small company, but I just don't know what to do.

1jboiy3,am i overthinking red flags about this company's interviewing process?,"For context, I work in the Talent Acquisition space. I get that each company has a different interviewing process, but MAN was I let down by the last recruiter screening I had.

I've been interested in this company for so long and was finally blessed enough to get an interview. The careers site specifically states that the interview process includes a 30 min recruiter screen, followed by a 1-2 hour hiring manager/panel interview. The recruiter asked me if I could chat quickly for only 15 minutes, the night before the interview. I said yes since I was excited about the role and didn't think too much about it. But my time is already cut in half of what it's supposed to be.

To make matters worse, he shows up 5 mins late with his camera off (the interview invitation asked me to have my camera on), and he said he was getting ready for his vacation. So technically, I have 10 mins to be screened by this guy.

He didn't bring up compensation, or even screen any basic HR compliance questions with me. He stated they're trying to move the process quickly, but like... I'm taking time out my work day to interview with multiple team members, for multiple interviews.... he just asked about my experience and why I'm interested in the role. I asked if I could ask questions and he said he'll be on vacation but can answer when he gets back. In the meantime, I had a couple of interviews scheduled with peopleon the team.

So I scheduled an email asking these things when he gets back from vacation on Monday. Am I overthinking it?? Maybe my standards are high as a Talent professional myself, but I don't know if other TA folks agree / disagree with this. 

I will say - one of the members on the team I interviewed with seemed super happy in her role and spoke very highly of the company.

1jbo4vh,need help in deciding masters degree related to biology,"Hi! I've been wanting to ask for your opinions for a while now as I'm stuck on what specific field I should pursue for my masters. For context, I graduated BS Biology from an Asian university. I'm currently working as a research assistant (~ 2 years now) in a project involving rivers, microbes, and antimicrobial resistance. The skills I've applied here is a combination of microbiology, molecular bio, and bioinformatics. While I am somehow familiar with R and Linux, I'm not really confident with my computational skills to pursue bioinformatics. I guess I'm overwhelmed with the theories of molecular biology as well. While love doing labwork, I also want to be constantly in the field. I have also considered pursuing fields related to ecology and conservation biology. The project will be ending soon maybe that's why I've been thinking about this lately. Medicine is out of the options so I guess masters is the only way. Bottomline is, I believe I can do anything I set my mind to (regardless of the field) while simultaneously being anxious if I'll love what I'll do in the future if I don't give it much thought.

1jbnwii,I think I'm giving up on having a career and financial stability,"I just want a job. Literally any job. I've applied to multiple barista/cashier/waitress jobs only to be rejected. I've applied both with and without listing my bachelors degree on my resume to these positions, and nothing helps. There's barely any new jobs being posted at that. The ones that are being posted are mostly for CDL drivers and nurses.

The job I was at before wasn't great either. It was a marketing job in my field though. I worked there about a year. I was underpaid and overworked. I didn't get a lot of 'real' marketing experience either though, a lot of the time I was just doing basic admin things. It took me over nine months after graduating to find that shitty job. I got let go of a few months ago due to ""restructuring"" and layoffs. I was already looking for a new job basically since I started this one since the pay is so low, but absolutely no one wants to hire me.

I've been through so many interviews and I've asked people for feedback, but none of them have been able to help me. One employer even told me that I was a great candidate, but that they found someone better with more experience. It was an entry-level position. Now, I'm not even getting interviews anymore. The economy is going downhill fast, and who knows how long this will last. In five years, no one will want to hire me for entry-level jobs because I'm too old and mid-level jobs won't hire me because I won't have experience. 

I cry everyday because I just feel like such a failure. I was stupid to believe that I could ever work in marketing or any other 'career' job. All I've ever wanted in life was to be solidly middle class. My parents are poor and I was destined to be poor too it seems. My savings are going to be depleted soon because I've been using the little money I have for rent and bills. No matter how hard I network, or upskill, or improve my resume, work on my interview skills, etc. It doesn't matter. I'm never going to be able to save money for a house, or retire, or travel. I've just been so heartbroken and depressed lately realizing I'll never be able to do any of the things I wanted to in life. I worked really hard in college and did everything right. I joined a sorority and clubs for networking, I did internships, etc. 

I had a bunch of other goals I had set for this year, but none of it matters. I can't work on any of those goals until I have a job and resources to achieve them. Now almost a third of the year has gone by and I have nothing to show for it. I would be okay if I had a 'bridge' job just to get by and let me continue living my life. My rent is low and it would be unfulfilling, but I could at least survive. But I can't even find an in-between job. And I'm starting to just give up on marketing altogether. It's the one field I actually love and am passionate about, but it doesn't seem like it's in the cards for me. I'd have better luck becoming an A-list rockstar than I would getting a job in marketing. Everyday I'm being pulled closer and closer to just killing myself, because I would rather die than live a life in poverty like my parents. 

If any of you have any advice that can help me it would be appreciated. I've already tried everything that are typically suggested (recruiters, go to an agency, cold calls, apply on the website, etc..).  Or a different career I can go into that pays somewhat well. Or just anything that can restore my faith even a little bit please.

I've been here 2.5 years, which is a relatively long time, definitely not short. But the people here all seem to believe that this is a very short amount of time and that I still have a lot of growth to do and that ""now is when you can start to really grow"". Which is ridiculous because if you believe that after 2.5 years, is when I am going to have the opportunity to really grow here, then you have been doing it wrong as an employer and managers and aren't aligned with me and my perception of my career growth and trajectory. 


And it's also maybe not easy to just say ""growth opportunity"" because over here, they do try a lot to give growth opportunities to us. 

But the thing is I want to leave because:
 - bad wlb

 - a lot of useless tasks, unnecessary arbitrary stress due to said useless tasks

- over it. Interested in moving on to another industry, role, work, to see something different

- (potentially) higher salary

So what can I say to them? I need my responses to their questions and counterpoints to be effective and also not make me seem like I am going ""just for a change"" to a worse off role.

1jbnh5q,Got fired a month after getting my first professional job,"Hello, first time posting in this subreddit so please bear with me but I'm just really disappointed in myself. 

I was fired this week at my first ever office job as a marketing research analyst after a month, and the reason they cited was ""general lack of interest in assigned tasks and attitude towards the job"". Personally, this came as an absolute shock because I had to chase after the senior analysts and the person training me for tasks to do/things they could teach me; if they were busy, I would go read up on company manuals and try to teach myself some relevant skills for the job. They told me that it was a very busy time so I bounced around to search for things to do, stuff I could help with, and took notes whenever I could to learn more about the job. The two people training me also praised me several times for some of my completed tasks and, generally, it felt like they were satisfied with my work and performance.

What surprised me was that the person training me was explaining a task for me to do in the morning, and told me to read up on manuals when I was done because they would be in meetings all day. 15 mins later I get a message on Teams from HR saying that they wanted to call me and talk, and not even 5 mins later they said that they were terminating my contract. Since I was still in the probationary period, there's no prior notice nor second chance, etc...The only reasons I can think of is maybe I spoke too casually, or my attitude was too casual (which didn't feel wrong in the specific office environment); I was on my phone replying to messages during a team meeting Monday morning (literally the only time I've ever checked my phone during a meeting bc my friend's in the hospital); or the last reason would be that I'm still in my last semester of college.

I'm trying to understand what I could've done better, and how I can improve myself so that this never happens again. And if a future employer/interviewer ever asks about this experience, how can I explain that, while this was a very short experience, I've learned quite a lot about the industry, and also learned a lesson on office culture in general?

1jbl6ga,What Options Do I Have As An Unemployed Economics Graduate?,"Apologies in advance if this is perhaps the wrong avenue to ask for this kind of advice.

I graduated last spring/summer with my bachelors degree in Economics (2:1 classification) from a non-target university in England.

My work experience in the financial sector, or really any corporate environment, is very limited. I interned during the summer of my second year as an Operations analyst at a large multinational bank for 8 weeks, however I disliked the role, and consequently declined to register my interest for a return offer, opting instead to take a gamble in pursuing a front-office high finance role (in retrospect, this was an utterly insane decision to take as a non-target candidate).

In the course of my final year I applied for approximately 150 roles in investment banking, private banking, asset management, and consulting. Much to the detriment of my university coursework, these were genuinely thorough and tailored applications. My efforts culminated in one final round interview/super-day for an asset managent role at a prestigious bulge bracket bank, but unfortunately I was not selected for an offer.

I felt utterly dejected by the whole process and, admittedly, made one of the largest mistakes a new graduate seeking work could make... I stopped applying for roles and opted to travel instead. I picked up some work in retail last autumn to recuperate my finances after travelling, although I resigned a couple of weeks ago to refocus my efforts in applying for financial roles.

It's been almost a year since I graduated and I feel like all marketability I may have had as a new graduate has dissipated entirely. My applications to back and middle office financial roles aren't even being progressed. I'm not too sure where to go from here really. 

I'm looking at a few masters in finance-adjacent subjects, like Statistics for Finance, which are attractive options. Alternatively, I could opt to study a masters in Data Science, but I have concerns about how future proof that subject would be and labour market oversaturation for the discipline and adjacent roles.

1jbhzzw,"Am I being micromanaged, or do I just need to suck it up?","I worked from home today, so I had to submit a log of what I worked on to my supervisor before I finished up. Within minutes, she responded to ask me how an event I had on my work calendar (which she has access to) was, and I told her that I didn't end up going - because I was working on a different project, which she knew, as she was literally working on the same shared document as me at the time the event was happening. The event was not directly work-related and was just a panel on a subject in my area of work - the sort of professional development thing you do when you have nothing else on your calendar. She then emailed me - at 6 pm today, a Friday - with a barrage of questions about my progress on other ongoing projects: ""ABC is right around the corner - what is your progress? What do you plan to accomplish next week? Also, what is your progress on XYZ?"" I nearly had a meltdown when I got this email.

The thing is, we have a check-in meeting every week; I literally have one scheduled with her on Monday morning. And this is not an isolated event; she is constantly pinging me to give her updates on things, multiple times a week. She obsesses over paperwork and administrative processes, and she is incredibly particular about how forms are filled out. She once told me I used the wrong form for something because the version I submitted had a drop-down box in one of the fields whereas the version she used didn't have it. It was literally the same document.

Today, she emailed me to ask if I responded to a non-urgent email that a colleague sent to both of us yesterday, saying to let her know if I need help - with what, exactly, I have no idea. But she constantly asks for updates on my work and offers help as though that's helpful even for the most basic tasks, but the offers do not feel genuine and it really stresses me out. Like she's hanging over me watching everything I do. 

I talked to my colleague about issues I've had with this shared supervisor, and she (my colleague) also expressed that she had frustrations with her. I am not a perfect employee by any means, and I know that I don't always finish things in the most expedient way possible, but I care about my work, try to do a good job, and get it all done in the end. It feels as though my supervisor just sees me as lazy and irresponsible even though I have had absolutely no complaints from anyone or disciplinary action in the year I've worked there. I feel patronized, infantilized, condescended to, and disrespected.

Am I overreacting? On their own, I know her constant check-ins and nudges seem innocuous, but they are seriously beginning to weigh on me to the point where I am considering quitting my job, which I don't really want to do because I love the rest of my coworkers and feel lucky to get to work where I do. If I'm just being a whiny piece of shit I will suck it up and do what she asks, but I have never had a dynamic with a supervisor like this and it feels unhealthy, so I would appreciate other perspectives.

1jbht1k,Need advice for changing career?,"# 

Hello everyone,

I'm a M(29), I have a bachelor's degree in Geography, I know this is a useless degree I chose this because I though I can find an easy job with GIS, but guess what I'm wrong. So right now I'm working at a sale representative with a minimum wage $18/ hour, I had been her for 7 years and I need help to find a way out.

The reason I want to change my career first it's a shitty pay job, and the second most important reason I need a more stable income to support my wife and four children, one is 2 years old, and triplets for 4 months. With my pay rate right now I know that I can't afford to support them. Before I knew that I had a triplet my plan was enroll to MS Environmental Engineering program at CSUF to jump into the environmental field but now the plan has to change. I'm thinking about taking some classes in computer science and then getting an MS in Software Engineering or Computer Science also at CSUF, I know that the job market is now really tough but I am willing to take a risk. For another degree, I also thought about getting an MS in account or Taxation and getting a CPA but then I read so much Reddit about the career being outsourced from India and the Philipines made me hesitate. I also think about going back to community college to get another associate degree in CIS, or accountant to jump into the workforce, or even going into trade schools to be a machinist. I think about every possibility of what should I do, but thinking too much makes me so stressed and desperate that not choose a wise degree or career before, I blame myself every day for this failure, my family is the only things that keep me up right now.

Before thinking about master programs I try to apply to every job, and apply everywhere that I can find, I use Linkedin, Indeed and Ziprecuiter. I really need an advice right now for knowing what to do. I really appreciate you guys help.",PrideGlad4068,1,1.0,0,1741995697,2025-03-14 23:41:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbht1k/need_advice_for_changing_career/,3,2025
1jbhrtu,"Torn between 2 roles - easy and limited, or aspirational low pay?","Hi all - throwaway account here for the usual reasons. 

I started a job in late 2024, and now have been recruited and offered another role. The two jobs are very different roles, and I'm having a hard time determining which one I'd like to go with. Anyone willing to offer their perspective? I'm in Western Canada. I'm a 39 year old female. 

**Job #1 (current): Facilities Manager**   


* Early mornings, monday through friday with some on-call during emergencies (rare)
* Flexible scheduling for personal appointments, easy to take time off or away
* 4 weeks vacation
*  85k/yearly, no retirement plans/investment, limited health benefits, annual bonus promised
* Free use of facilities (spas, pools, restaurant meals occasionally)  No direct reports currently 
* 15 minute commute
* Role is relatively easy physical work, I can generally complete my duties comfortably within 4 to 6 hours and then work on other non-essential or rainy-day tasking
* Limited growth potential within this role; company has expansion plans but 2-3 years out

  
**Job #2 (offered): Head of Facilities** 

* Regular 9-5 hours, monday through friday, some on-call required during emergencies, occasional events work on weekends
* Rigid scheduling, less flexibility of personal time
* 3 weeks vacation, w/seasonal shutdown of 2 additional weeks off
* 75k/yearly, no retirement plans/investment, limited health benefits 
* discount on trade related goods/equipment
* 35 minute commute
* Role is more demanding, managerial work. No hands-on work. 4 direct reporting staff. 
* This role is frustratingly low pay but would likely be good stepping stone to later career options

So I'm very torn - stick with an easy, relatively low stress role that has limited growth potential but does allow the freedom for other pursuits/career development, OR take a role with high likelihood of eventual growth in 2-4 years, for lower pay. The 2nd job is charity related and does offer some degree of personal satisfaction for a 'noble' role. 

I must admit, though the 2nd job has good potential to lead me to greater roles, the entire facilities management field is a bit of a dead-end in my eyes - it is far from passionate work for me. But I also don't know exactly where to turn if I chose to begin a new path. 

My spouse makes great money in a stable job, and I'm learning a bit more towards keeping my current role and pushing myself to find greater fulfillment outside of work or on a new career path.

1jbgydf,Is leaving a job after 4 months bad?,"As a bit of context - I work for a celebrity run brand working directly with the founder. It's been a bit of a nightmare from the start and they keep putting new responsibilities on me with zero pay increase. It's a very high-stress environment and things change and need re-done literally every single day. Pair that with some uncomfortable requests to use AI unethically and theres a lot of things that leave me feeling kinda shitty at the end of each workday. They also recently fired the other person who I worked directly with - granted, they weren't great at their job, but they also didn't have much guidance so it wasn't really their fault. If I didn't have another job prior to this I probably would have been fired by now too but I had a great mentor at my last job and have been able to navigate the shitshow on my own for the most part. Both my managers are remote, so I don't get a ton of guidance. Additionally, they told me my pay was the highest they could offer because of team structure so I don't know how I would be able to get an increase any time soon. The job totally had some red flags from the start but due to a terrible work environment at my last job I was looking for the first opportunity that came my way.   
  
The only problem is that I left my last job right at 1 year because of sexual harassment from the CMO, so it's not like I have a long employment history with them either. I have one other job on my resume that shows growth over 4 years of employment, so I'm hoping that is enough to make me look reliable if I leave this one. 

I have a new opportunity in the same industry I'm interviewing for that is a 10k pay increase, FAR shorter commute (20 min walk vs a 40 min train ride so no cost of commuting), better opportunity for advancement, more control over decisions, and less micromanagement for the same responsibilities. Is it crazy to take this new job? I figure I can always put the last one on my resume as contract work so it doesn't look as bad. I'm hoping the environment will be less stressful and hopefully keep me from feeling like I'm gonna be fired any day (even though I know I'm doing a good job and the fear isn't the most valid, the environment is just that bad) 

Should I stick it out so it doesn't look like I've hopped too much or take the new opportunity? ",Optimal_Employer_579,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1741993307,2025-03-14 23:01:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbgydf/is_leaving_a_job_after_4_months_bad/,3,2025
1jbgvqb,[CA] - advice for terminating employment agreement,"I signed an offer for a job with company A. After signing, I received a better offer from another company I would like to accept. I need advice on my ability and rights to withdraw my acceptance of the agreement with company A and potential legal vulnerabilities in doing so. As far as I know it‚Äôs not a contract but an agreement. The agreement says I can end the agreement if I give 2 week notice. but I want to understand any risk that the company may sue me for damages, lost time, or other expenses. There are no clauses or mentions about having to repay anything in the case of terminating. 

There is also an arbitration clause where they state that any controversy or dispute is to be handled by arbitration. It sounds more like to cover themselves for class action. Does that further serve to protect me?

I signed the offer from company A this Tuesday, and they spent about a week before that conducting interviews and other communication via email and phone. Since Tuesday, they have started the onboarding process and I have completed background check, drug test, etc.

1jbgsls,Married woman in my 30s and lost career motivation,"
Career/kids/married life: I don‚Äôt know if other ppl feel this but my problem is career motivation. I went from the most ambitious person to the least. 

Since I was a little girl, I was a high achiever. I was curious, smart, played sports, was very self motivated at a young age. On my own I had energy and desire to do it all. I became valedictorian of my class, got accepted to my dream school, got a masters degree, got married, worked for a few years in non-profit sector and also corporate America. Worked so hard practically burnt myself out. On paper I had it all but I was simply not happy. 

Adulting just became less fun instantly. My 40 hours work week mentally drained me. It literally felt like I was on a depressing hamster wheel, often in toxic office culture environment with less than ideal bosses or coworkers. I then went to work for several gig jobs or part time job which felt better. I became a mom and the freelance/independent work seemed to work for a few years but clearly I was under/employed. I truly feel unmotivated when it comes to career. It doesn‚Äôt help that I sort of have lost myself and my focus is always on my kids which is my #1. But how can I have balance. How can I have a thriving career and a thriving family?  Is it normal to feel this way in your 30s. I went from the overachiever/ambitious person who wanted to do it all, to not having ambitions but to spend time with my kids and husband.

1jbgqxe,My boss is extremely angry with me for quitting.,"Sorry in advance for the long rant.

I work in an administrative position for a construction company that pays a little more than minimum wage. My boss is a decent guy, and he went to bat for me about getting PTO a couple of months ago. They enacted a new policy that I was just barely not qualified for (I went full time a week after the cutoff), and I asked him if I could be pushed through. He got corporate to agree as long as I promised not to just immediately take the vacation time and quit or anything like that.

The work environment there has been rapidly declining since before all of this happened. It's not the most toxic place I've ever worked, but it's bad enough that I have been looking for another job for six months. The pay is also really bad, and I've never heard of anyone here getting a raise. I assumed I would be stuck in the job for quite a while, with how awful the job market is, which is why I put up a fight about the PTO policy. But I got offered my literal dream job last week and obviously accepted. Great pay, great benefits, and it's doing something I love. I have wanted to move out of my dad's house for years, and this job will pay more than enough for me to do that.

I put in my resignation yesterday. I have not taken any of the PTO that I received and said both verbally and in my resignation letter that I forfeit all of it (I am in a state that doesn't require it be paid out). My boss was PISSED. He wouldn't even let me speak, just ranted about how awful I was for doing that. He said they have to pay it out regardless of whether I forfeit it and that they're probably going to retract the new/improved PTO policy for the whole company because of me.

I feel like he was just trying to make me feel bad since HR would make that determination, not him. My employment contract even states that they don't pay it out. But it worked, I do feel awful. I'm scared this is going to make things worse for my coworkers after I leave. I didn't think he'd be happy, but I really didn't think he'd be this angry. Now I'm dreading having to work for the next two weeks.

I know I was in the wrong-- I shouldn't have asked to get included in the PTO policy since I was unhappy there and looking for something else. But I feel like he is overreacting. My total payout for PTO would be less than $1000, and I don't even want it.",RevolutionaryFix4451,15,1.0,39,1741992733,2025-03-14 22:52:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbgqxe/my_boss_is_extremely_angry_with_me_for_quitting/,3,2025

I never had anyone around me chase ""goals "" or dreams. Everyone either had children really young and worked at jobs they hated or they didn't have any children and still worked at jobs they hated.

So far I feel sick to my stomach because there is so much to learn in music and I don't see a payoff. Maybe that's due to lack of belief in myself.

1jbdyal,Fairly successful at 37. Completely unable to continue doing my job,"WARNING: sort of a long post, so I truly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this ‚ù§Ô∏è

BACKGROUND/CONTEXT
I've worked in the tech/marketing world for about a decade now. I've done well and grinded my way from being a junior copywriter to an executive at a tech company at one point. Made 160k CAD the last two years, low six figures since about 2019.

I'm self-taught, a pretty okay people leader, likeable (I mean, I think!), good to work with (mostly), and emotionally intelligent (I have zero idea if these are helpful things to mention). 

Currently doing marketing consulting with on and off success. Did well last year but will probably only clear 4k this month. Lost a few clients and burnt some bridges along the way, usually from taking on too much.

Also a co-founder of a tech product that has yet to generate revenue (about 5 months in, which isn't atypical, but my own motivation is plummeting).

Diagnosed with ADHD last year. On meds (for whatever that's worth). 

Most engaged I've felt recently is training for athletics, writing movie reviews on Letterboxd, playing extremely elaborate and in-depth games with my daughter via a recurring cast of stuffy characters, and working with my hands (fixing the laundry machine after my father in law broke it, good times).

In therapy (I know that bit of advice/feedback is coming!) Obviously that's not a quick fix, but it feels good to be doing it. 

Have recently quit drinking 1-2 beers every night or so to clear my head and improve my physical and mental health as much as possible. Wouldn't say I'm a drunk, but certainly drink more than I should and want to permanently kick the habjt. 

I don't partake in any substances outside of alcohol (unless eating the occasional large pizza to myself while watching Michael Mann's crime opus Heat is considered a substance).

THE PROBLEM
My motivation to literally execute work has completely plummeted. I have no desire to grow or learn new things in the space. I can and have been incredibly effective in roles, but I'm completely drained and permanently burnt out, it feels. 

I have a three year old. Savings are okay but not where they should be. I live in a high cost of living city in Canada (Vancouver) and am renting. Wife is a lawyer and makes decent money (140k) but not enough for us to live off of while saving. 

I feel like the world's biggest ungrateful asshole and like I've had every opportunity and squandered it. I can't keep doing what I'm doing; chasing motivation spikes and hopping across companies and clients. It will and maybe has already caught up with me. Also not getting younger, and ageism is a real thing in tech/marketing.

Do I hunker down and make it work? Get a trade and just start grinding? If so, which? Find a cushy government job? Eliminate distractions?

I have no interest in getting certifications because it'll just lead to more support and things I don't have any interest in.

1jbd1fa,At a crossroads between two career paths,"Hi r/ careeradvice folks!

I would like some advice on my current situation. 

I currently work for a large company (household name) in the finance sector as a junior financial analyst. I just recently started this position. Prior to that I worked at the same company, as an entry level IT technician.  

I have an associates degree in Computer Science, and had been planning on a career in Software Engineering. However, when I graduated I was unable to find a job in the field, and ran out of money to finish out my bachelor's degree. I ended up with the IT position instead.

An opportunity came up for my current finance position through someone I know at my company, and so far I am genuinely enjoying the work, and hear that the Financial Analyst career path can be a great one. My company offers tuition assistance after a certain period of time working in the position, and my new plan was to go back and get a degree in something finance related and totally switch career paths. 

However, a recruiter contacted me about another entry level IT position recently and I imitially turned him down, but ended up agreeing to an interview. I just received an offer letter, for an amount of money that seems far too good to be true for the position and where I live. This company is a mid sized legal firm.

I'm struggling with the choice on what to do in this situation. I enjoy my current position more than I did IT work, and the career path seems to be a better choice than IT overall. Another factor is the IT job is a 1.5 hour drive for me, fully in the office, and my current position is a much shorter commute and is hybrid. Also, I was strongly recommended for my current position by someone I know personally, and I don't want to potentially damage that relationship by leaving so soon. 

Essentially the only reason I am even entertaining taking this offer is because of the ridiculous amount of money I've been offered. It's a 30% increase on what I make right now, and a 40% increase on what I was making when I worked in IT. 

With all the cons of this position I mentioned, would it be smart to take the offer for the money? I make a livable wage currently and don't strictly need the increase, though it would be nice to have. Also, am I correct in thinking that finance is a better career path than IT currently? 

TLDR: Finance position, or IT position with several cons but a much larger salary?

Any insight is appreciated! Thanks all",runerose4083,1,1.0,0,1741982972,2025-03-14 20:09:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jbd1fa/at_a_crossroads_between_two_career_paths/,3,2025

the second job is a state government position in a legislative office, which is still technically in the law field i guess? i would be an administrative assistant, but the role i would ultimately be assuming would be proofreading and drafting documents for the general assembly, which vary from being more legal in nature to celebratory letters and such. the pay is $21.25 and of course have all the really good benefits that come with a state position. there aren‚Äôt as many reviews for this agency left online, but overall it seems like it‚Äôs a good job to get into other jobs with the state.

I've been in the industry for 5 years.

Oh and I'm completely burnt out on my job and don't care about it at all, don't care about the quality, about delievering, about nothing.

I'm middle aged and pretty senior/expert in my IT field. I left my last job after quite a lot of burnout (for what it's worth, a lot of my coworkers quit also), took lots of time to recover, found a new very small place, and am now a few months in.

In some ways the company is really nice. Everyone is really nice and friendly. We have daily meetings about what we're working on. But something isn't right.

I'm working a few extra hours per day trying to keep up. I am not keeping up, actually, I would say I'm about 6 months behind on the workload I've been given. It seems that I'm acquiring about a month of workload per day. And so, nothing is getting done.

But on top of that, anything I have tried to get done, gets knocked back. 

Maybe there's a very long process attached that I can't see the end of. Lots of steps that ""have to be done"", but which nobody else really does. They're happy to remove those steps, but left in place are other steps which will take a very long time to get familiar with.

Maybe it's something trivial, and someone always says no no no, we don't want to do that. And this blocks other work I had planned, and which blocks other work... like I literally can't improve anything to lighten the load in order to get time to learn how to take on the intricate parts of the jobs they want me to actually do.

\--

So it's been a few months and now I'm at breaking point. It feels that I did not have a six month runway to get started, because I have been given years of work up front. Every day I'm given more. And I can't get anything done. Literally today I just wanted to quit and step out in front of a car and end it.

1jb63mw,Should I take this offer?,"Current job: Salary is 85,000/yr, 3 weeks of pto + 7 days of sick leave accrued per year. Set dollar amount matched to my retirement (ESOP), which equates to about 4% of my current salary but does not increase as my salary or contributions increase. My job is 5 days in office, but has flexibility for some remote days as needed. Current work is moderate difficulty and I have a good support system in place for steady, upward career growth

New offer: Salary is 86,500/yr, 3 weeks of combined pto and sick leave accrues per year. 5% 401k match, 3 days in office/2 days remote. The work in this role would be an immediate increase in responsibility. Nothing I can't handle, but this is a smaller team with less support and a faster expectation for independence and a slightly increased workload

My main attraction to the new role is a hybrid schedule. I very much value the days I am able to work from home in my current position and do not think I want to work 5 days in office long term. My current office culture is very corporate and work-first, whereas the new role seems to promote work-life balance a little more. I also think the retirement plan at the new company is better, and my retirement is important to me as well. My main concern with the new role is that the team is much smaller (I would be on a team of 2 people including myself, the other team member is my direct supervisor). I would get great technical experience in this situation, but I am worried that working on such a small team will hinder my growth opportunities to be promoted and to get into management. My current role is a larger team where growth and management opportunities seem more available. There is also the loss of the 7 sick days per year in the new role.

1jb5v6p,Which industry should I move into with prior sales experience? Sales reps / promoters / commercial agents ‚Äì I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights and opinions!,"Hey everyone!

I‚Äôve been interested in sales since I was young. I first spent 4 years in network marketing, and for the past year, I‚Äôve been working in old-school direct door-to-door sales (steam cleaners).

I‚Äôm doing pretty well‚Äîselling comes naturally to me. I‚Äôm 27 years old, and my monthly income ranges between ‚Ç¨3,000 and ‚Ç¨5,000, depending on the month.

But to be honest, I don‚Äôt see myself doing this long-term. Door-to-door sales are tough mentally: people often treat you poorly, regardless of how respectful you are. After all, you‚Äôre stepping into their homes uninvited. The work schedule is all over the place, and I‚Äôm driving long distances every single day. From Monday to Friday evening, I‚Äôm basically gone. I live for the weekends.

So, to anyone reading this‚Äîwhat do you do for a living? How are the salaries? What‚Äôs the work schedule like? Do you enjoy what you do?

I‚Äôm looking to make a change. I‚Äôd definitely stay in sales since I already have experience, and I‚Äôm more than willing to trade a portion of my earnings for a job with more stable, humane hours in a field where I can truly see myself growing. Whether it‚Äôs digital marketing, car dealerships, telesales, retail sales (if there are good commissions), real estate‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm open to anything.

1jb5n8b,Help With Deciding Graduate School,"Hello, I am currently a senior student at a liberal arts school in the United States. My school is very well known for its good network connections and strong business school, and I am about to graduate with an economics degree and a low 3.0 GPA. I was a 4 year athlete and a recruiter contacted me and offered me a spot to play overseas in the United Kingdom (Nottingham University) and do a 1 year graduate program to play sports and receive a scholarship. My choice of masters is pretty flexible since of my help of athletics in the admissions process.

  
I am currently trying to decide what masters I want to do. I am deeply interested in the theoretical side of economics, such as bigger picture macro trends and observing the economy. However, I want job stability and work in my city after I return in the United States. That's why I am also considering an Accounting & Finance MsC. 

I have a couple questions that I can't seem to find the answers to online: Will it not translate as well since the UK doesn't use GAAP? Will this make it harder for me to find a job back in NYC upon getting my degree? Is it hard to find a job using an Economics Masters out of college since I dont want to go into government policy or academia?

1jb4q97,Nonprofit worker potential job change,"Hi everyone, I work for a large non-profit institute \~4k employees in the US that works primarily in the federal contracting space. Unfortunately, given the everything going on in the country, my institute is in the middle of heavy layoffs - we've had 2 rounds with more on the way and the messaging from leadership is:  
""even if you have a full workload, you are not safe from a layoff"" 

Recently both of the federal contracts that funded me directly have been cancelled and will be ending this calendar year; however, contracts run out in August, and really anything could happen.

The last wrinkle is that my \*current\* institute provided me with financial reimbursement for completing my master's and I would have to pay them in full if I leave before 6/1 (not in the case of layoff, which could theoretically happen at any time). The good news is that it's only $5,250, so it's mostly annoying more than anything. 

I have an interview for another, significantly smaller, non-profit \~500 employees, and with a more diverse portfolio - mix of federal and industry partners. They are also offering 40% more than what I make at my current job. There are a few pink-ish flags I'm seeing with this opportunity  
1) still another non-profit with federal funding  
2) they want to move fast - I told them during the phone screening that I need to start 6/1, but they're pushing for an end of April start date - I applied back on Mar 3rd, so this is a backfill position. 

Both positions are fully remote and working within similar industry - although the new company would provide a \*much\* higher salary (six-figures) and more responsibility. 

I'm talking with my HR representative today to get a bit more details about how and when I would need to pay them back. My current thoughts are this:

1) I have no confidence in my current institute and have other personal painpoints with their lackluster communication, so I'd be looking to make a change anyway.   
2) I would prefer to move to complete industry; however, this may provide a good stepping stone especially at such a high paygrade that I could really hoard money for when shit hits the fan again. 

My questions are:  
Should I just take the hit regarding that $5,250 with my current institute considering I would make it back within 2 months of the new position?

Should I try to work both jobs - the current one part time and the new one full time while I wait out the clock? 

I would love and appreciate any advice!

1jb4gwn,How do you professionally tell someone's boss they have no fundamental knowledge or understanding of the tasks they're performing?,"Title sums it up. The company I work for is seeking a specific accreditation for some of the work we perform for customers. I was tasked with auditing the individual tasks to their documented methods. 

The tasks themselves aren't complicated. The documentation is specific and step by step, leaving now room for misinterpretation, by design. We've been doing these tasks for decades and our customers rely on the outcome when designing their processes. 

The audit evidence shows we aren't doing a single task correctly. The deviations reflect a misunderstanding or completely ignorance of what the tasks are designed to do. 

The accreditation cycle has already been scheduled. I will have to inform senior management that we aren't, and never have, performed to spec. 

While I have no problem presenting the evidence, it's so bad that I'll look like an alarmist blowing things out of proportion. The person in charge and responsible for the implementation of most of these is a nice enough guy, but I have no idea how this was allowed to come about.

 Any advice that might make me look like less of a drama queen when informing management is greatly appreciated.

It is hard for me to value the stock, is it a lottery ticket? I have a lot of faith in the product and their VC backers are some of the best.

At first, Whitney was very helpful. She gave a lot of insight into what the audience is looking for. Lately though, she‚Äôs been reviewing everything I write and completely overhauling the tone. She has been rewriting entire sales sheets, social media posts, etc. and while she is a decent writer they are not performing as well. I frequently go in and update the grammar/try to make her writing more concise.

Glenn himself seems perfectly happy with my writing. Though I understand he brought Whitney in to oversee operations, I feel she is overstepping and that I am on probation without deserving to be.

Do I speak to my direct supervisor, Whitney, Glenn? All or none?",National_Function_34,2,1.0,0,1741947209,2025-03-14 10:13:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jb0k4i/do_i_address_this_or_ride_it_out/,3,2025

I‚Äôm planning to apply for a Master‚Äôs in Finance next year, and I‚Äôm also looking for job opportunities in finance and customer support. I‚Äôve been taking online courses from platforms like edX (for example, a finance course from the University of Michigan).

1jaz8ue,Am I in the wrong place or bad at my position?,"Small introduction: I work as an engineer for a contractor. I've been here for 3,5 years and for the past \~9 months been involved in a project where we develop the plan ourselves (instead of having an external client). The early process was fun to gather the needed information to write up and design the plan, but we've been stuck with the team for the past month. My project leader has repeatedly told me that he expects me to take the lead and take control, but whenever I do, I either get shot down for moving too fast / going too slow. Energy in the wrong places, something that needs a week has to be done today, something I want to finish today isn't priority but than 2 weeks later is urgent.

Another project of him failed and the engineer from the project has been assigned to help out. But it moreso feels like he's there to replace me and I feel incompetent. I never have the right answer and I always get overwhelmed during meetings. 

I currently feel like I'm in the wrong place or maybe even in the wrong company. Like that other engineer is making me super insecure because he has much more experience and is much better aligned with my project leader. So I feel like I'm only holding back the project and without me the project would most likely go much smoother. But I don't know how to approach it or get a grasp on it. Whenever the projectleader is in the office, I just feel a tense atmosphere and every question feels like a reproach. To the point I'm almost afraid for questions, because each one just makes me feel more and more incompetent

And then, as if the stars aligned, I noticed my old job has a job offer open. Which currently really makes me think to call my old boss, quit here in dignity and go back to my old position. I quit there 4 years ago because I wanted a new challenge, but it currently feels like something I shouldn't have done

How do you approach this. Pull the projectleader in a 1 on 1 meeting and just throw it all on the table? Talk to someone else in the company? Go full force ahead and get this project on the rails or decide that maybe I'd be better in my place at another position/company?

1jaym43,Insight into meeting with supervisor,"Hello Reddit!

I have a one on one meeting with my supervisor scheduled for this upcoming Monday, and I am in need of some advice.

Pertinent background information-

I work for a relatively small nonprofit in what is a two person department. I joined the team as a part-time employee in late 2023, and have remained somewhat stagnant in that position until recently. In December, my coworker (the manager of my department,) left in pursuit of new opportunities, and I have since taken on their workload which I have been managing with no additional hours. Initially, my former manager quietly told me not to apply for their role, as the hiring team was searching for an external hire with more experience. As the organizations luck would have it, the candidate that they extended the managerial role to has since declined, which has left us back at square one.

Now that I have obtained experience handling the job duty requirements and have met the expectations of what the manager position entails, I would like to be considered as an applicant.

I am curious if any folks here may have insight into how I may broach this topic professionally. I have been working on updating my portfolio with external freelance/contract projects, as well as obtaining new certifications that would build up my resume. If any of you have found yourself in a similar situation, I would love to hear your experience!

Thank you in advance!

1jawttp,Company changed hiring policies and I found out my newer coworkers are being paid more than me.,"So for context, before I was hired at my current company, I had 8 months of sales experience as a lead generator elsewhere. Then, I was hired at my company right out of college as a sales associate for about 45k. 8 months later, I get promoted from an associate to a sales representative and get a 5k increase and reach my 1 year with the company and get a 3.8k increase. I've been with my company for just over a year and a few months now, and I have some numbers to show (particularly the last 6 months). However, I referred someone I know to my company and they have some sales experience as well, but they got hired for about 65k, which is more than I'm earning right now. They do not have any experience in this particular field, but they were hired on at a higher pay than me right off the bat. I know for a fact that if I wasn't with the company and they had to hire someone to replace me, they would hire them for the allotted 60-70k range they have posted up on the company page. However, I spoke with my manager briefly and he said that no salary increase can be made for me at the moment and that I would have to wait till my 2 year anniversary to see the increase. I'm planning on bringing this up with my manager again in a meeting coming up, but I wanted to see how I should proceed. Is this reasonable? Do I need to prove myself more? Should I wait for the 2 year mark? Any thoughts or opinions are very much appreciated.

It was completely unintentional. I would never have asked but I couldn‚Äôt unsee it. I realized she was making significantly more than me.


I brought it up with my manager and the conversation was incredibly awkward. They reminded me that I had received a 20% raise six months prior but I pointed out that my co-worker was making nearly 40% more than me even with the raise. 


 Basically I was promoted and given a 45% raise‚Äîessentially because they couldn‚Äôt afford to lose me. At the time I was (and still am) the only person doing the work. I never threatened to leave.... just expressed that I was upset. My co-worker left the company about four months later leaving me to handle everything alone to this day. We never rehired. 


I found out my former co-worker told someone else what happened because our manager blamed her for me seeing her pay stub. Another co-worker just mentioned that in a recent salary discussion management reminded everyone not to share their salaries‚Äîreferencing ""a situation"" on my team that caused trouble. The problem is I and my ex co worker were the team. So now it‚Äôs obvious to everyone that they were talking about me.



The whole thing is just embarrassing. The accidental glance at her pay stub, the conversation with my manager, my co-worker getting in trouble, and then her telling others about it.

1javgbd,I need some advice about my career. I am in Australia for reference.,"Good morning everyone, I am writing this post to get some suggestions about my career.

First, a little about myself; I am an unmarried, 26 years old male. I recently became a permanent resident. I have been here for more than 8 years.

I am currently working as an independent education consultant in the migration sector. I am also studying Migration law to become a RMA, which will probably happen by next year.

First, I worked for someone for 4 years, then worked with someone as a partner for 1 year and now, working independently for the past 1 and a half years.

As every self employed person knows, cash flow is important and being independent means greater flexibility, but also uncertainty about your income. Last year was great, I saved up my tuition fee, paid my visa fee (almost 6k), bought a new car (although on finance). The car was a dumb decision, but I figured I will only be young once, so did it anyway.

This year, January was my best month since I came to Australia, but it has been downhill since, with no signs of improvement. Business has been extremely slow. I don't know what's happening, but I have been expecting about 15-20k in payments/commissions, that gets pushed a few days into the future every time. I'll be fine for another 2 months or so, but that is it.

I don't have much formal qualifications, the only thing I know how to do is this.

I don't have the time right now to study something else or start something new. I have an office, whose lease expires in October this year.

I am proficient in English; have good problem solving skills, communication skills are ""just fine"". I feel like my business skills are lacking as well, as I have unable to improve my business since last year. I do have a handicap, that other people don't. I am not a registered migration agent, so I am limited in what I can advertise and promote. I usually refer visa cases to another migration agent for a 50% commission.  
However, many education agents have huge businesses with offices worldwide. I don't know what I have been doing wrong with my consulting, maybe I have been overzealous with follow-ups, which seems desperate? Or people want to go to a larger company?

I don't even know if this is the best place to ask, but I am feeling very hopeless at the moment.",throwaway0000000047,1,1.0,0,1741925314,2025-03-14 04:08:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1javgbd/i_need_some_advice_about_my_career_i_am_in/,3,2025

Between the two I was unemployed for 10 months and my last job had effectly 0 career relevant experience.

I dread trying to apply and I dread even opening up my computer. 

I just want to quit the field entirely but that means the last 10 years and thousands of dollars where wasted.  It also means killing off my dream of working in the tech industry and specifically creating new AI models.

1jatzd6,Feeling bitter yet well paid. Do I have justified reasons to feel under appreciated at my company?,"29M, have 7 years experience in my field. I have been feeling very bitter and resentful lately, but I'm the type of person to internalize this. I honestly don't know whether to gauge how good I have it or not. I do realize I have a TON to be thankful for. 

Essentially it's a small company in a lucrative industry. For better or worse, the senior staff are very set in their ways, so I don't think things would ever really change. I have kinda become the 'ninja' at my company; using that because it's a rightfully stigmatized term. 

Here's the good: 

* I am very well paid, and have a good overall comp package (expenses, parking, etc). Let's say it's something around $150K USD total, which many people would consider amazing, and there's really not a lot of jobs like these around. So it would be hard to leave. I do really appreciate the privileged life it's afforded me and my loved ones. 
* I never work super long hours, and never get in serious shit. I do get a lot of friendly pressure, but I've never once feared for losing my job, etc.
* I am super important to my company, but more so in a way that they 'need' me rather than they think I'm amazing. And as such, I am comfortable using my vacation days, leaving early occasionally, etc.  Not sounding cocky, but I am truly amazing at my function and they all know it. 
* I am still very young - I am a lot further ahead than my coworkers around my age, and the senior people are all 40 - 55. 
* Manager title. I do have the outlook for a way better job in the future. It would really require luck though, as my organization is already fairly top heavy. 

These are my pain points: 

* Even though it's a great role on paper, in many ways I feel like a 'support ninja' for everybody. What I mean by this is that I'm constantly inundated with a million stupid tasks, but it's not really easy to just say ""this is not my job"" 
* Further to that, I feel like I'm wasting my education, not moving forward, and just stuck in this loop forever because I'm pretty useful in my current role. 
* I want to do a slightly different (but more glamorous) role, and essentially I've felt completely jerked around regarding this. 
* Most of all, even though I'm paid so well and have a manager title, I feel like I'm treated like a minion. My big boss will basically just bark out instructions to me, etc. It just doesn't feel like a dignified role in any way. It's hard to pin it down exactly, but I'm convinced it's ageism and other things. 
   * Meanwhile, we continue to hire senior business development people, and I feel like they get treated like the new messiah for a little while. There is a dynamic where sales is above all else. 

The ugly: 

* Let's say that the bosses and culture are fundamentally bad people - classic old boys club stuff. So I would never feel guilt tripped into thinking ""but they have been so good to me."" I just have to be sheerly pragmatic about it all. 

Am I wrong here ? 

I have been considering applying for more strategy related roles at different companies. All would likely be a decent sized pay cut.

1jattza,I got put on a coaching plan and I‚Äôm freaking out,"Long story short. I had a year end poor performance review for small errors, introverted, missing deadlines and not being proactive more.

Now I have to meet my manager bi weekly to see if I‚Äôm meeting the expectations and the ER monthly. They said my position is expected for me to be promoted because I been there for 1.5 years. And that my position has higher expectations than others because it‚Äôs a starting position.

1jatrg4,Legal Assistant to Information Technology?,"Hi Guys,

I‚Äôm a 47M and I work as a legal assistant.

I do not like my legal assistant career for multiple reasons including that the stress can be high, the pay is usually not high, and that most of the other legal assistants are women, which usually leaves me as literally the odd man out.

I chose this career path largely because I am physically disabled in that I have osteoarthritis I my left foot, ankle and knee, so I can‚Äôt lift or carry anything heavy, and I have to limit walking and standing.

That means pretty much no trades as I don‚Äôt think my body can handle the physical demands outlines above.

I have considered long-haul trucking but I am concerned that the constant use of the clutch will aggravate my left foot, ankle and knee.

So I pretty much need a desk job, but I would prefer it to be‚Ä¶ not my current job.

I have an interest in computers, and that I have built a couple of PCs and I am generally comfortable getting around and both Windows and macOS.

I‚Äôm not thinking about software development or even web development, as I understand that AI will generate progressively more of that code in the near future, thus reducing employment opportunities.

I wonder about a career as an information technology support person, probably as a helpdesk or hardware support person, maybe even as a database administrator or a network assistant administrator.

I see I can get CompTIA certificates and/or I could get an associates degree from a community college, both of which would take months or years and a sizable investment.

Before I invest all that time, though, I want to be careful.

My big concern is my age, or rather, ageism.

Were I to invest in and try to go down this path, I would be competing with younger entry-level workers, and I am concerned they would be favored over me.

Wondering if any other middle-aged applicants have changed jobs into information technology in any of the areas that I have mentioned, or for that matter, any area of information technology, including software and web development.

Any experiences that you (other old) guys can share would be a big help.",imlookinandseein,1,1.0,0,1741919714,2025-03-14 02:35:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jatrg4/legal_assistant_to_information_technology/,3,2025
1jatnai,Do I take a lower paying job that I gets me more experience?,"Hi! I'm looking for some insight here as I try to make a decision on what to do next. 

I am early in my career, currently 2 years into working for a federal agency doing microbiological testing of food. It's my first big boy job. Pretty soon into getting this job I realized the job duties were pretty limited and repetitive, the supervisor is so neglectful and careless, and morale is pretty low right now for obvious reasons. I am also in my early twenties working with mostly middle aged people who have spent 10+ years working at this lab. So I don't quite feel like I fit in here. Most importantly though, I do not feel that more time in this role is going to get me any further in my career. I feel like I've learned the most I can already.

I ended up getting offered a job with the state government for a similar position. They use more molecular techniques and test a wider range of commodities, so I feel that the experience I would get could help propel my career. The biggest caveat is that my current job pays me 62k/yr with yearly increases but this job would be 53k/yr with no scheduled increases, less benefits and no relocation assistance. I would be relocating 150 miles. Would you take this job? I already tried negotiating and they were not able to adjust it AT ALL. Is the experience worth it in this economy?

My other option is to maybe stay in my current role and pursue higher education.   
I have become really interested in public health or clinical microbiology and would really like to pivot in that direction. Should I consider an MLT? 

I'm really just trying to figure out what other avenues I can explore that will further develop my skillset and knowledge but things seem so doomed right now. Academia and research seems like a risk. Federal government is a risk. Low paying job is a risk.",punkintonuts,2,1.0,4,1741919356,2025-03-14 02:29:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jatnai/do_i_take_a_lower_paying_job_that_i_gets_me_more/,3,2025
1jatj7x,Should I take this offer?,"Current job: Salary is 85,000/yr, 3 weeks of pto + 7 days of sick leave accrued per year. Set dollar amount matched to my retirement (ESOP), which equates to about 4% of my current salary but does not increase as my salary or contributions increase. My job is 5 days in office, but has flexibility for some remote days as needed. Current work is moderate difficulty and I have a good support system in place for steady, upward career growth

  
New offer: Salary is 86,500/yr, 3 weeks of combined pto and sick leave accrues per year. 5% 401k match, 3 days in office/2 days remote. The work in this role would be an immediate increase in responsibility. Nothing I can't handle, but this is a smaller team with less support and a faster expectation for independence and a slightly increased workload

  
My main attraction to the new role is a hybrid schedule. I very much value the days I am able to work from home in my current position and do not think I want to work 5 days in office long term. My current office culture is very corporate and work-first, whereas the new role seems to promote work-life balance a little more. I also think the retirement plan at the new company is better, and my retirement is important to me as well. My main concern with the new role is that the team is much smaller (I would be on a team of 2 people including myself, the other team member is my direct supervisor). I would get great technical experience in this situation, but I am worried that working on such a small team will hinder my growth opportunities to be promoted and to get into management. My current role is a larger team where growth and management opportunities seem more available. There is also the loss of the 7 sick days per year in the new role.

1jat7y3,Masters of Data Science or Law School,"Hi everyone :) I (24F) planned to do a one year Masters of Data Science with a focus on Computational Linguistics (so, working with natural language processing, machine learning, etc). My partner, however, is really urging me to go into law. To be frank, money is a huge consideration for us and with our certain connections, law would be the most lucrative career choice. 

However, many data science MSc can be completed with in a year, and law school takes three years. I would graduate law school at 28-years-old. I want to start a family by 29 (a the *latest*), and I am not sure how easily balanced beginning a career and starting a family can be, especially since I am a woman and would need to take maternity leave.

1jasm78,Last year of college and have two huge internship opportunities (One in sales engineering/One in software engineering) that have a very high chance of leading to a job,"Hey guys,

As my title says I currently am about to graduate from college (currently finishing up my junior year), with a bachelors in Comp Sci. Following this, for this coming summer I have two internship opportunities one as a SWE intern at Mastercard and the other at a big cloud scaling company offering me an internship in sales engineering. Here's the catch about this internship concerning sales engineering, I and my family, are very close with the CRO of this company and I know to an extent (maybe a good extent at most) he will take care of me. He has told me that he will be putting me around to be mentored by the head of sales engineering in his company, and I would be in the calls for pitches, sales etc and be learning from him and his team. My question to you guys is, what direction should I go? As far as what I am being offered from both, the SWE internship is a hybrid job where i would be making about 35$/hr plus a 2k sign on bonus. Comparingly the SE internship would be paying about 22 $/HR, fully remote. But I feel as if im less concerned with the financials now, then I am with what the future entails for both opportunities. The future is my main driving force ( Financial capabilities, Work life balance, future incentives/raises etc... ). I am worried that if I go ahead with the SE internship I am losing that hands on experiences and genuine connections I would be missing by being fully remote. As it currently stands my plan/hope is to go ahead and take the opportunity with Mastercard and after that internship I want to pitch to this family friend CRO that with my furthered experience in tech I would be not only a better fit but far more capable, and ask if that same opportunity would be available after the summer . I feel as if SWE experience opportunities are very hard to come by, so by adding a company as big as Mastercard to my resume it opens so many future doors for me in any direction I choose to go. But as it stands sales engineering seems like my dream job. Am I stupid for not going directly towards the sales engineering route with a head of the company by my side? Is my plan solid? Am I being to greedy in my approach, I've talked directly with the CRO and he vaguely said this opportunity would be available again next summer, and that he would understand if I went the other route, but also said he would really want me with him there? I don't know ive been torn all week, and Ive talked to so many people.

1jasb8m,Upcoming Interview: Lie of omission about being employed?,"I have an upcoming interview, and I'm torn about what to disclose. Here are the facts:

- I was laid off 10 months ago from my dream job where I worked for 8 years. 

- 6 weeks ago, I started a new job that I hate. I knew it would be terrible, but the job market is bad and I had to take what I could get. 

- I decided to keep looking, but I've left my new job off my resume and LinkedIn. This is partly because I have no noteable achievements yet anyway, and partly because I didn't want to raise a red flag about looking for a job when I literally just started one. 

Fast forward to now, I finally got an interview for a job I'm really excited about. The recruiter doesn't know about my current job, but I haven't really lied yet either. 

Do I:

- Continue my lie of omission and neglect to mention that I'm currently working, and cite consulting work that I did during my layoff (which is true).

- Admit that I am currently working at a job I started 6 weeks ago, and just don't like, and thus have to explain why I didn't put it on my resume.

1jarty0,Should I take a difficult promotion? Or stay in my easy stress free role?,"TLDR: Offered promotion, unsure if leaving easy role for more money, more stress, and more hours is worth it. 

I recently came back to this job after leaving for a very similar (on paper) job for more money and a better commute. 

I worked at the other job for 8 months, absolutely hated everything about it (work load, management, people I had to interact with etc).

I got in touch with my old boss to see if they had any openings and he said he didn't think so, but he would find out.

Literally the next day the HR at my old work place called and said they had to fire my replacement and asked would I come back if they matched my current pay rate. I immediately said yes and came back to this job. The pay is good for the area and no degree. It is in quality assurance for a production facility.

I am commuting 50 mins one way, but it is very low stress and I can goof off for extended periods. I work roughly 45 hrs 1 week and 60 the next. Pay is weekly.

I have been offered a supervisor position on the production line for $2-4 dollars more (they aren't sure exactly on the offer yet, they're still discussing) and it would be five 12 hour shifts 7PM-7AM Monday-Friday. I am currently working 9.5 hr shifts (with lots of flexibility on arrival time and leaving time) and am off every other Saturday and Sunday. 

I would get a lot more days off every year, but I would also be working much longer hours and responsible for a crew of 8-15 guys. I would be much more visible to management and prospects for promotion are higher, but I am apprehensive because my current role is very relaxed and very flexible. 

I am so unsure of what the best course of action would be. I absolutely think this is the right career move in terms of promotion, but I am worried the stress and pressure of being in a supervisory role and the extended hours could take a toll on my mental health. I have never been a supervisor and I am in my mid 20s.

- 2. Is it really 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks out of the summer, how long are the deployments ?

- 3. How will this affect me financially, Would my Department still pay me during military leave or Deployments ?

I see there is a ANG Base that is a bit over 1hr from me that's located not too far, Ellington Field Joint Base. I'm now considering joining ANG. I believe it is a better fit for me since the base would be closer.

I'm currently making $80k, and am currently getting paid to pretty much just stand around, work on my masters, occasionally rack and stack servers, and file peoples papers. Basically just a secretary until I get my (TS) security clearance. They literally have no real work for me until I'm cleared. Although it's easy, I'm not real happy with the fact I'm not using the skills I learned all through college (and won't get to until my clearance finishes. Even after that, the role is purely devops, low/no real coding). 

Anyways I have an offer for $110,000 from a much smaller insurance company (500-1000 people in the US, many more overseas), and am wondering if I would be totally stupid to turn it down. It's a classic full-stack role, and hybrid 3 days a week (as opposed to my current 5 days in). This might seem like an obvious choice, but I would be leaving in the middle of my security clearance investigation. I would estimate it has at least 3-6 months left until its complete, but nobody really knows (started investigation in october). Also, I would need to pay back my $7000 relocation bonus. I've been working here for 8 months now, and its my first job. I'd also lose about $3000 in unvested 401k contributions. 

  
The more I think on it, the more it seems like it should be an obvious yes, but I wanted to post here to make sure I'm not overlooking anything.

From the moment I started, I‚Äôve felt overwhelmed and unsupported. My team is incredibly overworked, and while they are good people, there has been little to no guidance. I‚Äôm routinely assigned critical tasks without proper context, and when I ask for clarification, responses take days‚Äîif they come at all. I can‚Äôt submit anything without review because I don‚Äôt know what I am doing. No one ever sat down to teach me. Everything I know is based on assumptions. Despite working 65+ hours a week, I constantly feel behind, and I‚Äôve even been yelled at for delays that were out of my control. I hate when people are mad at me and I don‚Äôt want to disappoint anyone but it‚Äôs everyday where I do. Most of their interns before me were engineering masters student, I am a marketing & supply chain undergrad student. 

I do my best to stay organized, using trackers to manage my assignments, but it‚Äôs difficult to keep up when I‚Äôm struggling to understand what‚Äôs expected of me. The assignments are very general, I have no idea what platform to go to and what steps to ensure I did it for proper approval. There‚Äôs a lot of legal jargon in what I do and specific processes for everything. I‚Äôve been ridiculed for missing deadlines, yet my work requires approvals that I never receive. I try to advocate for myself, showing my unanswered questions and messages which I will send to multiple people on my team, but the blame still falls on me. I‚Äôve never had this issue before‚ÄîI‚Äôve always been able to adapt, but here, I feel set up to fail.

To make things even more surreal, I was hired in an unconventional way: five months after applying, I received a random call asking if I was still interested. After a 10-minute phone conversation, I was given an offer letter, told to start the next month, and relocate to California.

The biggest challenge is that this isn‚Äôt my background‚Äîmy experience is in marketing and product management, but this role is in tech. I‚Äôm trying my best, but without proper support, I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I feel like such a failure, I‚Äôve cried at work nearly every single day. I am already ending the internship early but I have a huge presentation next Tuesday and no one is there to help me, I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm being assigned work like I‚Äôve been here for 5 years already. No one sees me as a young student, they see me as their assistant. I feel so much anxiety, I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

No one here likes me, they all think I‚Äôm avoiding working or that I‚Äôm just plain stupid, or lazy, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt care what people think but I do. I really do. And it gives me so much anxiety. I‚Äôve fallen into a deep depression being here and I almost have no motivation to do my work aside from the fact that they might get mad at me. I miss my family back in NJ, I‚Äôm all alone in California surrounded every day by people who find me irritating. I feel that I am not even learning. I really need advice to keep going, I feel empty, sad, stupid, and unmotivated.",LANGO2019,0,0.5,1,1741911722,2025-03-14 00:22:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jar4yd/i_feel_like_everyone_hates_me_and_thinks_im_lazy/,3,2025
1jar11l,Should I leave my new job after they lied to me?,"During the interview for my new job, I was sold a dream. I mentioned I've been through redundancy threats before and I wanted a safe secure job where I could progress my career. They told me I could get all this at their company. They went through their company story, I asked how many current staff were working on the project I was interviewing for and they told me there was 10 staff. I was offered the job, a really decent wage and what appeared to be decent benefits (health insurance (I'm in the UK), 25 days leave and a Christmas shutdown. 

On my first day I showed up and there was just 1 member of staff, my manager and the MD of the company. I asked where everyone was and was told 'this is it'. I also became aware this day that it was the very first day of this project going live, I was absolutely not aware of this and thought this was an established company and the project had been going for years. 

I challenged the fact I had been told there was 10 staff and my manager pretended to be horrified and pretended to know nothing about it. The interview process was a 3 stage process, with 2 interviews with the recruiters and then a final interview with the MD and my manager. They had every opportunity to tell us the truth about what we'd be doing and about the company. I've even followed this up and asked if this has been addressed with the recruiters yet, and I was brushed off. 

When I spoke to my 1 colleague about this, she told me she was horrified at the situation too. She had only started a week before me and was the first person to start on this project. She said she was told during the recruitment process there were other people working on the project and they made it look very established. Sadly, 2 more people have now joined us and have been sold the same dream. 

Unfortunately, because it's a new project, it hasn't quite taken off yet and we have absolutely no work to do. We are being told to find relevant videos to watch and training to do online whilst we wait for work. We are now 6 weeks into having no work to do. We're all very upset at this entire situation. It's placed a massive stumbling block on our careers and put us all in a difficult situation. We are very worried about our job security (which we have raised with the MD) and we are bored.

We have also had a few other stumbling blocks along the way. Our generous 25 days leave has turned out to be 22 days leave as it is compulsory we use 3 days for the Christmas shutdown, amongst other things. The company appears to be a 'pheonix' company, and went bust last year, laid everyone off and is trying to start again. I'd have never taken this job if I knew even snippets of what I know now. 

The MD and my manager are really nice and friendly, which makes this a really difficult situation. I know they've lied to us all about the state of the company and the stage of which the project is at, and I want to hate them for that, but I guess I just want someone else's opinion on whether this was a really awful thing for them to put 4 people through, or whether we should just pick ourselves back up and get on with it. I'm 90% sure in a few months time we're all going to be out of a job, we've all left decent jobs for this role as it just sounded like a really good opportunity. I really want to look for a new job but I just don't know whether I should give them the benefit of the doubt and see if it works out. 

I guess I'm just after some advice please. What would you do in our situation? Are we overreacting?",LeadershipAwkward521,18,0.8399999737739563,29,1741911406,2025-03-14 00:16:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jar11l/should_i_leave_my_new_job_after_they_lied_to_me/,3,2025

1jaqm93,Should I go to trade school? My degree is literally worthless,"
Hi, I‚Äôm  (26 M) currently working and training in a manual labor industry/blue collar industry that has the potential to learn CNC. My job has a CNC machine that is used by my trainer, and when I learn the other parts of the job well, I can learn that as well. 

The problem is that I graduated with a music degree in 2021, but then my mom had a stroke when I was living with her and I had to move across states to live with my dad. I used to have dreams of doing something with music (I did all state jazz band in high school, piano player of the top band), but since COVID and having to move my life has been really fucked up. I‚Äôm not playing piano anymore and I don‚Äôt have any friends or career opportunities that are motivating. 

Im thinking of just saving up money to do welding school, because I‚Äôve had a job where I got to watch welders and it looked pretty cool. I‚Äôm also familiar with working in heavy equipment environments. Is there any thing else that would offer a path to retirement? I‚Äôm planning on killing myself at some point, if there‚Äôs no way to retire, which does looks likely, even given the fact that I‚Äôm pretty much done even thinking about playing music and am only set on working manual labor jobs until I die.

1jaq3me,Is this a good opportunity or am I being exploited?,"For some context: I‚Äôm 20F and currently working two jobs (barista and hostess) while also attending school full time. I decided to pick up an extra job so I can save up some money before I transfer to an official college, where I‚Äôll be dorming and won‚Äôt be able to work. So in total I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm probably working close to 40 hours a week, not including the time I set aside for school. The cafe I work at is family owned and I know them quite well. They just opened up and some of the owners are new to running a business, so everything is disorganized in terms of having a system for scheduling and inventory. Today one of the owners sat me down and told me he wanted to consider me as a candidate for assistant manager of the store. He explained that it would start off as a sort of ‚Äúinternship‚Äù where I would learn internal business operations like financing, scheduling, managing inventory etc. and if I‚Äôm a good fit, he would move me up and possibly expand me to some of his other businesses. This would be a really good opportunity for me to gain some experience since I‚Äôm majoring in business management, but I have this gut feeling that he‚Äôs just going to exploit me for cheap labor, since he never mentioned any sort of pay raise. Just talked about how good of an opportunity this would be for me to gain experience and stuff. I could tell he was sweet-talking me at some points and it almost seemed he was talking up a big game to make the offer more appealing, telling me how hard it‚Äôs going to be to find work after college and that the knowledge he‚Äôd provide me is something I won‚Äôt learn in school. When I told him it would be a lot for me to manage with everything I have going on right now, especially since I‚Äôm moving away soon, he told me he just needs an extra 10 hours a week to train me and once I get the hang of things that I would be able to work remotely and would only need to stop by the store every other week. (The school I‚Äôm transferring to is in-state and only about a 1 1/2 hour drive away from home) I‚Äôve always known that I‚Äôm capable of doing more than just making coffee and attending to customers but I don‚Äôt know if he genuinely has good intentions for me or if he‚Äôs just chosen me because I‚Äôm young and can be easily manipulated. I figured the experience I‚Äôd gain from this would be worth more than what I‚Äôd be paid but I‚Äôm just not sure if it‚Äôs worth the time and effort.

1japl7w,Should I take a job with a nonprofit for more money or a job at a sports complex with lots of growth?,"I (24F) have been sending out applications for a year, this is my first post grad job. I went to a good school for psychology but don‚Äôt necessarily want to stick to that field, though I worry I‚Äôll want to go back to school at some point. I really have no direction, but I have to pay ~$1,300 for living expenses and I have ~$10k of debt from being unemployed, so $~500 a month. I worry taking job 1 will put my chance of an actual career on hold.

Job 1. Luxury spots complex. $20/hr full time. After everything is paid, I‚Äôll have $700 a month leftover. I would be doing registration and admin work. Amazing benefits, full access to facilities with good discounts on anything else in the complex and tons of free classes. 3 weeks PTO. Sun-thurs 10-6. Healthcare, financial stuff all good. Lots of room to grow, which was emphasized in both interviews. Enjoyed the staff, lots of people working there and all seemed pleasant, decent employee approval online. 40 Min commute (one train, 10 min walk). 

Job 2. Nonprofit that is closer to my major and possible career path. Pays $55,000 and has 4 weeks PTO. Similar benefits in terms of healthcare etc. I‚Äôll have $1600 leftover after everything is paid so I could pay off my debt faster. Obviously a better career choice. No room to grow, or at least not within the next few years because they need this role filled and it‚Äôs a small team. Admin/bookkeeping/some social media/lots of emails. Commute is 1 hour on a train and 15 minute walk. M-F 10-6 with 1 day remote a week, probably Thursday. This would essentially mean leaving at 8:30am and getting home at 7:30pm. Decent employee approval online, but complaints about incompetent management, say it‚Äôs a good place to start and build up. Team said during interview that they sometimes work earlier/later. Everyone was nice, but I didn‚Äôt see anyone within 15 years of my age. 

I personally feel like Job 1 would be easier, a better environment, I could prioritize my health and work on moving up. I don‚Äôt have the best mental health but have recently been a bit better. Job 2 feels like the obvious choice, though. The pay difference is tough. However, I feel that the nonprofit would be temporary and I would have to look for a job again in a year or so unless I ended up loving it. My work day would be closer to 12 hrs than I‚Äôd like when all is said and done. I worry about them losing funding or something like that.

1jap0ak,Where To Take Campaign Experience?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here, so forgive me if it's not directly in line with the rules. I wanted to inquire about where someone like myself, who got a degree in Political Science, and started interning and working on political campaigns shortly after graduating, can go?

  
I've been interning and working on campaigns for about the past year. At first I loved it but in my recent position as a campaign manager I am starting to think this line of work is not for me. I have been puking every morning for the last two weeks from stress. I don't get any days off (typical of campaigns) and I am working at least 10 hours a day. Every morning that I open my eyes I immediately feel dread and anxiety, and immediately check my phone to see if I missed any messages from my superiors. This job, even though I have been at it for just a month, has consumed my life. It is all I think about, all I do, and the stress is so bad.

  
I am thinking of changing to another career. Now, I don't mind the idea of a regular 9-5, with weekends off. In fact, that sounds amazing giving that my last two campaign roles had me working every single day, all day. I am realizing that campaigning is just not for me, even though I thought it was. I enjoy free time, I enjoy relaxing, I enjoy pursuing hobbies. Call me lazy, but I am just not the right fit for a line of work that is so demanding, I am realizing. Luckily, I am young, in my twenties, so I feel that it is not too late. Where would a young campaign worker, with good computer skills, intelligence, and who went to a good school be able to take his talents? I want to pivot to a new career, not have just a ""job"". I worked retail out of college and the pay was terrible and I worked late nights every day, don't want to go back to that.

  
Long story short, a campaign worker and starry eyed hopeful of making positive political change has fallen out of love with working on campaigns due to the long hours and insane stress and wants to pursue a regular 9-5, want to know how to go about it.

1jaoy9h,Should I risk my career to enjoy my youth?,"I'm 21, live in Panama, I have had odd remote jobs so far at call centers or doing cold calling for USA based companies, and after some years I finally landed an internship as a software developer in this local company, (hybrid 2 days WFH), 3 months long, the pay is $100 per month and if I do good they might offer me a full time position and from what I have asked some peers, the pay will be around $750 a month for a full time position.

Now for the first time I need to work on site and even though I only need to go to the office 3 times per week, I have to either take buses which takes about an hour or I need to spend money on Uber which is too expensive for me considering I am not making any actual money on the internship.

I have felt miserable these months because I feel like even if they do offer me the full time position, I don't want to spend +10 hours of my day working and not even make a good amount of money, outside of work I just go to the gym and that's it because I have no money to actually go out with friends or meet new people.

It will sound bad but I don't look up to my coworkers outside of the job neither, don't take me wrong they are great at what they do and I enjoy spending time with them, but I don't like how their life work balance looks, some are in their mid 20s - early 30s and have no car, live with their parents and often complain about how they either have no time or money.

All of this has made me really reconsider if I should continue in this company or field overall, I have 1 month and a half left to finish the internship but I have already received job offers for other remote sales or lead generation positions for companies offering up to $2k per month, which at my age and in my country is a lot of money.

Should I quit after having completed only 2 months into the internship and have a fun early 20s life with more money and flexibility and see what happens in the future? or just stay on this path and focus on the long term, which I also think is uncertain as how AI has been growing I don't even know if software development is a safe field anymore.",therazant,1,1.0,4,1741905679,2025-03-13 22:41:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jaoy9h/should_i_risk_my_career_to_enjoy_my_youth/,3,2025
1jaoxlg,How Should I Negotiate Salary with my Current Employer?,"
I love the job I currently am working in. I have the flexibility to work from home a few days a week and I only have to arrange for child care for two days a week to accommodate being hybrid. However, my salary is less than I am hoping to be making and what I feel I should be getting given my 10+ years of experience in the industry. 
I also got a certification at the beginning of the year that no one else in my department has, and it ties pretty close to the department‚Äôs main function. My manager wants me to help build out and strengthen our department using this, and told me this earlier in the week. 

I had casually applied to a few roles a few months ago, and I got a job offer today for a similar role. It would increase my base pay by ~25%, but I would lose some of the flexibility and benefits I have currently. I would have be in the office 5 days a week, so that would increase the childcare costs, among other things. 

The problem I am facing is that I haven‚Äôt had my year end review yet for 2024. (We‚Äôll be doing it in two weeks) So I don‚Äôt know what my bonus or merit increase is going to look like, or if there would be any changes to my title to take into account this certification. 

I would like to see if my current company will negotiate with me on a salary increase. (I know it won‚Äôt be as much as the new role is offering me). I‚Äôd love to stay where I currently am and I don‚Äôt want to burn any bridges by doing this with my current role, and the new company would like me to signal my intentions by Monday. 

Any advice on how I should approach my boss/company to negotiate a salary increase without knowing what I‚Äôll be getting for my 2024 merit and bonus? I feel like I‚Äôm between a rock and a hard place.

1jaocui,AIO or is my coworker trying to control/sabotage me?,"I apologize, this is going to be a long post but I'm going to try to bullet point a lot of stuff to make it easier to read.

For some context, I'm in my early-mid 20s, my coworker is in their early 30s.

So, there's a new-ish coworker in my small yet important department. They've been here a few months and I along with our supervisor work the closest with her. In the beginning I didn't like her much, as we are very different people with different political views, but I still acted friendly towards her.

She tries to be my friend a lot, has tried to invite me places and stuff, but I can't attend these event due to not having a car and to be honest, when it's my time off, I just want to be by myself. She also likes to gossip, mostly about HR, and has tried to gossip with me, but I try to keep my answers neutral by just saying ""ooooh"" ""oh yea"" ""wow"" ""uh-huh"" etc.

Here are some things she's done that rubs me the wrong way:

- when she wants my attention, she will spam teams/email or, if in person, go to my desk and ask me to meet her away from our coworkers.

-instead of saying ""could you do this thing?"" She instead emails ""Do this thing"" in bold.

-not sure abt this one, but our other coworkers sat me aside once to tell me the way this particular coworker talks to me is inappropriate.

-Has told me to tell our supervisor to get rid of my other priorities that doesn't involve her, so I can exclusively work with her.

- in a meeting the other day, our supervisor asked me a question, and addressed me on the question, and as I was about to speak, this coworker spoke over me and for so long, I didn't get to answer the question. 

- We have been dealing with cutting ties with an agency, and have been dealing with transferring files from them to us. These files contain mostly stuff I would have to deal with. I know that they're fine, I have opened a few files and they looked normal. There was one file that did have some issues. But it wasn't anything big, this file had assets that were misplaced in other folders. I was able to relink a few in that session. Yet my coworker keeps harping on it, in a rude tone. 

-Bc of above, she's been trying to get me to set up meetings with the guy in the same position as me in that agency. We met him in that file transfer session, and I talked with him, and we both agreed we didn't need anymore meetings as there was nothing for us to go over. Workflow for our position varies person to person. But my coworker doesn't understand and has sent me a targeted email.

-our supervisor and us had a meeting planned with a VP of another department, supervisor told me to tell my coworker that us two will go to that VPs office, and wait for them (our supervisor). When we got there, that VP was like ""sorry I cant do the meeting"" and my coworker was like ""oh sorry, (OP) told me that we should come here"". I reiterated that it was our supervisor who told us, and thankfully immediately after saying that, my supervisor was right behind us.

- she has tried to write my emails for other ppl bc they are not to her standards. She also tries to get me to do meetings I don't have any part of. 




I have talked to our supervisor about this weeks ago, when it wasn't so bad. My supervisor said she noticed and had a talk with my coworker. And it DID get better, but now it's just worse than before. I never really got super irritated or annoyed with this coworker, but now I am, and it's to the point I can barely hide it. I made the mistake of pulling a face in a meeting and my supervisor saw it üíÄ

1janl93,NM vs. NYL‚Ä¶,"To give a little bit of background, I‚Äôve spent the last 10 or so years in retail banking (in teller, customer service, banker, sales, operation manager roles, etc.).

I was laid off at the end of January and decided to look into roles more in the client services/wealth management side of financial services. I‚Äôve now found myself with two offers I may be interested in from Northwestern Mutual and another from NY Life as a financial advisor/financial professional.

I was aware that NM does not necessarily have the best image, but I‚Äôve recently found out that NYL may have a similar image (maybe not the best sales tactics, insufficient training, few cold leads to start, etc.)

I was looking to hear from people with experience at either firm which might be better, if any of these things are true, etc.

If these firms were not necessarily what I was looking for, I‚Äôd consider completing licensing, and transitioning to another firm. Would that be recommended or is it better to wait it out?

1janaqw,my linkedin sucked terribly - it doesn't anymore üòé,"Hey everyone,

I want to share something real about my journey with LinkedIn. For a long time, my profile felt like a bland, half-hearted summary that didn‚Äôt truly show who I am or what I've done. I didn‚Äôt want to stretch the truth or lie about my experience‚ÄîI just wanted it to reflect me, honestly.

I kept thinking my profile was missing something. It was generic, and I felt it didn‚Äôt capture the real work I‚Äôve put in over the years. Instead of adding buzzwords or exaggerating my achievements, I decided to strip it all back and focus on what really matters. I wanted every word on my profile to be something I could stand behind.

After getting some honest feedback from friends and colleagues, I stumbled across a tool called [Nomora](https://nomora.org/). It wasn‚Äôt a magic fix, but it helped me see the gaps in my profile in a straightforward, no-nonsense way. I used that feedback to rework my headline, rewrite my summary, and even add a few specific numbers and examples to back up my experience‚Äîwithout stretching the truth.

I updated my profile picture too. I switched out a casual snapshot for one that felt more professional and true to who I am. It might seem like a small change, but it really boosted my confidence and how others perceived me online.

What really changed was the focus on authenticity. I wanted my profile to be a genuine reflection of my journey‚Äîevery job, every project, and every win, even the small ones. I stopped worrying about what recruiters wanted to hear and started focusing on telling my own story in a way that felt real.

Slowly but surely, I began to notice a difference. People started engaging with my profile in a way that felt more meaningful. Instead of those vague ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be in touch‚Äù messages, I got real conversations about real opportunities.

I‚Äôm still learning and tweaking things as I go, but I‚Äôve learned one thing for sure: honesty really does pay off. Your online presence should be a window into your true self, not a polished fa√ßade that hides your journey. It‚Äôs not always the flashiest profile that gets noticed‚Äîit‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs genuine.

So, if you‚Äôre stuck with a profile that feels off, take a moment to look at it with fresh eyes. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúDoes this really represent who I am and what I‚Äôve accomplished?‚Äù Sometimes a few honest tweaks can make a world of difference.

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and what changes you‚Äôve made that really felt authentic.

Thanks for reading this far!

1jamk0q,Stay or go?,"I‚Äôve got analysis paralysis on this decision and it‚Äôs making me really anxious. I can‚Äôt decide if I should take a risk and try out this new job, or stay where I‚Äôm at. 

Context: working in IT consultancy and really enjoy my field/role. Both Current Job (CJ) and New Job (NJ) are the same general field/same role. I‚Äôve been at CJ for around 4 years.

Good things about CJ: supportive work environment, like everyone there, flexitime, get on w my manager, and when I‚Äôm doing my role, enjoy it. Good learning and development WHEN on the right projects. Several socials a year which are a lot of fun. Hybrid office so can WHF or go in whenever (but I only really go on social days). Redundancies / firing rare.

Bad things about CJ (and why I‚Äôm in the predicament): no defined roles past where I‚Äôm at, so progression is unclear - I have to ask for specific things and they do deliver, but can take a while (like several months) to do so. Have asked for exposure to leading projects a year ago and this still hasn‚Äôt come through. Can be out of work for long periods of time (like 4 months). Have been asked in the past to take on a different role that I don‚Äôt like doing, that doesn‚Äôt help me in the one I do like, in those empty months - tbf I could say no, but if they and I know I‚Äôll be doing nothing otherwise, I tend not to. Salary is approx 30% under market rate.

Because of this, I ended up responding to a couple of recruiters who reached out to me, offering essentially the same job but for more money. Narrowed down offers to the best which is NJ. Since I do like CJ when I have work and am busy doing my role, I asked my manager before resigning, if management could match. They have matched and said I can be put onto 2 new projects next - including one where I would lead with support. So now I am really struggling on the right move to make. 

Good things about NJ: defined roles, so a clear way to move up. Few more days of annual leave. Free health cover inc dental and optical (I have health and can get dental at CJ but have to pay). Same role and general field, but a different area of the system, so would expand my knowledge. Also I‚Äôve only worked at CJ - exposure to more ways of working, wider network etc. flexitime and a big focus on wellbeing (although this is what I‚Äôm told, can‚Äôt be certain it‚Äôs true!)

Bad things about NJ: fully remote - no office option. Only 1 social a year (but they are trying to change to 2). The slightly different field means I lose the advantage I have in the current one (which is on a new system, and I‚Äôve been working on that system since it came out - lucky to be exposed to it so much). Also, will be a delay before I get those lead opportunities while they assess me - so not necessarily faster than CJ. They downsized the team quite recently, so a little worried about security. From interviews, think will get on with people but of course no certainty.

If anyone has been in a similar position - what did you do? How did it go? Supposed to decide tomorrow, may try and push to Monday as my gut swings either way morning to night!

Now the problem is that it will take almost forever for me to get the GC. I asked my boss to give me a pay raise as I provided him all the data to show that I have been below average during all this time. He is a great guy but I was disappointed how he is not able to support the team members. I mean he is not even sure if he can start this conversation with senior management. All the numbers are in my support but he does lack the trust in the company that they will increase my pay. I am the most junior in my team and he says other senior members would be below my pay if they increase it. I was simply not able to digest it. I am not asking to match FAANG companies salary and just asking to make it slightly above average. Then he suggested that he will talk about title change.

""I need a reality check. Two years ago, I joined my friends' startup as their first employee after being a freelancer. I got offered ESOP equity and the opportunity to build something meaningful together.

The initial setup:

* Close friends building something promising
* First employee with equity stake
* Shared vision and values
* Strong friendship and trust

How things evolved:

* Company is growing significantly
* Dynamic shifted from ""working with them"" to ""working for them""
* Doing everything from warehouse work to digital marketing
* Long hours, relatively low pay, high stress
* Respect and transparent communication deteriorated significantly

The reality now:

* Becoming more replaceable each day
* The exit opportunity could be life-changing financially
* Mentally drained, thinking about quitting daily
* Friendship that made me join is basically gone

Here's what I'm struggling with: I can't tell if I'm being mentally tough by pushing through hardship for potential future rewards, or if I'm being naive by accepting this treatment based on what used to be.

Part of me says ""man up, this is what building something great takes."" Another part says ""stop being an idiot, they're taking advantage of you.""

1jaj5ej,"Burning out from extra work, but apparently I still need to grow","(Throwaway account because I just need to vent anonymously.)

CONTEXT:

At my job, we're evaluated based on:

1. How well we align with the company's values.
2. How we perform against the goals set by our manager.

For each parameter, we get rated as Low, Good, or Outstanding. These ratings determine our overall performance:
- Low performer
- Good performer (meets expectations)
- High performer (exceeds expectations)

After that, our manager evaluates our potential and rates whether we:

1. Still have room for growth in our current role.
2. Are ready for a lateral move.
3. Are ready for an advancement move.


MY CASE:

I scored Good on half of the parameters and Outstanding on the other half. I also received glowing feedback from colleagues. My final rating? High performer (exceeds expectations).

Sounds great, right? Well, not really‚Äîbecause when it came to assessing my potential, my manager rated me as ""room for growth in the current role.""

And that really pisses me off.

Why?

I was hired to be the business owner of a company-wide system. At the same time, they also hired someone in a support role to handle operational tasks. Then:

- Due to restructuring, my support person was moved to another team. I had to absorb their workload.

- Around the same time, the product owner of the system went on sabbatical. Since I was already deeply involved as the main business stakeholder, I was asked to step in.

- There was no real handover. I had zero experience as a product owner, zero experience working in a Scrum framework. I had to figure it out on my own.

- I had only been at the company for five months when all of this happened.

- Now, seven months later, I‚Äôm still doing it all‚Äîplus, they dumped another system on me to manage as business owner.


So tell me‚Äîhow the hell am I still considered as ""needing growth"" in my role when I‚Äôm already doing the job of multiple people? How am I supposed to grow when I‚Äôm drowning in extra work that isn‚Äôt even mine?

I‚Äôve taken on tasks across different roles, with little to no guidance or support. I‚Äôve kept critical systems running under stressful conditions. I haven‚Äôt received any compensation adjustment. And after all this, they‚Äôre still implying I need to prove myself?

I feel completely undervalued and unfairly treated.

Hopefully this subreddit is appropriate for my post. I'm seeking some advice/guidance/wisdom from older folks who have ‚Äúbeen there‚Äù and can relate to the struggle. Thanks in advance.

I‚Äôm 30, North America, first-generation student, immigrant parents, came from a poor background.

Went to university straight out of high school because that‚Äôs just what you did. I was completely clueless and unprepared. Had no idea who I was or what I wanted.

Fast forward and I ended up with a¬†**BA and MEd**¬†(Master of Education, not a medical degree lol), which haven‚Äôt gotten me anywhere in life.

I‚Äôve spent the majority of my ‚Äúcareer‚Äù bouncing around in the¬†**education/higher education field,**¬†scraping up whatever roles I could find. The majority of roles have been lowly/contract/part-time/covering-for-someone/temporary jobs (if you‚Äôre from the field, you know the struggle). Nothing permanent or full-time.¬†**Nothing to actually sustain myself and move forward in life.**

At any given moment, I‚Äôm either under-employed or straight up UNemployed. In the past year, for example, I‚Äôve had 2 contracts with long periods of unemployment in between. My current role ends in April once the main staff member returns from leave. This is basically a snapshot of what it‚Äôs been like for me in my field since I finished school.

Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôm still stuck living under my parents roof because I simply do not make (nor have I ever made) enough money to¬†**properly, comfortably and sustainably move out**¬†as a single person in HCOL area. I've had previous brief stints with roommates, sure, but was barely scraping by financially. Always ended up having to return home.

My whole situation makes me feel sick. I feel so cheated out of life. I did everything you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed to do,‚Äù and it hasn‚Äôt gotten me anywhere. I‚Äôm so far behind my peers, and even people younger than me at this point. I‚Äôm so ashamed and devastated, and I‚Äôve isolated myself over the years as a result.

So, here I am at 30, putting everything on hold for a major career change into a completely unrelated field¬†**(healthcare).**¬†If all goes well, I‚Äôll be settled into the new career and finally making real money in the next 3-4ish years.

Until then, my income (already small to begin with) will come to a complete halt once the program starts later this year. I still won‚Äôt be able to move out or do anything major really until I‚Äôm in the new career.",justmilesaway,1,1.0,1,1741890833,2025-03-13 18:33:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jaj4to/people_in_their_mid30s_onward_if_you/,3,2025

1jah9lo,Should I talk to my boss about a coworker who doesn‚Äôt do any work?,"Should I talk to my manager about a coworker who doesn‚Äôt do any work?

Hi, I have a coworker in my team who doesn‚Äôt seem to do any work at all. I work remotely in IT so it‚Äôs pretty easy to track that. I usually don‚Äôt care about that as long as it doesn‚Äôt impact my work. The problem is, I am quite sure this person is getting paid as much as me (salaries are not talked about, but there are salary standards and we are on the same level) and I have a decent to heavy workload throughout the week consistently.

Last time we had another coworker who I was highly suspicious of not doing any work (again, it‚Äôs easy to track, plus she often didn‚Äôt respond to my messages for hours if not the entire day(even though she appeared online)) and I ended up being right - it took the management almost two years to figure that out and it took me only a couple of months to start suspecting that. They eventually fired her. But for two years she got away with doing practically no work, causing more issues and bugs than actually helping.

Going back to the current story. I am wondering if it‚Äôs a good idea to bring it up with my manager. I don‚Äôt want to be a rat, but I also feel like it‚Äôs very unfair that there is a person getting paid for nothing while the rest of the team actually puts in effort.

1. Land a new job in my field and interests. I've been aggressively applying and networking, so hopefully, I can secure a role soon and leave my current job for something more aligned.

2. If 1 don't have a new job in my field by next month, I'l work in retail within the industry I want to pivot into (beauty, fashion, luxury) while freelancing on the side to keep building my marketing skills and income until I land the right full-time role.

1jagwui,How to leave without jeopardizing current or future role with vacation time in the middle?,"
I recently accepted a job offer starting in a few weeks, immediately after my current job‚Äôs vacation. If I submit my notice upon my return, I‚Äôll have two weeks of overlap with my new role. Since both jobs are remote, this shouldn‚Äôt be a major issue. However, I‚Äôm concerned about jeopardizing my new position.

On the other hand, if I notify my current employer before my vacation, I‚Äôll have to forfeit that week of leave. My company offers ‚Äúunlimited vacation time,‚Äù meaning they don‚Äôt pay out unused vacation when I depart. My partner is really uneasy about me taking the week between jobs off without pay and would prefer that I either leave without notice immediately upon return from vacation, or have some overlap between the two to be safe.

I‚Äôm also unable to extend my start date any further because I‚Äôve already pushed it back two weeks later than they originally asked. How can I approach this situation without damaging my current role while also avoiding taking the week of vacation without pay? It‚Äôs worth mentioning that I was unexpectedly given a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) last year, but I successfully regained my standing. The PIP was issued immediately upon my return from maternity leave, and I had no prior indication of poor performance.

1jafxlz,Hard time finding literally anything; Advice?,"**Intro:**

I'm 33, I live with my mom in a town with less than 300 people, AFAIK. Last census. I've been jobless since last summer. Not from the lack of trying. We had to sell our jeep and we got $250 for it because it quit working. My mom gets to her job by my stepdad and my sister. My step dad hates me and wants (borderline) nothing to do with me. So he won't help me in the slightest.

I want to get a remote job but everything I search for is fake, on indeed so it might as well be fake, and no one calls me back. 

**Why don't you have a job now?**  
Last summer I was getting to my last job, which was a pool job. I was going to clients' houses and cleaning, fixing, and ""make look pretty"" pools. I lost that job because I do not for the life of me understand PPM (parts per million). I swear to god it sounds like a crack head came up with this logic. I was let go after about 6 months because of this. I told my boss when I started that I wanted to stay as a helper. 

Come to find out, the people I went with would complain about me. This is complete crap. Why? I would ask my partner that I was with what I needed to do, then I would do it, I would ask again to make sure I got everything, and he would say, ""You're fine, dude, I'll let you know."" Almost all of them would tell me this. There wasn't anything for me to do. 

They complained I wasn't working. When I ask you what to do and you tell me ""nothing"" I'm not going to find random crap to do just to do it. If there's nothing to do, you need to tell me what to do. Everytime I do things I'm not supposed to do in ANY job I've had, I get yelled at for it. EVERY. SINGLE. JOB. So don't tell me that I'm doing something wrong when I'm basically a background character waiting for instructions. I found out that they didn't like me. I joked, but I wasn't terrible. I was cool with the guys. Only 2 people wanted to go out to jobs with me. Let's just say, I'm white and they don't like that because they are brown. I don't care about skin colour but that was the case, at least that's what it felt like to me.

**Why can't you get a job now?**

I have no real way of getting around. Everything in both directions of my main road has nothing down it for around 2.2 miles, and if you've never walked a mile, it takes around 30 minutes. I walked to the Dollar General near me, down a partial highway, it took 1h10m, back and forth. There are a few businesses there, but I talked to everyone around and they all gave me the same excuses, ""No, we just hired someone."" I was dressed nicely. I didn't smell... bad. But still no one wants to hire me and I don't know why. 

The next closest place is another city, which would take me nearly 3 hours to walk to, 15 15-minute drive or 30 30-minute bike ride. I don't own a bike. I've not owned a bike in 15 years. I'd ride a bike around my main town if I had a way there. 

**The car situation:**  
I lost my car around 6 or so months ago. I saved up $1500 from the pool job, I needed $3500, I even asked my boss if there was anything else I could. Nope! I needed the money for a new engine. Sadly, I had to sell my car for $500. That's all I got from it. Now, all my money is coming from friends.

**Me:**  
I don't do drugs, I don't drink. I don't do anything illegal. I'm just trying to make ends meet. I have less than $60 to my name. I just want a little help. If I can find a remote job, I'll take it. If I can get a moped or a bike, I'll find the nearest McDonald's and go there. I don't care anymore. I JUST WANT TO SURVIVE! 

**Outro:**  
If you read all that, thank you. I'll read your advice. I'll have this tab pinned in my browser. ",Holomatter,1,1.0,0,1741882991,2025-03-13 16:23:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jafxlz/hard_time_finding_literally_anything_advice/,3,2025

1jafhw5,Seeking Advice on Breaking Back into Advertising/Marketing - How to Land a Job as an Account Manager/Media Buyer in Top-Tier Agencies in London/Dubai?,"
Hi everyone, I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to break back into the advertising and marketing industry. Here‚Äôs a bit about my background:

1. I graduated with an MSc in Marketing from a Top 20 UK university in 2022.
2. I completed my placement as a Display Account Executive in a media agency (Oct 2022 ‚Äì May 2023), where I worked on campaign management, client relations, and optimization of digital advertising.
3. Prior to this, I worked as a Brand Services Associate in a well-known advertising agency, where I was involved in client relations and business development.
4. Currently, I‚Äôm working with a mid size apparel sourcing business to bridge the gap in my CV and gain experience, but my goal is to transition back into advertising or marketing full-time.

I have a few questions:

1. What strategies should I emphasize on my CV when applying for Account Management or Media Buyer roles in top agencies, especially in cities like London and Dubai? Are there any specific keywords or metrics that would help make my CV stand out?
2. How can I break into these roles without having direct experience in agencies at the moment, but with relevant transferable skills from my previous work?
3. How can I effectively leverage my international work experience and my time in the UK (I am currently on a PSW visa, valid until Dec 2025 & hold an Indian passport) in the job market?
4. Would working in Dubai or Qatar or Saudi be a realistic option for someone with my background, considering salary expectations, industry demand, and competition for roles in those markets?

1jad3qz,Should I quit my job before getting confirmation for a new one?,"
Hey everyone, this is my first time posting on Reddit, and I could really use some advice.

About a year ago, I joined a small purchasing office (around 8 employees) because I wanted to develop my skills in procurement. At first, everything seemed fine, but after a few months, I realised that I wasn‚Äôt actually learning much about purchasing. Instead, my tasks felt more like sales‚Äîconstantly trying to convince suppliers or customers rather than focusing on actual procurement.

So, I started job hunting and found a position that I‚Äôm really excited about. I‚Äôve gone through the entire hiring process and just passed the final step. Now, I‚Äôm waiting for an answer, which should come in the next two weeks. On one hand, I feel confident that I convinced the hiring manager and HR. On the other hand, I heard that this position was originally planned for someone else, and they plan to open more of the same roles throughout the year.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: I‚Äôve grown to really resent my current job, to the point where I just want to walk away. But should I quit now, even without the final confirmation, and risk being unemployed for a longer period if things don‚Äôt work out? Or should I tough it out for another two weeks to get the confirmation? My notice period is one month, so in total, we‚Äôre talking about 4‚Äì6 more weeks in this job.

For context, this hiring process has been ongoing since December, and I‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end. I‚Äôd really appreciate some Reddit wisdom on how to handle this!

1jacdqd,Onboarding / questionnaire,"Hello everyone!

From personal experience, I have noticed that many people face issues during the onboarding process, especially those with lower seniority (not directly related to programming). In order to draw any conclusions, I created a survey that might help clarify the issue. The survey is intended for both employees and HR/managers/team leads, so if you find yourself in both roles, feel free to fill it out twice. If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to ask, I will respond as soon as possible.

1jabjnq,How can I Leverage my position for better pay?,"So today I‚Äôm having a conversation with my boss. 

TLDR: I‚Äôve working for her through a customer service agency for 4 months now and she has been in love with my work constantly telling me how amazing I‚Äôve been and that I‚Äôm the best assistant she‚Äôs ever had. 

Well a few days ago she told me she had plans for me with the growth of her business, that I would be the head of the customer service team for her. 

I‚Äôve been thinking about telling her that I would like to be directly employed by her and not through a third party (the agency) this so that I can maximize my income and maybe even save her money in the process. 

How could I approach this conversation, I want this to be a win win but I feel in a very strong position as I have become critical to her sales process and replacing me with another assistant may derail or slow down the growth she has planned as I am extremely overqualified for my position and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excelling at it.

Any tips or recommendations? ",ianrdz,0,0.5,11,1741871284,2025-03-13 13:08:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1jabjnq/how_can_i_leverage_my_position_for_better_pay/,3,2025
1jab6nq,Don‚Äôt Let the No‚Äôs Keep You From Having Some Fun and Being You,"So I recently applied to a job in a state my wife and I really wanted to live. Both my wife and I have visited it several times and knew we wanted to be there, but we know we can‚Äôt pull the trigger on the move without something lined up for work since there is no family in this state for us to get help from. We‚Äôd be taking this adventure fully on our own, which is fun and exciting, but also feels a bit more risky these days considering the current economy. So I‚Äôve been applying and applying with mostly no responses or the generic ‚Äúwe‚Äôve moved forward with someone else who is more qualified‚Äù which I get, I‚Äôm not a seasoned professional in my role. I got about 3 years experience related to what I do, my work history prior to that is part time stuff while in college. Well recently I finally heard back from a job, and it was actually everything I hoped it would be, it was a role doing something I really wanted to do, in the state, in a city we‚Äôve visited and loved, and public work for that city which is also something I was hoping for over private sector work. My wife and I were super excited! We knew this would be a big move if it worked out so we started planning, not committing to anything, but planning to be sure we were ready to make the move if I got the position. Had a whole moving road trip planned pretty much across country and how we would do it and the things we‚Äôd be able to do once we were there. We pretty much planned everything down to the penny of how much gas would be needed and what cities and parks we would stop at along the way to make a trip of everything we could. We got to the point honestly where our heads were already living there even, rookie mistake there I guess, prolly made this no a lil harder than the rest. Got OUR hopes up this time, not just my own. Anyways, got the email recently saying that they chose to move forward with someone they felt was more suited to the role. Hurt to get this one, but I still responded asking for feedback, maybe next time I‚Äôll be better prepared as this role had me conduct a take home exam so there could be extra valuable information to take away from it. I got the response and apparently I was ‚Äúvery close‚Äù and there were 3 questions that needed improvement out of the 10, and the hiring manager gave very brief responses to why. Not much information, but ended his email with ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt give too much detail because you are an active applicant for the Tier II position‚Äù‚Ä¶ when I applied to this role I had applied for the Tier I and Tier II levels of this role. Based on the job description I felt I was a good fit for either role but so far I only heard back from the Tier I position. So that shot a bit of hope back into me because the Tier II position did close later so maybe I just need to wait to get material for it? Im not sure, I feel like if I wasn‚Äôt a fit for Tier I then I‚Äôm prolly not a fit for Tier II to them either. If that were the case though, why bother mentioning it? Like if you know I‚Äôm not Tier II material based on what you know now after receiving my material, then what difference would it make to provide me more detailed feedback? Idk, it felt odd and I can‚Äôt tell if I should feel like there may be hope to get this Tier II role or not. Anyways, I decided mentally I didn‚Äôt want to let the way I felt about the rejection keep me from being me, and when I saw that response I had one thing run through my mind: So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance‚Ä¶ lol. So I responded to the email to essentially ask if that was the case, and try to inject some humor into the email as well. I remained professional and thanked them for taking the time to provide feedback, and then asked to confirm if my understanding was that I would still be considered for the Tier II role, and included the meme of Jim Carrey saying ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me there‚Äôs a chance‚Äù lol. I contemplated sending it at all, because professionalism and all, but figured I already got rejected so worse case, I‚Äôm already not really being considered for Tier II anyways. Best case? Hiring manager finds it funny and maybe it slightly improves my odds for the Tier II role. Might as well get a laugh and maybe give a laugh too lol. This market is so tough right now, no need to let this rejection decide my week. My wife and I have already pivoted to taking a trip instead too, get out of the house a while and spend a weekend in a cheap cabin next to a river for some fishing, watch garbage TV, and play some board games and card games. God knows we could use the break mentally. All will be well for us regardless, can‚Äôt let the no‚Äôs keep you from being you and finding peace in your current situation, whatever it may be. 

TLDR: Really wanted a job in another state I wasn‚Äôt selected for at Tier I, but it looks like there is still hope for Tier II role in same place. Sent a follow up email to hiring manager when I heard I wasn‚Äôt selected but was still an active applicant asking for feedback, and decided to include a Jim Carrey Meme of ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance‚Äù in the email. Gonna take a break and trip with the wife, and prolly a break from the job hunting for a little while. Who knows, maybe I get a response to that email and it at least gave someone a laugh lol

Good luck to everyone out there job hunting currently. It‚Äôs hard to chase dreams right now, I hope you can find a way to keep chasing and still have fun. Don‚Äôt let a rejection decide who you are and take a break from the hunt if you need to.

1jaat93,Landed a QE Job - how can I obtain a better paying position?,"I have a Bachelors Degree, 1 yr internship, and 1 yr experience as a QE. After applying to around 50 jobs, I managed to get 3 offers; 59k, 66k, and 70k (AUD). I accepted the 70k salary role (around 44k USD), which is the same as I was earning at my previous job (bit less adjusting for inflation). There's no WFH and the office is about an hours drive, which isn't ideal but it's something.

I was under the impression that the market average for a junior QE was around 80k - am I being lowballed or is this the state of the market atm?

Lastly, what's the correct play here to potentially land a higher paying role? Should I keep applying and look to leave them soon? Find a higher paying grad role for 2026? Or should I prove my value and then negotiate a payrise with this current company? If so, how long into my employment would it be appropriate to start negotiating?

Initially all was going well and I got on well with everybody. PM sort of professionally love bombed me ‚Äì I could do no wrong and I was in on everything happening on the floor and we had a collaborative working relationship. I sort of fell into a demand forecasting role based on the data I was collecting ‚Äì and I was asked to take this on as part of my duties. ¬†That‚Äôs when mine and the PM‚Äôs relationship started to deteriorate. It immediately, became clear that this was a problem for PM who felt that this should be part of her role even if it hadn‚Äôt been previously and her challenges with tech also meant that she wasn‚Äôt able to keep up with what I was doing.

She took over the forecasting by force like almost a literal coup ‚Äì ¬†one week I was doing it and the next I wasn‚Äôt. Btw this also involved storming out of meetings, spreading rumours, lying to the Managing Director (MD) about conversations we had had etc. Part of the problem is that PM is insecure and thinks I‚Äôm there to take her job and is taking this out on me. This has made the work environment very tense and hostile and she thrives on withholding information, creating cliques of people who ‚Äúreport‚Äù to her, kind of like spies so she‚Äôs iced me out and made it a little harder for me to work with people on the floor.

I'm sponsored by this company for the past 3 years (I'm a third-world citizen), and I can't real switch jobs or do anything because no one would hire foreigners. Sponsoring VISAs takes ages, so companies avoid it. I asked for a raise twice, and twice did they decline my request. Every time they give me a measly 4% increase or something and thank me for my work. I tried in the past showing that I am worthy of a raise and went above and beyond in terms of performance and took up a lot of other tasks, but they told me tat they thought I was doing it to make my job more interesting and they only gave me the usual 4% raise. Since then, I just told them okay I'll resume my duties as normal, forget all the extra stuff I did, they absorbed it and told me alright that works. 

That's where we're at right now, it's a dead-end job, literally have been doing the same thing for the past 3 years. I've also automated a lot of my work creating VBA-powered Excel sheets, and I'm in the process of trying to sell them online.

But would it be wise to just come clean that I've created some of the best tools in the market for my private use and I'm profiteering off of them online and I'd be more than happy to implement them at a raise?

1ja6xw8,New hire is getting to do work I want to do,"I'm a marketing manager at a tech scale up. Some background info: We have multiple solutions/products but don't have a product manager for one of them. Since its a scale up product managers also take on product marketing tasks like messaging, go to market strategy, usp. I've been with this company for the past 3 years, I've started as a single person on the team except for my manager. So I was very excited when we recently hired an additional person to the team, also for the same position as mine except for a different market. It meant a lot of pressure would be relieved from me. I do feel like I have a better work life balance now and can dedicate more time to certain projects.

For the past 3 years my role has been extremely broad and I had to do everything from analytics to content. During my career planning meetings which we have twice per year, I've indicated to my manager that I want to narrow down my role and start specializing in one area rather than keeping it broad. I'm particularly interested in Product Marketing where I could use more of my research skills and learn how to bring products to new markets. 

Yesterday I had a meeting with both my manager and the new hire. During the meeting my manager announced that the new hire will be taking on new responsibilities and get to work on what she called ""PM lite"" role for a couple of hours per week for a product that doesn't currently have an actual PM. So this ""lite"" role literally encompasses what I told my manager I would like to be focusing on. However, this was never even brought up to me or I was never even considered for this role. 

I obviously feel upset and angry at myself for my lack of movement in my career in these past 3 years. I'm also confused why my manager never mentioned this to me earlier. I haven't yet talked privately with my manager about this and I'm not sure I even should do it. What would be your advice for me?

I'm exhausting all resources and hassling the team a lot to help when they can. This work is being outlined to the top dogs in the business and I feel like I'm drowning under this project from lack of experience and knowledge. I've raised these concerns but nothing has changed and my boss' boss is beginning to turn against me where I'm struggling to get things over the line in time.

I've noticed a few issues with her work ethic but haven't said anything because it doesn't feel like I am in the position to. She comes in at least an hour late every day, one time she even came in at 1pm when work finishes at 4:30pm. She is constantly late to work events we have to assist with setting up. She needs constant reminders to get her tasks done and ignores the solutions I offer when she is struggling (she mentioned she works slowly because her email inbox is constantly full. I taught her how to create an archive which takes 3 minutes, and whenever she complains about her full inbox, suggest it to her but she never creates it. 

One time, she came in half an hour late to a meeting and hid in the bathroom the entire time on her phone because she was overwhelmed and scared of how my boss would react. 

Today, her supervisor came to me to talk about her performance and asked me for suggestions on how to help her improve. They are aware of the issue and are frustrated but aren't at the point of firing her yet.

 It seems like my coworker disassociates when she feels anxious about work and she hides in our break room or the bathroom for half an hour at a time. I honestly don't know what to do?

My wife doesn‚Äôt want me to leave my current job because of how good the benefits are but she‚Äôs also supportive of me no matter where I work. But she‚Äôs also told me to wait it out at my current company for another full time position. The problem is I‚Äôve been waiting for over a year now and nothing has panned out. Full time spots are competitive, rare and there are people who have way more tenure than I do and they always end up snagging those spots.

1ja5il9,Fair to ask pay hike after a career break?,"Background and Context:
I took a career break for approximately three months. I have been actively searching for a job for the past three months.
This equates to a total of six months of unemployment.
My total work experience spans approximately a decade.

Current Situation:
After submitting multiple job applications, participating in multiple interviews, and engaging in numerous opportunity discussions, I have finally been offered a job. But for this job I was interviewed by two people together, asked to submit an assignment and then asked to meet those two people in their office to present the assignment.

Concern:
I am being offered the same last salary compensation as six months ago. My request was for a minimal raise over my last pay, as I have come to understand that my compensation is competitive with industry benchmarks. Additionally, I acknowledge the career gap I have due to personal reasons.

Questions:
Is it  appropriate to request a monetary compensation increase from my last drawn salary after a six-month break? Should I accept the offer as it stands, based on my last pay?

1ja4mxd,How do I explain my employment status during a job interview?,"I am in a bit of a tricky situation right now with job interviewing/ hiring process. I‚Äôll start from the beginning.

My last day of work with the company I‚Äôve been with the past two years was 2 weeks ago. I put in my 2 week notice a month ago because the role was becoming too overwhelming. I had a mutual agreement with my boss that it was not a good fit for me. However, I ended on good terms with the company and they said they‚Äôd be happy as a reference. I actually did not even have a job lined up when I put my 2 weeks in, but I had several job interviews lined up. Of course this was not ideal, but this was the best decision for me regarding the circumstances going on. A couple days after I put my notice in, I got a job offer, but decided to go with another one. This company‚Äôs interview process lasted about a month, and I did not get the job offer until after my last day.

Here is the catch - I applied to a job in a different location that I was extremely interested in over a month ago, and I got an email back about a week later saying they regretted to inform me they already moved forward with another candidate, we all know how it goes. This is a place I‚Äôve always wanted to move to, and I had been applying to jobs here for so long that this was kind of the last straw for my out-of-state job applications. In the meantime, I‚Äôve been doing paperwork for my new employer since they can‚Äôt onboard me until a couple more weeks. So I guess I‚Äôm not really unemployed because I have a job lined up, but I‚Äôm also not working currently. 

Funny enough, the out of state job I applied for emailed me again last week saying that they would get a recruiter to reach out to me regarding the role. I was super confused since they said the role was filled, but I guess that fell through or something happened. The recruiter called me last week and we had a great conversation over the phone. They said they wanted to move me forward to the next step which would be an interview with the hiring manager. The only thing I am nervous about is that I talked about my previous role with the recruiter as if I still worked there, even though it had only been a couple days since my last day of work with the company. I don‚Äôt know why I did this, and I am sure the hiring manager thinks I still work at this company. My interview with them is tomorrow, and I want to be truthful about my current situation without it deterring them from wanting to hire me. Does anyone have any advice on how to do this or bring it up if asked about it? This is an actual dream role in a place I have always wanted to live, and I just hope I still have a chance regarding this limbo state I‚Äôm in.

I love all the people I've met so far. The benefits are great...the salary? Not so much. 47k (25, two years out of college and currently working in non-profit marketing/development).

1ja2wvz,Are there any kinds of tech jobs I'm not considering but may be a possible fit for (as someone with a CS/DS degree)?,"I've got a degree in comp sci with a concentration in data science (it was quite a heavy concentration and meant that most of my upper level coursed were DS related [math, stats, etc] and technical rather than CS related) and I've been out of work for 6 months since graduating. My GPA is terrible so I leave it off my resume, but the main issue is that with no experience, no listed GPA, and only a BS, I don't get looked at for any DS or ML/Applied Scientist roles. Never even hear back 90% of the time when I apply. I can't go to grad school due to the aforementioned terrible GPA, and that I don't know anybody who I can ask to write me a letter of rec. Anyway, I know I can just make fast food/retail my career but then my years of study for a degree would go to waste, so is there any types of roles this kind of degree qualifies me for?

I have taken quite a few courses in stats, math, and ML, and I did take DSA courses. The reason I haven't applied for SWE roles is that I don't know a thing about web dev or full stack, as my degree was more focused on math and stats than pure CS. I have studied programming languages concepts but I only learnt Python, Java, R, and SQL in school and I know nothing whatsoever about OS, not much about systems design. This gives me a unique combination of having taken a lot of hard coursework that hurt my brain, but also not having anything resembling an employable skillset anywhere. Just sort of fishing for if there's any chance whatsoever that there's some sort of field or area I'm unaware of that I could somehow find a job with. 

I know that to be a statistician you usually need grad school too, and that to be an actuary you need to pass exams which usually take like a year or two's worth of studying for (from my perspective it's the equivalent of going to grad school, except for that I can actually go this route though it'd mean spending 1-2 more years without a career. So many other kinds of careers I'd want to think about breaking into require more schooling or training before you can work in them (such as trades, for instance). I really love the idea of working with statistics and data for my career, but all those jobs seem to be impossible to get without a higher degree.",Wide_Yoghurt_8312,1,1.0,1,1741836404,2025-03-13 03:26:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ja2wvz/are_there_any_kinds_of_tech_jobs_im_not/,3,2025

1ja1geu,At a crossroads,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm in daily turmoil with how to approach my life. 
I‚Äôm 40 and a stripper (please no judgement)
I still look like I‚Äôm in my early 30s and I still make a lot of money at work but the late nights and physicality of my job is taking its toll and I know I have to quit probably in the next year. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do next. I haven‚Äôt always danced; I‚Äôve worked in office environments as an executive assistant, finance officer and in general admin. I‚Äôve tried property management, hospitality and other jobs that I‚Äôve never enjoyed (I always ended up going back to dancing as I get to choose when I work and also make over double sometimes 3 or 4 times what I‚Äôd make in a regular job, working half the hours)

I don‚Äôt enjoy being in an office all day. I‚Äôve done a beauty qualification but I‚Äôm going through a divorce and my ex made quite a bit of money so working and earning the little I would earn as a beautician wasn‚Äôt a problem, now with the cost of living (I live in Australia) I can‚Äôt really afford to earn basically minimum wage and live

I‚Äôm happy to retrain, I‚Äôm happy to study, I just genuinely do not know what to do. That being said, at 40 I don‚Äôt really want to do a 4 year degree and I want to study something that will land me a job once completed. 

I guess what I want is something where I‚Äôm not sat on my arse all day staring at a computer screen that pays enough to get by without struggling. I know I won‚Äôt match what I earn dancing but as long as I can afford mortgage payments, food and a semblance of a life I‚Äôd be happy

1j9zx5u,How to handle bad situation with coworker who treats me poorly?,"I (F30) have been dealing with a bad situation with a coworker, Al (M30), for about 6 months now and would like some advice. 

I started at our company about 2 years ago, and Al started 7 years ago out of college. I was promoted above him last summer, and became his boss. He did not take it well. Anytime I asked him to do something he would challenge me on it (‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you do it?‚Äù) and is just generally very argumentative with me anytime I ask a question. I genuinely did not feel like a was managing him, because he refused to allow me to manage him. I think part of the problem was that I was promoted over him, but the other part is (I suspect) that I am a woman (I am the only woman on my broader team of 20 people). 

In January, Al was transferred to a different manager but in an adjacent team. This was because of the issues we were having. While I no longer manage him, we still have to work together. It hasn‚Äôt gotten any better. He‚Äôs still super argumentative and difficult to work with him, to a point where I avoid him and it‚Äôs affecting my job. 

What really tipped me over the edge today is that I discovered he withheld a project document (containing information on something we were jointly working on) for over two months from me. Everyone else involved had access but he ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to share with me even when I asked multiple times if there was any documentation in the project. I have a very hard time believing it was an accident. 

I told Al‚Äôs new boss Chuck (M35) about this incident today and he said ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do about it? tell Al you felt like it was intentional? Do you really think that it will help? I know you guys don‚Äôt get along but I don‚Äôt want to be in the middle‚Äù. I was stung and felt like I was being gaslight by his emphasis on the word ‚Äòfelt‚Äô, so I said don‚Äôt bother.

I‚Äôm now looking for advice whether I bring this to my boss, who is also Chuck‚Äôs boss. I‚Äôve raised the issues I‚Äôve had with Al in the past to my boss, and he‚Äôs generally been supportive (he‚Äôs had many conversations with Al giving him direct feedback), but I feel a little disappointed that this is still ongoing. He‚Äôs told me before that me and Al ‚Äúboth need to figure out how to get along‚Äù because we‚Äôre both valuable to the team. I genuinely don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the problem - I‚Äôve never had an issue like this with another coworker, but Al is generally difficult to work with according to many people.  I don‚Äôt want to be perceived as just complaining endlessly, but Al is getting in the way of my job which I care about very much. I am the only woman in my group and so I don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm being dramatic. What should I do?

1j9zqp9,Corporate career options for a 28M with GCSEs and some corporate experience (UK),"Hey everyone! I hope I‚Äôm in the right thread. I‚Äôm posting on behalf of someone I met recently who seems really motivated but slightly disillusioned. At 28 he feels like he should be making more money but has been stuck around the ¬£25k ish mark at entry level roles (outside of London). I‚Äôm a corporate girl myself but I have a degree so my general advice to getting a job isn‚Äôt as suited I think as I realise I have a somewhat privileged position. 

He comes from a lower economic background and has faced multiple issues such as homelessness which have stopped him from getting qualifications past GCSE level. He started a Business Admin apprenticeship but left and has worked a variety of odd jobs both inside and outside of corporate. He currently works in accounts but believes this career  path is not future proof due to AI. 

I think right now he really wants to break the ¬£30k ceiling which he can probably do with an entry level role in London (he‚Äôs open to move) but what advice would you give him? 

Im thinking to recommend civil service roles at EO (¬£27k ish outside LDN and ¬£34ish K in London) level as they don‚Äôt usually require a degree, gain 1-2years experience and build up/job hop from there? What are some other career options. He‚Äôs open to sales/recruitment but he really is a numbers guy - any tips you guys can give with this admittedly limited context?

1j9zibd,Stuck with an increasingly useless PR degree and feeling unemployable - Is it a lost cause?,"I (24yrs) started college pre-COVID when job prospects were good. I held student marketing leadership roles, landed internships at high-profile PR agencies, and graduated with a high GPA. By commencement, though, the vibe had shifted (my university president‚Äôs speech even focused on promoting their new AI major instead of celebrating our achievements).

Over the past two years, I‚Äôve taken on ‚Äúthe bad jobs that get you to the good jobs.‚Äù I managed all marketing and communications for a local nonprofit that turned out to be a mess, and I also worked in small business retail, where I did my best to volunteer for extra responsibilities. I left the nonprofit due to unethical practices and was eventually let go from retail because business had dwindled, and they knew I was searching for jobs in my field.

Since then, I‚Äôve done coffee chats, LinkedIn outreach, resume reviews, joined local mentorship programs, and secured referrals, but local interviews have either not made it past the second round or the positions eliminated before I could even start. I was once set on digital marketing or communications, but now I‚Äôm also considering office admin, HR, or hospitality just to get my foot in the door.

I wake up anxious, and the constant setbacks are eating away at my self-confidence. I‚Äôm getting desperate and will likely end up working retail or food service, but I‚Äôm scared that as time passes, I‚Äôll become a less valuable candidate for jobs in my field.

Does anyone have any recommendations for career pivots, how to move forward, etc?

1j9ynrx,What should I do next after failing my PIP and being let go?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm currently going through a tough time and would love some guidance. I was recently placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) at work. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to meet the expectations, and my termination is set for this Friday, March 14th.

Here‚Äôs a bit more context about my background and the situation:

Originally, I was pursuing a career in law enforcement and physical security, but I decided to transition into IT during the COVID pandemic. I was able to finish school, earning a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Informatics with a concentration in cybersecurity. From there, I secured an internship that eventually led to a rotational role, which ultimately ended in my termination. This was my first corporate environment.

The transition from law enforcement to corporate work was difficult, especially in the IT field. I‚Äôm used to environments where there‚Äôs clear guidance, with someone telling me exactly what needs to be done by the end of the day and with well-defined timelines. But in my current job, I struggled to find any kind of liaison or support, which made it even more challenging. I‚Äôm still trying to understand how corporate IT environments work, especially the Agile and Spotify models, but it felt like there was no one to turn to when I needed help.

Honestly, it‚Äôs been a gut punch. I‚Äôve never been in an environment where I could literally cry out for help and yet no one would help you. It felt like they were just watching me struggle, and that was extremely discouraging. In my previous roles in law enforcement, everyone worked together and helped each other, no matter what the situation. That sense of teamwork was one of the things I loved about my previous career, and it‚Äôs been difficult to adapt to an environment where it felt like no one cared whether I succeeded or failed.

Here‚Äôs what I need advice on:
	1.	Should I file for unemployment benefits now, or should I focus on job hunting and studying for certifications first?
	2.	I have a background in cybersecurity and data analytics. Should I prioritize CompTIA Security+ because of my cybersecurity background, or should I focus on data analytics certifications first?
	3.	How do I explain this termination in interviews or on my resume? I want to frame it as a learning experience and show how I‚Äôve grown from it, but I don‚Äôt want it to negatively affect my chances of finding new work in the IT field.

I‚Äôm really committed to improving myself and pushing through this tough time, and I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or insight that you can share.

I‚Äôve tried going into sales but I‚Äôve found I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for me either.

My only other option is to go into the trades, I worked in a trade for a little bit as well as a prior job doing grunt work, but I ended up quitting one of the jobs yet I liked it and would be open to getting into it again.

My problem is at those past jobs, it was 2/3 years ago and the first one I got fired from it it was an hvac company that I did run around work for and some labor, they fired me because I kept failing at stuff and getting things wrong, got fired after 5 months. My last job in the trades I quit because of some other reasons and I also quit to pursue my business, I made a few mistakes there but I enjoyed it and I am kind of interested in it.

I had signed up for school for the trade and just as I was about to go a few months ago, they changed the location of the campus.

Anyway, all of this stuff has weighed on my confidence as I feel I will fail at everything or won‚Äôt have the motivation or smarts to good at it.

I am seeking advice mainly from tradespeople, what should I do and do you have any advice for someone who‚Äôs ego is broken and feels as if they will fail again if they start?

1j9xpfv,What are my options?,"Hi,

**Background**  
\- I'm currently in my first year of a high paying tech job and 1/4 of my equity vests on July 1  
\- I am very firm on leaving and starting my own thing, and all of my free time is preparing for this new thing. Work is draining my energy and it would be much more ideal to put in my notice now. I have been counting down and crossing off days until July 1 for a few weeks now, and it seems impossible for me to make it until then  
\- My equity that will vest on July 1 is in the 6 figures, with lots of upside, and I want this equity  
\- I get along very well with my team. My boss is amazing, the type of person that tells me not to work just to work, and to take off whenever and that they trust me. I truly believe she will want to help me as much as possible rather than going behind my back to HR in any way that would screw me over. My boss has made huge promises about our team, and me leaving would not look good. We're all personal friends at this point  
\- I am the sole contributor to a very large, 12 month project that I started 3 weeks ago. If I leave in July, I will be significantly hurting my team as it will ""screw them over"" and put them months behind schedule. There's always pressure on our small team to deliver, so this will just add pressure to my team  
\- My speciality is very niche and rare, and high paying, and industry specific. We have to recruit from a place in another country, and my whole team is from that same place (just 5 of us). I truly believe they regret hiring me, and would rather have someone from that company come and replace me. But we are all friends, and I think they are trying to help me and believe in me long term enough to not fire me  
\- I will be silent quitting until July 1, doing just enough to get by

**Options**

1. Stay until July 1, which will really hurt my team when I put in my notice. Every day is a struggle just to get to my computer
2. Tell my boss this isn't for me ASAP, and that I am going to work for myself rather than another company or competitor, and that I am telling her this right now because I don't want to screw the team over in July, and ask if there's anyway if I put my notice in now I can get my equity vested, otherwise I would intend to stay until July 1. I run the risk of shooting myself in the foot if they turn around and fire me
3. Tell my boss this isn't for me ASAP, and ask if I deliver the perfect replacement (the exact person that did what they are asking me to do), if I can get my equity vested and put in my 2 weeks notice

**Summary**  
I know some people will get annoyed for this post and I apologize, but it is truly a life changing decision and there are other factors regarding my family that would really benefit from putting in my notice now. Ultimately I'm not doing anyone any favors and would much rather leave on good terms without screwing these people over, but I've worked my butt off for this company and deserve that equity.

1j9whvb,how can i possibly choose my career?,"I'm 16 and completely stuck - starting sixth form in September and scared I'm going to make a huge mistake.
Obviously I know that really nothing matters too much when you're 16, things work out in the end, and it's not worth stressing, but I need advice! I've spoken to numerous careers advisors and teachers yet had no real help so far.
The thing is, I cannot make decisions for myself in this situation, and I get that I shouldn't have anybody else make an important choice for me, but I really really do need somebody to TELL me what to do, not just simple advice.
Usually, I'm good at making decisions, and quickly, but when it comes to my career I honestly just need to be told where i fit.
I'm doing very well all across my subjects; English, Maths, Bio, Chem, Physics, French, Spanish, German, and Art/ Photography. I'm currently achieving As or A* in all of these, so l fit for a wide range of subjects. I don't really have a passion for any of these subjects though, more of a natural talent that i've had throughout my entire education.
Naturally, I assumed that it would be a good idea to pursue a medical approach, but only due to the money involved.
However, now that I get closer to leaving secondary school, I'm starting to backtrack on my multi-year plan, and really feel a desire to do something that I enjoy. But my biggest fear is earning a low salary (due to growing up and currently living in a council estate, and having people my whole life not to throw away my potential).
Knowing that there's so many people out there who don't go to uni and are very successful in their lives and salaries, it makes me want to do the same. But what if it doesn't work out for me? What if i disappoint my family by not being the first in the whole family to go to Uni? What if i throw away all of my potential because I'm bored of school?
In all honesty, my dream is to travel, and have a family.
Honestly if i had to choose now, id be a SAHM, or an uber driver! But with my experience of a lower class upbringing, I have a huge desire to escape, and have that life that i always dreamed of.
And by not taking a chemistry A-level, I basically cut off my chances of pursuing med/dentistry. And realistically, i have the grades, but no extracurriculars and im not sure if id even be able to get IN to the med/dent uni in the first place (let alone try and afford it).
Along with this, in Uni i wouldnt be able to start my life and family until i'm about 25 (assuming that i find a high paying job straight away, which is highly unlikely).
So what on earth do i do?? I need the money, desperately. I dont know if ill be able to commit to Uni, or even barely commit to a-levels, but i can't throw away my talent and spend my life regretting it.
ps, currently thinking of taking psychology, bio, and chem a-levels. I definitely want to take psychology as i do think id really enjoy it, and probably bio as i may enjoy that too - but i think chem would drain me. maybe spanish would be good as i LOVE it at GCSE.
But not only career FIELDS can anybody give me actual career ROLES, with a salary of ideally at least 50k, ano without Uni if i can avoid it.

1j9vd60,Is lying about your GPA on job applications worth it overall?,"Hi I‚Äôm about to finish my degree in Data science with a minor in finance and I have a low cumulative GPA and around a 2.7 major GPA. Here‚Äôs my strategy for applying to jobs:


1. No minimum GPA listed = I don‚Äôt put GPA on my resume. 

 2.  Asks for a minimum GPA of >= 3.0 = I put a GPA of 3.2 since I feel like putting exactly 3.0 or 3.1 is suspicious. Many people suggest not to mention your GPA on your resume if it‚Äôs below a 3.5 but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs valid advice because ATS and recruiters will exclude applications that don‚Äôt have it when there‚Äôs a requirement. 

3. Asks for an unofficial or official transcript in any part of process = I don‚Äôt apply or I abandon application process because I‚Äôm not crazy enough to illegally forge documents. 

I keep having these worries like what  if I get hired and after hiring me they demand to see my transcript? Does that even happen? Anyone else have experience in lying about your GPA? Was it worth it overall? 

PS: None of my actions are Illegal so please don‚Äôt report this post for that.

1j9ug6d,Career Suggestions for a Lost High Schooler,"Hi, so I‚Äôm 17 and nearing the last few months of my junior year. This means I‚Äôm also getting closer to college but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to major in. I have a lot of interests and things I‚Äôd like to do but because of my depression impacting my grades I fear I don‚Äôt have the grades or the financial situation to do them. Here‚Äôs a list of paths I‚Äôm interested in and why, and if you can help suggest others or offer more information on these fields I‚Äôd really appreciate it. 
‚Ä¢ Astronomy / Planetary Geologist-
 (when I was a little I wanted to be an astronaut, now that I‚Äôm older I know I‚Äôm not smart enough or brave enough to be IN space, but I‚Äôd love to work with the history and anything else with space.
‚Ä¢ Historian / Archeologist / Anthropologist -
(Again I love history and I especially love relics of history and their meaning and significance the only issue with archeology is the pay is quite low and I‚Äôm not necessarily physically equipped for it ) 
‚Ä¢ Phlebotomist - I love blood lol 
‚Ä¢ Journalist - I love writing and research I think it‚Äôd be so cool to write on different topics and research them and have people read my work
‚Ä¢ Museum Curator / Conservator - I love art and any opportunity to work with art whether making it or showing others is a lovely opportunity. 

Unrealistic dreams : 
‚Ä¢ Voice actor - I love doing random voices and acting in general but voice acting has always been my dream. I love cartoons and animations and being able to give a character a voice is awesome. 
‚Ä¢ Producer / Production assistant - I love movies and I‚Äôm constantly dreaming of scripts and scene work and cinematography I wish I could work in film in any way but my family‚Äôs not supportive because money and failure 

Alternative because I‚Äôm alternative/ Goth ü¶á
‚Ä¢ Piercer - People can‚Äôt judge you for being goth with piercings if they‚Äôre getting a piercing right???
‚Ä¢ Hair colorist - Dyeing hair is a lot of fun also I think it‚Äôd be less dress coded since you know people come into hair salons to express themselves ???

1j9u1eg,When to negotiate my starting pay at a new job?,"I interviewed for a job as a sales associate. I make $20/hr where I am now, and this place said they typically start people at minimum wage plus uncapped commission (on several thousand dollar machines, so I'd actually be able to make up the difference in pay pretty easily if sales are consistent), but they'd be willing to discuss it. I said I needed time to think about if I'm still interested and talk with my husband since it's financially risky. 

After I sent an email with some follow up questions, they ended their reply with ""Please let us know if you have any other questions or feedback on your salary requirements."" 

Should I send an email explaining why I think I deserve more than minimum wage starting out, or should I just wait until they formally give me a job offer? They seem to be inviting that discussion but it feels weird to do that when I'm not even sure I'll get the job.

If you can help me steer my way into even a general career direction it‚Äôd be much appreciated. Please consider I‚Äôm from a lower middle class family and paying for college is already a major stressor in my parents mind for the bachelors -to masters.

1j9toua,Am I being auto-rejected for applying again too soon?,"Long story short- I work for a huge healthcare company in the Northeast. After 1.5 years in the same role, I realized that I do not enjoy where I am at and am ready for a change. I started applying for other internal positions in other locations/departments/sites. A few months ago I got an interview, and then I got the official job rejection about a month later. Ever since then, and even in the meantime as I was waiting for a response back, I put in a few applications for other internal positions, to keep my options open. However, I have been getting rejected from them pretty quickly. It almost feels like an auto-reject? These are positions that I know I  am qualified for and have the required experience. Do companies have policies for how often employees can interview for or apply for internal positions? Is it bad that I am putting in applications for internal positions often? Do companies have internal policies regarding the number of applications or positions an employee can apply for within a certain period? If so, why? I‚Äôm assuming this would be to give everyone a fair chance? Is this something I can talk to HR about? Because while I would love to stay with my current company, I know my worth and I know that I can get not only paid better, but treated better elsewhere. But if it‚Äôs going to become a waiting game to apply for and be considered for a job within a different department or location, where I can only apply and interview X amount of times every X months, then I would much rather dedicate my time and energy towards looking elsewhere. Any insight on this topic would be much appreciated.

3. Offloads parts of my role (the part I have less experience with) without informing me, only mentioning it in meetings. (This doesn't bother me because I'd love to focus on what I'm good at but its the not being given a heads up or having this discussed in my 1:1's) 

4. Assigns tasks but later changes plans without updating me.

Others also feel out of the loop because leadership makes decisions behind closed doors, forcing us to scramble at the last minute. And I don't think she thinks I'm bad at my job, I think she sees I have a lot on my plate and wants to offset it because she does trust me with a lot. BUT I feel that not having conversations with me about it is where I'm feeling left out of a conversation that ultimately impacts me and also leads her to just assume she needs to step in instead of understanding the why behind it. Is this normal boss behavior, especially her constant interference in my workflow? 

If I'm expecting too much, do you have any advice on how you managed this?  
  
If I'm not, do you have any advice on how to get her to realize that I'd like to be considered in conversations about my role before she just jumps and does it?

1j9pues,Which MiM programs would have the best ROI and impact on my career?,"I'm not sure if this is the right thread to post this on, but I wanted to get advice on which program to choose considering the impact it would have on my career.

26F applying to MiM programs in Europe.
I'm applying to/considering these universities:

IESE, ESADE, IE, ESSEC, ESCP, EDHEC, SDA Bocconi, NOVA SBE.

In case I get admitted to most or all of these, which ones would you recommend to attend which would have the best ROI and career prospects (considering IESE is a 1 year program and I could potentially get a 70%+ scholarship) if I want to work in Europe (countries like France, Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium or Spain) or the UAE?

PS: I have a bachelor in CS, 2.5 years of experience in Technical Support and UX/UI design, I speak French, English and Arabic and I'm interested in Management positions (PM or else) or Consulting (Management Consuting or IT Consulting) and I'm from a developing non-EU country.

PS 2: I'm applying to MiM instead of gaining more experience for an MBA because I can't afford an MBA and I think they're too expensive for what you get and from what I know, in Europe, both MiM and MBA are well respected if it's from a reputed university and offer similar career prospects (correct me if I'm wrong).

Do you think I should just pursue a Master's degree in CS or more work experience instead of an MiM to be able to become a PM or to shift to Consulting? (if so, what would be the career path you suggest for that?)",Ghosting01,1,1.0,0,1741801174,2025-03-12 17:39:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j9pues/which_mim_programs_would_have_the_best_roi_and/,3,2025
1j9pt1a,I don't think I enjoy my career at all.,"I, 24 F, am not even a full year out of college yet working as a civil engineer. I have a good job, with a good salary, with a good company, but I just can't see doing this for the rest of my life. I get up and go to work every day and sit in my cubical and stare at a computer. Some days I absolutely dread going to work, and then the day seems to last 50 hours. There are other days where the work is okay and I think that I could do this for the rest of my life, but also will never feel passionate about it. Also there is really no where for my career to go unless I choose to get my license, which I'm not sure that I really want to. I mean sure my career will advance and I will get a very big pay bump, but it will likely force me down the management route which I don't really want to do. The only other option I really see to do with my degree is to go and work out in the field which I absolutely do not want to do, ever. Not even for a summer like alot of people do in my company.

I honestly don't even know why I chose this career in the first place, or even my major in college. I just was always told growing up I would make a good engineer because I am good at math and problem solving. If you asked me what my passions are I wouldnt even know what to say. The only other time in my life anyone has every implied that I might be good at anything else was once in high school when my mom said that she could see me being a vet. This was because we had a severely injured dog that I had done a great job nursing back to health. Even the vet was impressed with how well I had bandaged his wounds and did not believe my dad when he said his 15 year old daughter was the one who was caring for him at home. The vet said that she wouldn't have though anyone other than a trained medical personal could have done such a great job, and that she truly believed that the only reason my dog had recovered from his injury as well as he did was because he was getting absolutely acceptional care at home.

Let me tell you if felt great hearing that somebody thought I would be good at something. Especially when it was someone who wasn't my parents, and a basic stranger at that. But honestly it was never a career that I ever considered. The biggest reason being because I am not a great reader and biology and the med field have alot of very big words and I always figured I would absolutely struggle through school and maybe not even make it through. Now I'm wondering if maybe I should have looked into it more. I mean I love dogs, and animals in general really. But it seems absolutely crazy to even think about a career change. It would mean going back to school and getting the needed prerequisite, and then 4 years of med school. It would mean taking out a ton of student loans. All for somthing that I'm still not sure I would actually be good at, or even like as a full time career.

I feel like it is all just such a big gamble and crazy and that i should just stay with the good job I have and continue with the life goals I currently have. I'm getting married in a few months. We are saving up to buy a house, and wanting to starting a family int the next few years. A career change would change all of those things. I just don't know what to do.",Ok-Advice-17,3,0.7099999785423279,29,1741801081,2025-03-12 17:38:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j9pt1a/i_dont_think_i_enjoy_my_career_at_all/,3,2025
1j9pmi4,Promotion to Deputy Manager but with Low Salary ‚Äì Should I Stay or Look for a New Job?,"Hi, I'm 27 years old and have a master's degree in Physical Education. I initially wanted to work in a school, but due to mistakes I made during my studies (working in jobs unrelated to my field), I didn't gain the necessary experience to break into that career. I sent my CV to almost every school in my city (there aren't many, as recruitment only happens during the summer), and I even tried to speak directly with school directors, but the secretaries wouldn't schedule interviews since I didn't have any recommendations.

After the pandemic, I moved away from my small town to find better job opportunities. I got interested in a position at a clothing store as a ""shift coordinator"" (which was just a fancy title). To clarify, the positions there were: sales associate, senior sales associate, shift coordinator, deputy manager, and manager. In short, I managed shifts with the sales team when there was no one above me.

I've been working there for 3.5 years, and the pay wasn‚Äôt great, but I didn‚Äôt want to stay in a low position because I believed I could eventually move to a better job. A few days ago, I got promoted to deputy manager (we hadn‚Äôt had a deputy manager for a year). However, when I saw the new salary, I was really disappointed. Two years ago, the pay difference between my position as a shift coordinator and a sales associate was almost the same as the difference between my current salary as a deputy manager and a sales associate. I received the lowest possible salary for this position, and the promotion was mainly because the store needed someone to fill the role.

My manager recently wrote something on our group chat saying I didn‚Äôt perform well, which is affecting the way new employees view me.

*To summarize: Should I continue working as a deputy manager with this low salary to gain more experience and possibly move to a better job later, or should I start looking for another opportunity now? Long-term, I don‚Äôt want to stay in this position, as I‚Äôm more interested in a role related to fitness or a sports facility.*",Astonek33,1,1.0,1,1741800645,2025-03-12 17:30:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j9pmi4/promotion_to_deputy_manager_but_with_low_salary/,3,2025

1j9p3ad,Career Burnout,"In my mid twenties I craved a career, one that would be fulfilling, mentally and financially. Once I had my sight set on something I felt drawn to I followed my gut and started the education path towards that career. I thrived in college because of the guilt I had carried around from wasting my time during high school. After college i obtained a full time job in the field of my degree. At first, it was fulfilling because it was new and exciting but over time the newness wore off and I became annoyed with the job because 80% of what I had learned in college was a waste. With today‚Äôs technology and machine automation it has removed the mental stimulation and has turned my job into simple muscle memory. Since I had accepted this to be my career choice I furthered my education because it was a new goal I could set for myself that would financially pay off. After switching shifts and getting a raise from furthering my education I figured it would make me happier but quiet the opposite happened.

The thing I‚Äôve always prided myself on is how much of a hard worker I am. I‚Äôve always prioritized my job no matter how little I was paid for giving my absolute best. After the stress from college was removed and I had free time,  I started focusing on trying to find hobbies that could make me feel fulfilled since work no longer provided that.

Painting has always come pretty natural to me. I would say my work is decent and my close friends and family have always complimented my work. Over the past few months I‚Äôve been practicing and improving my skills. I have actually completed several pieces to completion which is very rare for me because I typically get discouraged or distracted. The main thing I have noticed is how much fun I have while painting, how rewarding it is to see the transformation I create on a blank canvas, and how much it affects me on the days I don‚Äôt get paint because I have to go to work.

I have agreed to take on a leadership role at work because I figured maybe more responsibility and a change of my typical work tasks might spark some sort of motivation and liking for my job.

But I have to wonder because I know some artists make their hobby a career. Am I possibly taking an opportunity from someone who actually enjoys their career? Am I trying too hard at something that just isn‚Äôt meant for me? Should I try embracing the artist in me??",starliight4ever,2,1.0,2,1741799355,2025-03-12 17:09:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j9p3ad/career_burnout/,3,2025

I‚Äôm pretty well rounded and haven‚Äôt settled on a niche, but given my degree and background have been in the biotech space for the last few years. I started my current job back in September and was originally hired as a marketing assistant with the following job description: 

‚Ä¢ Adapt and manage large Excel worksheets for marketing expansion.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ 
‚Ä¢ Plan, create, and present proposals to expand our market reach.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ 
‚Ä¢ Assist in editing Marketing and Sales materials.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ 
‚Ä¢ Support monthly resource reporting.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ 
‚Ä¢ Assist in Trade Show presentations, planning, and collateral.   
‚Ä¢ Website design and integration in e-commerce and outward communication. 
‚Ä¢ Organize and attend project meetings, assist in creating meeting agendas, notes, and follow-up action items.‚ÄØ 
‚Ä¢ Contribute to project planning and scheduling activities
 
Upon joining, I quickly tackled these tasks and have been taking on much more responsibility like:

- Overhauling our company and product messaging to be better fit for our target market
- Analyzing and creating a quarterly metrics report 
- Managing our social media and email content calendar
- Writing and generating all content for email blasts 
- Coordinating a new website design and providing all original copy
- Creating a company wide style guide for both scientific and company purposes 
- Developed a marketing plan for post-website (SEO strategy, email automation, targeted messaging, etc)

My manager (exec level), has a background in sales but self reported, not a lot of experience in marketing. We have a very small team- 16 total at the company with myself and an intern in the marketing dept. In one of our meetings I asked about the promotion structure and how I‚Äôm not feeling like my title and pay isn‚Äôt representative of my tasks, and not outright for a raise, but his opinions on it all. He agreed they got more from me than initially thought, but around a year mark would be more appropriate for a promotion.

I don‚Äôt disagree, that in a typical setting a year makes sense, but my responsibilities are wildly different than what I initially signed on for and negotiated my salary for. I need advice on if I should make a better argument for myself or really just wait it out. 

Edit: I also forgot to mention someone in the company responsible for protocols, SOPs, and other scientific content was let go today and we‚Äôre meeting later this week to discuss how the marketing team is going to fill in for this work.

1j9koty,Should I take the role with more responsibility (CEO) or stay where I am (Administration)?,"# Should I take the role with more responsibility or stay where I am?

**Edit to add**: My salary would increase by about 50% to start which would be life changing for me and my family. Though it wouldn't come with added responsibility of meetings outside of normal work hours, a lot of public speaking events/presentations.

I would be able to join some boards within my community which I would enjoy.

As a woman in leadership in my small community, I could have an impact on other women which is another thing I would enjoy.

I will try to keep this as short as possible -

I work for a PBC in a small county, about 50k residents. I was approached by the current CEO a couple of weeks ago asking if I would be interested in taking his position when he retires. I don't know when that would be, but he I assume in the next 2ish years or so.

I don't know how much it matters but I am in my late 30's I have a 10 year old. The reason I mention this is because I value my time with my child, though they are starting to want to spend more time doing things outside of hanging out with me.

I am looking for advice because the current CEO is hard to work with. They are very unpredictable which makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes they are in a great mood and I am greeting with a ""good morning!"" and sometimes they are miserable and make everyone else in the office pay for it. They are constantly sitting at their desk, calling one of the 3 of us that work in the office on the phone and asking us to get up and go into their office to talk about something rather than getting up or simply discussing over the phone. They can't create their own presentations or even click through their presentation during meetings, they always ask someone else to do it. I could go on and on and on about the terrible things they do and how terrible it would be to work along side them for an undetermined amount of time.

On the other side, they do have a bit of knowledge that I could learn from and have been successful in their role over the past 10 years.

I am worried that I could not handle working even closer with them over the next couple of years while they ""teach"" me their ways. I use """" because I don't think it will be so much learning as it will be barking orders and doing grunt work they don't want to do rather than the mentor/mentee relationship I would prefer...

And I am also worried that if I were able to make it through that, would I be able to be as energized as they are in the role or would I constantly be compared to what they did during their time.

Are these normal worries? Should I suck it up now and go for it, or say no and stay where I am?",FearlessCricket3093,3,1.0,10,1741787893,2025-03-12 13:58:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j9koty/should_i_take_the_role_with_more_responsibility/,3,2025
1j9kn5j,Does a former hybrid role look bad for a potential hire? See below please,"
When I finished my MBA (right after undergrad), a couple of years back.. I only had a finance internship under my belt. I had an offer from a medium to large size hospital system for a role that was a mixup of both HR & accounting. 

It‚Äôs been a little over two years of doing this role, so I‚Äôm thinking of where to go next. Not sure if I will move in this current economy. But anyway, my question is, will this be seen favorably or unfavorably by the next role I apply for? 

Not sure if I‚Äôll focus more on accounting jobs or HR next, or really what would be best to look at. 

My idea had been.. I‚Äôll jump in and learn HR and get some accounting experience for a few years, all in one role, then I can decide to focus more on one or the other when I outgrow this role.

I am unhappy and always fatigued. And I'm having sleep and stomach issues lately. My day looks like this:

- wake at 2:50 am (Monday - Friday)
- drive to work at 3:30 am
- walk into work, use bathroom, and start my shift around 4 am
- Sit down for two hours at the telepromtper 
- Work cameras for an hour, and repeat for two more hours
- 9 am, my boss arrives lol

I have a VERY hard time getting up to go to work lately. I have called out 5 days this year already, a couple of times for imterviews with other employers. My boss hasn't spoken directly to me in months, but will come into my work area and complain about his home lifewith others.
The two people I liked at work and who made the environment positive left over 6 months ago. After that, things went downhill. 

And one other thing: One of my superiors just doesn't talk to me at all anymore. This ""superior"" has always picked on people and has joked around a lot with me in the oast about other people. Now I guess he's decided he doesn't like me. Lesson learned.

1j9fpw0,"New job, not enjoying it and need advice?","I was with my previous employer for 11 years and l really enjoyed my time working there with a great group of people. I was a senior member of the team and well respected. I was approached by a recruiter for a role which was more senior, more money and fully remote. Jobs like that are hard to come by where I live so I took the opportunity while I had the chance. At that time my previous employer was also going through changes and laying off staff so that was a concern.

3 months in and I do not like my new job. The people and the culture is not like my previous place. There is more micromanagement, lots of meetings and constant shifting of priorities. I feel their goal is to burn us out and squeeze every last penny out of us. I'm mentally exhausted already and I'm a zombie with my wife and kids outside of work. I know this is all new to me and maybe I just need time to learn and adjust, but I have a gut feeling that I will still feel the same in 6 months time. My new manager is somewhat supportive but I don't think things would change if I spoke to him as his boss is driving this culture. It's coming top down.

My previous place has still has not filled my old job and I'm tempted to reach out to ask if a return is possible before they fill it, even though that would be embarrassing. My old manager told me to reach out to him if the new job does not work out. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or if I just need to suck it up for a while in my current role. My previous place has made more people redundant but my old team have been safe so far. I could be jumping from one fire to another, but at least I would be working with people I like, assuming they would take me back. I'm worried if I still feel this way in 6 months and my old job is filled, then I'm stuck trying to find a new job in a rough market.

1j9fkyi,What's my job title? Website Product Manager or Head of Creative Content?,"Hi there! I'm having trouble nailing down what my actual job title is at work. I'm currently working at an e-commerce start up as the Head of Creative Content, which was a title given to me a couple of years ago before my role expanded. My boss has acknowledged that my role has expanded and was wondering what kind of role I'd like to move into next (he's planning to sell the company; I'll get a payout from it but I also need to plan ahead). 

I feel like my job is a bit of a mishmash of things and I'd like to know what exactly it would be classified as so I could steer myself into a similar role in the future and moving up from there. 

Back when I got as given the role of Head of Creative Content, most of what I did was managing our freelance content writers and graphic designers to keep our site updated, while implementing SEO strategies from our consultant. 

Nowadays, I still do all of that but I now manage more on-page elements. Like, oversaw the introduction of a recommendations engine, enhanced search/filters and new modules to improve the value of the written content on our site. I'm currently working with our Marketing Director to roll out our new website design. So, I work with developers now too to bring these things into fruition.

I also review project proposals that affect the front-end of the website because I know how it all works and can look out for issues or conflicts. So it feels like everything that goes on the front end is under my purview.

Do you think that still makes me Head of Creative Content, or is that something entirely different? If I were to move on from here into a new role, I'd like for it to be something like it. Or would I have to decide between managing content vs being like, a website product manager?

1j9ckgx,$110K Job Versus $140K Job,"Will try to sum everything up as best I can. I'm leaving the company that I've been with for the last 10 years (my whole career). I enjoyed the different roles I had within the company over the years but always felt like I didn't really care much about the work and felt bored often. Just got two job offers and can't decide between the two because of money and what the jobs entail.

Company A is in the entertainment industry and the work seems fun with lots of exciting travel opportunities. They offered me $100k but I was able to talk them up to 110k, which is about what I was making at my last role. The people seem really cool here and the work finally seems like something I might actually care about. 

Company B is in the medical field and seems to be closer to the kind of work I used to do, however they're offering $140k base with a potential $15k bonus bringing it to $155k. The person who would be my manager seems very nice but also very uptight and I can't tell if he would be overbearing or a micromanager.

My fiance and I are early 30s and are about to get married. The extra money would be nice in general but we have gotten by fine on what we were both making before. 

The main question here is if it's worth it to leave $30k (potentially $45k) on the table to finally be interested in and feel engaged with my work or just go for the money?

Commute for Company A is slightly better but both are not bad at all. Company B is definitely a bigger company but I've worked for a huge company my whole career and don't really have a preference on that. Company A definitely has way more perks in the way of events that you can go to and bring friends and family.

I need to create a dashboard, including creating and vetting 40+ reports as well as teaching my coworker how to create reports in our system since I am the only one who knows how to right now (I self-taught myself) - having no experience I am teaching them as much as I know with this time crunch. This ask in the past has been considered ‚Äúextra‚Äù/when I have worked on projects like this before, I did so in my own time outside of work hours. To add, I do not have full access to our system to do these things - the only reason I know how to do them is because I was curious enough to learn enough with the access that I do have in my own time.

We hired an outside consultant who agreed the ask/timeline was unreasonable given my lack of access/resources, however, when I mentioned this to my boss, and also mentioned how much stress/time this is taking, she is still keeping the timeline.

Curious what I should do when the job market sucks, as I can no longer sleep and work 80+ hours per week (currently pulling an all nighter to get things done)/I never am able to take lunch breaks, etc. 

I love what I do - though this workload is not equal to my pay (I am in an entry level role, asked to complete and lead Director-level projects). Love the experience/being able to learn, and partially feel like I need to keep up to ensure I don‚Äôt get laid off in an upcoming restructure.

1j9bxna,My new manager wants me at my desk at all times?,"The previous manager was lax. He allowed us to work hybrid, where we could WFH 1-3 days out of the week. Heck, sometimes we'd WFH for weeks! Those days were at our discretion, so seldom did I see my coworkers in-person. When I was in, they weren't, and vice versa. Honestly, I quite enjoyed it. The days I did go in, the office was always quiet. About 2 months ago, our team got a new manager. The first decree‚Äînow it's only in-office. No more WFH. Bummer.

I am sandwiched between a colleague who I think has ADHS because he cannot sit still to save his life. He's always sliding back and forth or twirling in his chair, he rummages through his desk like a squirrel hunting for acorn, and he talks quite loud in virtual meetings. The other colleague is a chatterbox. He'll talk my ear off, even when I have headphones on. They are both great people. I simply cannot work efficiently with such distractions. So, I started sitting at the single private nooks scattered around the office space. After a couple weeks, the new manager informed me during the 1-on-1 that I must sit at my desk while at the office. Those nooks are available for everyone to use, yes. But, for *team morale* and *availability* I need to be at my desk. But while I'm at my desk, my efficiency drops. I mentioned this to the new manager, and he shrugged it off and said that's not a thing. I've also tried explaining delicately to my two colleagues that they're distracting.

What can I do?

1j9bbes,Would you take an in office job to grow your career?,"I work in IT and after 2 years, I‚Äôve grown a lot! Currently doing a swing shift and working from home for a hospital. It allows me to stay with my daughter during the day and work in the afternoon/ evenings. We only have to pay $400 for childcare a month right now because we are blessed to have family help most days. 

I recently have been offered a position to go back into an office and work a 8-5 shift. This would be a lateral transfer, and after taxes I would be taking home an extra $300 per month. This new job is with an MSP who says that I will learn even more.  

If I make the switch, we‚Äôd have to pay a minimum of $1,800/month for child care, plus $200 for commuting costs and other work-related expenses. That means I‚Äôd actually be losing around $1,700 per month just to take this job.

The only upside is that I‚Äôd learn more and potentially grow into a higher-paying role, but there are no guarantees. Would you make this move, or should I hold out for a better opportunity? Anyone been in a similar situation?

1j99rlj,Job treats me like child instead of professional,"Hello,

I work in the Tour Maritime industry, in short, I work on a touring pleasure craft. I won‚Äôt get specific about anything, I know some of my colleagues use Reddit a lot.
I turn 20 soon and have been working on boats full time since I got out of high school. I take my job seriously, I follow orders, I do what is asked and needed of me without question all the time. At my first job as a Deckhand I was regarded as one of the better employees, many captains wished to have me on their crew on busy days or days where we were doing drills for the coast guard and company executives. 
I left for another company after my first company treated me like a child, shrugging off my needs, telling me lies about promotions in order to keep me content.
I joined a different tour boat company which I currently work for hoping my high praise from captains would be enough to be treated like a professional. However now I see that I‚Äôm once again being treated like some child they have to babysit.
I understand that my age in this industry is a bit of an outlier, trusting a 19 year old around million dollars vessels is probably something managers are a bit weirded out by. But I‚Äôve proven myself time and time again that I do what is needed of me. Captains here speak highly of me and trust me with the vessel even though I‚Äôm fairly new here. I‚Äôm not looking for a promotion or even praise, I simply wish to be treated like the professional of 2 years that I am. 
I often get sent to do small unimportant tasks while the rest of my crew carries out important tasks. I get talked down to like I‚Äôm stupid, concerns I have are often ignored until brought up by someone else.

1j98the,Dealing with an unreasonable workaholic senior colleague,"I started a new job at a senior level about 4 months ago. I really like everything about it...except the lead on my main client account who is an out-of-control workaholic. I mean, texts me every Saturday and Sunday about work, even when she's supposed to be on vacation, and wants me to respond to her at any time of the day or night. She loses her mind if it takes more than an hour or two to respond to a client email, despite the fact that we all work on multiple accounts. She has very specific ideas about what work should be done and how, but instead of communicating her expectations, she waits to see if you'll read her mind, and if I don't, she lashes out and cc's my boss and the CEO on communications about my ""failures."" 

Most recently, she got mad that I wasn't responding to her fast enough when I was in a hair appointment for two hours in the evening (theoretically my personal time, but she obviously doesn't believe in personal time) and emailed my boss and the CEO about it. My boss knows she's unreasonable, but can't seem to do anything about it, since she technically outranks him.

My question is: How do I cope? This role is a big step up for me in seniority and generally pays well (though not as well as some other agencies pay at this level) but this coworker is singlehandedly ruining my quality of life.

1j98ovu,How do you know when it's truly time for a career change?,"I've been a software engineer for 7 years and...I think it's not for me anymore. I've enjoyed some of my jobs in the past but there always comes a time when it's the most monotonous thing on earth. I always get to the point where I'm existentially bored to such a degree that I have a hard time even doing my job. The boredom is at every level of my job from the pointless meetings to even the technical stuff that I used to enjoy. Days crawl by at a snail's pace. I spend hours daydreaming about doing something else. It's becoming a huge problem for me as I can't focus on anything. I feel like I'm rotting away. This isn't sustainable for me any longer. 

And it's not like I don't have anything to do. There's plenty on my plate but I'm bored to the point that I just can't do it in a timely manner. The problem domain bores me. The tech stack bores me. The tasks bore me. The coworkers bore me. I can predict the phrases people will say in meetings because it's always the same meaningless dribble. The current position I'm in has cranked all these feelings to 100 and I genuinely feel like I can't do this for the rest of my life. I'm spending many hours of every day trying to figure out what the fuck I should do about this.  
  
Sure,  I'm well compensated but what does it matter when I feel like this for the majority of my waking hours? People point to the money and say ""get over it"" but I've genuinely been happier earlier in my life with far less. I'm treated well at my job. The benefits are good. The WLB should be great but it's not because of my personal issues. All in all I believe the problem is something with me. Part of me thinks I lack perspective and need to put myself into a shit situation to appreciate what I have. 

I'm not sure that the same job at a different company is going to cure this. I really need advice.

To go into a little more detail, I did a BTS focused on customer relations and basically I am very shy and withdrawn. I thought that by doing this BTS it would help me to open up about myself, especially since I did it on a work-study basis as a customer manager. But I still have difficulties with it basically and I think that's why I have difficulty finding work even after my BTS, whether for another work-study program or a temporary or permanent position.

And recently I've been thinking about completely reorienting myself and starting from scratch. Every time I look at the ads I find that the most interesting positions are in the field of finance or management, and I regret not having done that before. This is why I am thinking of doing a DCG (diploma in management accounting). Afterwards, I have always had mediocre grades in science subjects since high school and I am afraid of not progressing in this field... And yet I would love to enter this sector because it opens up so many interesting opportunities. But this will also mean that I will have lost 3 years of higher education, so I am very mixed, and I am afraid of not succeeding. 

And so I'm stuck between continuing my studies in line with my BTS, that is to say still in customer relations (my biggest anxiety), or starting from scratch and doing the DCG but I'm afraid that the level will be too hard and that I'll lose more time.

1j94a1q,Feeling burnt out,"At the beginning of the year I was pulled onto a massive project that I had no prior involvement in, given little to no guidance and told to get on with a time critical task. The project had been ongoing for a year at that point so there was a LOT to catch up on. The reason given was that the person who was supposed to do it was off sick. They came back the next day but the task remained with me. I pointed this out but it was decided it should stay with me and that the other person would focus on another element of the project. 

At the same time, I took over the responsibilities of a colleague who was going on maternity leave. She was supposed to be assigned on a project 50% of the time but as she had no other work so realistically was working on it 100%. There wasn't a lot to do here to start with but I have a minimum of 4 meetings per week on this project and the workload is starting to creep up. 

I also have other projects of my own that I have been told would be covered by others but as I am the SME, I am having to answer questions. I will have to pick up a bigger element of this work next week so I have been trying to prepare for this. 

And then we have a new colleague who has been assigned some small tasks and ive been assigned as the person to take them through the process and teach them how to use the systems to complete those tasks. 

I am being pulled in four different directions. And with the first two projects, pulled in 2 different directions on each of those. So that makes... 6 different directions! I get out of one meeting, start a piece of work and need to jump into another meeting. I can't keep up with the pace and I'm starting to crumble. 

My manager is on long term sick so I am dealing with her manager. There are no one to ones so any complaints need to be raised in a group setting or I need to book a specific meeting to explain my concerns. I have tried to do this in the past but when I speak to her, she somehow spins things in a way to make it seem like I don't have as much to do as I do. I take so much pride in my work and have never had negative feedback but I can feel things slipping through the cracks because I don't have time to think. 

Literally all of my colleagues are complaining about their workload with some of them working well beyond their hours and have been doing so for many months. A part of me feels ashamed that I am feeling so overwhelmed when others have been in this position for longer than me. 

To top it off, I am studying part time and coming to the end of my programme. I need to write my dissertation but by the end of the day, I am so overwhelmed, all I want to do is zone out and stop thinking. I have been so stressed out lately, I have been picking up old anxious habits like picking at my skin and pulling my hair. People message me and ask me if I'm OK because I look stressed. I feel like a failure. 

I've been applying for other jobs but that feels like a job in itself. I am at my wits end. What do I do?

1j942ke,Am I overestimating my value proposition?,"Hello! 

I am interviewing for a Strategic Sourcing Analyst role at a former client of mine from 4 years ago.  I was reached out to directly about the role by the Vice President of Operations.  The role is currently listed at $85k but I am currently making $113k, which I made clear to the VP who reached out.

Having previously worked with this company and having 15 years experience in my niche, I'd like to think I'm uniquely qualified for this role.  Do you think that asking for $118k would be reasonable given the below criteria? 

-Established relationships with internal stakeholders.

-Existing relationships with companies roster of 10+ manufacturing, warehousing and transportation suppliers.   

-Intimate knowledge of companies products.  I wrote the specification library for over 100 SKUs, and BOMs for their kits.

-Track record of saving this company hundreds of thousands of dollars annually and reducing lead times by finding efficiencies in manufacturing process and value engineering product specifications.

I can't mention this in the interview, but I am also aware of the margins (30%+) that I applied to their products while working at my previous company sourcing these products for them, so I know I can add value right out of the gate.  Total annual value is $20MM annually.

Am I overestimating my value and does it justify asking so high over the posted salary?  Appreciate everyone's professional input!",MilkSlap,1,1.0,3,1741733394,2025-03-11 22:49:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j942ke/am_i_overestimating_my_value_proposition/,3,2025
1j93u4g,2 Job Offers ‚Äì Should I Negotiate for More?,"To provide some context, I was part of a surplus at my previous company and am still considered an internal hire. Before leaving the payroll, I applied for one internal role and another position at a different company.

I didn‚Äôt get the internal role I applied for, but they‚Äôve now opened another position that they‚Äôd like to offer me. I haven‚Äôt received an official offer yet, but conservatively, I expect they‚Äôll increase my previous salary by 5%, with 10% being the maximum.

The other company I applied to has extended me an offer today, which I‚Äôm excited about. However, I‚Äôve asked for a few days to consider the offer.

If I accept the external offer, I‚Äôm eligible to collect severance from my previous employer, but if I stay, I would lose that benefit.

I feel fortunate to be in this position given the current market conditions, which is making me hesitant to negotiate. However, I‚Äôm wondering if I should consider negotiating the offers, and if so, how should I go about it?

1j93fgl,Stuck at a Dead-End Job After 2 Months‚ÄîNew Offer with a Catch. What Would You Do?,"Hey Reddit, I need some career advice‚ÄîI‚Äôm at a crossroads and could use your take. I‚Äôm a female working as an engineering tech at an underground mine, two months into the job, and I‚Äôm already over it. They lured me in with promises of using my drafting skills, but instead, I‚Äôm stuck installing ground monitoring instruments and rock bolts all day. It‚Äôs brutal on my body, and I feel totally undervalued. Pay‚Äôs decent at $83K/year, but I had to relocate 600 km from my fianc√©‚Äôs family for this, and now they want $5K back for that move if I leave early.

I have discussed with my supervisor about growth plans and he seemed to be insulted by the fact I want to grow in my own role?! Says I‚Äôm going to quick, but only plans on making me do the assistant job as my others skills rot away.
Here‚Äôs the twist: I just landed a new offer as a mine technologist in ventilation‚Äî$88K base, 10% isolation bonus, 9% vacation pay (works out to ~$104K/year), plus a $15K relocation bonus. It‚Äôs fly-in, fly-out (FIFO), uses my drafting and planning skills, and gets me out of Ontario, which I‚Äôve been dying to do. The catch? I have to relocate to St. John‚Äôs, Newfoundland, within 12 months, and my fianc√© isn‚Äôt keen on moving 2,500 km east. His job‚Äôs just a service writer gig‚Äînothing big‚Äîbut he‚Äôs comfy where we are.

The $15K relocation for the new job will not cover the   5K I owe my current job (they‚Äôll prorate my 3 weeks vacation to ~$738 on exit, not enough to offset it), plus movers and rent. New job‚Äôs a career upgrade, but I‚Äôm torn‚Äîdo I push for the move and risk tension with my fianc√©, or stay put in a role I hate? He‚Äôs already 600 km from his family, so I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll warm up to St. John‚Äôs, but 12 months feels like a ticking clock.

What would you do? Jump now and use the $15K to smooth it over, tough it out longer to avoid the $5K hit, or something else?

1j937ax,Need advice- relocating and stuck between old job field and new possible job field,"I (25F) have recently relocated to where my husband (28) and I want to move and hopefully settle down. I'm in school for library science, and I recently worked as a library tech. Before that, I worked in childcare for years (This is important later.)

I got a few interviews with jobs here that seemed promising, but not really what I want to do. I got a job offer which I readily accepted. It's in my old childcare field, which is alright but not preferred. Since then, the admin process has been frustrating and no one can help me get set up. I've had to repeatedly ask where to start trainings, only to be directed to other people or have them cc'd in emails that are never answered. Its been like this for almost two weeks while trying to move and get set up in a new state. I recently checked the reviews in the past 4 months for this company and they are all TERRIBLE, mostly about admin/training.

I ended up getting an apartment set up for when my husband arrives, and I'm having major second guesses and guilt about not wanting to continue with this job. I got two job interviews in library science, which I think I have a good chance at. Both seem eager to interview/have me work for them and I'd much rather work there than this company.

  
I'm just feeling a lot of guilt for wanting to abandon ship on this company that seems completely lost most of the time. Especially after I've gone through all the work to relocate here for these job prospects.

1j92kr8,1 rescinded offer <2 months ago; 2 offers at hand this week,"Mid Jan, I received an offer from Company A and was about to sign the contract - only I reviewed the contract and had some questions about the benefits but told them I was excited to join the company. After 1 month of waiting to hear from them, they decided to rescind the offer (for some reason that I won‚Äôt disclose as this is no longer relevant with this post)

So currently, i‚Äôve got 2 offers: 

Company B - contract to be sent this Friday, once signed they‚Äôll start with the employment checks; target start date end of March

Company C - employment checks first, once checks are cleared, they‚Äôll then send the contract; target start date end of April. Better offer than Company B.

Left my previous job end of December without too much in my pocket. I would say I‚Äôm good good in managing my expenses the past > 2 months that‚Äôs why i survive. 

So my dilemma (as a someone having no source of income for a couple of months now) is that I am planning to say yes/sign for both Company B and C. With the trauma I had with Company A and the fact that Company C isn‚Äôt sure yet as well (finding it weird why checks would happen first before contract signing), I want to grab the opportunity to make money asap. If I got cleared for Company C, then I will have to leave Company B and would end up working there only for a month.

Note: this is my first official job. This month my manager and I got on our usual call to check numbers and discuss how I'm doing etc. We recently had an office meet for 2 weeks where we worked from the office. During that time our team analyst asked me regarding the goals as well as my manager I told them I don't remember the exact numbers and they said okay. Today on the meeting the manager bought it up and started questioning me on the goals set under different categories and I answered them incorrectly. But she put me on the spot and called me a red flag for not learning the metrics to meet for good performance. I do not perform badly and keep my metrics in check and meet them monthly I don't understand why I have to by heart them. She says I don't have a goal I just login and work and check if I'm coded red(if I didn't meet the metrics) this took me off guard and I felt hurt by her accusatory tone, as if I'm not hardworking. Please advise me on how to handle this I'm going to try memorizing or keeping sticky notes. I'm gonna leave this job in a few months to pursue my masters but for the time being I'm here I want to handle it properly.

1j91fpm,Cant figure out what to do with my lfie,"I‚Äôd like to share some background about myself (25M) and what I‚Äôve been experiencing recently. I‚Äôm a software developer at a mid-sized company with about 4 years of experience. I am earning above average for indian standards and I‚Äôve been living comfortably since I graduated. I got a decent opportunity right out of college and started my career in a good position. However, for a while now, I‚Äôve been feeling dissatisfied. Last year, I decided to switch companies to find new challenges and fresh experiences. I joined my current company around 7 months ago, but since then, I‚Äôve been feeling more disconnected from the work I do. Everything is new, but I lack the motivation to engage with it.

I find myself working solely for my reputation and out of fear of being laid off before my stock vests. I‚Äôve become so distant with the idea of work that I‚Äôm struggling to even get tasks done. Despite my job demanding a lot of work every day, I‚Äôve done very little over the past month. I see my colleagues and friends, who are putting in a lot of effort to grow in their careers, but it‚Äôs just not working for me. I don‚Äôt feel interested in the work anymore, and I‚Äôve lost the motivation to wake up and face the day.

Outside of work, I have a few friends, and most of my time goes into hanging out with them. On weekends, I spend time smoking up and relaxing, and this has become a pattern that creeps into my weekdays as well, after work. I also have a LDR with my girlfriend, but we can barely talk due to the significant time zone difference. I‚Äôve developed a lazy routine‚Äîworking 5 days a week, smoking up after work, and mostly chilling. I don‚Äôt work out, though I occasionally go out to play. Most of the time, I stay at home doing nothing productive. So basically I have got no hobbies, nothing that I am good at, and honestly no goals.

Lately, I‚Äôve started to feel empty. I feel like I‚Äôm running away from every responsibility‚Äîbe it work, upskilling, or even taking care of my health. While I‚Äôve always been fascinated by software and technology, and that‚Äôs why I chose CS as my major in college, the reality of my current work life feels empty and unsatisfying. I‚Äôve never worked on a product where I could see direct user impact, and I‚Äôve never solved challenging technical problems that make me feel like I‚Äôm achieving something meaningful. It‚Äôs hard to stay engaged when I feel like the work I do doesn‚Äôt make a difference and tbh I have realized it does not make a difference.  I‚Äôve never taken upskilling seriously. In my new job, I‚Äôm working with a tech stack I‚Äôve never used before. Despite having plenty of time to learn, I never bothered to go through tutorials. Instead, I spent that time ""chilling"" and wasting it.

I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I feel stuck and uncertain about how to break free from this cycle of laziness and dissatisfaction. I want to get back on track, but I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to make the necessary changes. I am at a point where I have been thinking a lot about quitting my job after my first stock vest, and take a year long break to figure what I wanna do. My plan is to take sometime out first to feel calm, quit smoking and other habits. Then I wanna explore the world of tech a little more. With all new AI agents coming, I feel like I wanna deep dive into it, build something of my own, take on some real world challenges, and I cant imagine doing it with my full time job. But along with it I have a fear that if this year break doesnt work out and I start my job hunt next year, will I get a job with at-least close to my current pay? I consider myself an average dev, who have just been fortunate enough to get the kind of opportunities that pay me well. Although I have been considered as a performing dev by all my colleagues and friends. and this also stressed me out, the imposter syndrome. Is my decision to take a break worthwhile?I have never taken time out for myself to look for what interests me the most. I have just been going with the flow uptill now and now I have started to feel empty. I just dont wanna waste my life and do something fulfilling.

He had insisted it was no big deal, and didn't want to wait for an alternative piece of equipment to be freed up to do his inspection.

1j90sv6,"Feeling Stuck ‚Äì Not Enough Pay, No Growth, and No Luck in the Job Market","I've been at my current job for six years, and it's feeling more stagnant by the day. The pay isn‚Äôt enough, and despite multiple conversations with leadership, there‚Äôs no real path for career growth. I‚Äôve been applying for new roles, but I either don‚Äôt get interviews or, when I do, I don‚Äôt make it past the final stages.

I suspect part of the issue is that my career path hasn‚Äôt been super linear, which seems to turn some companies off. I‚Äôve been considering contract work since it might be an easier way to land opportunities and build my resume, but the instability worries me.

Basically, I‚Äôm burned out, underpaid, and discouraged by the job market. Every rejection chips away at my confidence. Any advice on how to break through this career plateau?

1j8z7hu,"Asked for a raise and got it. Did I aim too high, or not high enough?","I'm gonna add some context for why I'm asking this question, but there's a TL;DR at the bottom.

I started my current job in Sept 2020 as a warehouse associate for a local, but popular clothing retailer. Our team was very small, only being the warehouse manager and two associates, including myself. All three of us started within 2 months of each other, as the owner was trying to form a dedicated warehouse team. Apparently the salesmen and even the higher positions would split their time between office work and warehouse work. 

In the Summer of 2024 they started doing e-commerce through Shopify, direct to consumer and the workload got too heavy for them to not have a real warehouse crew. That's where we came in. 

Honestly this job is really great, and always has been. My coworker and I both started at $13 and we got good  raises every year. In Sept 2023 our manager left for a different position closer to home with higher pay, and immediately after he let us know, his boss met with us separately and bumped us from $18 to $20/hour each. I think the plan was that we were going to absorb our manager's duties and we would essentially manage ourselves. 

I thought this was kinda weird at first, but the job was so laid back and had such a nice environment with the office people that I didn't think much of it. About a week later my coworker puts in his two week notice. He said it has something to do with his feet being in too much pain, but I'm pretty sure it's because he wasn't happy with the increased work load.

Either way, now I'm the only warehouse employee. We went about 2 weeks with that being the case, and it was pretty tough but I received a lot of praise from my boss and other employees for keeping it together. I basically became the manager by default, and it felt weird, like I wasn't exactly chosen so I felt a lot of pressure to do well. 

I had been the warehouse manager for one year when I decided I needed a raise. I'm doing everything my old manager used to to, plus about half of the stuff I used to do as an associate. I debated on how much to ask for, but I decided on asking for a salary $55,000, up from $38,000. (I have no idea how much my old manager was making btw)

I could tell when I met with my boss that she knew exactly what I was going to ask, and she didn't put up any resistance to my asking. But she told me she would have to come back to me in a day or so to see if $55,000 was in the budget. She came back and told me they could do $50,000 and re-evaluate for $55,000 next year. 

I was satisfied with that so we shook hands and that was the end of it. I can't shake the feeling that I may have either sold myself short, or asked for too much considering the size of the company. 

TL;DR
I asked for a $17,000 salary increase to $55,000/year after one year of becoming the warehouse manager by default. Not sure if I could've asked for more or if I asked for too much considering the size of our company.

1j8yien,College?,"Right now I'm a junior at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I'm studying industrial engineering. I'm also very skilled at working with my hands. I just remodeled my girlfriends parents bathroom. Here's a link to the remodel since I can't post pictures here.

In the Chicago land area I can charge about 5k to 10k for this type of work. I also can do trim and flooring. I can pretty much learn how to do anything with my hands just by watching someone do it, and everything I need to learn is youtube. I have a strong foundation in math, science, and physics so learning the theory behind any sort of building is easy for me. I also have a strong foundation in business. My mom owns a cleaning service that generates 5 mil in revenue and I've learned a lot from her, she always talks to me about her business. I also ran a bicycle repair shop out of my parents garage before I went to college and profited 40k in my first summer. I had 2 employees.¬†

I also had an internship last summer at a control panel building and high voltage electrician company. I am 90% sure they would take me without a degree because I was invited to their Christmas party and they gave me $1000 bonus for Christmas and I didn't work at all during the semester or over winter break. I started programming a simple PLC program on my own and was able to test panels on my own by the end of the internship.¬†

I'm wondering if it's worth it for me to finish college or should I start doing construction and work at the panel building company? I'm guessing I could make around 100k by the time I graduate in spring 2026.

Maybe thats their way of saying they actually arent interested, and that the email will never come?

When she asked about one, they couldn‚Äôt give her what she wanted but they gave her a little increase and a company gas card since she drives to clients a lot.

My wife says if they tell her she has to pay it back she probably will because she doesn‚Äôt want a bad mark, but as mentioned I want to hold firm on not paying them back given they under pay her, make her drive all over the place, have her work on weekends and after work she has to buy a book that the owner wrote and then do homework assignments.

1j8tjtx,Would you try writing-based exercises to discover what work you're really meant to do?,"Hello everyone,

This is not an ad, I have nothing to sell.

I'm developing a series of writing-based exercises to help people gain clarity about what work they really want to do. Work that: 

* Involves your favourite topics and interests
* Combines your favourite skills and activities, and
* Solves the type of problems that you find deeply meaningful.

The intended outcome is for you to find out how you can earn money using the traits, talents and interests you like most about yourself. 

I'm looking for ~~5~~ 2 people who are interested in this process and willing to provide honest feedback.

**WHAT YOU'LL GET (entirely for free):**

* A structured method to identify your natural talents and what work would feel most meaningful to you
* Research-based reflective writing techniques to understand what you actually care about
* A personal framework for evaluating your career decisions and opportunities
* Greater confidence and ability in articulating what tasks, responsibilities, and projects you want at work
* Four zoom calls to talk about and reflect on your progress and discoveries
* Worksheets to synthesize your insights and turn them into action
* Concrete suggestions for how you can immediately begin pivoting towards your most desired job

**YOU'RE MY IDEAL CANDIDATE IF YOU:**

* Feel uncertain about your career direction or that your current work isn't truly fulfilling
* Will commit to attend sessions and complete the between-session exercises (estimated 3 hours x 4 weeks)
* Will provide detailed feedback on what was helpful and what needs improvement
* Accept that I'll anonymously use your feedback to refine my methodology

**WHY AM I CREATING THIS?**

I've got a Master's degree in sociology, and I've always been interested in how relationships, social structures and mainstream culture shape our thinking, and not least our choices, without us realizing it. Sometimes even masking our true identity from ourselves.

I want to aid people in separating their genuine values, desires and ambitions from inherited social value systems and pragmatic ""shoulds"". To uncover who you fundamentally are and what path would satisfy you, absent external expectations, social pressure and media influences. What makes you come alive and feel maximally engaged.

I've developed this system based on research into purpose discovery, flow state, meaningful work psychology, and reflective writing techniques. Your participation helps me refine these methods while potentially giving you valuable career clarity and insights about your professional purpose.

To participate, send me a DM. Only 2 more spots. Sessions will ideally start next week, or next week if your schedule requires it.

Thanks for considering!

1j8stkr,Fired 4 times? Is my condition that bad?,"I have 7 years of work experience with 4 different jobs so far. In all of the jobs I‚Äôve had, I‚Äôve been fired.

Here‚Äôs a little more on that:

1st Job (1 year): I was pretty new to the domain, but over time, I learned what the job truly entailed. It was about to be a year when, one day, I was told by my senior to stay back and work on something. I disagreed, but ended up working anyway. The next day, when I arrived at the office, I was told I had been fired. I thought about this a lot and blamed it on being not disciplined. (

2nd Job (2 year): This job was full of ups and downs. It was a new experience for me, so it took some time to get the hang of it. Then, the pandemic hit, and I had my salary cut by 70%, which lasted for 6-7 months. After that, I was asked to do telecalling, which was completely unrelated to my job. I declined, and a couple of days later, my manager called me and told me I was fired. I must admit, both the manager and the company were quite a disaster. I sometimes wonder whether it was my fault or if the company was just really bad.

3rd Job(2 year): This was a remote position, and I had trouble connecting with my team, despite putting in a lot of effort. My manager once mentioned that I was perceived as being a bit rude. In terms of work performance, my rating was below average, and before they could fire me, I quit.

4th Job (2 years): Up until this point, I had a good experience. I really loved my work at this company and had a great team. For the most part, I was doing well, and it felt like a dream job. However, after nearly 2 years, I was fired again. The reason was that I was considered evasive, not truthful, and they had issues trusting me. To be honest, I had a couple of incidents where I was evasive, but not intentionally untruthful.

Now, I understand I may be at fault, but after 7 years of work, I‚Äôve been fired in almost every job I‚Äôve had. This is making me rethink everything. Am I in the right domain? Should I start a business (I really want to, but just don‚Äôt have the guts)? Are these firings a reflection of something about me? Am I really that bad professionally to be fired from all these jobs?

The silver lining in all these firings is that I‚Äôve always switched jobs with a nearly 80-100% salary hike, and I ended up working at better companies.

I really need some advice here. I‚Äôm quite anxious about joining something new again. Just to add, in almost all of the jobs, I had severe anxiety. For example, if my manager called me, I‚Äôd immediately start thinking about what I might have done wrong. This anxiety, combined with the firings, has made me really reluctant to join a new company.",ConfusedAFF898,2,0.5299999713897705,87,1741705386,2025-03-11 15:03:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8stkr/fired_4_times_is_my_condition_that_bad/,3,2025

The catch here is that I verbally agreed that I could start remotely in the start date they wanted. I did not sign the offer letter yet so of course I could walk away or they could rescind the offer.

Does it sound unreasonable to go back and say I want more time upfront not working, but I'll arrive in person a month earlier?",OSamsara,1,1.0,6,1741705259,2025-03-11 15:00:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8srr9/can_anyone_share_how_they_pushed_back_the_start/,3,2025

1j8skop,Previous colleague in position below was on 10% more than me,"Okay so I‚Äôm not sure where to start with this one so I‚Äôll try to make it quick. TLDR is at the bottom.

When I joined the company I was quite new to office life and a ‚Äúcareer‚Äù. I entered at 30k for an exec position. The senior exec on the team was hired at 40k 12 months prior. 

After a few months the company gave everyone a 10% cost of living/inflation busting pay rise. However as I started too late in the year I did not receive this. 

My colleague was now on 44k and I was on 30k. 

When she left I was promoted into her position last February, before hand I had meetings with my manager to discuss this and laid out my salary expectations (40-45k). I was given a salary of 36k as ‚Äúthe company only increases wages by 20% max‚Äù. Okay whatever, still more than what I was on. 

After another 12 months I was promoted again this February. I stated to my manager the going market rate is 45-50k and I expect to be paid within that range. When granted my promotion I was bumped up to 41k (a ~14% increase). Again I was happy but now I‚Äôm not. 

How do I address this without coming across as inconsiderate, bratty, or ungrateful? I want to bring this up to my manager in my 121 but not sure how to address it. 

Some notes:
I‚Äôve mentioned market rates - company unwilling to match. 
My exceptional performance - becoming a manager after 2 years is credit of that. 
I am constantly compared to my previous colleague with praise and the willingness to go further than she did. (I even got the promotion she did not get because of her lack of skills).
The business is restructuring and I currently have another team who wants my skills for their own. 

In short, I am more skilled, a better performer, and more desired to work with, but am on almost 10% less than what she earnt in a position above. How do I address this? Or do I just call it a day and quit?

TLDR: I earn 10% less than an ex-colleague in a position below my current one, even getting the promotion she didn‚Äôt get. Do I just quit? Or do I finally bring up that I know she earnt more than me and I expect to be paid more?",ParrotDrumStickBitch,0,0.5,4,1741704745,2025-03-11 14:52:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8skop/previous_colleague_in_position_below_was_on_10/,3,2025

I am a Recruiting Manager for a corporate company. So technically I am on the HR team. My last company was staffing and I was the manager over the recruiters in my location. 
As a manager, I built trust and was able to manage my team and myself how I see fit. I am huge on work life balance so I would provide half days, early outs, remote days, etc as incentives for good performance. The schedule was pretty flexible. We left when the work was done or we hit our goals for the day.
I came into corporate thinking I would have even better work life balance. But the way they micro manage everything here is kind of mind blowing. You must get in on time and can‚Äôt leave early. As a manager I can‚Äôt offer any flexibility as an incentive for hard work. Fridays I have to wait until 5pm to leave. Even if I‚Äôm at a stopping point.
When you start, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúearn‚Äù a hybrid schedule until you‚Äôve been employed for 90 days. Giving the impression you have to ‚Äúearn‚Äù to be trusted even after they literally hired you.

1j8jbgh,Struggling to nail interviews? Read this.,"You‚Äôve been here before.

You send out applications, get the interview, and then... something doesn‚Äôt quite land.

You walk away knowing you didn‚Äôt mess it up.

But you didn‚Äôt exactly¬†*nail*¬†it either.

So, what‚Äôs going wrong?

After years in headhunting, I‚Äôve seen that¬†**i**t‚Äôs rarely about qualifications.

Plenty of talented people stay stuck in their careers simply because they don‚Äôt approach interviews the right way.

If you want to stop leaving opportunities on the table, here‚Äôs what really makes the difference.

First:¬†**do your research like a pro**.

And no, that doesn‚Äôt mean reading the ‚ÄòAbout Us‚Äô page five minutes before the call.

The best candidates dig deeper. They look at recent press releases, earnings reports, or industry trends.

Then, they work that knowledge into the conversation.

Saying something like,¬†*‚ÄúI saw your team just rolled out a new client onboarding system. How has that transition been?‚Äù*¬†shows you‚Äôre engaged at a higher level than most.

Next,¬†**talk about your experience in a way that actually means something**.

A hiring manager doesn‚Äôt just want to know what you did; they want to know the impact.

Instead of saying,¬†*‚ÄúI led a team on a project,‚Äù*¬†say,¬†*‚ÄúI led a team on a project that cut processing time by 30% and saved us $200K in overheads.‚Äù*¬†See the difference?

Another thing - the best candidates¬†**own the conversation**.

That doesn‚Äôt mean talking over the interviewer or running through a rehearsed script.

It means having¬†**thoughtful questions ready**¬†that show you‚Äôre thinking beyond just ‚Äògetting the job.‚Äô

Instead of,¬†*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the company culture like?‚Äù*¬†(which they‚Äôll answer with a vague ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre very collaborative!‚Äô), ask something like,¬†*‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the biggest challenge the team is tackling this quarter?‚Äù*

That‚Äôs a real conversation starter.

And let‚Äôs talk about that awkward silence. You know, the one after they ask you a question and you feel the need to rush in with an answer?

The top 1% don‚Äôt do that.

They take a beat, think, then respond with confidence.

A well-placed¬†*‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great question‚Äîlet me think for a second‚Äù*¬†makes you look considered, not unprepared.

Finally, don‚Äôt forget the¬†**follow-up**.

Most people fire off a generic ‚ÄúThanks for your time‚Äù email and call it a day.

The smart ones send a message that refers back to a specific discussion point.

Something like,¬†*‚ÄúI really enjoyed our conversation about X, and I‚Äôd love the opportunity to be part of Y.‚Äù*

That‚Äôs the stuff that makes you¬†**stand out**.

So, if you keep getting to interviews but not getting offers, don‚Äôt just assume it‚Äôs bad luck.¬†**There‚Äôs a way to do this better.**

Now go and own that interview.",timthomas3,46,0.8799999952316284,8,1741669598,2025-03-11 05:06:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8jbgh/struggling_to_nail_interviews_read_this/,3,2025

1j8ibsc,"""MY team"" - no (smack!) it's ""OUR team""!!  UGH!","Does anyone have a co-worker who takes the spotlight, constantly takes charge (even though he's not in charge - he's not even designated as any kind of lead), puts everyone else in his shadow and uses phrases like ""my team"" a lot?  Organizationally we're all at the same level, same pay grade, and all report to the same manager.  

How do I get him aligned to the real world reality of we/us and 'the team' or 'our team'?  

To make matters worse, this individual is our poorest performer.  We're on a 3/2 hybrid schedule with core in-office hours of 8-5, Tues/Wed/Thurs but he's in office once or twice a week for 4-5 hours a day as he has to get his kids on/off the bus (no one else with kids has this issue).  When he's working from home he's often showing as 'idle' in Teams, is difficult to reach and that's usually because he's tending to his kids rather than working.  His work product is often riddled with mistakes when he has us peer check it... likely due to his personal life distractions and off the charts ADHD.  

Yet, he still has this take charge attitude, and he only becomes more present / on task when we're close to kicking off a large project and he jumps into superhero mode to look good - while the rest of us have been working hard behind the scenes all this time.  

Of course our boss is aware (he's remote in another state) but isn't willing to rectify the problem.  

I'm ready to throw in the towel and move on.  I love my job.  I'm just done working in the shadow of this one individual.

I work very closely with my coworker (Jeremy) who I feel is impossible to work with. He‚Äôs incredibly stubborn, rude, and condescending . He consistently fails to meet deadlines and often forgets about tasks. The issue is that most of these deadlines/tasks are shared with me so I am constantly reminding him or just picking up his work for the sake of not missing a deadline and getting lectured at by my manager. He has an issue with his temper too, he will slam his keyboard over something as simple as his computer rebooting or his mouse not connecting which makes me feel really uneasy around him.

I know that no work place will ever be perfect and there will always be people, coworkers, managers, that you don‚Äôt get along with but I just am feeling very fed up and my morale has been very very low.

1j8h0ht,How do you manage work life balance over pointless business trips?,"
Hi friends. Been at my job for about 2.5 years as an engineer. I love my job and my manager, but it‚Äôs extremely tough. 

Lately, I have 9 PM calls 4x a week, plus being in the office now. I also am expected to travel abruptly and with little to no notice (just went on a week long business trip).

However, I recently got asked to travel to a customer site for some presentation. In my opinion, this trip has no value added‚Äî I can‚Äôt even meet with the customer, I‚Äôm presenting to an audience that has not been responsive at all to my team in the past, it really feels like I‚Äôm just ‚Äúgoing to please my boss,‚Äù who randomly signed me up for this and has no idea what is going on at this event anyway. 

Additionally, this trip was scheduled the week of my anniversary and my husband is still recovering from a medical event, so I don‚Äôt feel great about being gone a whole other week for a presentation that doesn‚Äôt take longer than half an hour. 

I still agreed to go, but kept my visit only for one night and two days. I think it‚Äôs a reasonable compromise as I‚Äôm not refusing outright but at the end of the day, I don‚Äôt think this is an important enough trip to bail on my family life for a whole week especially with how much time I‚Äôm already giving to work on a daily basis. 

I know that sometimes work travel will clash with birthdays or anniversaries and normally I would deal with it, but I feel this need to keep some amount of boundaries when I can. 

How do yall manage work travel? Do you try and avoid it on the important occasions? Would love to hear some other perspectives.

1j8gxg0,Need help on how to navigate this meeting with my boss tomorrow,"Hi all!

I have a meeting tomorrow with my boss where I wish to discuss my year-end review and subsequent performance pay bump. I received a 3.6 / 5 as a total, where in 3/5 categories I rated ‚ÄúExceeds Expectations‚Äù and 2/5 I rated ‚Äúmeets expectations‚Äù. For my pay, I got an .88c raise, which is a 4% overall increase. 

Now you may be wondering what‚Äôs so bad about all of this, I‚Äôm glad you asked! 

I began this job a year ago in February. I took the offer for the same pay as my last job but an increase in commute of 25 minutes because of the growth potential. So, a pay cut essentially. I also did not go in expecting the success I had, but am proud of what I have accomplished. 

In my time here I have been a critical member of the department. I have 9 of 13 documented department meetings where I receive praise from the VP of our area. I am told that I have been asking questions expected of our senior in the department, and I am a junior. I was told that I am the only person in the department who is consistently meeting their project time restraints, and that I have received the best review of the whole department. 

Since October, I have been told my by supervisor that I should expect a promotion to staff. Again, this was communicated to me in OCTOBER when our staff employee retired. I accepted the extra tasks given to me with a positive attitude. Since then, I have cleaned up the half-completed tasks left behind by our previous employee. I‚Äôve written procedures on how to complete the tasks as to prevent future miscommunications as well. I, essentially, have been doing 85% staff work for Junior pay only because I was told to be expecting a promotion.

I asked my supervisor on three separate occasions if I was still on track for a promotion, and each time he said yes. What bothered me, though, was that the time frame changed each time I asked. The end date being a promotion could be expected in March when I receive my yearly review. 

A few weeks ago, my supervisor was out for 2 weeks. During that time, my boss assigned over 80 reconciliations to me that were past due from October, giving me a huge confidence boost in the email where she assigned the work. My boss let me know that assisting with this would be a huge team help, and would help with my future career prospects. I completed 3/4 of the work and it took my all 2 weeks. Again, I only did this because I felt I was a shoe-in for the promotion, and it was expected. When I asked my boss to reassign the tasks back to my supervisor, she told me that he would no longer be completing these recs, and that they were mine now. Not only that, but I have been training the new junior employee that was hired to ‚Äúreplace my position‚Äù, but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet and it‚Äôs been 2 months. 

So, back to my yearly review. I received stellar comments and NO PROMOTION! Only an .88c raise! I told my supervisor I was  disappointed and felt used for cheap labor. He let me know that he was confused as well, as he had been vouching for my promotion this entire time and suggested I speak with our boss directly about it.

So, that meeting is tomorrow and I am nervous I‚Äôm going to fold and be too nice about it. I have a very very good relationship with my boss AND supervisor and would like to make the most of this conversation. I recognize that I was only told by my SUPERVISOR that I‚Äôd be getting promoted, not necessarily by my boss. So I want to address that miscommunication. I should be earning at least $55K, but am making less that $22/hour after benefits are included.. 

And yes, in the meantime I cleaned up my resume. 

So I was wondering if anyone had any good points to mention and bring up and tips and tricks as I‚Äôm really nervous about this meeting.

This morning I went in while having a migraine and nausious. I didnt call off cause I was worried about getting in trouble for it during probation period, So I went in anyway.  About an hour into my shift I accidently didnt notice the person didnt pay until the other person after paid. It was very busy and I was again, sick. My manager was informed and politely informed me not to do it again with a written warning, and that she understood that I was sick. About an hour after that manager left, I somehow did it again and wasnt aware of it until another manager told me about it before close. She said the manager who talked to me before will talk to me and I‚Äôm very nervous about being fired, I love this job alot and don‚Äôt wanna lose it.

1j8gdlt,How worried should I be about ROI for my degree? I have one year left to finish,"My education journey has been full of bumps and turns. I was severely depressed in high school so I did not get good grades and chose to take a year off in between high school and college. I attended community college and then dropped out during covid to paint houses. I really hated the danger, exposure to harmful chemicals so I decided to go back to school and attended a 4 year. I stared out in psych but didn‚Äôt do well so I switched majors so social work. At that point I had two problems: I didn‚Äôt research ROI and I have done so poorly in stem and math classes (dyscalculia among other disabilities) that high paying degrees were mostly out of question. Also I scored pretty low on IQ. Unfortunately now I‚Äôm stuck doing a degree I‚Äôm good at, but that has a high burn out rate, terrible wages among not being valued by society. I‚Äôm super stressed about the ROI and all the years I have wasted on my education.

1j8g6eb,pretty hurts,"so I have applied for a job that gave a description of what I was going to do but as time gone on I noticed almost the whole team has left or is leaving. they were there longer than me tbh. But now this is about me I was in a bad situation desperate for a job so when I walked in with my CV and immediately got a call back I was relieved so I guess you could say that I took a break from looking after been judged for my work history gap as I had an accident. However the type of work Im in people there are so stiff they wouldnt talk and the two girls who were showing me around and explaining everything left. This leaves me my manager I had horrible past experiences were I promised myself that I would tell someone about it. My manager is considered amongst girls attractive however as someone who went through DV my want to get to know a guy requires more emotional connection than looks. after about two months I noticed that I was hired when the company was not supposed to and back when I first handed my cv in I noticed the manager kind of eyeing me which I ignored and this is not to brag but guys say im beautiful my guy friends never stay friends and i had a manager before this give me his number and i never returned to that place again , also about two years ago a man was locked up for stalking me. I had an uber driver last month make a joke about how pretty he thinks iam and that it would be a shame if the gas had run out. Fast forward to this manager (my current manager) when I first started he told me that all the staff schedules are on the facebook group and that the only way to join it is if he adds me. so he sends me a request and i stupidly accepted it. but as a previous victim of DV my privacy was already tight so whether he was trying to hit on me or not there is really nothing outside of my doubke private settings that he could view or access and because I was desperate for a job I needed this to get by while I keep looking the break from having to search for jobs and not been able to explain why i couldnt leave the house due to abusive relationship was the reason why i couldnt work and to add insult to injury last month I was diagnosed with ptsd which explains my panic attacks and why i couldnt stick to one job longer than 3 months for a year. I would lose my concetration or I would leave as I was always surrounded by people ignorant of me. anyway back to my point once he added anything i posted he would either view so quickly I ignored it as anyone coukd see on his photo that he had a GF and I always brushed off his behaviour whenever he was nice to me or getting me anything I needed (he would always say yes and I heard from other people that when they ask he would say no) if he ever saw me come in late he wouldnt raise any issues. He would tell me that he understand. fastforward few weeks I noticed we would be scheduled to work so late alone and when I asked why that would be the case he said that he was not aware of how I would get home??? bare in mind he is my manager and he should ask if he wasnt sure what time matches public transport. my friend advised me to never complain since this job was a paycheck one as I hated it fr. the people I work with work with celebrities and influencers and they come from wealthy background. i never ever felt like I fit in even when they had a party it was almost as if they were expecting me to show up otherwise I would be left out of other things. I almost attended before canceling due to a panic attack. then as more time had gone on I accepted requests of other collegues (females) bare in mind I didnt have anything to hide I always had my own private circle even if someonw i dont know adds me on facebook. I never shared my twitch page, my insta or sc on facebook. I would like to also mention that my collegues almost all use a fake name I dont know who they are or how important they are but this is the job iam in right now and I found this out when one of my chatty collegue told me this and she was drunk coming into work. so as you can imagine they are the type of people that expect perfection and probably hired me for my looks according to my friend from everything that I have told her. so after several attempts of the manager across weeks of staring at me and stalking my selfies and story I decided to share something as I was on the verge of a breakdown one post regarding mental health and he decided to back off goodriddance but not in the way that I expected because he deleted me after that. it was a post regarding mental health of a woman page blogger and advocate for womens rights against abuse. physical and mental etc. I feel it was odd timing especially after this whole time of him been nice and trying to be my friend, asking personal question and even adding me? so what now? if feels like as if it made him back up but cant help but think what was his intention? was he trying to hurt me ? is he abusive himself so the post hit his ego im really not sure but im friends with my other friends who have gone on to work in media , politics , social media , OF and streaming. I just feel sick if by accident that post called him out. I noticed prior to this when girls were leaving they would delete him. there was a guy who worked there for four years who recently left he too I have come to find out that despite working with my manager for years they were not friends. I had a conversation privately on my facebook with a friend about leaving this job soon as I have another one with a female manager and no one there bothering or behaving like him by staring at me (which I caught him do) he woukd do this thing where he would stare and when i notice he looks away. I had bad experiences were I got told by police from my experience with abuse that things like words and staring are hard to prove unless there is a witness or another female that this happened to. but my job role became outside of what was described to me because I would be working isolated  from everyone else in an office sometimes not the same exact time as him but he would be there alot making it so that we are alone. Now because of his behaviour im worried for my job and having to apologise for mistakes after that facebook friend deletion incident and I dont need to be doing that. I just expected few more weeks enough to pass probation period for the other job and to become perm so I would leave this one. The other thing I need to mention is that it appears that he is taking it so personal when someone leaves but if he was a good manager to begin with then we wouldnt have lost 8 people in a month. almost double and tripple the workload is passed to me. one time when I was on a break I caught him slacking and his excuse was I didnt know where to start. I think he had bad intentions from the start and when he didnt get his way possibky the post gave away that I was a victim of DV he backed off immediately. When I accepted him on facebook I was relieved that he had a gf as I was telling myself that no one will behave like this especially not a manager so it wasnt after he deleted me after seen the DV post that made me realise he was not who I thought he was. he was one of them men that shared their own story about a mother battling cancer. not to say that it was a lie but more I understand what its like to have an emotional shock. the guy may also lose his job as the whole team is leaving including two other managers and myself.  I need needed to share this in the hopes that someone will understand how tired I feel about starting over. it feels draining like I feel like a failure. I also feel like as if i was been gaslighted because when he was adding me he insisting and making jokes that everyone here is cool but I should have followed my instinct. there is a difference between a collegue deleting you for example and a manager where it makes you question if you just got fired. I noticed people who leave never speak to him so he probably assumed once I leave I will. im also getting vibes that this guy might have been stalking me I cant prove it but one time I left the building on my break as I didnt want to be drinking in the staff room and he guessed correctly which cafe I had gone to. im sure my anxiety is making me think this way and due to past real stalking behaviour. did he hack my fb ? did he track me using the staff app which asks you to turn on location which i didnt? what is happening. its called S4 for anyone who thinks that they can find out if there is something i missed in my contract regarding app use etc. (privacy) etc. I mentioned that I had a private convo with a friend regarding leaving. I need to clairfy that my friend does not know these people because I come from a small town and have a poor background my area has made headlines with the council in regards to how poor the population is living there. through a very long commute with a plan to relocate i was able to go to a city for a job and not just one but two part times as its expensive living there. the timing of me as an hire we have a thing in our schedule which shows how long each person was there and when they joined. i have been the only hire across 3 months ??? even when staffs were leaving they did not hire others. its really bad. and when people who have been there for years are leaving with noticing the manager almost takes it personal it and him deleting me after sharing a DV post it makes me realise that I was not hired for the reason that I thought I was. its like as if I realised that looks is all guys see and will make attempts to get close and they cant be friends with me or see me without trying. I mentioned the staring this had gone on few times across a month. I had a manager before this after applying give me his number. all of is making me effed up I feel like the only solution is to purposely make myself unattractive. but this is work... to get a job I need to look tidy and my uniform has never been dresses, skirts etc. Im abit of a tom boy I wear hoodies and I wear all black mostly casual too. its hurting my confidence and I have already been reffered to see a therapist for my ptsd. im currently on reddit on a rant spree because I feel like that my gut feelings were right and that guys are making me think im crazy but i was right all along i just didnt want to believe that my manager with a gf was probs only getting close for one reason and it wasnt easy due to my past experiences like that post about domestic was almost like a heavy wind blowing him away.it should only bother someone who had ill intentions. I got lucky. now that same guy is asking me to work til I leave. part of me wants to ghost the place and use my other job as a reference for future applications as I was there way longer than this. I just thought on paper it would look good to have both to become a supervisor at some point. I worked hard to support myself to chase my dream...he was trying to mess with all that. what do you guys think. please talk to me about any of my points as this is alot like my brain is in a tornado. what I would like to hear is that its not my fault and to always follow my gut from now on. Thats all I want. but this is a public post here it goes reddit please help before i blame my looks and myself. im not far off as while in abusive relationship I was underweight with an eating disorder after trying to bounce back i still had the scars of ptsd from all that. the daily insults the humilliation, the hitting, insults about my looks. he was treating me as if he was my manager telling me when to sleep , go out and when to eat, sabotaging me, when he found out i was applying for jobs he broke my phone in response. it was hell. i also grew up with my dad who did the same thing to my mum and she always gone back to him. when I left i never looked back but it seems like guys still want me under their thumb and im done.

1j8fsl4,Job offer rescinded due to poor reference,"I just left a hostile work environment. My former manager and I had an excellent working relationship for several years of my career. After some significant life changes, I reduced hours at work. This came with an unexpected shift in my manager's attitude toward me. I was immediately excluded from most of my former duties, with my work being re-allocated to others. I expected that. But then I was removed from job duties that were simply part of the job. It was a gradual shift over several months. I realized that I needed to move on, and arranged a conversation with my boss to submit my notice--at which time I completely lost my cool and aired my grievances. My old boss later told me not to come back, put me on admin leave (paid), and said I was eligible for re-hire within the company. 

  
A few weeks later, I have a job offer in hand and am preparing to start work, when I get a call from HR that the offer has been rescinded due to a poor reference from my former manager. I did not list him on my resume, but as this is part of the same company, I should have anticipated this. I also didn't expect him to give a poor reference, as our relationship prior to my resignation was overall very positive.

1j8fbyr,Started a new TPM job 2 months ago and already received 2 negative reviews,"I started a new job as a TPM with an engineering company beginning of this year, it‚Äôs a remote position. My company is smaller and mostly subcontracts out to larger companies, and so I have supervisors with both companies. In just 2 months my large company supervisor (let‚Äôs call him John) has provided 2 negative reviews back to my main company supervisor (call him Bob).

John provided the first bad review after my first month, saying I was moving too slow getting the teams and tracking set up. Since I‚Äôm a subcontractor to this company, getting access for me is different from their normal employees and took the first 2 weeks to even get admin rights to their apps. Also I‚Äôm trying to familiarize myself with their system, processes, and products in this time working around these roadblocks.

I get access and get things moving and John provides some good feedback a week or so later.

Today I get a message out of the blue from Bob that John provided more negative feedback last week, so Bob and I hop on a call. John submitted that I‚Äôm not pulling my weight, feels like I‚Äôm not giving it my all and can‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôve accomplished on his task list he gave me.

I‚Äôve been working his tasks but tbh it‚Äôs a lot for 1 person (basically I‚Äôm doing the role of PO, SM, and support help desk) so I need time to get to all his asks. Not to mention I‚Äôve only been there 2 months and still figuring my way around everything. It also doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôm remote and most rest of them are in office and seem to have drive-by-convos and meetings they don‚Äôt fill me in on. I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know.

I have a meeting with Bob tomorrow to discuss strategies to right the ship with John/the large company. But it‚Äôs already been 2 strikes back to back. I‚Äôm shocked and shook my company might let me go if John provides a third bad review. Keep in mind John and I meet almost daily and he‚Äôs never provided any feedback to me personally, always gone to my supervisor. I legitimately thought we were going well and was blindsided by the news today.

Any advice/wisdom/insights is much appreciated. I feel it‚Äôs way too soon to start job searching again but this feels terrible and like John is already out to get me.

1j8ex6u,Continue with a fictitious traineeship at a fancy place or return to college to continue building a novelty project?,"I am a final year undergrad pursuing Electrical & Electronics Engineering. At the moment, I am engaged in a kind of ""internship"" (unpaid) at an airport. I am with the engineering and maintenance department and obviously more closer to the electrical side of things.

I have got to see inside the substations, the various switchgear devices, LT & HT panels, transformers, DGs, ACBs and VCBs, motors, chillers, HVAC, etc. I got to read various SLDs of the terminal building, catalogues of switch gear, reviewed proposal from vendors for different electrical installations and ensured compliance with relevant standards. 

But I feel like I have only toured these facilities and didn't gain any meaningful and impactful knowledge. My immediate supervisor comes off as incompetent to me, partly because he has no regard for adhering to higher standards of professionalism and mostly because he has no respect for theory and barely would understand core electrical concepts i studied in college. He's a technician, with many years in the field who knows which products are suited for what and acts a low level manager/consultant ensuring execution of plans proposed by some outsourced consultancy. He's more of a technician rather than an engineer.   
I barely have any work to do, so I mostly sit in a nice air-conditioned office learning things and doing some hobby projects. 

Now before coming here, I was pursuing a research project in my college, developing a novel piece of hardware under a professor. I left that for the internship at an airport and now its been a month. I still am in touch with the professor and occasionally advice and assist in the development of that same project when I have time and during holidays. Our intention has always been to publish a research paper. 

Now I feel like, pursuing the project at school would be a better thing to do. This internship seems to be getting me nowhere except that it gives me a nice corner in a fancy office where I can be much more productive than I usually am. This is my first experience outside of college, and I went for it exactly because of it. I wanted something on my resume. 

  
I'd really appreciate if y'all could give me more insight.

I'm on a PIP, it went well for the first few weeks and then it's just spiralled out of control.

I've been really struggling with regulating my emotions and dealing with being at work, but every accommodation I ask for gets denied. And I just feel like I've won't be capable of anything else.

I want to be able to do my job, but I just feel like I've wasted a decent job opportunity and I'm not capable of anything else. I just know I'm going to lose my job at the end of this and I'm fed up of going through OH for the advice to be ignored. I've had three assesments one for neurodivergence and the other two regarding the levels of anxiety that I suffer from. If anything, the  PIP has exacerbated the anxiety and left me more stressed. Which has led me to being on way to fail the PIP and all the previous habits I developed as coping mechanisms are coming out.

I just feel like I've been punished for struggling instead of given any help. I'm really scared to go into another job because I feel like places way that they will give you support and then refuse to accommodate it.

Is this normal? I'm just soo confused and stressed at this point. I just can't stop crying but I'm scared ill throw my job away if I go off sick.

1j8dows,Going to HR for guidance and to make a report about inappropriate behavior,"I am noticing a pattern of inappropriate behavior with my manager and his manager. I contacted HR today for guidance. To be honest, I don‚Äôt even want to be alone in a meeting with him. 

Here‚Äôs what I said:

I want to formally address a pattern of inappropriate workplace conversations that have made me uncomfortable over the past several months. In multiple one-on-one meetings, [skip level] has repeatedly brought up topics that I feel are not appropriate for a professional setting.

The following are specific examples:
	‚Ä¢	Religion (9/16/24): [skip level] compared Catholicism to Shintoism, saying both are based on shame.
	‚Ä¢	Politics (Early 2024): He made a pointed comment about appreciating living in a more progressive area than where I live.
	‚Ä¢	Personal Finances (2/10/25): He brought up his own wedding expenses and asked if my family was contributing to mine.
	‚Ä¢	Family Planning & Reproductive Choices (2/10/25): He mentioned that people would soon start asking when we‚Äôll have children and suggested getting a dog as a ‚Äútest run.‚Äù

These topics are not relevant to my work responsibilities and have made me uncomfortable. While I have tried to redirect the conversations, they continue to arise. Given the nature of these subjects‚Äîespecially reproductive choices and finances‚ÄîI feel it is important to formally address this to ensure that professional boundaries are maintained.

I would appreciate guidance on how to ensure that workplace discussions remain professional moving forward. Please let me know how you recommend handling this situation.

What do you think is going on? Am I being overly sensitive? What should I be prepared to do next?",SassyFrass3005,0,0.4300000071525574,18,1741651808,2025-03-11 00:10:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8dows/going_to_hr_for_guidance_and_to_make_a_report/,3,2025
1j8dol0,"Need career advice ‚Äî take the job and move, or stay where I'm comfortable?","Hey everyone,

Looking for some advice because I'm really struggling with a big life decision.

A little background: I started my career as a developer making $72k right out of college and stayed in that role for 2 years. After that, I wanted a salary increase and took a remote job that bumped me up to $100k ‚Äî but I was laid off just 3 months in. I live in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, and after that layoff, I spent the next 10 months job hunting ‚Äî and as many of you probably know, the tech market was brutal. Eventually, I took a sales job making around $74k just to have an income.

Problem is, that sales job has no career path. It's a dead-end job, and honestly, I hate it. I‚Äôve been there for about 1 year and 3 months now. So at this point, it‚Äôs been 2 years and 1 month since I‚Äôve worked in my desired career field.

Recently though, through a recommendation from a friend, I got an interview for a¬†**System Administrator**¬†role with a DoD contractor ‚Äî which I didn‚Äôt expect to get past round one ‚Äî but I made it through both rounds and now I have an offer. It‚Äôs a mid-level position (even though I‚Äôve never officially held a mid-level title before), and it would get me back on track with my career. Salary is $120k ‚Äî which is a huge jump from what I‚Äôm making now.

The other piece of this is that¬†**System Admin roles are really hard to find in the Raleigh area**. But in Maryland and the DC area, there are a lot more opportunities, so this could set me up for future growth too.

But here's where it gets complicated:

* The job is in Maryland, about 6 hours from where I live now.
* My wife would have to quit her software dev job (she makes $80k) to move with me.
* We'd be moving to the DC area, so I think she'd find a new job eventually, but there‚Äôs no guarantee.
* Housing would be cheaper ‚Äî we'd go from paying $1,700 + utilities to $1,200¬†*total*¬†(utilities included), but it would be a much smaller place (from 3 bed/1 bath to 2 bed/1 bath, living in someone‚Äôs basement).
* I have about $70k in debt (credit cards and student loans, combined with my wife's), plus $30k left on a car loan. With this job, I could finally start paying that off more aggressively.
* **We also want to have kids in a few years**, and not having family nearby would make that really hard. All of our family is here, and being 6 hours away would make it tough, especially during those first 1‚Äì3 years of raising a kid.

Also, my wife is supporting whatever decision I make, but I can tell she‚Äôs genuinely happy where we are now. I know she would be sad to leave, even though she‚Äôd never say it.

On top of that, moving terrifies me. I was honestly kind of hoping I¬†*wouldn't*¬†get the job so I wouldn‚Äôt have to make this decision. But now that I have it, I‚Äôm torn between taking an amazing opportunity and leaving everything and everyone I know ‚Äî or staying comfortable but stuck.

Some other context:

* My best friend says I‚Äôd be an idiot not to take it.
* My family says they‚Äôll support me either way, but I‚Äôll miss them a lot, and they‚Äôre getting older.
* I‚Äôm still waiting to hear back if they would let me work remotely ‚Äî but from what I‚Äôve gathered, that‚Äôs unlikely. I‚Äôll know within 24 hours.

I feel like¬†*not*¬†taking this job would be a huge mistake career-wise. But the fear and uncertainty of moving away is eating me up. I also worry about my wife having to quit her job when she‚Äôs happy where we are.

If anyone has been in a similar situation ‚Äî or just has some perspective ‚Äî I would appreciate it so much.

I guess the other thing I‚Äôm considering is the trade off with compensation.

1j8d5f3,Is my mom‚Äôs former coworker overstepping by still reaching out to her even tho she‚Äôs retired now?,"

I‚Äôll start with saying that my mom is clearly a grown adult capable of making her own decisions but figured I‚Äôd ask others to see if they agree with me. My mom was at the same company for ~ 30 yrs and she retired about 2 weeks ago. Last yr, she was assigned to train this new coworker and they ended up becoming friends. This coworker seems to be dependent on my mom for help & comfortable enough to ask her. Out of the whole time I‚Äôve seen my mom work remotely, I‚Äôve never seen her coworkers reach out to her as much as this new one. My mom likes her but she‚Äôs even pointed out that this coworker just calls whenever she feels & doesn‚Äôt give notice. 

My mom had a reputation at the job for being ‚Äútoo nice‚Äù and my mom told this coworker that she can still call her for help once she‚Äôs retired. They‚Äôve literally been on the phone for maybe an hour already & again I get my mom tolerates it but‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be okay with this if I was in her position. If she slowed down her workflow while she was employed & now she‚Äôs still doing this as a retiree, I don‚Äôt get how she‚Äôs okay with this. If it was me, I would‚Äôve shut it down a lot sooner but clearly in a respectful way.

I‚Äôve worked at 3 law firms. Always overworked and underpaid. High levels of stress, strict deadlines, asshole clients. I feel so unfulfilled in my work.

The current firm I work at is a disaster. People cry at their desks daily. Several have had nervous breakdowns. People are quitting left and right. The workload is intense and upper management simply doesn‚Äôt care about providing us with resources.

I guess I‚Äôm venting, but I‚Äôm stuck. Where do I even go from here? I feel like I‚Äôve wasted 10 years when I could have done something more. My bachelors is in psychology, but I don‚Äôt have any interest in pursuing anything in that field.

1j8ctll,Dealing with a bad manager . Should I quit ASAP?,"
I‚Äôm currently working at a startup where the rules are clear, but my manager is incredibly difficult. I was hired as a manager, but my role doesn‚Äôt reflect that at all. While I acknowledge that there are skills I could improve on, I feel like he deliberately withholds information and never gives me a real opportunity to lead. He seems insecure when a team member takes charge on a call, often interrupting with unnecessary questions‚Äîalmost as if he finds it irritating when someone else takes the lead.

What‚Äôs even more frustrating is that he won‚Äôt let me communicate with my counterparts at external companies. He hired me as a manager, yet he refuses to fully hand over responsibilities, holding onto at least 40% of the work. It almost feels like he‚Äôs trying to make me feel irrelevant so that whenever a question arises, he‚Äôs the one answering it. This company has around 140 people, yet I‚Äôve never been copied on an email with his manager. He even asks me for information and then relays it to his manager without including me in the conversation. It‚Äôs just bizarre.

Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt my first experience with a startup, so I regret not learning my lesson sooner. I‚Äôve only been here for three months, but I already know I don‚Äôt want to stay. I‚Äôve applied to Columbia Business School part time program, and if I get in, I‚Äôll be looking for another job.

What do you think‚Äîshould I stay for a year to avoid a short stint on my r√©sum√©, or should I start looking for a new job as soon as I get into Columbia, given that the MBA will open up better opportunities?

1j8ciwk,Im worried about getting a career in the future and i feel like i need guidance,"Im 16 and soon im gonna have to really pick what i want to do after highschool and i just feel lost. I dont have any major aspirations, im good with making a solid $50,000-60,000 because i know i wont struggle off of that salary and ill have the ability to save. 

I was thinking of either becoming an electrician or a forensic technician. Im worried about going into college because even though i know ill qualify for financial aid, im pretty sure i would still have to take out loans and i dont want to go into any debt. I dont want to start that knowing ill struggle to pay it off. Im okay with doing community college and transferring if thats a better option, but i dont know too much about it. Or really anything with college. 

If i were to do forensics, id have to get a bachelor‚Äôs in forensic science and have some intern experience, which i assume id be able to figure during my college years. Im really just worried about being able to find a job with that and about going into debt. Would it be crazy to do online school and try to work while going to school if i do need to pay? I would be able to live with my mom no problem, so i wouldnt need to worry about bills as long as im going to school/working. And by work i mean retail

My other option would be going into trades. I think this would be safer because you can get an apprenticeship with a union or go through a training program and then join a union and make decent money. Im just unsure because if this doesnt work out long term for whatever reason, i wouldnt have transferrable skills or a degree. Would it be wrong to try that first and if it doesnt work out for me and i realize i want a different path to go to community college? I think i could do well if i learn the skills needed, and with a union i would make decent money and have fine hours. Another thing is that im female, and im worried a little about workplace sexism, but i think id be fine. 

Would it be a bad idea to try trades and go to college online at the same time if i realize that it isnt for me? My sister took two years as a gap and is currently working service while attending school online, and she had pretty bad grades, she had to graduate highschool through summer school. So i feel like its possible. Im just unsure on whats realistic. 

I think even if i realize that trades are for me id still get a degree down the line, but in something i like, like history. Just to have you know?

1j8brik,Torn Between Two Career Paths ‚Äì Need Help Deciding,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 22 years old and at a bit of a crossroads in life, with two very different career paths in front of me. I have an undergraduate degree in real estate, and I also hold a U.S. passport (I‚Äôm from Ireland). I‚Äôm hoping to get some perspectives from people who may have experience in either of these areas.

Option 1: Become a Firefighter in the U.S. (Possibly New York) & Do Real Estate on the Side
I‚Äôm thinking of moving to the U.S. and joining a fire department, possibly in New York, where I could work a 24/72 schedule (24 hours on, 72 hours off). This would give me a lot of free time to also work part-time in real estate using my degree.
The idea is to work as a firefighter for 20 years, saving money and building a decent financial cushion. After 20 years, I could return to Ireland, where my uncle has a farm he‚Äôs promised to me (80 acres of grazing land and 80 acres of high-quality land). By then, I should be set up financially and could live a comfortable life without needing to work full-time.
The major benefits here are stability, the ability to save, and the opportunity to build a life back in Ireland, close to family, with a beautiful farm.
Option 2: Become an Airline Pilot (US or Ireland)
The second option is to become an airline pilot. I‚Äôm willing to go through the expensive and time-consuming training process to build hours and eventually work as a commercial pilot. After a few years of hard work, I could eventually work part-time in my 40s, potentially with a good amount of seniority.
I‚Äôd either stay in the U.S. or, in the longer term, commute from Ireland to the U.S. for work. The downside is that I may miss out on the farm, and the initial years would be tough with low pay as I build up my hours and experience.
Things to Consider:
I have the U.S. passport, so the visa/work situation wouldn‚Äôt be an issue for the firefighter option.
I‚Äôm really torn about whether I should take the stable, somewhat more predictable firefighter path with the farm in the end, or whether the high-potential, high-risk airline pilot route is worth the sacrifice.
The farm could offer a comfortable, peaceful lifestyle in Ireland, while the airline pilot job could bring a lot of adventure, but potentially at the cost of that farm and time spent with family.

1j8ai64,"2 weeks notice given today, want to WFH due to commute but boss won‚Äôt let me","
Hi all. I just quit my first corporate job by putting in my two weeks notice. I am entering into a completely different industry and my training starts in a couple weeks. 5 people have quit since I started this job and not one was allowed to do a two weeks notice. 

I offered when I met with my boss today to do a two weeks notice to be nice and he said he would let me know. We are a hybrid 3 days in office environment. 

He called me back and asked me to come into the office this entire week and work and I said I would. I have a two hour commute to the office from my house. 

Is it horrible if I just go in the office tomorrow and say I‚Äôm happy to help with transitions but due to the commute I would like to work the rest of the week from home? 

This is frustrating because he has never made other employees work a two weeks notice since I started besides me. He also lets his favorite employees work from home for minuscule reasons majority of the time so I am not sure why he is making me do a four hour commute every day for my last week of work. 

Please let me know more experienced people what to do. I am nonconfrontational and a woman so I‚Äôm not sure if this is a ridiculous ask on my end or if he‚Äôs just taking advantage of me. All the other people who quit were men so idk if I need to stand my ground more. He has been a horrible boss and a constant dread every day, but of course I‚Äôm not going to tell him or HR that and I tried to leave on good terms. But I also think it‚Äôs ridiculous that I have to come into the office for this.

I also work in Sales and spend most of my time cold calling so I‚Äôm not exactly sure what he is trying to get me to do because there‚Äôs not much to ‚Äútransition‚Äù that would require me to come in office for three days this week.


Should I go into the office tomorrow and then ask to work from home for the rest of the week? ",ModeMysterious1519,4,0.5400000214576721,218,1741643449,2025-03-10 21:50:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j8ai64/2_weeks_notice_given_today_want_to_wfh_due_to/,3,2025

During my first job I was working quite alot during the weekends in the trades. And I'm thinking about quiting my job and starting my own company. Probably electrician. I have some knowledge about electirc but I'm missing some experinace. 
What would be the easiest way to to this without losing a good income at the begining.

1j89d5b,Dealing with a bad manager . Should I quit ASAP?,"I‚Äôm currently working at a startup where the rules are clear, but my manager is incredibly difficult. I was hired as a manager, but my role doesn‚Äôt reflect that at all. While I acknowledge that there are skills I could improve on, I feel like he deliberately withholds information and never gives me a real opportunity to lead. He seems insecure when a team member takes charge on a call, often interrupting with unnecessary questions‚Äîalmost as if he finds it irritating when someone else takes the lead.

What‚Äôs even more frustrating is that he won‚Äôt let me communicate with my counterparts at external companies. He hired me as a manager, yet he refuses to fully hand over responsibilities, holding onto at least 40% of the work. It almost feels like he‚Äôs trying to make me feel irrelevant so that whenever a question arises, he‚Äôs the one answering it. This company has around 140 people, yet I‚Äôve never been copied on an email with his manager. He even asks me for information and then relays it to his manager without including me in the conversation. It‚Äôs just bizarre.

1j87axm,Should I take the role with more responsibility or stay where I am?,"I will try to keep this as short as possible - 

I work for a PBC in a small county, about 50k residents. I was approached by the current CEO a couple of weeks ago asking if I would be interested in taking his position when he retires. I don't know when that would be, but he I assume in the next 2ish years or so. 

I don't know how much it matters but I am in my late 30's I have a 10 year old. The reason I mention this is because I value my time with my child, though they are starting to want to spend more time doing things outside of hanging out with me. 

I am looking for advice because the current CEO is hard to work with. They are very unpredictable which makes me uncomfortable. Sometimes they are in a great mood and I am greeting with a ""good morning!"" and sometimes they are miserable and make everyone else in the office pay for it. They are constantly sitting at their desk, calling one of the 3 of us that work in the office on the phone and asking us to get up and go into their office to talk about something rather than getting up or simply discussing over the phone. They can't create their own presentations or even click through their presentation during meetings, they always ask someone else to do it. I could go on and on and on about the terrible things they do and how terrible it would be to work along side them for an undetermined amount of time. 

On the other side, they do have a bit of knowledge that I could learn from and have been successful in their role over the past 10 years.

I am worried that I could not handle working even closer with them over the next couple of years while they ""teach"" me their ways. I use """" because I don't think it will be so much learning as it will be barking orders and doing grunt work they don't want to do rather than the mentor/mentee relationship I would prefer... 

And I am also worried that if I were able to make it through that, would I be able to be as energized as they are in the role or would I constantly be compared to what they did during their time.

Are these normal worries? Should I suck it up now and go for it, or say no and stay where I am?

1j8706l,Career Advice/Insight,"TL;DR:

28(m), Bachelor‚Äôs in Science (Paralegal). Worked since 16. Tried multiple jobs‚Äîhated most. Courts/DA office were disappointing. Now in insurance, underpaid, stuck, and bored. Considering trade school (cars/electric). Want to be my own boss. Am I overthinking, or is it time for a change?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
I‚Äôve been working since I was 16. Now at 28, with a Bachelor of Science and a paralegal concentration, I find myself questioning where I truly belong career-wise.

For nearly five years, I worked my way up in McDonald‚Äôs to Assistant GM. But as much as I appreciated the experience, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to do that forever. I left to go back to college after taking 1.5 years off to battle cancer (2020-2021). While taking courses, I experimented with different jobs‚Äîbanking, car sales, fast food again, even DoorDash‚Äîbut none of them felt right. Most lasted about six months before frustration set in.

In 2023, I landed a job at the courthouse and thought I had finally found my path. The work was interesting at first, but the politics drained me. After 1 year and 7 months, I transitioned to the District Attorney‚Äôs office, expecting something more fulfilling post-graduation. Instead, I found myself stuck in monotonous data entry with no real challenges or change in toxic environments.

Now, in 2025, I‚Äôm working in insurance administration. One month in, I‚Äôm already feeling unfulfilled. I‚Äôm performing well, but I can‚Äôt move up for a year, I‚Äôm making $8 less than before, and I‚Äôm commuting 28 miles in heavy traffic.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: I‚Äôm an analytical thinker, I love problem-solving, and I succeed at almost anything I apply myself to. But I‚Äôm realizing that office jobs might not be for me. I‚Äôve been reconsidering trade school‚Äîperhaps working on cars or becoming an electrician. Funny enough, my dad is in the trades, and while we don‚Äôt have the best relationship, I wonder if I‚Äôve been avoiding it just to be different from him. Maybe I‚Äôm more like him than I thought?

I also love the idea of being my own boss one day. I want work that‚Äôs hands-on, challenging, and rewarding. But am I being unreasonable? Should I just stick it out? Or is it time to take a risk and finally go after something different?

Anyone else feeling the same way?

1j8704m,"Canada, 2 YoE, No Interviews in 10 months: I am exploring my options to stay relevant in a fast-changing career and I had some career-shifting questions from professionals in the field today.","It's been 10 months and I have had no luck finding work. 

Very very quickly, my background...you can skip to the end for my actual questions, but you can use this as reference. 

**Academic Bkg:** I live in Ontario, Canada. B. Eng in Electronics Systems Engineering. It was a very practical program - we had at least 1 engineering project every semester, sometimes multiple, amounting to 10 total. 

**Co-ops/Paid Internships**: Three in total. One at BlackBerry-QNX and One at Ciena. One was in a startup. All 3 were in the realm of high-level SWE. This taught me everything in my toolbox which landed me my jobs after grad. 

**Professional Experience:** First job, was in Data engineering - they provided all the training material and were patient, but got laid off due to lack of work. My second job was at a very famous Canadian company working for their automation team. At the end of probation, they terminated me due to lack of skill. Total YoE: 2 Years (1.5 + .5, respectively). 

**First 8 months:** I tried to focus on SWE fields, such as DevOps, and upskilling, but not doing the certs since my other SWE friends told me that just having it on your resume is a strong bait, but you will have to prove yourself in the interview. Just 1 phone screen. 

**Last 2 Months** Three of my friends who left their respective careers and became Data analysts talked to me and advised me to strongly consider DA or BA because it's got an easy barrier to entry and they all have stable jobs, so I took a big course, did a few personal projects, put on my resume and started applying. Not a single peep, just recruiters hopping on calls just to get my details and ghosting me immediately after I tell them I am pivoting to DA/BA. 

**Now**: I'm exploring my options. I am in a capable spot to pursue a master's and I want to see what's the best course of action for moving forward. 

______

1.	How is the job market for entry levels ? 

3. There can be master's degrees in CS or EE that would be a waste of money and time. Instead, what are the most effective CS and EE master's that are worth it ? 

2.	Will a master‚Äôs level the playing field for me ? 

3. If I go for a master's, will I be in competition with those that are 5+ YoE, or will it be more my level of exp?

1j86y1t,Being subtly excluded at work by a group of people women. How can I handle this strategically and gracefully?,"

I recently started as a contingent worker at a FAANG company on their communications team. My manager seemed welcoming at first, and I was excited to contribute.

On my second day, I learned I had a coworker with the same title but different scope who started a week before me. I immediately sensed she wasn‚Äôt thrilled to have me there. She helped me get set up but seemed competitive, quick to position herself as the expert, and eager to highlight everything she did for me to our boss. She goes out of her way to build strong social ties with the team, and my boss loves her‚Äîconstantly referencing her work in meetings, including our 1:1s.

At first, my onboarding involved shadowing meetings and reviewing docs. I was mainly listening and absorbing, but my boss started making passive-aggressive comments about me ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù or ‚Äúthinking this is a fashion show‚Äù when I started engaging more. She also downplays my role compared to my coworker‚Äôs. When I asked about shadowing opportunities or projects to help with, she shut them down with a smile, saying to focus on docs and that things would come ‚Äúeventually.‚Äù

Meanwhile, my coworker has already been working on key projects, meeting with team members, and helping with the most important deliverable (an All Hands deck). I expressed interest in contributing (since writing is my strength), but my boss shut that down while praising my coworker‚Äôs graphic design skills.

When I asked about meeting my boss‚Äôs counterpart‚Äîwho I‚Äôm supposed to support while she‚Äôs on leave‚ÄîI was told she had ‚Äúwedding drama‚Äù and my boss would check in first. She never followed up.

By the end of last week, my coworker randomly scheduled a meeting with me, asking detailed questions about how I manage my time, my role focus, and my thoughts on documents. She gave vague answers when I asked her the same. Later, in our joint onboarding meeting with our boss, she asked clear questions about her role and scope, while my boss gave me vague, noncommittal responses: ‚Äúeventually‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúat some point‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre ramped up.‚Äù She promised a doc outlining our responsibilities but hasn‚Äôt followed up.

This week, things escalated:
	‚Ä¢	A meeting I was supposed to shadow was rescheduled‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt invited. I noticed it on my coworker‚Äôs calendar and asked if I could join. My boss said, ‚ÄúThat would be great!‚Äù‚Äîbut when I arrived, the invite was removed. My coworker was confused too, so she let me join via her Zoom.
	‚Ä¢	After that, everyone‚Äôs calendars went private.
	‚Ä¢	The weekly onboarding doc my coworker and I were supposed to follow wasn‚Äôt even viewed by her.
	‚Ä¢	I asked my boss where to find a document for the day‚Äôs deep dive. She ignored me, but two team members started discussing it publicly in chat instead.

To my face, they are seemingly inclusive, but I feel like I‚Äôm being sidelined. My coworker has clearly aligned herself with my boss, and I‚Äôm being given different (less meaningful) tasks.

The problem? I just relocated for this job, and I need this income. As a contingent worker, I‚Äôm unsure what leverage I have and whether this situation is salvageable.

Has anyone been in a similar position? How do you handle subtle exclusion in a new role‚Äîespecially as a contractor?

It's been like this for 4 months and it just feels like it's getting worst and worst. My manager isn't really involved in much of my stuff and it seems like everytime I ask for help it just always lands back on me to figure stuff out.

1j867mk,Advice Needed on Negotiating a Raise for Expanded Program Manager Role,"Hi everyone,

I recently transitioned from a technical role into management at my company, and I‚Äôd appreciate some advice on what percentage raise to request given my expanded responsibilities.

Background:
	‚Ä¢	I began my career at my company in a technical role before moving into a project management position.
	‚Ä¢	Recently, I was promoted to a Program Manager role, which came with significantly increased responsibilities. I now oversee a team of technicians whose primary job‚Äîmaking up about 90‚Äì95% of their work‚Äîis switching out sharps containers at various hospitals. While the technicians handle daily inventory at these sites, I provide oversight, guidance, and step in with administrative tasks when shortages occur and decisions need to be made about resource allocation. Most of what I do is making sure my technicians have what they need to succeed and stepping in when they don‚Äôt. I also handle a lot of requests, concerns, and questions that come from multiple customer contacts at these hospitals.
	‚Ä¢	As part of my promotion, I played a key role in securing a major contract. I‚Äôm not supposed to know this, but I later learned that my promotion was a condition for that contract, meaning the company specifically arranged for me to manage the program prior to negotiating the promotion with me.
	‚Ä¢	My new compensation package included a base salary increase plus a bonus plan tied to performance targets. However, due to program-specific financial hardships‚Äîwhich were not my fault and which my boss fully understands‚ÄîI ended up receiving only about half of the expected bonus. An automatic raise bumped my base salary slightly, but it still doesn‚Äôt reflect the full scope of my expanded responsibilities.

My Question:
Given these factors, do you think asking for a 10‚Äì15% raise on my current base salary is reasonable, or should I consider pushing for a higher percentage? Any advice on how best to approach this negotiation would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

P.S. My current base salary is between $70,000-$75,000 if that makes a difference.

- Doesn't have the same insane pace and pressures of teaching a class of 30 students all day
- is appropriate for a physics graduate with a very strong academic history who graduated 10 years ago. Been in work since then and had lots of leadership experience

Any advice or suggestions on what to do? I'm currently thinking of being an actuarial or data analysis but my coding is very basic (though willing to learn) and not sure if this is too much of a barrier. Thinking of leaving for Sept 2026 so got plenty of time to upskill for the right role.

1j85k09,Looking for Advice on my Longterm Career Path,"Hey everyone. Just looking for some feedback on my situation. I'm a 30yr old guy, currently an Operations Manager with a delivery contractor earning a salary around 100k. Been with the company for about six years, and with the amount of autonomy I have it's really a dream job. But, the owner is rather old, and I don't see him doing this another 20 years. So I want to make some proactive moves as to not be left out to dry if he ever retires. Ever since I graduated college, I've only ever been in this field of delivery logistics. My degree is in creative writing though, which I know doesn't account for much. I worked my up from driver to where I am now, and I feel lucky to have made it this far on merit and hard work. 

But, I have no official degree or credentials in the field I'm in. And my job is rather all encompassing; I pretty much run the day to day operation as well as handle the hiring, on top of multiple other duties. My worry is ending up at 45 with all this experience that doesn't really sell my skillset on paper. I don't want to slide down the ladder back to driving after earning where I'm at currently. I enjoy the field of logistics and business management, and if I have to go back to school or take some courses I will to better ensure a stable career. So I'm all ears for those who have been in similar situations. Any feedback would be appreciated.

1j84yv7,Asked to speak up against the owner of my department for political views. What do I do?,"I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. A little backstory: my department head is a through and through trump supporter (plumbing trade, not uncommon in this line of work). He has a wall of trump memes within the office and they have been getting progressively worse. 

I am a minority (filipino if that matters) and the only one in my department of 5. My supervisor asked a coworker to broach the subject with me so that I talk directly with my supervisor in opposition of the wall.

I explained to my coworker why I will not speak up about it.
1. My reviews since I have been hired 3 years ago have been nothing but negative, whether those are racially motivated, I have no proof. I feel like it would be a super easy reason to let me go.

2. Getting rid of the wall will not get rid of the problem, it's not like this person is going to lose their job.

3. I want it to be a warning to anyone else that might join up after me, I do not want to mask that they are walking into a potentially bad situation.

4. It doesn't seem to be coming from a place of concern. It feels strictly more business since my productivity is bad (according to my review at least). They are ultimately wanting to get more work out of me.

What should I do? Any kind of report to anything outside the company feels like putting a target on my back. I don't want to tell my supervisor the reasons because it could get back to the department owner. I know I told a coworker but if the reasons actually get out, I know who did it since they are going to be the only one I will tell. This coworker has always been transparent with me (ex military seems to be a big driving force). I do plan on moving onto a different job but with the current affairs of the country, may take some time. I don't need arguments on which side is right or wrong, this is strictly for figuring out how to best navigate knowing we are on different sides.

1j84vpk,"HELP! 26F returning to college, need advice on work/school structure.","I am 26 years old and never finished college. My work experience is about 70% billing, AR, payroll and 30% serving and bartending. I also have about 3 yrs experience nannying and babysitting. I've decided to pursue computer science (leaning towards software engineering but also considering data analytics) and I'd like advice on the potential ways to structure my schedule and energy being a full-time student that also needs to support myself financially.

In regards to my billing, AR, payroll experience, I started off at in the billing department of a maintenance company where I created quotes and invoices, but also had a blended role. I moved on to a residential and commercial security systems company and essentially became the accounting clerk for the controller. About 2 months before I left had been promoted to billing manager. I also kept track of all employees timesheets, rectifying mistakes, ensuring absences and time-off were approved and/or accurate and preparing everything for bi-weekly payroll.

In changing my mind to pursue computer science, and wanting to do school full-time, I wonder if I should stay in accounting or pivot to a source of income that is doesn't have me as stressed, sedentary and staring at a computer screen like I know I will be doing a lot during school and for the years to come. I also wonder if it's better to find a job at night so I can do school during the day wherein I feel I'd be most attentive and productive?

**Idea #1: Maybe I should become a full-time nanny for a family that needs after-school care (so like 3-4PM to 10-11 PM) and then pick up 2 serving/bartending shifts on the weekends. This way I can do school during the day Mon-Fri. I feel those jobs will keep me active although they may not be as lucrative as finding another job as a billing manager elsewhere. Cons would be the inconsistency with my resume and these jobs not being as ""professional"". Pros are that they are active, non-sedentary and will force me to interact with others during schooling.**

**Idea #2: Find another billing manager job that pays better with a regular 8-4 or 9-5 schedule and a program that offers nighttime and/or weekend classes. Cons: I'd be sitting down, staring at a screen basically everyday for most of the day with this type of job and trying to get a comp sci degree at the same time and I think being a billing manager on top of school would be more stressful than a nanny and bartender. Pros: Better for my resume, more lucrative and stable of an income.**

I graduated a couple of years ago with a bachelors in pharm science, and I'm currently finishing an MBA with a conferral expected in the coming weeks.  I'm at the end of a one year contract doing administrative QA work for a mid-sized biotechnology company at the moment.   The job market is not looking great (and neither are my prospects at the moment), and the higher ups at the company I am contracting for have not expressed interest in converting me to FTE, but budgeted to keep me on for ***another entire year*** as a temp so I can continue managing some vital functions (üòë). 

My supervisor has fought for me to have FTE here, but she suggests that if I decide to stay I should approach my temp agency and negotiate a rate increase that matches the value I bring and the work I put in.  

I'm currently making 29/hr, and after some research I've observed that the industry average is between 35-45 for people around my age, with my experience, and with similar qualifications.  Is it crazy to ask rate within that range if they are open to negotiate a new contract? I can't help but feel cheated comparing what I make to industry standards.  

Those who have gone through similar contract negotiations, how did you approach it? I'm still pretty early in my career, so I haven't had to deal with this before.  I don't currently have any other offers, and I am not completely sure how much leverage I'd have if they are even open to talking to me about a pay increase.  Any advice is much appreciated!

1j82lcx,The Biggest Issues Facing Today‚Äôs Job Market And How To Overcome Them,"**How Job Seekers Can Thrive in a Tough Market**

With the job market cooling, competition intensifying, and skills demands shifting rapidly, landing a good role in 2025 requires more than a polished resume. As hiring slows and employers grow pickier, job seekers must adapt strategically to stand out. Here‚Äôs a roadmap to enhance your odds of success in this challenging landscape.



In a world where technology is rewriting the rules, upskilling is non-negotiable. Employers are clamoring for talent fluent in high-growth areas like artificial intelligence, data analysis, and cybersecurity, fields where demand outstrips supply.¬†



Don‚Äôt have a tech background? No problem. Platforms like Coursera or Codecademy offer beginner-friendly courses in Python or cloud computing, while certifications from Google or AWS can add instant credibility. Pair these with timeless soft skills like adaptability and communication, and you‚Äôve got a winning combination.¬†¬†¬†



**Craft Applications That Cut Through the Noise**



Generic applications drown in today‚Äôs flood of resumes. To rise above, tailor everything. On your resume, weave in keywords from the job posting.

Quantifying your wins by writing ‚Äúboosted efficiency by 20%‚Äù beats vague responsibilities. Your cover letter? Make it a story.¬† Research the company‚Äôs recent moves such as a new product launch, and show how you‚Äôd add value. It‚Äôs not about volume. Submitting ten or so customized applications a week trumps mass spamming.¬†¬†¬†



In a tight market, build your network deliberately. On LinkedIn, engage with recruiters and industry leaders by commenting on their posts. Reach out informally, too. Ask a former colleague or alum for a quick chat about industry trends, not just openings. Aim for 1-2 hours or more¬† of networking weekly.

1j81x4x,Job Transition Timing,"Hey there, 

A bit of a complex situation but I wanted to get the feedback of the group here. I have been working for state government since 2018 and have transitioned through a couple of positions. I'm pension-eligible once I hit my 10-year mark in 2028. 

At my current agency, I moved quickly from one position (with a micro-manager boss) into another that was better suited for me with a good boss. This took a bit of maneuvering, including involving leadership to support but ultimately required me to move down by one grade. HR would not budge, but my supervisor assured me he would look into reclassifying the role later on. 

Effective in April, I will have been in my current role for one year. Meanwhile, I've had a local government Executive Director role looming on the sidelines - with the potential for a $24k pay increase should I be offered the position. Downside of the job is that it is fully federally funded. They have spent the last year trying to get me into this role (it was one of the positions I was considered for when I initially moved over into my current agency). 

So my questions are: 
1) Do I use a potential job offer as leverage for my salary being increased in my current agency? 
2) Would I totally burn bridges if I leave my current role after only 1 year and a few months?
3) Should I take the local govt position due to the pay increase even though it may be much more disorganized? 

Just trying to think through possible scenarios. I appreciate any advice. ",Guilty-Sell-4035,1,1.0,0,1741622191,2025-03-10 15:56:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j81x4x/job_transition_timing/,3,2025
1j81j2l,My first career path failed me. I want opinions on my other options.,"20F. I'm feeling conflicted over my career options. For some back story, I went to a 2 year specialty trade school but came out of it feeling lost and utterly unprepared. I feel like I've lost 2 years of my life and around $40k towards a career I feel unqualified to pursue, but that's besides the point. I'm trying to pick myself back up and choose a career I am passionate about. My current job is fine and my coworkers are nice, but its not a field I really care for. As of right now, my two options are this: 

Option 1) I have multiple years of customer service job experience, so I was thinking being a ticket/ gate agent for a major airline would be fun. Not to mention the flight benefits. Over the last 4~ months I've done multiple applications, which were promptly denied, and 1 interview which was also denied. I don't mind continuing to apply and try my best, but I don't want to be stuck at my current job for years and years just waiting for an airline to finally hire me. 
Option 2) Return to college and pursue baking/ pastry arts. I'd go to a community college this time, so as not to spend a fortune again. (But should I really spend money on another degree or go with option 1 and save up?) There's plenty of baking job availability out there, whereas my original career path was highly competitive with scarce openings. If I go this route, I'd want to start asap (fall 2025) so I don't waste any more time. But is this too soon to really give the airline career time to have a chance?

Both of these options are pretty different, but theyre both jobs I believe I'd like. I understand that, in the end, this will be my decision alone. I'd still appreciate any advice.

I went to the local state college in 2017 for Biology with a minor in Chemistry thinking that I wanted to be a doctor. Shadowed a neurosurgeon a little bit and volunteered all up until Covid hit. Once COVID hit lab jobs and hospitals were not allowing in anyone besides the medical students. I got a job at a an ‚ÄúEssential Business‚Äù bring a Repair Automotive Shop to support myself while still completing school. There I would do a lot of administrative stuff for two years until Dec 2021 when I graduated college with honors. In the Summer of 2022 I got an internship at UCLA for computational medicine after teaching myself a little Python and I figured that the experience wouldn‚Äôt hurt. Granted this whole time I do not know what I wanted to do with my life but I just kept trying to move forward. When I got back from UCLA, the fall of 2022, I did not need to work from a couple months and was debating traveling abroad. Feeling lost in life I began journaling, meditating, dabbling in mycology, and remaining positive until a job opportunity came my way. I was not looking for a job but a local law firm wanted me to help them with some Data Analysis / evidence for their law firm. So I interviewed and got the job leading to working there from Feb 2023 - present. In the Fall of 2023 I applied to Grad school for bioengineering at one of the top private universities in the country and got in thinking that I needed to do something bigger with my life and the same everyday routine was killing me. Currently I am pursuing my Masters in Bioengineering and still working at the law firm to pay my bills.

Now that the background is done I will say how I am feeling. I feel lost and am reading so much about maybe not being able to find a well paying job after grad school. I am debating to do another post-bachelor computer science program to make myself more marketable. To be honest I am just scared of life and if I am even on the right path or is every path the right path? Meaning that any knowledge gained is not useless because even if it doesn‚Äôt work you know that it doesn‚Äôt work.

I feel like an imposter in this program, everyone else comes from top universities with engineering degrees and here I am from a little known state school just trying my best with a biology degree.

I recognize that I am truly blessed in my life and understand that others have it a lot worse, I‚Äôm just trying to make sense of everything in my brain. Everything seems to be about perspective when comparing yourself to others. I cannot imagine what other people can go through I various countries where kids are forced into a survival state everyday. I am a highly empathetic person and have cried for people because sometimes they do not choose the life they were brought up into. I come from a loving family with a father who never opening discussed his feelings but his actions show immense love for his kids which I did not realize later until now. Also come to the realization that nothing really matters in the long run but that inherently makes everything matter even more. Every sunrise and sunset, every moment with loved ones, every interaction, just everything.

I feel like I should have everything figured out by now but that is not the case. Trying to find motivation to do improve skills outside of work and school is hard. How do I know if I even am on the right path. I have also struggled with perfectionism my whole life and only now have recently realized that there is no meaning to the word perfect. I also care too much about what others think.

Hobbies / Diet I have been consistently going to the gym for about 10 years since playing sports in high school. I do not consume sugary drinks often, I drink intermittently and I fast every morning. I grew up playing video games a lot and play every now and again but not as much as I used to. I find the uniqueness of people to be so interesting how everyone‚Äôs lives vary drastically and whit they are as a person. I deleted my social media apps and have a 40 min time limit on TikTok everyday because I like seeing hope core and info I would not seek out otherwise. I have a high admiration for beauty so I have done some photography and been into male fashion. I like cooking a tasting food.

TDLR: I feel like I should have everything figured out but I do not. I am blessed in my life but still feel lost.",steebrawle,1,1.0,2,1741621005,2025-03-10 15:36:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j81gcj/life_advice_would_be_appreciated_feelings_lost/,3,2025
1j81du2,I‚Äôm lost,"I have a decently paying job, with nice coworkers (at least my own team). I did my internship there and they hired me to stay full time and I‚Äôm being given quite some responsibilities and I‚Äôm basically in charge of two relevant processes within our department, one of which takes about 60% of my time and the other 30%, and the remaining 10% is sporadic help on other processes that I‚Äôm familiar with. 

Thing is, I have been here for a year and a half, basically hadn‚Äôt taken any holidays and no days off apart from bank holidays and 2 days during christmas period. 

Even during the time I did ask  for a 10 day holiday due to a trip I had scheduled for 6 months prior, my boss asked me if I could play around with the holidays and squeeze in to do one part of the process because we were very short staffed at the moment and pretty much no one else had the availability to do it. I said yes, although I could very easily have said no. But I didn‚Äôt.
Actually, during Christmas I still logged in for 20 mins to do some quick checks that needed to be done. No hard work or effort, but it still meant being with my head not disconnecting from work during a time where I should have been fully disconnected.

On top of this, I have a very long commute. As in one that makes me spend more than 3h commuting. At least I do this 2 to 3 days a week, never more than that. 

I‚Äôm constantly thinking about work, even on the weekends, anxious about anything that could have gone wrong and that I‚Äôd need to fix the following week. 

Today and tomorrow I‚Äôve taken sick leaves to be able to at least for a day not think on work. I‚Äôve been wanting to quit for a while and search for something else, but I just got my contract extended (basically because I need the security to be able to pay off my expenses), and I‚Äôm scared to not find another job quickly enough to not spend my savings (which are enough to cover my living expenses for 3 months, then I‚Äôm left empty pocketed).

Has anyone been in a similar situation (probably yes)? And what did you do? Whenever I come back from the office between stress + tiredness + commute I dont have energy left to do anything, and I still manage to work out, do house chores, etc, but nothing more",InternationalGuy73,2,1.0,3,1741620832,2025-03-10 15:33:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j81du2/im_lost/,3,2025

With cuts to HUD, hope for a raise is even lower than ever. I have three years experience in a nonprofit developing low income housing. This includes grant writing, vendor management, acquisitions of properties, creating operating and development budgets, developing promotional materials, community outreach, some light construction management, and general office clerical duties. 

This field is very small and it seems like no one is hiring due to all the funding cuts. I really have no idea where to even begin to go from here. I don't want to leave the industry, but it seems like that's the only way I can get out of poverty. I have a BFA in graphic design, but haven't done any graphic design for about 5 years now and am completely out of practice.

1j7y0z9,Leaving 9-5 to Join Family Business? Looking For Advice.,"I was recently offered the opportunity to join my family's small business that has been around for 8 years now. I currently work an 8-5 job that pays well, close to 100K a year and has good benefits. This offer to join the business has me with mixed feelings. I already help them on the side when I have free time and I do enjoy it. Here are my thoughts, looking for any advice!

I have a young family but we are completely debt free in a low cost area if that helps. I also have a good relationship with my family.

**8-5 Job**

Pros

* Strong Job Security
* Good pay
* Benefits
* Enjoy what I do
* No take home work

Cons

* Hate working a structured/stuck schedule of 8-5 (my industry this is basically the normal)
* Long commute (45 min one way)
*  By the time I get home I have about 2 hours with family before putting kids to bed.

  
**Family Business**

Pros

* Enjoy the work.
* Like the idea of being independent with growth based on my own performance.
* Location is extremely close to home (3 min commute one way).
* Business has been growing steady over time.

Cons

* Job security isn't as dependable
* No current benefits (insurance/retirement)
* Pay would be less than I make now but ability to make more based on my own performance.
* If I leave my industry, coming back into it would be really hard.

  
To summarize, I enjoy the family business when I help with it, its a commodity based business. Probably one of the biggest pulls towards joining is the less structured hours and basically no commute, which could equate to more time with family. The less pay starting out (although still able to make by) and no benefits really scare me.",ArcticxFusion17,2,1.0,9,1741611602,2025-03-10 13:00:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7y0z9/leaving_95_to_join_family_business_looking_for/,3,2025

I've currently been at my company for 6 years and during that time, the company has more than tripled in size and the team that I lead has taken on more responsibility in both scale and scope.

I've consistently been rated as a top performer every year

I've been asked to build a stronger bench for succession planning, however, in order to do so, it requires paying market rates for new talent, which is only ~10% less than I am making (I am ~30%-40% less than market)

I've recently been approached by an old colleague to apply for a position at another company which would bring me up to market rates (35% total comp increase) but require moving, which I would prefer not to do, but would consider if necessary.

I have my 2024 performance review with my boss today and would like to push for an outsized pay bump, but am not sure the best way to handle it

I‚Äôm from Asia and have been working remotely as a UI designer for about six months now. My shift is completely flipped to match US hours (10 PM ‚Äì 8 AM GMT+7, sometimes longer), and it‚Äôs really starting to take a toll on me.

* The work hours are exhausting. Somehow, I barely get 2-4 hours of sleep after working and can‚Äôt sleep more than that. No matter what I try, my sleep schedule is completely wrecked, and I feel drained all the time.
* The role keeps expanding beyond UI design. I was hired as a UI designer, but I‚Äôve been asked to handle tasks way outside my scope, like video editing and social media content. It feels like I‚Äôm just doing whatever needs to be done.
* There‚Äôs little room for growth. I don‚Äôt get many opportunities to improve my skills or contribute meaningfully to projects.
* The pay is decent, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth the long-term impact on my health and career development.

I‚Äôm considering resigning in a few weeks to focus on improving my portfolio and finding a better job, but I have a few concerns:

1. My health is deteriorating. The lack of sleep is affecting my concentration, mood, and overall well-being. I‚Äôm constantly exhausted, and I worry about the long-term effects of this schedule.
2. I only have six months of experience and no prior work or internships. Would this be enough to land another role?
3. The job market seems tough. Should I wait until I secure another job before leaving, or is it reasonable to step away given my situation?
4. Would remote experience working directly with an international client be an advantage when applying for new jobs?

I feel like I‚Äôm reaching my limit, but I also don‚Äôt want to make a decision I‚Äôll regret. Would love to hear your thoughts!

1j7wbmy,Want to finish degree but don't know what to major in,"I'm a 34yo woman with a notorious habit of half doing things and my college career is one of them. I want to finish my bachelor's. For my resume, to get better jobs and overall for my self-respect. The problem is that I don't know what to get that degree in. I know that I'm pretty much stuck with it being an online degree that needs to be affordable but I'm unsure about the major. The job market seems extremely shaky right now and I'm not sure if I should go tech, or even if that is something I would even like. And then there's the psychology degree  which I'm actually interested in and engage in personally, but I'm not sure about the career opportunities with that major. I've even considered supply chain management since I'm considering driving trucks for a spell and figured that degree might aid a good segue into the logistics dept of a company I drive for ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Yes, what they say about your 20s going that ***quickly*** is *true*.

I work in online development. Am super lucky/fortunate to be in work and on the salary I'm on - so for that side, I can't really complain!

**My main gripe with the job is that I feel like I'm a bit of a burden to the company, especially with the owner?**

For both my 15th anniversary, was totally overlooked (he normally does do a monthly anniversaries callout). Not even a mention, until HR realised and ran to the shop to get a box of chocolates.

This year, the same thing.

Younger members of the team get shoutouts all the time for their contributions and I'm not - despite me putting in the bulk of the work on key projects.

Should it really matter? 

At the end of the day, I get paid. I'm lucky to have a job where I can just get on with the work. But increasingly I feel like I'm that guy that's ***been here too long*****.**

1j7vla3,Im 27 years old and don't know what to do with my life,"I am a girl of 27 yo, I consider to have a lot of interests but it's hard for me to stick to one.
I like mostly:  music, travelling and writing.
I've always consider mysealf to be an artistic person.

When I was younger (20yo), I started to study english philology in the university but I quit to focus on my music career, I really like singing and performing, I started going to singing classes and music theory the problem is, to have a ""certificate"" in music you have to pay a lot of money and I like to focus on artistic expression (singing,  interpreting) rather than music theory. Music studies focus a lot on music theory.

I was really passionate about music and I like it very much, but everyone tells me its a difficult path,  it's uncertain.  Even thought I continued doing music on my own and with my bf (singing in public, writing songs etc.)

I started working to maintain mysealf and I discovered I tolerate working in tourism (it's what I'm working right now) it's not my passion but it could be good to work as a second option.

Also, I thought abt the idea to work abroad and save money, and figured it out that I don't want to be in a foreign place on my own, in a culture that I don't relate to just to save money and see new places.

My problem is: what can I do? Do a Tousim course and work in that field? Or still going to singing and performing classes to do what I like even thought is uncertain and I won't have a degree? Go travel abroad? Im lost.

I think that when you are in your twenties , or late twenties is so difficult because there's so many options and things to do, everyone tells you that there is a lot of opportunities but it's difficult to focus in one.

I compare mysealf to others that have it clear and I just can't relate, I know I have to decide mysealf but some advices will be welcomed.

1j7uhlg,"Leaving a good workplace with minimal growth for a larger company with better growth and pay, how to approach boss without burning bridges.","TL;DR:  
I received an offer for a contract-to-hire position with a 20% pay increase at a prestigious company in a field I‚Äôm much more interested in. My current job has plateaued in growth, though my coworkers and bosses are great, and they recently purchased training for me unexpectedly. I feel guilty about leaving, especially since this is my first job out of college, but I know the new role offers better long-term prospects. I‚Äôm anxious about how to approach my boss and whether giving a one-month notice would be best‚Äîany advice would be appreciated.  


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the title says I have recently received an offer at a company that pays substantially better.  Specifically the role would be a contract-to-hire position, of which the employer stressed that the goal was to hire.  The pay is substantially better, 20% increase, it is in a field I am much more interested in, and it gets my foot in the door at an extremely well known company in the field.    
  
My current job is in a field I am not super interested in, however, my bosses/coworkers are extremely nice.  I am allowed a hybrid schedule, however, the growth has already plateaued after approximately a year and a half of working at my current company.  3 days ago my current employer randomly offered me to get training for a type of software that we regularly use, and I have already been notified that it was bought.  It is growth, however, this would be the last possible thing I could learn in this job role and I'm not super interested in it.  

  
I feel terrible as all of my coworkers and bosses are extremely nice and accommodating, as well as the fact that my current job is my first job out of college.  Furthermore, the training they had signed me up for was not for another 4 months, so I was shocked when I saw that they purchased it already.  I am anxious about the whole situation, am I making the wrong decision accepting the new job?   How should I go about approaching my current boss about my decision?  I would love to give my current job the courtesy of time to find a replacement if need be, potentially 1 month's notice.  



I don't have anyone to talk to about this with experience in this type of situation.  I would love any advice to approaching this situation and whether or not it is the correct decision for my career.  For reference, I am 22 year old.

I'm obviously a beginner in all of this but something that I noticed while looking at job offers for this field is that most (if not all) require or use Java as the main programming language, which I can understand since as far as I know Python is more useful for AI development while Java is more used since websites use Java and JavaScript.

1- a 3 year contract.

2- a decent pay(about 30% more than my previous job).

3- About 700 estimated hours of OT at 1.5x over 3 years. (Verbal. Not mentioned in the contract)

4- 4% vacation pay.

5- Stat holidays.

6- No rrsp match or health benefits.

As for the job itself, it is a smilar position to what i was doing earlier but  its based on a site 30 mins away from my place, unlike the office-wfh hybrid role I was doing earlier.

I am fine it being on site, my issue is with some terms in the contract.

Firstly, There is a non compete clause which makes me ineligible to work for the client for 1 year after my contract with agency ends. Is this a typical noncompete duration for these kind of jobs? Should I try to negotiate?

Second, there is literally a clause that says I can be terminated anytime without notice if the client is not satisfied with my services.

1j7sstq,A combination of happiness and stress is making me slow at a new job I joined. What are things I can do to get faster or improve focus ?,"I have gone through quite a lot of things in a very short amount of time in the last year or so.

I don't want to go through all the details. Around 3 years ago, my father had a lot of huge loans. In order to pay those, I had to take multiple loans over time. Soon, there was a point when the EMIs crossed my salary and I was not able to support for a few months. The phone used to keep ringing non stop and collection agents would come home.

Additionally, I was in a job where I did not get the promotion that I deserved, and the constant anxiety made it hard to focus too. There was a lot of politics in that particular team and I was put into PIP.

However, problem solving has always been my passion and something that I have been able to do without worrying about other things. I regularly participate in contests and I was able to get a slightly better job quickly in around 2024.

The job was better, but they had lowballed me based on the market situation and the salary was still not enough to pay the EMIs.

Suddenly a whole host of things happened in the last few months.

* An ancestral property got sold, allowing me to close many of my father's loans and some of mine.
* I was able to get a new job at a new level.
* My parents got divorced
* My father had a heart attack, but he recovered.

I now joined a new job in 2025. However, there was no break time in between my previous job and my current job.

Most of the time, I feel such extreme relief and happiness at not being under a huge loan and having EMIs much lower than my salary, at getting a new job and then some stress over the parents' divorce (though I am happy it's amicable), I am finding that I am not able to focus much at work.

My emotions often oscillate from extreme relief to extreme happiness to slight stress, that when I sit at the computer, I am seldom able to focus at work or get to know the new architecture. I was so used to having the huge burden of the loans that I feel very free at closing many of them.

However, I noticed I am working slow and avoiding doing the work. Even if I sit and open the IDE, I soon get distracted and start thinking of other things - either the happiness or the stress. People in my company are starting to notice that I'm slow.

I want to speed up before I get into any trouble. I do want to do well at this job. I want to fix my focus and was wondering if anyone had any tips for this. I just feel a huge flood of relief when I somehow finish the daily status meeting and then just enjoy the relaxation for the rest of the day.

1j7shwt,Have one week to decide on Company Y. What job offer and option would you Commit to and why? - having hard time deciding. Currently working at a small Company (company Y) as a 21 Year Old new grad with ~$93k base comp.,"Hi everyone, I'm having quite a difficult time deciding on a job based on a new offer I recently received. For some background I am 21 and currently in my last semester at a pretty high ranking college and will graduate in a double degree in Data Science + Economics during May of this year. I was offered a job at company Y located in a small California town near my hometown (20 mins commute) few months back and have accepted and have started work there since January to meet their hiring needs despite not having graduated, while taking reduced course load during the semester to balance the work. The decision to accept was heavily driven by the current state of the job market and my idea to build experience and reapply down the line with technical experience (aiming for at least a year worth). Now, company Y is small but great to build technical experience in a low stake environment (assigned to the HR department). This current role as a Systems Analyst requires familiarly with data engineering concepts, SQL, managing and building integrations, and involves low-mid business acumen. Base comp at this position is approx $93k with variable comp determined by performance (+- 5%). Day to day isn't crazily demanding as I oftentimes find myself addressing system related ad-hocs (e.g data pulls), presenting solutions, editing/building SQL statements, and learning this new ETL full-suite platform to prepare for the implementation of a new HR software taking place throughout this year. Being HR, the information being handled isn't necessarily interesting and oftentimes I have trouble staying engaged as a result. Obviously the comforts of home after work is an amazing privilege, but I hope it isn't stunting any career growth or opportunities as I am afraid of growing accustomed to this standard of work this early in my career. My colleagues and the general age group of employees at this company are friendly but at a stage of their careers where they can afford to be complacent in their careers as they should - There isn't necessarily an ambitious landscape at work as it'd be extremely rare to find anyone < 24. However, the quality of workers is great, i.e., the IT analysts that we oftentimes collaborate with are highly skilled and efficient in their respective work. Now working in a place near where I grew up inherently has some perks including the pay as it places me above 90th percentile in the small area, family + friends at close proximity, far lower cost of living (compared to other jobs and my college), and being able to pursue my interests and hobbies outside of work easily. Ideally in the long run I prefer a role that has a balance of business acumen/practical skills and technical. Furthermore, experiencing this in a high growth environment surrounded by ambitious colleagues. It may not sound like I am appreciating this opportunity as much as I probably should or overlooking some factors as I am sure there are people who would snap at this opportunity given the state of the market.



Last week I received an offer from a far larger company (company X: top 3 bank) as an analyst placed in a two year cohort paying full time at $75k. This would be located at the opposite side of the country in a mid sized city outside of Philadelphia. (6 hr flight from my local airport). The city itself isn't very reputable but the company is. The company would needs a decision in a few days.

To help in this decision I created a quick matrix to outline my options and to break down by important variables(DM for pic as it wont allow me here).

Company Z here is another opportunity I am actively chasing that may potentially present an offer in the near future (return offer from previous internship).

It may not sound like I am appreciating my current role as much as I probably should or overlooking some factors as I am sure there are people who would snap at this opportunity given the state of the market.

1j7saj9,A genuine doubt of whether integrating engineering with law is a good idea? (In India),"I'm asking this query as a 17 year old, so please correct me if I'm wrong. Coming from a family of lawyers, subsequently I developed an interest towards law but considering the fact that we are talking about India, my parents are strongly suggesting me to take the engineering path especially data science and cybersecurity which everyone's talking about. The sole purpose of them suggesting this career path is with respect to the pay, everyone's giving their opinion that compared to law, engineering is a much safer and a higher paying job and this made me have a dilemma of whether choosing what i like or choose what's better as a career (for the note, I absolutely don't mind about getting into the tech field).

And I also have a genuine doubt of whether investing 7 years ( 4+3) of my life integrating engineering with law is a good idea?. Is there any scope if I do that and what are they?. Please guide me through as I hope strangers with expertise in this regard may help me without any judgement.

1j7rvhj,Interview Follow Up,"I wanna preface this by noting that I live in a very small town where most things are what they seem to be. It's nothing like living in a big city with the ""rat race"".

Almost 3 weeks ago, I had a county position interview. It went really well. They actually went into detail when explaining the position, they opened the interview by presenting the benefits, etc. It was more of a discussion than anything and it was the most comfortable I've ever felt in an interview.

At the end, I was told that they reach out to applicants whether they decide to proceed or not, and that I'd be hopefully been hearing from them the next week.

It's nearly been 3 weeks now and I haven't heard anything. I did send the HR guy who lead the interview a follow up email, but he hasn't responded. My parents were both hired by the same HR guy at a different organization. My dad said he interviewed multiple times, always sent follow up emails and never heard back. Finally, he called instead of emailing, laid it out that he was still very interested in the position, and got the position. 

Is it too late to give him a call? I figure the positions been filled by now, but I'd like to ask for some feedback on what I can do to improve my chances in the future. I already know I qualify, but I'd like to be a stronger candidate.

They had also mentioned during the interview that they were going through union negotiations, and I know everyone there is super busy due to some restructuring. My current job requires me to occasionally work with one of the guys that interviewed me, so I know things are really busy over there.",Human-Cauliflower-85,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1741585923,2025-03-10 05:52:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7rvhj/interview_follow_up/,3,2025
1j7rfii,make a lot of mistakes at work,"Hello, I am currently in an internship - Work, when I was starting at my workplace - internship, when I made mistakes I did not punish myself so much because I was just starting, however it has been like 4 months and recently I made a different mistake, and I punished myself a lot. I am improving in the process but I always make different mistakes, in my opinion, so when time passes and despite everything I continue making mistakes even if it is something different, I punish myself a lot, because I feel that I am a person who is not good at anything and that is why I continue making mistakes. 

 I am very anxious about making many mistakes since my previous job (which was my first job), I also made mistakes, but unlike this one (current) where they don't say anything to me but rather understand me, (but I feel like they put up with me too much) in the previous one they told me everything directly or indirectly about my mistakes, I didn't scold them but sometimes they were mocking or criticizing my own colleagues, sometimes they were right and sometimes they just went too far and that's it, also someone who I told my concern to, told me that by making mistakes they will see me as a disaster, I will leave a mark of a person who makes pure disasters, well the truth is I would not like to be seen like that.

1j7pqxs,should I go all in on a new career?,"for the past 19 years I worked in telecommunications, in a call centre role. I was recently laid off along with all of my colleagues. I have tried applying to about 10 similar jobs, but I have heard nothing so far back. I was really lucky and was paid very well (60K/year) due to my tenure, but all the jobs I'm applying to pay way less. some of them all the way down to minimum wage. and I'm starting to feel like I can't bring myself to work in a call centre for the rest of my working life ... but I am going to be 42 soon and need to keep working because I am nowhere near retirement yet. so I really need some advice. 

I feel trapped and depressed. I feel like I've had nothing else going for me in life besides my job. No girlfriend, hardly ever see friends, morbidly obese, very red legs (stasis dermititis) and now poor blood flow or possibly nerve damage (carpal tunnel?) in my right arm, getting only 2 or 3 hours of sleep each night, addicted to video games, never learned to drive... and my mom tells me her cancer may be back, this time in her lungs. everyone in my family has been very supportive. but I feel like I need a fresh start. 

I have started exercising and losing weight, so far 28 pounds down. I can't enjoy video games anymore. I feel like I would be spending my time better doing anything else. my family is concerned that I am using too much slimfast and not eating enough. my family tells me I should go to the food bank, but I don't know if they will turn me away because of my income due to my severance. 

I'm seriously considering going back to school to learn how to become a pharmacy technician. it's a full time program so I simply won't be able to work and do it at the same time. meaning I will be putting all my chips on the table and all my eggs in one basket and that's scary. and burning through all my severance and savings to make it happen. 

the practicum requires me to work in a pharmacy setting after I've done all the courses. so that will mean I'll be technically be 'working' (for free). so I won't qualify for EI while I'm doing that (???). once the practicum is over, even though this kind of job is in demand and health care in general is regarded as a growing field, it might take several months before I get hired by a pharmacy, and even then my starting wage will likely be.... minimum wage. the same as if I had just applied to work at mcdonalds. 

now pharmacy technicians do actually make more money ($30-$35 an hour is what I am seeing on some job postings), but that is for people who already have 1 or 2+ years experience. so if I only get minimum wage for 1-2 years then I'll stop hemorrhaging money every month, but I'll still be bleeding out slowly. I don't know how long I can keep that going. 

because I am getting the severance my income is still likely too high to qualify for financial aid (???) will they look at my circumstances at being laid off at all when determining if I will qualify for aid? I don't want to do other programs that take 2 years or more, I don't think I have enough money to be able to pay my ridiculous Vancouver rent for that long. and those programs don't really appeal to me, even if they may come with higher pay. 

is all of this effort going to be worth it? if I go all in on becoming a pharmacy tech (which can get paid more than just a pharmacy assistant) then that could mean I could eventually after a few years earn as much as I was earning before in the call centre. but I would get to directly help people with their health, and work indoors in a respectable job. honest pay for honest work. I think health care is a very resilient and in-demand industry so it would be less likely I would be laid off again (???)  

am I about to make a huge mistake by going all-in on pharmacy tech?",minerlj,1,1.0,0,1741577974,2025-03-10 03:39:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7pqxs/should_i_go_all_in_on_a_new_career/,3,2025
1j7pqg8,Academia VS local govt - help!,"Hey everyone, I need some advice!

I‚Äôm stuck between two job offers and truly don‚Äôt know which to choose.

Right now, I work in academic research‚Äîit‚Äôs flexible, offers international travel, and comes with lots of publication opportunities. But I feel like it‚Äôs the right time to leave since international research is being targeted by the current administration.

Option 1: Academic Project Manager
I was offered a job at an elite academic institution managing global health training projects. It‚Äôs hybrid (only in-office about once a week or less), and the funding comes from internal discretionary sources, not  government grants like in research. The role sounds high-impact, involves travel, and has room for growth into leadership positions like Education/Research Training Director. The pay is okay, and the flexibility means I can work from anywhere, travel, and stay with my boyfriend, which I value a lot. However, I worry about the lack of structure and whether I‚Äôd truly be gaining new skills. The director of the program told
Me that this role has not existed in the past and it is mine to shape into whatever I‚Äôd like. Plus it sounds like they would be supportive with career development.  

Option 2: Local Government Health Manager
This role is in a very rural part of California, managing multiple health improvement programs. It‚Äôs the highest salary I‚Äôve ever been offered, and breaking into government work at a management level could be a great long-term career move. However, I‚Äôd have to move away from my boyfriend (we‚Äôve done long-distance before, and he‚Äôs supportive), leave our current life behind, and relocate to a very conservative area as a gay man. My plan would be to stay for about a year, gain experience, and then try to transition back.

Each job has its pros and cons. The academic role offers flexibility, stability, and international work but may not push me to grow. The government role is more interesting, pays well, and could open doors, but it comes with big personal sacrifices. Plus, with the economy looking uncertain in the future, I‚Äôm not sure which would be more secure long-term.

Any thoughts or advice? I‚Äôd really appreciate different perspectives!",ImpossiblePay8895,1,1.0,0,1741577927,2025-03-10 03:38:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7pqg8/academia_vs_local_govt_help/,3,2025

We were discussing a topic about whether we should inform our client about the limitations of advertising to kids on YouTube.

However, the customer only uses Google Marketing Platform, and at that time, they did not have an account representative.

I noticed that new Google Ads account users have a higher chance of being assigned a Google representative to kick off the project. I organized the resources I had and shared them with the team.¬†

The customer had inquired about this service several times. I was unable to convince my colleagues to present this solution to the client. The manager did not provide a clear reason why we should not have given the answer. We never had a clear conversation about it, and I felt like I was the only one thinking differently from my colleagues. I began to feel demotivated about sourcing more resources or finding alternative ways within the company. This frustration left me feeling disconnected.I know I should just let it go, but after this incident, I can't be excited about working at that company anymore.

1j7ougk,In need of your honest opinions/advice,"Hello everybody, I am a 21 year old living at home working as an apprentice electrician and I feel this job is just not a good fit for me. I have been working as an apprentice for a little over a year now and recently I have been feeling like I cant continue.



While I enjoy some aspects about this job, such as: 

1) The feeling of being proud of your work. For example, when you run a lot of pipe and you take a step back and look at your work. Its like ""damn I just did that."". I feel satisfied and I like that feeling.

2) I like to be on my feet (to an extent) and moving. I feel I get antsy when I'm sitting down for too long

3) There is some sense of comradery in the trade. A brotherhood as they call it.

4) I suspect I have ADHD so this type of hands-on work helps minimize those symptoms 



But there are also plenty of cons that I personally feel:

1) There is a lot of pressure to be ""good enough"" at your job and that constant pressure is personally very stressful

2) Its hard on the body. While it, by far, is not the hardest job you can do physically. It is still pretty physical work. You're lifting, pulling, climbing, bending over, kneeling, and even at times crawling all day. I've only been doing it for a year now and I've started feeling the effects. I cant imagine how it will be in 10, 20 years.

3) Its a very fast, high stakes environment. I find that my brain just shuts down in these situations and I cant think straight. Leading to a number of fuck ups

4) It can be very unstable. Majority of the time you will be moving from jobsite to jobsite, having to adjust to new environments and people quickly

5) Maybe this last reason is stupid but I feel my personality just doesn't fit. I am an introvert and I prefer not to interact with people for extended periods. In this job, you have to. 

  
I would really like a job/career where:

1) Where I feel there is some value to my work. I think I am a very empathetic person and I want to see my work benefit people in some way, even if its small.

2) Low pressure and or slow paced environment. When I say low pressure/slow paced I don't mean I don't want to work hard. I understand at work you need to be productive and I want to work hard but I find it easier to be productive when there's not a million things going on

3) I'm not just sitting all day. I would love to be in a dynamic workplace where I can sit and move around

4) Decent enough pay to live on my own. 

I would love to hear any suggestions or opinions, Thank you for reading!",Bl272412,2,1.0,5,1741574983,2025-03-10 02:49:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7ougk/in_need_of_your_honest_opinionsadvice/,3,2025

Prior to graduating college my experience was almost entirely composed of project based internships and after college I joined a tech startup where I helped build pretty much the entire business end of their company from the ground up working for them for a year and a half then they decided to stiff me on payment for all of my work and terminated me for asking for payment (and as such I am now suing them out of existence). 

I have now been on the job hunt for nearly 6 months without a single bite (except for scammers which I have reported to the FBI because I don't tolerate that nonsense), I've talked to at least 20 different recruiters to put feelers out, I've used indeed, Linkedin, Monster, Glassdoor (which as it turns out is just indeed), Ziprecruiter, The State's unemployment office, and gone down the list of every fortune 500 company regularly, contacted all of my connections, Had at least 3 different people look at and help me rewrite my resume, it seems utterly impossible to find a job in HR without having at least 3 years of experience in the field and with Trump functionally nuking the industry by putting an end to DEI functions and that entire portion of the industry leading to a massive increase in supply and severe decrease in demand for HR professionals.

1j7nhe6,I declined a job offer and they are urging me to reconsider. Should I?,"TL;DR I declined a job offer and now they are trying to convince me to reconsider. Is it a red flag or a sign to revoke my declination?

I am currently working as an executive assistant to the CEO of a national plumbing franchisor, I earn 90k a year and do a 4 day work week (10 hour days) and usually work from home for one of those days, the office is located 15 minutes from my house. Over the Christmas period I was really burnt out and hating my job, it has historically been hostile with high turn over resulting in my taking on a lot of work that was outside my job (accounts, marketing etc) in order to help my boss/keep the company running. Whilst it has been hostile, I do have a good relationship with my boss and have never been the one to cop the ‚Äòwrath‚Äô.  He also lets me do the 4 day week as I am studying my cert 4 in HR, which I am currently a quarter the way through.

I‚Äôve never particularly loved my job and have struggled with not having any work friends like with previous jobs, but it‚Äôs been good enough with the 4 day week so the weeks go by quickly anyway. During the Christmas burn out, I returned to work and decided I had enough and started applying to jobs. I eventually got offered the role of Practice Manager for an accounting firm which focuses on wealth management and self managed super funds, the pay is 95k per year, with review to go to 100k after 6 months

This would be my first time managing people and would be great work experience, however I ended up declining due to the following reasons:

-          It would be 5 days in the office, with negotiation of a WFH day after 6 months probation
-          It‚Äôs further away from my house and would have to drive through the city a peak hour in the morning and evening which could make the drive up to 30 mins.
-          I feel a but out of my depth with the new role, with the management and a lot of reporting and creating processes
-          They took 2 weeks to let me know I got the job, so I had already let go of it in my head
-          I didn‚Äôt feel excited about the role when I found out, I was just pleased with myself for having gotten it
-          In all honesty, my current job is busy/stressful but it isn‚Äôt hard and gives me great work/life balance and I really value my time outside of work

I emailed them declining, they asked for the reasons why and had hopes of working it out with me, I told them I can have the opportunity to develop in my current role whilst maintaining the flexibility that is important to me, they responded with the below:

 

Hi [name],

Thank you for replying.

Are you sure?

The opportunity here is a significant and to add financial services and practice manager to your resume would be huge!

You could open the whole world of financial services and the knowledge that this will provide to you for your own future.

No disrespect to plumbing which is an essential service, your opportunity for growth and learning in financial services and to make a difference to so many is considerable.

You will have two practice managers to lean on for support in other offices and [owners name] and I with 20+ years management experience.

I understand you may not feel confident to take this next step but to grow you need to step out and take yourself out of a scenario you probably feel very comfortable in.

This was advice I too received earlier in my career.

Beyond [office location] we also have [new business] that will need your services to progress.

I hope that you may reconsider the opportunity and career and if you do we welcome discussing this with you.

We do need to progress to find a solution this week so please reply or call to arrange an appointment or discuss.

Otherwise please confirm if your decision is final.

Warm regards,

 

Is the above a red flag or an opportunity to reconsider my declining? I‚Äôve never received anything like the above when declining a role.

Logically, I know I should take the role for my long term career development, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right. Is it my intuition that made me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt take the job or could it be imposter syndrome and I‚Äôm just scared?",jackandellie,59,0.8700000047683716,161,1741570752,2025-03-10 01:39:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7nhe6/i_declined_a_job_offer_and_they_are_urging_me_to/,3,2025

1j7n1kn,Need advice on 2 different positions,"Hey there,

So I have 2 positions on the table that I can't decide on and looking to get some 3rd party point of views. I work in the cyber space, so thats what these positions are tailoring to.

First Position:

* Pay: 115k
* Benefits: 100% paid health/dental/vision for me, would have to pay for family members
* Retirement: no 401k options
* The good: This position would be in line with my career and allow me to step out of my lane a bit and work in different positions and gain additional experience. Small company (15 people) so I get to work with the CEO on a weekly basis.
* The bad: I would lose my 401k and my security clearance. Lateral move from current position, but current fed employee that is most likely going to be affected by the RIF's.
* Flexibility: Hybrid work, 3 days in office 2 days WFH, very flexible as life things arise.

Second Position:

* Pay: 137.5k
* Benefits: Good health insurance for family and I + company contributions to HSA (1k a year)
* Retirement: Expansive 401k, with 100% match up to 8%
* The good: Would allow me to keep my Security Clearance active. Very reputable company, position directly aligns with my interests and I get to do very interesting work + travel to unique locations. Internal movement is quite easy and encouraged.
* The bad: Large places have their increased chance of layoffs. My experience in the cyber space has been a bit safer, but cant tell the future. Have to ""stay in my lane"" of work unless I transition to another team.
* Flexibility: 100% onsite, 25 min drive, and every Friday off. Flexible during the week and can make up hours here and there if something comes up during the day.

I believe that I covered most of my comparisons, cant think of much more that I need to consider. But thats where I am looking for help to see if there is anything that I am not thinking of that could be a decision changer.

- want to experience working abroad for a few months or so

- this visa usually has an age limit of up to 30 and im turning 29 this year


Cons:
- health insurance ü•≤
- currently having some health issues (not serious so far) so losing health insurance would def suck
- so  much uncertainty 
- income might not be the same 
- I don‚Äôt speak any East Asian language, but willing to learn while I‚Äôm there.

1j7m0s4,Possibly Getting Fired Soon,"Hello.

I am reaching out to the Reddit universe for some help/suggestions with this one. I've been employed with my current job for 10 years now (retail pharmacy, front store)

For the last 3 years I have been a Store Manager. Throughout that time, I have dealt with many challenges and obstacles with being a SM since a good chunk of the responsibility in the store's success, ultimately falls on me. Overall, I believe I did a good job within this role, producing good positive results but admittedly along the way, have not always followed company policy to the T. I never did anything crazy like internal theft, curse at my employees, or anything inappropriate to anyone but have made a couple bad decisions that I slightly regret but nothing ever egregious by any means.

Recently last month my store had its annual inventory day when my boss and other higher level field MGMT come in and look over the inventory process and help assist/oversee the inventory process. This particular day, a conversation was brought up between my boss and myself about a then-current staffing issue we were having, due to the company essentially pulling one of my employees to go to another store that was in dire need of help within the pharmacy dept.

My boss and I had a minor disagreement about how I hired a person to replace the colleague they took away from us, but she did not like the fact that I hired this person as a member of MGMT instead of starting them out as a cashier, as they did not have any former retail store experience. I insisted that I took the approach I did, since we were then short-staffed and needed another keyholder, not a cashier since they are limited on what they can do vs what the demand called for given the circumstances. This disagreement happened in front of other colleagues, although it was not a heated argument by any means. I would say I just did not agree with her and would not budge on my opinion on the matter, although I did stay professional and listened to everything she had to say.

However, after this interaction occurred, it was as a though a switch had been turned for her and a week after our inventory, she returned to the store (not common) and essentially blasted me out of nowhere for a lot of different reasons, many of them minor infractions such as not letting her aware of a PTO day I took the week after our inventory even though our store had coverage and there was no actual issue with it other than me not informing her via email beforehand. Then came allegations that she had to have asked colleagues about, although these were also very minor in nature. She essentially was trying to shake me down and tear me down mentally. I was accused of being a ""bad leader"" although our store metrics were good. All of this was so weird to me, since she had never treated me that way before. The only thing I could tie it to was the disagreement we publicly had the week before. During this 2nd encounter, at one point during the conversation I gave her my keys to the store and told her since I'm supposedly such a bad leader, if she wanted to explore other options she could, and I was legitimately ready to leave if that's how she truly felt about me. Seemingly surprised at my response, she put my keys down on the desk after getting some commitments from me on how I would improve and finish a certain store task within a certain time frame (which we did) and then left shortly after.

After that instance, I didn't hear anything else from her about me or the store at all. Now comes this past Friday where I got a call from HR wanting to ask me questions but alleged concerns that could have only come from colleagues since they are very specific in detail.

One of them was from a disgruntled employee that would rather see me gone and get her way (wants to get FT hours with FT benefits but not work Friday, Saturday, or Sunday at all) at the cost of it being detrimental to the store and gave my boss a story about how I've cut her hours in some sort of retaliatory way because I simply don't want her to become FT which is not the real reason at all. Some of the other allegations are of me throwing out potential answers to scenarios which may have violated policy but were never actually done and actually back tracked by me once the correct way was found out (these were just a couple of uncommon scenarios that I had never really had any experience with so my first thought would be just an idea of a possibility of how to handle it but with more time, usually just less than 30 mins of me reaching out to others would get the correct way of going about it) So basically they're trying to use hypothetical scenarios that never actually took place against me now simply because my boss someone got this info out of the employee that these scenarios happened to. At least one was completely fabricated and false. And one of them did happen, which was of me telling another employee about how another colleague was incompetent. This one I did fully own up to during the 2nd encounter that my boss and I had, so this one she was fully aware of already, but now HR confirmed it for the record. (Yes I did do wrong here in this instance and do regret saying that to another employee but in all fairness this colleague in question did cause us a lot of issues performance wise and my comment was nothing against them personally, it just was a lapse in judgment of my behalf and something that was said out of the heat of the moment. (That exchange was shared from the other colleague I told, to the other disgruntled employee who then feed this information first to my boss but has now been confirmed by HR from the actual colleague the message was shared with)

Sorry, I know this is pretty long at this point, but I wanted to share context between the allegations. I honestly know I made some mistakes since I have been a SM and admit that I was wrong but the picture that is being painted against me is very one-sided, and it's clear that this has been an orchestrated mission to end me from the moment my boss and I had that very first open disagreement that sparked all of this.

I had actually been thinking of leaving the company this year due to personal reasons before all of this madness started happening and was starting to plan it out but was trying to wait until after my annual bonus. Now, however, I think what is about to happen is that I'll be terminated before those go through (late next week) Why else would I get the HR call on a Friday at a really inconvenient time at that. My boss has incentive to get me out besides her own personal motivation. They can fire me, keep my bonus, keep my raise, then replace me with a new person making less than what I currently am. It's all corporate greed bs at the end of the day and this is just another way for them to cut costs, which my boss found that opportunity to do so with me.

Anyway, I will probably find out one way or the other soon next week. I guess my question here would be, based on what I have shared, what do you think is the possibility is that they are getting ready to fire me ? Pretty high ?

For anyone that has ever experienced anything remotely similar or just getting fired in general, any tips or suggestions going forward for where I am now with it ?

Thank You in advance. Any help is much appreciated.

1j7kw04,Advice for Laid-Off Person,"Hi there, Hopeful for a little advice. I was laid off in July. I haven't been able to find a job in my field because it is highly specialized and the market in my field is the worst it's been in generations. I hold two Master's degrees and am 6 months away from my doctorate in my specialization. However, when there are no jobs, that means nothing. 

I have not applied for any jobs in the local market that people might typically apply for (like Target, etc) because there is no way that, once someone looked at my resume, a hiring manager would hire me to do a job that I am, on paper, overqualified for. Years ago, I worked 3+ jobs at a time, I've worked retail, been a waitress, etc. I'm a great worker, but any hiring manager would look at my recent job history and education and write me off. And I get it, I probably would too if I were in their shoes. 

But I need to work!!! I'm looking at homelessness if I don't. I need to feed my family and keep a roof over our head.

My question is: How do I frame my application so it doesn't look like I am overqualified? Do I flat-out lie? Say I have been a stay-at-home mom for the last 20+ years? I REALLY hate to do that, because I am NOT a liar (my field actually mandates that!!). 

I'm super open to advice. You'll see I'm new to Reddit, it because I've never had to ask a question like this before, but now I don't know where to turn. 

Thanks in advance for any advice. I really appreciate it. ",Fantastic_Wrap_9344,2,1.0,3,1741563006,2025-03-09 23:30:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7kw04/advice_for_laidoff_person/,3,2025
1j7ki7v,undergrad -> air force -> phd ???,"I am currently an undergraduate Computer Engineering major at the University of Maryland College Park. While I am unsure of my specific career path, I really enjoy my major. I have been considering joining the Air Force after completing my undergraduate degree, before pursuing a Ph.D. in either Computer or Electrical Engineering.

My reasoning for joining the Air Force is, first, the financial stability it offers. I believe the salary is around $50,000 per year for four years, and since the military covers most expenses, I would be able to save a significant portion of that income.

Another important factor is the opportunity to work on projects related to my major. I have seen Air Force officer programs that allow me to focus on fields such as cybersecurity, avionics, or other areas relevant to my degree. This is crucial to me, as I would not want to join if I couldn‚Äôt apply my skills in a meaningful way.

Additionally, I am not entirely certain whether I want to pursue a Ph.D. after my service. However, I have heard that the security clearance and experience gained in the Air Force can make it much easier to secure jobs at government agencies such as NASA and the NSA, as well as private companies like SpaceX, Google, and Meta, which value veterans. I've also heard that being a veteran can strengthen Ph.D. applications and make admission easier.

Furthermore, the government would cover the full cost of my Ph.D. program after I complete my service through the GI bill.

Lastly, I believe I would genuinely enjoy being in the Air Force. There is a chance I could be stationed overseas, which I think would be an exciting experience, and overall, I feel I would find the work fulfilling.

Another thing I want to add is that I am very suicidal. I do not have many friends and I have limited connections with family. The only thing that brings me happiness is my career, not because I care much about money but I just enjoy engineering a lot and I am a big nerd. Would the air force be a good idea for me considering this? I do not care much about money and I can't ever see myself getting married. My goal for life right now would just to be a person that is well respected and notable in my field.

Given all this I just wanted input on

Is the Air Force is a good idea for me from a career standpoint?

Is the Air Force is a good idea for me from a mental standpoint?

Is anything I said incorrect?

Has anyone else taken a similar path?

Does being in the Air Force significantly increase my chances of getting a big tech job or getting into a PhD program or am I incorrect on that?",LocalBid4597,0,0.5,0,1741561919,2025-03-09 23:11:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7ki7v/undergrad_air_force_phd/,3,2025
1j7jsds,Need advice: Stay at my current job or go back to my old one?,"I‚Äôve been at Company A for almost a year now, making $110k + stock options. The company is profitable and growing fast, aiming to go public in the next few years. I‚Äôm in a Senior Analyst role with a lot of room for growth since I report directly to the director. The problem is, I‚Äôm just not feeling motivated here. The company‚Äôs future is bright, but the constant changes and startup vibes are making it tough to really get into my work.

Now, my old company (Company B) wants me back as a Manager, which is one step up from where I am now. The salary would be $120k + a 10% bonus (if targets are hit), so $10k more than my current salary. The work itself would be pretty similar to what I did there before ‚Äì repetitive stuff ‚Äì but I really loved the team, the culture, and my old manager (who I‚Äôd be working with again). They really pushed me to do my best.

The downside with Company B is that their growth has slowed down a lot compared to Company A. They‚Äôre not looking at a big expansion or going public anytime soon, so the long-term growth potential there feels a bit more limited.

The pay difference is tough to compare because Company A gives stock options, but it's hard to know how much they‚Äôre actually worth. I feel like I haven‚Äôt really given my all at Company A, and if I can figure out how to motivate myself, I could probably get more into the work. But I‚Äôm really torn between staying at Company A, where there‚Äôs more potential, or going back to Company B for a better work environment, more responsibility, and a higher salary, even if the growth is slower.

1j7jqya,Scared about changing career path : Would it make me boring ?,"I graduated as a seamstress. Along the years I developed many interests like music, dj, cinema, art, but would always look for more niche aesthetics. My friends/acquaintances pretty much all do art in various fields. So I found myself in a community who values creativity over pretty much everything. (Paris)  
It was so fun to grow with them, to connect with new like minded people, specially during my teenage years. But now I'm 23. I realised I won't have a big income as a seamstress. Worst, I won't be recognised for my talent/savoir-faire. (It's always the big brand or designer that gets all the praise)

I'm seriously thinking about studying in the economic/computer field because I've always been good with numbers, I'm smart and I miss using my intelligence to learn and do complex things. Also, a new career in that would give me financial security and flexibility and challenge.

1j7i682,Why Can't I find a Job? College Graduate Seeking Advice.,"Hi everyone,

I am a 23M that is in desperate need of help and advice. I cannot seem to find a job and get my career started whatsoever. I moved to Florida from Michigan in July and I graduated college in August with a bachelor's degree in marketing and a minor in General business. Since moving and graduating college I have tried everything that I know to get a full-time salary job worth my degree and time. I have applied to over 4,000 jobs mainly in Florida but all over the United States as well since August. Most jobs I have applied to have been entry level marketing roles with salaries around the $50,000-$60,000 range. All jobs I should be qualified for if not overqualified. I have an excellent cover letter and resume, I have tried walking into places as well as calling them. I have reached out to old professors, counselors, peers, basically any connections I have that I thought could help me get my career started/give me advice. I have been working as a front desk associate at a hotel for 5 months now because that is the only job part-time/full-time or hourly/salary that I could find.  They company has mistreated me, overworked me, undervalued me, and under supported me. I currently have zero work life balance over a job I dislike and am overqualified for. They have made me work 50+ hours a week at $16 an hour 6-7 days a week since I started due to the lack of staffing and mismanagement. I need to leave but have not been able to get another job or get my career started whatsoever, I have debated on leaving this week so I could have more time to focus my efforts on starting my career better. Unfortunately, it seems like the job market is just really bad right now and everyone is experiencing the same thing. I figured I would make a post seeking advice because I do not know what to do. Do I continue doing the same thing just mass applying to jobs hoping to catch a break and land an interview? Do I take a few courses (Google) to show I have valid skills? Do I go back to school and get a master's degree in a field more useful? Do I seek advice from a career coach or counselor? It seems like I have tried everything I know, and I have made zero progress.

1j7h08r,Should I take the leap?,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm seeking advice on my career path. I've got a non-technical background (BBA) but have been doing some technical work in my current role. Here's my story:

I graduated 7 months ago with a degree in Business Administration. During my final year, I was doing business development at a local software house, which gave me a taste of the tech industry. After graduation, I landed a job at an investment management company as their first customer success hire.

In this role, I was tasked with building the customer success team from scratch. I had to:

- Research and implement a customer support platform (Zendesk)
- Integrate WhatsApp Business API with Zendesk (no direct integration available)
- Build an AI-powered customer service agent using Dialogflow CX on Google Cloud
- Create a custom proxy server to connect Dialogflow and Zendesk (learned Node.js overnight!)
- Deploy everything on Google Cloud (figuring out hosting, authentication, security, etc.)

This project reduced our customer support team's workload by 40% while handling 3x more inquiries. I also cut the average response time from over 2 hours to under 15 minutes. Recently, I got promoted to Associate Product Marketing, but I'm not feeling the spark in my current role.

Most of my day is spent reviewing copy and directing designers on social posts and emails. While I enjoy the creative aspect, I miss the technical problem-solving I did with the customer success integration. I'm honestly torn between:

1. *Learning software development properly*: I'm considering a bootcamp or self-taught route to learn programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or Java.
2. *Going the finance route with CFA*: I've been investing in stocks since 2022 and have built my own analysis spreadsheets. I'm interested in pursuing a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation.

Has anyone else made a similar career switch? Any advice or guidance would be appreciated!

1j7grie,Is there even a point bothering to continue?,"Hey Guys,

I am in a weird situation in my career and the only place I can think of sharing this, is reddit. I will just give a short backstory of it and then I will specify more into what the case is. I would love to hear your feedback, especially people with more experience in life. It will be appreciated.

Basically, I started in this company about 8 months ago. Let's call it ""company X"". Pretty niche industry which I've been working for 5 years that is comission based. Before I came into the company, I was working a senior role for about 3 and a half/4 yrs in the same industry (a role, with much more responsibility, complex and significally higher pay). When I went to the interview for company X they said that their policy is to start from a junior role (a role which I've been for only a 10-12 months, when I first started into the industry), so I can prove myself in a way. I agreed on it, as company X had much more flexibility than other companies, like working remotely, working at your appointed time, not following irrelevant KPI's etc. I said to them: okay, I will start as junior, but I am not here for that fyi - which they knew based on my CV. So, I should expect a promotion for the senior role after 5 months. 5 months go by, I get called for a meeting that the promotion will be delayed with another 2 months. A month goes by and they call me again for another meeting saying that ""I won't be getting a promotion, unless my ""junior"" department performs"". So if my junior department don't perform it will mean no spots. Now I depend on my colleagues, which are kinda lazy and not motivated to push like I am. Now bare in mind that I've been the highest performer out of my department and my skillset is far more extensive that the guys in the senior role (which I am aiming for).

I got super annoyed, but kept calm and analyzed the situation. I start doubting that these people care about growing the company. The only people working in the senior role are a group of friends close to the manager over there. People are underperforming for months in the senior role and they are still kept there and not being fired for bad performance. Only 5% of the people make money. So now, not only there won't be an available spot because no one is getting fired or demoted for their sh*t performance and lack of work ethic, but also I have to depend on my colleagues from the junior role to bring results, so I can potentially have a spot created for me. I escalated this a couple of times to the upper management and the only response I got is ""Yeah, the time you started is not very favourable. All business have ups and downs. We can assure you that in the future it will be much better. The company has plans about this and that. You will become a senior eventually but we don't know when. If you leave we assure you that you will regret it. etc"". Pretty much everything a manager is supposed to say. Now bare in mind I am in my early twenties and I am much more fortunate than 90% of the population in my country. I told them that and they know it. Promises won't keep me in the company for long, based on what is currently happening. I just think they are insecure around me as well in a way.

The thing is I've worked in much more stressful environmnet and made good money due to it. I am here now in a much more comfortable environment with literally 0 stress, but I start getting depressed, because I feel like I am betting low on myself and not recognizing who I actually am and what skills I have if I continue staying here for a longer time. The thing is that this comfortable environment that I am in right now, doesn't recognize the skills you have, the work ethic you have, the discipline you have and is like I am not using my potential and character. And that's hurts. My results started dropping and I don't think they will get better, even if I stay, hence I started looking for new opportunities

I have been working with the company for 15 years and think I as well regarded and respcted amongst colleagues, and also ironically by my boss.
They keep saying there is no money for pay rises but I can see money being spent in other departments.
Having said all that, I am paid well for what I do, have no stress, can work my own hours to a degree. I am v bored though as my work is quite repetitive. Some friends of a similar age are in stressful jobs that require being at work a few days a week and tell me not to look a gift horse in the mouth.
I have had a v interesting and enjoyable career until recently and hate to think this is my swansong but on the other hand don't want a stressful job at this stage.
To make myself feel less frustrated with my current situation, I dont work to my max. I don't like this and have never worked like this but equally dont want to be taken advantage of.
Thoughts? Should I ride this out until retirement 2 years away? Or try to find something else more interesting where I might decide to stay longer?

1j7fxvl,Seeking guidance on Resume title for IT Manager role across diverse departments,"I have been serving as an IT Manager for several years. In our IT organization, we follow a practice where managers usually rotate across different departments to gain exposure to various processes and functions given the small size of the team and rotation. Currently, I am managing two distinct areas: Supply Chain and Marketing.

While my role in both departments involves having the same IT governance activities, the processes and expertise required for each are significantly different. I must admit that I have mixed feelings about handling such diverse areas, but I do acknowledge the significant learning and growth this experience is providing me.

However, I am facing a challenge regarding my resume. My leaders foresee me eventually focusing entirely on Supply Chain, which is a larger domain. At the same time, I don't want to minimize the effort I am making in marketing and sales related projects.

As I explore new opportunities with other companies, I am unsure whether highlighting both Supply Chain and Marketing on my resume may confuse potential employers or recruiters. I have observed that companies often prefer candidates who specialize in one area of expertise, which is making me question whether I should focus only on Supply Chain or highlight my dual roles despite their distinct nature.

1j7ftnc,My employer lied to me about the job and what I'd be doing,"About 5 months ago, I started a job at a relatively small company. I'm fresh out of college with a computer science degree. I had been applying to jobs for a couple of months, so when I got the offer for this one, I was super excited. One thing to keep in mind is that I never applied to a job at this company directly; they found me through a post I made on LinkedIn and contacted me. This is also my first job, so it was a huge step for me in starting to build my career.

During the interview, I was walked through the history of the company and whatnot; I talked about myself and what I expected to learn, the usual. Well, during the interview, my employer painted this really beautiful picture of this web app I was going to be building and the future cybersecurity projects I would be a part of, and I was super excited about this because it really seemed like I was going to learn a lot! It felt like I had won the lottery when they called me to say I got the job!

Well, obviously it went horribly, or I wouldn't be making this post.

To me, it is not about how much they pay me; it is about how much I would be learning. Turns out that no one else in that company has any sort of technological background, besides me and the 2 interns who found themselves in the same situation as me, meaning there is no senior developer of any sort to guide us; the project had no manager, no plan whatsoever, nothing. We were made to work on this really bad low-code platform that no one has heard about, where the only lines of ""code"" we got to write were CSS. The platform is extremely limited, and we can't do most of what they are asking of us, and when we try to explain it, no one understands because, again, we're the only people with a programming background in the company, and this is our first real job. Obviously there haven't been any cybersecurity projects.

I am just stuck here feeling distraught that I was lied to and that I'm not getting any relevant experience. The job market is awful, and even if I put this job on my resume, I don't feel like there's much I can reference for future jobs.

Turns out the turnover rate for this company is huge; someone in the same situation as me but from a different area left after only 1 month because of the same thing. I ignored all the red flags in my contract because excitement and no previous experience could have never prepared me for this, and I am left feeling unmotivated and lost because this is my very first job, and if I start looking for other jobs, I might be seen as a job hopper.

1j7fnbb,"Male coworker turns in subpar work, gets paid more than me for same job","Hi,

I‚Äôm a graphic designer. I need advice. I found out dishonestly when i first started my job that my male coworker made about $4k more than I did. I did a shitty thing (I‚Äôll admit) and pulled his paystub from his desk drawer and calculated his salary. I felt bad but I accepted it at the time because I felt he had more experience and he had a 4yr degree in graphic design while mine was in film.

However, time went on and it became clear his work wasn‚Äôt all that. He‚Äôd turn in ads with poor typography, typos, poor image quality, poor contrast, and bad visual hierarchy to name a few things. Management would often not ask for revisions, which I found odd for such basic mistakes. With my work, my manager has said he loves it and I catch my own mistakes usually. I‚Äôve never had negative feedback on my actual work.

I had a rough time with mental health and addiction last year. My work was fine, but my attendance wasn‚Äôt. I started asking for reasonable accommodations due to bipolar disorder and my psychiatrist received a list of things my employer already provided and advised me to drop my request because they were already pretty accommodating. 

I took a month off for rehab instead. I was missing work once or twice a week, and my coworker became the dependable one. I started to improve after rehab with intensive therapy, but still had some missteps in January that caused my boss to switch me to $26.45 hourly from a 55k salary.

Now, I am mostly showing up every day and on time. I got my shit together. But I am making substantially less because my hourly rate does not count the fact that salary employees only work 37.5hrs, not 40. I take the bus/train/uber for my long commute and it is hard to make 40hrs exactly. I show up about 8:30am (leaving approximately at 6am), take a 15min lunch break, and leave about 4:45pm (making it home around 7:40-8pm). If the timing is perfect, it is exactly 8hrs, but the 15min for lunch is just so unfair too considering everyone on salary gets an hour paid.

I love my boss and my job, so I‚Äôm not sure what action to take without causing too much of a disturbance. I know I could have been fired many times and they chose to keep working with me. But what can I do about getting paid less and getting knocked way down with hourly? The other graphic designer doesn‚Äôt even show up until 9-10am when start time is 8:30. He is able to work from home, even on vacation, and I was just denied going back to working from home sometimes because they are ‚Äútrying to keep the newer hires in the office‚Äù. He leaves early all the time.

I have my yearly performance review coming up so I can wanted to ask my boss what I have to do to get back on salary. I‚Äôm not sure taking legal action would bode well‚Ä¶even though I should be paid as much as the male coworker.

Idk. Thoughts?",extrahotcheeto,0,0.10999999940395355,18,1741549021,2025-03-09 19:37:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j7fnbb/male_coworker_turns_in_subpar_work_gets_paid_more/,3,2025

1j7efgy,Want to switch careers from tech,"I (25M) currently work in the digital forensics field in NYC making about 82k pretax. Not too great considering how expensive the area is, but I'm fortunate enough to live with a relative who only charges me 500 a month for rent. The only debt I have is student loans (about 50k) which most of my income currently goes towards. No car or child responsibilities. So all in all my situation now is a lot better than most and I'm not taking it for granted. 

However.. I don't really like what I do now and ultimately want to switch careers. My college background is security risk and intelligence analysis, which lined up with me wanting a career in civilian government but with everything going on there right now, making that pretty much useless at this time. My only professional experience has only ever been in digital forensics and with me wanting to step away from that I'm not sure where I can look to next.

My end goal is to move away from NYC, further south to a different state in a lower cost of living area doing something totally different. I would like to have a decent apartment on my own and cheap car eventually. I understand ultimately I'd have to pay up more than I am now. But I am a big risk taker and I'd like get out there as soon as I can to a place I want to be preferable within the year. As for a new potential career I don't think I'd want to do much with computers anymore. I also don't want to go back to school as I already have significant debt. Something involving traveling around locally would be nice or anything outdoors, but I don't have much experience with that. 

Given my situation, what would you do? How long should I stay where I am now before making a move? What options should I consider for a new line of work? Thanks in advance!

1j7e9uo,I am a Security Analyst in Infrastructure Security ‚Äì Confused Between IT Auditor and Pentester,"Hello everyone,

I have been working as a Security Analyst in Infrastructure Security for the past 6 months in an organization in India. My role mainly involves audits, such as operations audits, GRC audits, and some IT audits (though not completely into IT auditing yet).

I am currently confused between pursuing a career as an IT Auditor or a Penetration Tester. My main considerations are:

I prefer less stress and no off-hour work.

I want good pay and career growth.

Which of these two roles would be a better fit for my career goals?

If I choose the Auditor path:

1. Among different types of auditors, which one has less stress, no off-hour work, and great pay?

2. I aim to be a CISO in the long run. My plan is:

First 5 years as an Auditor ‚Üí Move to Managerial Role ‚Üí Eventually become a CISO.

My planned certification path: Security+ ‚Üí CISA ‚Üí CISM ‚Üí CISSP ‚Üí CCISO.

Is this a good approach, or should I adjust it?

If I choose the Pentester path:

1. The goal is almost the same:

First 5 years as a Pentester ‚Üí Move to Managerial Role ‚Üí Eventually become a CISO.

2. My planned certification path: eJPT ‚Üí OSCP ‚Üí CISSP ‚Üí CCISO.

3. Does Pentesting have more stress, off-hour work, or lower pay compared to Auditing?

Lastly, I‚Äôm considering taking CISA in a year. However, I know that I will receive the certification only after 2-3 years (waiving some criteria) or 5 years normally. Will getting CISA early benefit me when switching jobs in 1-2 years, even though I won‚Äôt receive the official certificate immediately?

Would love to hear suggestions and insights from experienced professionals. Your guidance will be valuable to me!

For a 13% raise, I traded off 50% more work with a hyper-busy team, and it‚Äôs not what I expected including the cut throat competitive team members. Above all, I don‚Äôt like the project itself.

Recently, when going over my appraisal with my new manager, I went through my performance review and my old manager had indeed put in great recommendations and also was rewarded a great bonus due to that. 

I‚Äôm tempted to reach out to my old manager to see if they‚Äôd take me back, but I also feel quite ashamed for leaving in the first place. Given the market, I‚Äôm unsure how soon I can land another job if I start looking again.

1j7djqq,Where to look for WFH sales jobs?,"Bachelors in marketing. Minor in Econ. Used to own my own company running Facebook/Google/IG Advertising for small businesses, mostly contractors.

Made some good money. Was inconsistent though as ads would bring in too many clients, more than customers could handle and they would cancel ads until next year when they needed more work. So half the year I‚Äôd have no income.

Big selling point to get new clients was ‚Äúno contracts, cancel when you want.‚Äù Should have changed that but didn‚Äôt.

Got an offer to sell company for big chunk of change and took it. Was tired of running my own company.

Looking for new WFH sales job. Been rough. Indeed is dry. No call backs at all whatsoever. Idk if it‚Äôs my resume, always worked for myself since I was 21 and I‚Äôm 34 now. So idk if it‚Äôs lack of working for other companies.

Tried solar for a bit, but absolutely hated it. Feels like I‚Äôm scamming someone. And I hate the whole frat boy wolf of Wall Street attitude all these solar guys have.

Just want a nice wfh sales job I can work on my own pace with good commission. Commission only is fine, base pay even better. I don‚Äôt care either way tbh. I‚Äôm great at cold calling a B2B because of cold calling businesses myself for my own company selling ads management.

Any suggestions would be great. I‚Äôm tired of indeed. Every sales job seems like some scam.

I‚Äôm a recent CS grad and joined a startup as a founding team member in December. I‚Äôve been contributing a lot, and I genuinely love the work‚Äîgreat team, exciting projects, and solid growth potential. The only issue? The pay is¬†average

Now, I‚Äôve been offered a remote role at another company for 2.4x my current salary with relocation options. The catch? I don‚Äôt know much about the new company, and I suspect the job progression might not be as good as my current role.

1. Staying at the startup (which I love) and trying to negotiate a raise, even though I just joined.
2. Taking the higher-paying job to ease financial stress, even if it‚Äôs not as fulfilling.

1j78dwj,How much control is reasonable to expect?,"I am the director of Digital product at an organization (being vague so not really identifiable). I have been there for four years and by all accounts do my job well. My boss and his boss are happy with me, I get bonuses, and very good reviews. 

Our customer base has been tanking lately, so about two years ago our Customer service team hired a consultant to help us identify and fix the problem. This takes the form of big group design sprints where everyone comes up with an idea and the head of Customer service decides which idea we will execute. 

These are almost always digital in nature. 

The first year we selected an idea that me and my team knew would not work for a number of reasons but I was professional and helped the outside firm as much as I could on development. We spent a ton of money on it and it was not successful for the reasons we raised.

The next year my idea was selected. Over the course of the  year I collaborated closely with the customer service team on execution, but I owned the project. We rolled it out last year and it has been extremely successful. I have been given a lot of public praise for it and it was seen as a ""digital win"".

This year, the customer service team held a third design sprint and didn't invite me. They ended up selecting an idea very similar to a project already under beginning stages of development by my team. I have been invited to the implementation meetings but, not all of them, and now they are holding user interviews, which I was not involved in designing or invited to. 

It feels like they are taking over one of my projects, leaving me out of it and only pulling me in when they see fit so that they can get a win under their belt.

My boss is trying to be diplomatic and make both sides happy. I feel like I need to be allowed to do my job and build digital product and that the customer service team should be the subject matter experts providing insight but that I should be allowed to own and manage the project.

1j77y47,eCommerce Director Role Responsibilities Too Broad?,"As the title suggests, I‚Äôm considering a Director-level role overseeing eCommerce and Performance Marketing for a smaller, start-up apparel brand. I‚Äôd love to hear from others in similar industries‚Äîdoes this scope seem too broad, potentially setting me up for failure and burnout?

# My Background:

I‚Äôm currently a Director of Performance Marketing at another apparel brand, where I‚Äôve been for 10 years. The first 5 years were focused on managing the eCommerce side of the business, and for the past 5 years, I‚Äôve worked exclusively in Performance Marketing. I have experience in both areas, but in separate capacities.

# Role Responsibilities & Support:

The role I‚Äôm considering includes oversight of the following areas, with junior-level team support for each:

* **eCommerce Operations** ‚Äì Web merchandising, web strategy, optimization, and UX updates (including a planned Shopify overhaul this year). Supported by two junior employees.
* **Retention Marketing** ‚Äì CRM, email, and SMS marketing. Supported by one junior employee.
* **Performance Marketing** ‚Äì Paid Search, Paid Social, Display, and launching an Affiliate program. Supported by one paid media agency and one junior consultant.

# My Concerns:

While the role is intended to be strategic, I worry that:

1. The **junior team support is very limited:** these employees have only 1-2 years of experience and I anticipate having to roll up my sleeves often (which I don't mind doing but am worried this will be the norm).
2. **I have gaps in my expertise**, particularly in site UX updates (especially overhauls) and CRM execution. While I‚Äôve worked closely with these areas, I‚Äôm not an expert.

I‚Äôd love to hear from others: Is this level of oversight normal for a single Director, or does it seem like an unrealistic workload that could lead to burnout? How are similar roles structured at other companies?

1j77f2f,Should I take a high-paying but stressful job or stay in my comfortable one?,"Hi Redditors,

I need some advice on whether I should take a new job offer or stay with my current company.

I recently received an offer from another company that would more than **double my current salary**. However, after checking Glassdoor reviews and speaking with former employees, I‚Äôve learned that the job comes with **high stress and poor management**.

On the other hand, my current company has a **chill work environment**, a **hybrid schedule (3 days in office, 2 WFH)**, and **flexible, supportive management**. I really enjoy the work-life balance here.

My main concern is whether I‚Äôm **getting too comfortable** and missing out on a better financial opportunity, or if staying in a healthy, low-stress environment is the smarter choice.

I‚Äôm also **currently single and don‚Äôt have many commitments**, so I feel like this might be the right time to take risks and chase better financial opportunities.

I‚Äôm a final-year software engineering undergraduate in Serbia, with only my thesis left to complete. On paper, it sounds like I‚Äôm on a solid path, but the truth is, I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôve been living someone else‚Äôs dream.  

When I chose software engineering, it wasn‚Äôt out of passion‚Äîit was due to external pressures from my family. I‚Äôve always been more of a creative, bookish type, drawn to art, history, and philosophy. Math and programming never came naturally to me, but I powered through the degree because I didn‚Äôt want to quit. To survive, I focused on front-end development and graphic design, avoiding backend courses because I knew they‚Äôd be too overwhelming. Now, as I near graduation, I‚Äôm stuck. Finding a job in web development as a total beginner in Serbia feels almost impossible, especially since I lack backend skills.  

Over the years, I‚Äôve come to realize that my true passion lies in the humanities. I‚Äôve always loved books, history, and philosophy, and I‚Äôve found a way to incorporate that into my thesis. I‚Äôm writing and designing an illustrated book about the history and philosophy of the East using Adobe InDesign. It‚Äôs been the most fulfilling part of my academic journey so far, and it‚Äôs made me realize that I want to pursue a career in this field.  

This year, I‚Äôm taking a leap of faith and starting a philosophy degree in October. University in Serbia is affordable, so I don‚Äôt need to take out loans, but I still need to figure out how to support myself financially. My goal is to save enough money in the next seven months so that I can work part-time while studying. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to find remote work or freelance projects that align with my skills and interests.  

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm struggling: I have a foundation in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and graphic design (Adobe Suite, Figma), but I‚Äôm not sure how to market myself. I‚Äôm not a traditional developer, and I don‚Äôt want to be. I‚Äôm more of a creative hybrid‚Äîsomeone who loves design, writing, and storytelling. I‚Äôve thought about niches like UI/UX design, technical writing, or even digital publishing, but I‚Äôm not sure where to start or how to stand out.  

I've designed and published my web design & graphic design portfolio website and for more context about my current situation here is the link:
https://mitsuki-layla.github.io/portfolio/

If anyone has been in a similar situation‚Äîtransitioning from tech to humanities or balancing a creative career with financial stability‚Äîhow did you make it work? Are there specific freelance platforms or remote job opportunities that might suit my skills? Should I invest time in learning other technologies (and which ones), or should I focus entirely on something else?

I‚Äôm willing to put in the work over the next seven months to build a foundation for this next chapter of my life. I just need a little guidance to find the right path.

My goal is to save enough money in the next seven months so that I can work part-time while studying. Ideally, I‚Äôd like to find remote work or freelance projects that align with my skills and interests.  

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm struggling: I have a foundation in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and graphic design (Adobe Suite, Figma), but I‚Äôm not sure how to market myself. I‚Äôm not a traditional developer, and I don‚Äôt want to be. I‚Äôm more of a creative hybrid‚Äîsomeone who loves design, writing, and storytelling. I‚Äôve thought about niches like UI/UX design, technical writing, or even digital publishing, but I‚Äôm not sure where to start or how to stand out.  

I've designed and published my web design & graphic design portfolio website and for more context about my current situation here is the link:
https://mitsuki-layla.github.io/portfolio/

If anyone has been in a similar situation‚Äîtransitioning from tech to humanities or balancing a creative career with financial stability‚Äîhow did you make it work? Are there specific freelance platforms or remote job opportunities that might suit my skills? Should I invest time in learning other technologies (and which ones), or should I focus entirely on something else?

I‚Äôm willing to put in the work over the next seven months to build a foundation for this next chapter of my life. I just need a little guidance to find the right path. Thanks so much for reading‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to your advice!

1j76kz4,Boss Expects Me to Take on Additional Tasks Without a Pay Raise,"Hi! I would like to ask for your insights about my situation at work as it has been bothering me for weeks now and it already affected my performance at work.

I started a new job at my company in January as a traditional marketing specialist, focused on events, promotions, activations, and partnerships. A week after I began, my boss learned about my background in digital marketing and started assigning me tasks outside my job description. Despite a separate department handling social media, my boss, unhappy with their performance, wants me to manage both traditional and digital marketing. I‚Äôve told him I can only do one, but during a meeting where he ambushed me with other managers saying that this was a ‚Äútop management‚Äù decision and not his. He also insisted I take on both tasks without discussing additional pay or benefits. It later became clear he influenced management to assign me these tasks. HR is aware but has not addressed how this change affects my contract.

The situation has been stressful. My colleagues are already assigning me social media tasks, even though I‚Äôve not agreed to anything. My boss seems to be cornering me into accepting creating an intimidating atmosphere. 

I haven‚Äôt taken any action yet because my boss manipulates everything I say to work in his favor. I‚Äôm now considering leaving the job, as I feel used by management, and I‚Äôm worried my refusal to do the task will be used against me, with labels like ‚Äòbad work ethic‚Äô and ‚Äònot a team player.‚Äô 

What should I do?

Also, the social media task is not value-adding to me or to my career progression he just wants to use it for his goals.

1j763uh,Offered a different job whilst waiting to start a different new job,"Context - worked for a large company in my industry for the last 6 years. Was time for a change due to no clear career path upwards / internal company changes etc. 

Found another role which is quite different to what I am currently doing (but still in the same industry.. confident I have the skills needed) ¬£130k salary, 20% bonus. pension, health care etc etc. 

Was very much looking forward to to starting. Notice handed in and am currently two months into notice. A few weeks ago had a call from a number I didnt recognise. Was a recruitment guy who I've spoken to in the past. really nice guy (which I find rare with recruiters ;) ) so we have a chat and he was telling me about a role with a company who is doing great things in the industry. they have won awards, also have best workplace awards fort the last 5 years. also, and Im not sure why this matters to me, they are privately owned whereas the other company is publicly owned. after chatting to them and meeting them, they have offered me 140k, 35% bonus, but also a long term incentive plan which gives a considerable bonus when you hit targets and three years at the company. (im waiting on full details on this but I believe its 1.5 x salary) to add, this other Roll is a spitting image of the role I am currently doing, so know I could walk in and get my teeth into it from day one. 

  
So. Question is what to do? the industry is large, but also for my niche very small... so I have no doubt that me pulling out of the role I said yes to to go with this other company will have some reputation consequences. 

from a finance point of view, I know its a no brainer. But I would be keen to get the thoughts of you fine people to see what should be done. 

  
any views and thoughts would be greatly appreciated. ",Olympics2028,1,1.0,5,1741521410,2025-03-09 11:56:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j763uh/offered_a_different_job_whilst_waiting_to_start_a/,3,2025

1j75isc,Stuck in avoidance mode‚ÄîHow do you break the cycle?,"Sorry for the long post, but I really need to get this off my chest. Throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want to be identified.üôà

I graduated four years ago with a law degree from a prestigious university. I finished during the pandemic, dealing with financial insecurity and immense pressure. Throughout college, I felt out of place financially at an elite school, struggled with imposter syndrome, and lived in constant stress and anxiety‚Äîwhich ironically pushed me to achieve great results.
After graduating, I passed a civil service exam (financial stability has always been my dream), but the job is outside my field and pays minimum wage. I took it thinking job security would give me time to study without fearing unemployment. Since then, my quality of life has improved‚ÄîI have healthcare, I‚Äôm in therapy, and I started ADHD treatment. For the first time, I experienced life without constant anxiety.
But now, I‚Äôm stuck in avoidance. I know I need to pass another exam to improve my life, but I procrastinate, then perform poorly on tests‚Äîsomething that NEVER happened in college. This leads to self-criticism and frustration.
For context: I work out, have been in therapy for years, and manage anxiety, ADHD, and mild depression. I‚Äôve tried multiple techniques, approaches, and therapists. My current therapist has helped me a lot, and I‚Äôm grateful, but I feel stuck. I know what I need to do, yet I don‚Äôt do it.
I‚Äôm hoping to hear from someone who has gone through something similar. Maybe you did something (or a mix of small things) that helped you break out of avoidance in your late 20s.

Please be as realistic as possible, but if you can be kind, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Any advice is welcome.ü•∞

This was brought up in my mid-year review last year and my manager noted that I improved after that conversation and continue to do so. But I was still rated low because I still have improvement to go. I was given an improvement plan but not formally called a pip.

I'm struggling with feeling like I fit in on this team. I am still early career and feeling doubt on if engineering in general is for me. I have a masters but if feels like that has screwed me over because I came on as a level 2 engineer with level 1 engineer knowledge and now I'm underperforming. Everyone on my team that produces results faster, work 50+ hour weeks and it feels like the implication is that I should also be doing that in order to meet those expectations. I don't mind working overtime but I am not particularly inspired by this manager and often feel like there isn't more work for me to do. I ask around for more work but no one has the time to train me and would rather do it themselves so it gets done faster.

I absolutely bombed the interview because I was still learning everything and it destroyed my confidence so early on. My manage never told me why, but other women at my company said they had the same thing happen to them but their managers did tell them why. There is a policy at my company that every open position has to interview one minority and the person who that position was opened for (we have to interview for our promotions) was a white male. I'm at a loss what to do. I'm leaning towards looking for a new job while still trying to do my best in my current one.

Without getting overly specific, I‚Äôve had my eyes set on establishing my brand and business within one of the Northern European countries I‚Äôve been heavily researching and looking to possibly relocate to all together.

This plan has been on my heart and mind for many years now, and now more than ever feels like an essential time to make this decision into a reality. However‚Ä¶

The country I have in mind‚Äìamongst other countries near it as a possibility in case SHTF‚Äìmight be losing the protections they‚Äôve been receiving from NATO. This would more than likely set them up for potential conflict escalation from Russia. 

I am extremely proud and have so much love and respect for said country. They‚Äôve been liberated twice within modern history from the grips of Russia/the USSR. The citizens of this country inspire me on so many levels, both as an everyday person and a business owner.

To reiterate what I said earlier, I would love to expand and set my roots‚Äìpersonally and business-wise in this country. My business would be a boost to the country‚Äôs economy and provide jobs for others. The only hang up I‚Äôm having is that I feel stuck and hesitant with the real threat of outside aggressors coming in and causing harm if the country is left vulnerable and unable to protect itself.

On the other hand, the USA isn‚Äôt any better currently. I currently live in a blue state, and although things feel ok-ish for now, I expect a lot of deregulation across the board, along with the increased potential for the USD to lose significant value (I hope not). Regulatory agencies and protections are being stripped away. I‚Äôm afraid of the possibility of investing funds into a brick-and-mortar location just for the USD and economy to collapse at any moment. It‚Äôs clear that the USA is compromised currently. 

If you had the option to relocate to & set up your business in a country with the possibility of said country being invaded by an outside aggressor, but the country is otherwise a great place to live and work at least for now, would you take the chance?

1j6ztf0,Another longer commute question,Wife and I recently sold our rural home and moved 70 miles east to an urban area. I kept my job as I was able to make it hybrid and commute 2 days a week. She started a new job locally that turned out to be a toxic work environment. She gave 2 weeks notice and applied to several job listings in the area. Interviewed and an offer has been made. In the meantime her old job reached out to ask if she had any interest in returning. Job 1 (local) salary $49k with 2 weeks vacation. Job 2 (former job) salary $62k with 4 weeks vacation. She loved her old job and had excellent working relationships with coworkers. If she took her old job the plan would be for us to ride together 2 days a week (Monday and Friday) and then for her to drive in Tuesday stay with her mom (who lives locally) Tuesday and Wednesday night and then drive home Thursday night. If weather is bad she can work remote and after a few months would see if they would be open to at least allowing her remote 1 day a week. We have no kids and commute is 10 minutes of city and then the rest is what I would call rural/highway driving. Literally see 5 cars the whole way. 1 hr 20 minutes drive time.

1j6znmk,Laid off; want to return to previous job but there's no openings,"For context, I got my dream job back in 2020. I got along with my colleagues, managers really well. In early 2024, I got a job offer at another company... with waaaaaaay better pay. So I ended up taking that job, having to start anew, and leaving my good colleagues behind. I did not burn any bridges or mouthed off anyone.

Unfortunately, at this new job I took, I was laid off due to budget issues.

I remembered my former manager from my previous job telling me that if I wanted to come back, I could -- however, I looked at their openings and they don't align with my education and/or experience, which may hinder my chances of returning to my old workplace. I don't want to sound super desperate at this point, but, do you think it's still worth asking to come back anyway? If so, what should I say? What should I ask?

1j6zd1r,How to handle EPFO overlap of 3 days?,"Hi

I have EPF overlap of 3 days between company B and C. Prior to that I had exp of 3 years from A company.
In company B I was hired for my skillsets but they assigned to very legecy project which I felt misleading/misinformed to me.
I discussed regarding this with my manager but they refused to help. So I told to release me so that I can use my other offer.
They told it might take some time to get the documentations so I left on Monday 9th of the month and joined company C on Tuesday 10th (currently working for 2 years now).
On Wednesday I got call from B that I have to pay notice period amount, after discussing with few it friends I paid also. Same week Friday 13th they gave me only experience letter mentioning last day as Friday not Monday(left on that day).
And same thing is reflecting in EPFO portal. I mailed them several times but they refused to change. I went to EPF office and discussed the matter but they told only Employer can change.

Now changing to company D they saw in EPFO portal and asked me the reason, also they told to mention in BGV form so mentioned, looks they were ok but my doubt is still there.

Now since there is a overlap of 3 days but also I have experience letter of B company,
how I can overcome from this situation in BGV?
What I can tell to my next employer if asked about it?
How this experience letter can help me?
Is there any way to change overlap date(as B employer refused to do).
how this can impact in future? any solution?
Any other suggestions apart from asked above.

Demand Manager role: current known salary - 120k, but I believe my offer would be lower, I expect around 100k, due to currently having a lower salary. I would be able to keep my current tenure, PTO, etc. and there is little to no nights and weekends work. 

Project manager: current known salary 115k. Less PTO but more company holidays that roughly balance out. Some nights and weekends work.

I was offered a job yesterday pays $13 an hour as a security officer with a 2 on 2 off 3 schedule in other words I work 3 12s one weeks and 4 12s the other 

The first job has a one hour unpaid lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks the days I work. There is a chance of being hired on for another position that pays $13 with an opportunity to get a pay increase every six or so months up till $19 an hour currently it has no benefits.

Their second job will give benefits after 60 days.

My current living situation is I pay about $200 for car insurance and $120 for utilities a month. 

The security job comes with a security certification I honestly have a fear of work commitment I can work jobs for years but I don‚Äôt ever fully go gung ho into anything cause of the idea of working something forever I don‚Äôt actually enjoy. 

 I need to get a new car relatively soon and the $17 hour job me and a neighbor the same place so I just ride with him the last two weeks and he hasn‚Äôt made an issue of riding with him till the project over. 

Idk, what to do I have a lot of family who have worked this security job and complained about the job giving them inconsistent schedules cutting hours as they hire new people. I just got myself in a place to try and pay up some bills and idk what to do cause I got called for an interview and got hired on the spot so I have till Monday to really make a decision on what I‚Äôll do. 

They mostly younger people who really don‚Äôt have responsibilities or older family members on the verge of retirement who from what I can tell don‚Äôt have much extra money to really enjoy their time. 


I post this to see how other people see this situation and what they would do my current living situation  could remain the same for a year or more. The security job is less than 10 minutes away but is required to drive your own vehicle to the location. 

The first jobs hours are 10pm at night till 7am and the second one would be 530am to 17:30pm. 

The security job has some room for ‚Äúpromotions‚Äù idk he may of just said that cause I brought up my other job being contractor work and they spoke down on the job. 

I‚Äôm working towards getting my credit back on track and don‚Äôt have much money currently. I spent most of my check on bills and car insurance I currently don‚Äôt owe anyone till next month.

B. Negotiate a severance package with my current employer? I am not familiar with the process and only have a few weeks before I start my new job. I also don‚Äôt even know how to approach my manager with that idea AND don‚Äôt want the termination to reach my new employer.

C. Keep my current job and perform for as long as a can, while working the on the new job. I‚Äôd ultimately get fired with cause in about a month AND burn bridges with the people I work with. 

D. Give my 2 weeks notice. I would leave on a good note, have a clean record, and potentially maintain a decent relationship with a few of my colleagues following my departure.

I don‚Äôt mind all of this because I really need this job and im basically one missed check away from being homeless , the problem is that he keeps changing my schedule last minute

As of recently he been changing the schedule less than 24 hours in advance from my schedule which has caused me to miss appointments and miss out on the plans that I had scheduled and I missed a day of work because of him doing this and not notifying me . 

Aside from my personal life being effected he has also changed the schedule and put me to come in a hour earlier than I was previously scheduled also without notifying me which is making me miss out on the hours I desperately need .

I feel like the situation is out of my control and I feel targeted because my schedule is the only one being changed this frequently and I can‚Äôt keep up 

I thought about going to my district manager with the proof I have of him changing the schedule and asking if I can switch stores , I also been applying to other jobs 

I have a bunch of proof and pictures of the the schedule before and after it was changed but mentally and physically im not in a good place right now to keep up with all this and it‚Äôs not my place as im not the manager.

I had previously applied for the manager role but was denied. (My previous manager was transferred to a higher position and a different division within the company.) However, my previous manager had expressed their desire to promote me to supervisor, but the CEO refused due to budget constraints.

The VP and AVP were subsequently appointed as supervisors after I had already been in the department. The AVP had previously been my manager before her own promotion, and a new manager was chosen.

I recently received news that the supervisor position was given to someone else within our department. They conducted interviews and everything.  

Additionally, I have the longest tenure among all employees. The current AVP (previous manager) had also expressed her desire to promote me to supervisor before her own promotion to AVP.

It may seem like a significant amount of management, but our department is responsible for training over 700 employees. I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to management and my desire to transition beyond just training.

I‚Äôll be joining a quant trading firm as a systems/infra engineering intern, and I want to make the most of this opportunity. My goal is to perform well and increase my chances of securing a return offer.

Some context about my background:

* I have experience developing low-latency systems and running high-concurrency services (e.g., handling 600-700 concurrent users on a self-hosted quiz server).
* I‚Äôve worked extensively with backend development (Node.js, Python) and databases (MongoDB).
* I‚Äôve participated in multiple hackathons, often building projects that involve blockchain, cryptography, and real-time systems.
* I have experience managing infrastructure for a college intranet, which includes maintaining servers and handling networking.
* I‚Äôve also worked on projects involving WebSockets, TLS/SSL, and optimizing system performance.

For those who‚Äôve been in similar roles or have experience in the field, what advice would you give an intern in this position?

* What key skills should I focus on to stand out?
* What are common pitfalls that interns should avoid?
* Any specific areas in networking, system performance, or automation that I should double down on?
* Any general tips for thriving in a high-performance, low-latency environment?

The district I'm applying to uses an assessment called TeacherFit and TeacherFit SE. It is very clear from the questions that they are looking for student-centered, flexible, easy going candidates. The vast majority of the questions are very easy to read. 

My question:

Does answering ""strongly agree"" and ""strongly disagree"" on all of the very obvious questions help you or hurt you? I do strong agree and disagree for 99% of them. 

A handful of them are a little harder to read, and I asked about those over in r/teachers. 

I am looking for general advice on making my application strong enough to get through the screener and hopefully land me an interview. I would love to work in the district I am applying to, unless a miracle happens and I can stay where I am, which I would also like.

1j6p3t8,"Politics - Lies, manipulation, deceit and threats","My boss decided to turn face against her subordinates (my colleague and I), for reasons which I believe to be self-preservation and personal vendetta.

It started about 9 months back, where she had a 180degree change in the way she treated us (without a doubt, with intent). Gaslighting me on my attitude and work performance unevidently was just the tip of the iceberg. 

It started when I requested to pull out of a non-regulatory-compliant project / task. She made a comment which my natural reaction took it as a threat to my career progression / promotion. After trying hard, I managed to get her to agree on a 1-1 to speak. That's where the gaslighting took place the most. I even brought up how her actions have affected my colleague and my emotional and mental health. 

As you can imagine, things only got worse. Retaliation. She started to send sarcastic, passive aggressive messages, pull work away form me rather than work together, took away my analysts whom I've built trust with and trained overtime, displayed public differential treatment between analysts and myself, and of course marking down of performance grading unreasonably, making 0 room for discussion. 

I was setup to fail on all occasions thereafter, but proved myself in many occasions. I continued to be my best self and ignored all her political moves, many at times ""proving"" her wrong when she tried to catch my mistakes publicly. At the same time, I got HR and my C executive involved and aware of the matter, in which the C executive agreed that she had problems. 

To add, she hired a colleague whom she worked with before previously (let's call him ""the new manager"", and he started to execute these political acts on behalf of her as well. It was psychologically traumatising, abuse of power and something which most people would take the highway.

The final blow came when my performance grading was adjusted retrospectively. HR investigated. The new manager came out clean and shared how she blamed him for being too nice and not marking my performance grading down even more the last quarter. Their relationship took downhill thereafter.

My colleague and I were shifted to another new hire report. The migration of team was a transition which took awhile (It was poorly done since this should have been immediate under such a case). During so, she made the final threat to our performance grading, even after I have outrightly mentioned to stop all these acts of bullying. My colleague resigned.

This boss has single-handedly broken company grevience policy, and possibly even legislative employee protection on harrassment act. 

This case definitely caught the attention of the whole company and I believe everyone knows something is going on, but nobody knows the full story.

With information going around, I was informed that actions are taken to get her fired, but too much empty promises developed the trust issue inside of me, especially understanding the fact that the ultimate interest of all parties, doesn't include junior members, but either self-serving or the company.

With my performance grading having taken a hit (which i totally saw it coming since the beginning of this issue), I made the effort to find alternative ways of getting peer feedback to support my performance. 

Today, I have another job offer in line, a step up I would say. However, I strongly will not allow such acts get away without punishment. End of year results, bonus and remuneration decisions are due in the next 2 weeks. I'm waiting to see how the management handle this. I have cards which I can play, but do not want to go down the slippery slope of using these cards as a ""threat"".

1j6oo04,I think I was set up for failure since the very beginning as a Graduate Engineer,"When I first joined the company, I was excited. I had a background in Mechanical Engineering and a Master's in Product Design. I was eager to learn and grow in the field. I thought I was going to be part of a supportive team where I could develop my skills, especially in energy modelling, which I knew would be a challenging but rewarding journey. The job description seemed perfect, and they promised training and development.

But from day one, I felt the pressure mounting. I wasn‚Äôt given the time or resources I expected. Instead of starting with foundational training or being eased into the role, I was thrown into projects immediately. The software, IES, was something I had never touched before, and yet I was expected to perform on a client project for a primary school. I wasn‚Äôt given the chance to learn the basics of modelling or energy analysis‚Äîno time to get comfortable or get up to speed. Instead, I was expected to deliver results quickly.

The company, though, was short-staffed, and it seemed like no one had the time or energy to support me properly. My manager was often too busy to help, and the rest of the team, despite being very talented, was just as overwhelmed. I had to reach out to senior engineers constantly, but I was told I was asking ""too many questions."" I felt like a burden, but at the same time, I needed guidance. The fact that they didn‚Äôt have a mentor available to me despite being told I would have one was one of the first red flags I missed. They admitted after a month that they couldn‚Äôt afford a mentor. It was all so disheartening, and I was trying to keep up, but I was drowning.

A month in, I hadn‚Äôt even been given the basics. I was still learning about the standards, codes, and software. But clients were already demanding results from me. I didn‚Äôt even know how to properly navigate through the software at that point. I wasn‚Äôt prepared to take on such a responsibility with no proper guidance. I felt blindsided and unprepared.

When the feedback came in, it was harsh. They made it clear they weren‚Äôt happy with my performance, but at that point, I was still struggling to even understand the basics of what was expected. They didn‚Äôt tell me the full truth about what I needed to be doing or the support I would get. They simply expected results, fast, without understanding the reality of the situation.

I was frustrated, confused, and feeling incredibly isolated. I reached out for support, but I felt like I was constantly asking for help that never came. I was trying my best, but without a mentor or the proper tools, how could I have succeeded? There was no clear communication about what was expected of me, and I was left to figure it out on my own in an environment that was not conducive to learning or development.

Then came the breaking point. My manager and senior engineers didn‚Äôt even take the time to assess my progress properly. They didn‚Äôt check in regularly with me. Only when performance reviews came up was I told I wasn‚Äôt doing well enough, even though I had been putting in all my effort. It felt like everything I did wasn‚Äôt good enough because I was judged by standards that I hadn‚Äôt been properly trained on. Instead of a clear roadmap to success, I was constantly facing new challenges with no support or feedback.

It was clear they were more concerned about getting results than helping me grow in the role. I was a graduate with no energy modelling experience, and yet I was expected to perform at the level of someone who had been doing this for years. How could they not understand that? My manager, when he did interact with me, never offered constructive feedback or guidance he simply criticized my efforts, only when he was with my boss in front of me without providing a way forward.

I wasn‚Äôt lazy. I wasn‚Äôt unqualified. I was just inexperienced, and that‚Äôs what they failed to see. I was thrown into a role with too much responsibility and no help, and when I wasn‚Äôt able to meet their unrealistic expectations, they blamed me. It was a toxic situation where I felt blamed for their lack of planning and support. They promised mentorship, and they didn‚Äôt deliver. They promised a learning environment, but they didn‚Äôt create one.

Eventually, I felt like the only option was to leave. I had nothing left to give. I was constantly stressed and demoralized. I wasn‚Äôt growing or learning; I was just trying to survive. And when I was let go, it stung. I didn‚Äôt even get the chance to redeem myself, to show them that I could succeed with proper support. Instead, they wrote me off as incapable, even though I had made strides in the limited time I had been given. 

Now, looking back, it‚Äôs clear to me that they never wanted to invest in my growth. They saw me as a problem to fix, instead of someone to mentor and develop. I was just a cog in a machine, expected to function without the proper resources. I regret not seeing the red flags sooner, but the lack of proper onboarding, mentorship, and communication were all huge warning signs that I missed.

 The company failed to provide what they promised, and in the end, they made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt good enough when I was simply placed in an impossible situation. They let me go since last week and although initially I felt relief, I just feel anger and it felt like an easy way out for them, but they failed to look at the whole picture. And now, I have to pick up the pieces and move forward in this mess of a job market.

1j6nlya,"Feelings of dread, how to get the most from a wrong first job?","Disclaimer: I live in EMEA region

28M, Master's Degree in engineering management.
My academic resume isn't doing me any favor: low GPA and more time needed to graduate. (My fault: wasnt serious until 22 yo)

6 months ago I started working in engineering consultancy thanks to an internship. Recently they wanted to hire me to work on a medium sized project (low end of 1-5 M$ scale) for a big player in the energy sector. But it will be a 6 months project far away from home. Role would be manufacturing engineer and I'd work in one of the biggest factories in my country.

I accepted because job market is not very good and I tought any work experience is better than no work experience.

I know I am not a ""hands-on"" kind of person, I don't want to work in manufacturing after those 6 months, but the tought of never landing a job without any work experience was making me miserable too.

Now (I'll start on 2 days) I am experiencing feelings of dread constantly, I am afraid I'll be pigeon holed in manufacturing given this will be my only full time work experience. (And because of my age)

Ideally, I'd like to work on a more IT-like role (ERP for example, or some kind of analyst role), basically a more ""boring"" (not for me tho) office job.

Am I screwed? How can I get the most from this experience to have a little bit of leverage to job hunt in 6 months, looking for basically a completely different career? (Junior roles of course)

It wasn't until the end of my 2nd interview that they told me the position is actually for a different location approx an hr away from me. I wasn't very enthusiastic about that but where I had landed the position by this point in conversation I figured something was better than nothing. I've been with them less than a month. Today I get a notification about a job posting for the position I'm in with the company I work for advertising a location much closer to me with a salary range that starts 4k higher than what I was offered. I understand I took the position so in their eyes they bought my labor fair nd square. I'm by no means attached or invested in this company or position but I do enjoy the job itself and can see myself excelling at it. I'm curious how others would navigate the situation regarding pay.

1j6nc74,When your questions impress the interviewer,"Last week, I had a two-hour in-person interview, and one thing they emphasized beforehand was to come prepared with questions to ask throughout the process. I normally bring my ‚Äústandard five‚Äù questions to interviews two of which are: What does success look like in this role? and What are some of the current challenges facing the team right now? But I knew that for an interview of this length, I‚Äôd need more than my usual go-to set.

As the conversation unfolded, I also asked some ""popcorn-style"" questions to clarify points they raised. It felt less like a Q&A and more like a collaborative discussion. They mentioned being impressed by my questions and even said it felt like they were being interviewed too, which, honestly, is how interviews should be. It‚Äôs not just about me jumping through mental hoops to give the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù answers but about having an actual dialogue, building mutual respect, and figuring out if this is a good fit on both sides.

For anyone prepping for interviews, here‚Äôs the full list of questions I used. Hopefully, they‚Äôll inspire you to craft or adapt your own:

1. What counts as success to you in this role?

2. How would you describe the ideal person for this job?

3. Can you outline what my first four weeks might look like in this role?

4. What are some of the biggest challenges in this position right now?

5. How is feedback given in this role? Are there regularly scheduled performance reviews, or is it as needed?

6. How do you, as a hiring manager, handle feedback from your team?

7. How do you handle change or uncertainty within the company?

8. What's something the team is doing today that they weren‚Äôt doing a year ago?

9. What are your favorite and least favorite things about working here?

10. What is one question that you wish candidates would ask more often?

11. Based on everything we talked about today, is there anything I can clarify or elaborate on?

This experience was a great reminder of how important it is to stay engaged, curious, and adaptable during interviews. The questions you ask matter just as much as the answers you give, so don't be afraid to make it a two-way street.",BlackBoyNamaste,97,0.9900000095367432,3,1741458121,2025-03-08 18:22:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j6nc74/when_your_questions_impress_the_interviewer/,3,2025

I do not have a degree in a related field or any college beyond my AA in liberal arts. I wouldn't mind going back to school. I loved school but Im also scared and Im 29 now. What if the other kids make fun of me? Anyways, I have no student loan debt or any debt related to school, currently. My AA is from paying school on my own or grants in community college. 

 For laughs, I applied to a local university to see what my associates (and a few random classes I took in the past) could get me. For a degree in Buisness Analytics, Im about half way done, which is more than I expected to transfer over. All I need are the Business Analytic classes and some math. I would have to take a loan out to finish this degree but considering I have never had this kind of debt before, is this worth the investment? I really want to take the ""programming for DA's"" course at least. 

Maybe I'm not looking into other revenues? I could just self teach everything, which is how I got my job now.

I just found out that I‚Äôve been on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for over a month ‚Äî and my manager never told me.

I worked hard to address it, and by December (in my annual performance review), my manager acknowledged my improvements and said he‚Äôs seen a ‚Äúnight and day difference.‚Äù Since then, our weekly 1:1s have been positive, and there‚Äôs been no indication that my performance was in question.

You only have 20 days left.‚Äù I was confused because this was the first time I had ever heard of a PIP. He admitted he didn‚Äôt tell me earlier because he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to ruin my PTO.‚Äù

I went back and reviewed the PIP, and the entire thing is copy-pasted from my October feedback ‚Äî feedback I already addressed and received positive recognition for improving. There was no mention of it in my December annual performance review, nor was it ever brought up in our 1:1s since then.

Now, I‚Äôm being told my PIP is almost done, and if I sign it, it will ‚Äújust disappear.‚Äù But I‚Äôm starting to feel like this was designed to quietly push me out.

1j6jl2z,How do I stop letting my coworker‚Äôs attitude affect and bother me?,"How do I stop letting my coworker‚Äôs attitude affect and bother me? 

TLDR: I have a passive aggressive, negative, and snarky coworker who is very unpredictable and you can never expect what mood she will be in. I have to work in close proximity to her every day and I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to stop letting her bother me. 

As some background, I work closely with 3 coworkers on a daily basis. I have a problematic coworker (she is the same age as me and we hold the same job title). 

The problematic coworker seems to only have 2 moods: 1) talkative or 2) extremely moody and passive aggressive. When she is in mood #1, she only ever talks about herself. When she is in mood #2, it becomes everyone else‚Äôs problem because it seems impossible to ignore. Any little thing will set her off and it will end with any person who approaches her getting attitude. It‚Äôs frustrating because if I come into work trying to have a good day when she happens to be in this mood, the effort is instantly quelled. I constantly feel like I am walking on eggshells around her and I can never fully relax because I never know what type of mood she will be in. 

Ive noticed that it‚Äôs usually not what she says that bothers me, but how she says it. She has a very snarky tone that instantly makes me feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong. She‚Äôs the type of person that can dish out attitude left and right but can‚Äôt tolerate it when the same attitude is dished back to her (not that I have ever dished it back). When she says something in a snarky tone I usually try my best to ignore it, but it still bothers me. I have never approached her to tell her how her attitude affects me, and I feel that even if I tried, it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it because in her head she‚Äôs always right. 

There were 2 specific times when she completely crossed the line by raising her voice/ yelling at me (both over a year ago now). Completely unacceptable in the workplace in my opinion. I wish I would have stood up for myself looking back. It was when I was new at the job, and I was too focused on learning and doing the job well. I didn‚Äôt have the time or resources to report her to HR or anything like that. Even if I wanted to do something about it now, it would all be here-say because I don‚Äôt remember all the details, on top of our manager/ higher ups not being regularly involved with what we‚Äôre doing. 

I am naturally a pretty anxious person. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm just overly sensitive to other people‚Äôs moods and emotions. 

My other coworkers aren‚Äôt AS bad but they are slightly problematic as well ‚Äî they tend to gossip a lot and are constantly negative. I do not trust any of them. The whole situation really sucks because the job itself is great (nice hours, pays well, plenty of downtime unlike other jobs in my industry), the issue is the people. I know the answer that many people will probably say, and it‚Äôs right‚Äî I need to leave and find a better job. While this is true, I need to figure out what to do in the meantime. 

I‚Äôm open to any thoughts or advice you may have. Thank you for reading!",Thin_Acanthaceae4510,1,1.0,3,1741447925,2025-03-08 15:32:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j6jl2z/how_do_i_stop_letting_my_coworkers_attitude/,3,2025

1j6fwl5,Seeking advice on leveraging Manager support for a promotion in a different team,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently looking to move into a higher-level role within my company that recently opened up. My manager is generally supportive and has expressed praise and confidence in my performance in my current role - with feedback specifically saying that i surpass colleagues in my grade in many ways. My manager is aware of my interest in this role and advancing my role.  

However, the internal opportunity landscape is quite limited in my current team, and it might take a few years for something to materialize due to budget constraints and internal politics.

Hence, I want to make the most of my manager‚Äôs support in this situation for the move into a higher role, different team. 

What are the best ways to leverage his backing to ensure I‚Äôm well-positioned when the right opportunity arises? Specifically, I‚Äôm looking for advice on:

1. How to ask my manager for (like speaking to the hiring manager or advocating for me) for this opportunity ? 
2. What kind of internal networking strategies I can employ.
3. Any tips on maintaining visibility and momentum during this period.
4. Any other dos and dont would be appreciated. 



Thanks in advance for your advice.

1j6c75d,My boss treats me like I have no experience.,"I have been in manufacturing for about 10 years. I started as a polisher/deburrer, moved to cnc machining, learned how to do edit programs. Worked on continuous improvement and corrective action projects to improve quality of parts/find root cause of an issue and implement a solution. Did my own set ups and measured my parts in 2 machine cells. Worked in inspection. Measuring parts with all kinds of assets- bore gages, calipers, comparator, mics, ball mics, blade mics, height stands, etc etc. I have ran CMM machines. Been on a six sigma team. Etc. Been all over in manufacturing over the 10 years. Have a bachelor's degree in quality engineering. 4.0 GPA. 

My current role is a blend between quality technician and quality engineer. Lots of administrative tasks like vendor management, document control, managing corrective actions, etc. I also do internal audits, ensure compliance to AS9100 in our procedures and processes, manage our database of supplier info, Certs, 1st articles, etc etc. I do alot! And I really enjoy my job. 

Sometimes the way my boss talks to me, it seems like he has no idea about my previous experience in manufacturing. He talks to me not only like this is my first job in manufacturing but that's it's my first job ever in life. 

I want to know why he talks to me like I am inexperienced. I want to know if he knows anything about my previous work experience. Genuinely just want to understand where he is coming from when he says stuff like he will say ""you gotta find your own rhythm, make a to do list and check off tasks when you finish them"", when i am not asking for help or expressing any issues. & I have an excel spreadsheet with a monthly tab and daily tab for to dos. I have various excel spreadsheets for new vendor on boarding, document control plans, corrective action management, etc. Pretty much every task/thing that i manage, I have created a spreadsheet for so I can track my progress and easily see where each item is at. It seems like making a to do list is something you would tell to a recent college grad who is interning, or to an 18 year old who is just entering the industry. Not to someone who has been in the same field for 10 years and who is 34 years old.  

I don't think I need to show him every single thing I finish, or show off my productivity tools. He sees my audit reports, he approves my documentation improvements before they are released, he sees on his corrective action reports that i am always keeping them moving along and getting them closed out on time/before due dates. He approves my work and barely ever expresses anything negative about my work. He also doesn't acknowledge my work in a positive way, at least to me, he doesn't ever say good job, or give me tips on how to improve, etc.

Just seems like there is a disconnect from when he is approving my work and seeing all the reports showing I am on time - to how he speaks to me in person. 

Maybe this is just his personality? I am not sure what to do. I want to talk to him but I am not sure how to start the conversation. I've thought about asking him if he was ever given my resume prior to me being hired. I interviewed with His boss, so the question isn't me being a smart ass, just genuinely curious that maybe he actually never saw my resume? 

Any advice on how to begin/go about this conversation with him would be appreciated. I want to express that I feel like he basically talks to me like I am a child and hopefully we can find a better way to communicate or clear up any misconceptions that could be in the air.

The final straw that set me off on considering quitting is when I asked for a couple weeks off so I could go to a friend‚Äôs wedding out of state, they told me no and were rude about it. (I have never requested time off until now.)

1j6bmbx,Advice needed - Tech Sales to Software Engineering,"
Hi, I currently work as an account manager for a product based tech company and am considering switching to software engineering.

I graduated with a business degree last year and got this role straight out of college, I have been in this role for about 8 months. 

To talk a bit about my role, I am responsible for driving sales - from generating funnel to closure of deals and also maintaining the accounts by building good rapport and addressing there day to day issues.

I wish to transition to software engineering, have learnt a bit of python in college but that's about it. Want your suggestion on what roles I can try for and how feasible is it for me to try for this role.

Also, I will be able to dedicate 2 hours a day to learn the languages in weekdays and more hours during weekends.

TL;DR : currently work in tech sales, want to transition to software engineering but have a business degree and beginner knowledge on programming

1j6bemw,I need some advice on negotiating a promotion.,"I work for a startup and promotions are coming up next month. I‚Äôm in an operations role at an Associate level, fully remote, $60K base salary. The next level up is Senior Associate, which pays anywhere from $70K-$80K at my job (based on other external job listings).

Outside of work, I also run a social media account which my leadership team ended up finding. I keep it pretty lowkey, but some people like my manager already knew about it. It has a fairly large following, and my leadership team were interested in having me create content for the company, but this would be outside of my normal job duties, and more than likely require me to use my own equipment. 

I‚Äôm definitely not opposed to this as it‚Äôs interesting and is something I‚Äôm passionate about. However, I also want to make sure I‚Äôm being smart about how to approach this.

If offered (and assuming compensation for content work), would it be better to ask to have content production work done as a contractor, and continue regular job duties as a W2? 

I‚Äôm not entirely sure how much content they would want me to make, and I wouldn‚Äôt want this to eat into my normal job duties.

Now i want to set other goals for my life. long term goals. basically my priority goal that i care most about. which i think will be related to career.

There are some paths in my head:

\- Studying Masters in my country

\- applying for universities abroad (basically immigration to better countries through this)

\- go work for someone

\- start a company

They're all long term goals. That mean I should work on them at least for 1 year. That's why I'm overthinking about them a lot to evaluate each path to see which one fits me best.

I want to make money and move toward financial independence, that's why money is one of the important factors to me.

Job 1 Pros - higher salary pay + low employee benefit contribution ($15-30 a check) + remote + unlimited PTO. job security as they know what works and they just need me to do it. 

Job 1 cons - another 5 people will be hired with me - I‚Äôm scared they are over hiring and that can lead to layoffs? I mentioned it to HR and she told me the company is growing and making money so overall they are just hiring as needed. The HR team is also bringing on more people. They offer a lot of product so I can see why they need more so not a huge concern but, not sure how I can grow with so many people. They are big on metrics and revenue so there will be that pressure of hitting that revenue KPI month over month - they were very transparent about that. 

Job 2 pros - I‚Äôm the only hire and they have a new team (they‚Äôve only been there for a few months as they have new leadership and want to invest more in that department) I would help build the marketing strategy from the ground up with my manager - so def room to grow and will look great on paper! In a few years when they hopefully grow more, the people hired will naturally be under me so I have that lead on moving up. 

Cons - hourly pay but it is only $2K less annually than job 1. But with hourly comes vacation accrual instead of unlimited pto. medical benefits are priced more too - will be about $50 each paycheck. 
Another concern, how secure is a job that is building out something new? Versus a job that has the blueprint down. Also hybrid work schedule, I don‚Äôt mind it but remote is a plus.

So long story short I was a Journeyman lineman and worked for a city I was making $50 hr with some decent OT and a take home truck and free benefits. Did not enjoy the people and hated my drive took me 2hours to get home most days and when we had our daughter I decided to leave.

I‚Äôm currently a distribution system operator for a local co op, make $37 hr and free benefits and it‚Äôs about a 50 min drive.
Possible promotion coming up which will put me at $40hr and we get a small 5-10% bonus every year as well and supposedly consistent 5% cost of living raises every year . I absolutely hate my schedule 

I have an opportunity (pretty much an offer) to go to another company as a Transmission System operator where start pay would be between $38.50 -$40hr insurance is great not free but really good, better PTO, hellacious retirement package, and once I pass my NERC exam pay can go from $88,000-110,000 a year until I finish in house training which take about 6 months to a year then pay range is between $110,000 - 132,000 ( lower end of these numbers more likely.) but they have a $12,000 bonus as a trainee $16,000 bonus once I pass my test and $24,000 bonus once I make Operator and they do a DuPont schedule which is a lot better than my current schedule as I‚Äôll only work night shift once a month. As well as consistent COL raises 
Only kicker is it‚Äôs about a hour and a half drive home.

Or I have an opportunity to go back to being a Journeyman lineman/Troubleman. Loved my job just hated being away from my new daughter so much.
That job offer $57 hr Monday -Friday 7-3:30 no weekends and no call out (only stay over to catch calls if needed and storms) benefits are decent, pto is good, and retirement is alright, lots of OT from storms and staying late and will make the most overall throughout year also has a decent bonus system as well.

I was lied to about something related to his position because no one on my team likes working with him. 

I dealt with this for a year, tried to quit, they put me on call instead but never called for anything. I reached out and they actually needed me back because properties were asking for me to work again.

There's no PTO, there's an under payment somewhat, I was also lied to about a position but also some other things. One of my guys keeps telling me I am more genuine than my boss, they all come to me before they go to management since I have knowledge and actually help them.

I have engaged with several recruiters at the same company and the most recent one I have seems to be engaging me the most, at least to what I can ascertain. 

He reached out to me a while back for a position but after I applied he said I needed more experience/I was not what they were looking for. However, after he said to keep in touch. 

We have shared a few emails for the last several months and my most recent one I emailed him informing him I applied for a position. He got back to me again saying they would not be moving forward with my application. But we should keep in touch. 

Should I take this at face value? Is it worth pursuing further?

The field is different than what I do but I‚Äôve been spending a lot of time self educating and trying to do things at my work that would apply to the new role in the new field.

1j64jlg,Marketing ~> STEM? What degree should I consider?,"Marketing ~> STEM? What degree should I consider?

TLDR: I have a bunch of marketing, project management and visual asset creation skills but want to transition into a STEM field where I can use those in a more specialized field. Ideally remote and global working possibilities. What fields or degrees should I consider?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I would love some insights or ideas for what to go back to school for and especially want perspective from folks knowledgeable in STEM fields in global markets. I know there are so many jobs I‚Äôve never even considered exist. Currently mid-30s. Lesbian, so LGBTQ+ friendly industries helpful. 

I do not have a degree, but have built a successful career as a commercial photographer and photojournalist, as well as project managing/producing video assets and documentaries. I shoot for global brands and magazines at a pretty high level (not like cover of vogue but celebrities on billboards, mid-level magazine covers, etc). My job is so much more than just taking photos ‚Äî- I have managed teams of subcontractors all around the world, help companies come up with their creative vision, manage project budgets of 100k+ per project juggling overlapping projects at the same time, write contracts, interview subjects & develop storyboard for documentary, synthesize complex information and find bite size ways to communicate to the target audience. And of course all the admin that comes along with owning your own business and doing complex books/taxes. I have worked lots in food, ag systems, on boats/ships for conservation, stories on climate impact to ecosystems, etc. I am also B1 in Spanish and studying daily to get my skills up. 

I want to leverage my current skillset as I consider what STEM field to pursue that offers me more ability to work from home, live abroad, hopefully won‚Äôt be displaced by AI, potential for both contract work or traditional employment, and slightly less ageism than my current industry (you really don‚Äôt see many folks doing what I do over 40-45). I‚Äôm hoping that with some sort of environmental science, biology, engineering, healthcare degree, etc. my current skillset could be an asset in helping me get a late start in the field. Maybe some STEM industries could use folks with strong communication and project managing backgrounds? I also could probably b-line into technical sales as a lot of my job pitching to clients involves sales. I excelled in school including math/science so I‚Äôm not worried about any particular degree being prohibitively difficult though I know it‚Äôll be a lot of work! I dropped out on academic scholarship to travel the world as a kid, so I already have about 2 years of transferable credits done from when I was younger towards most BS type degrees. 

So‚Ä¶ what should I consider? What careers might I be overlooking? I know that‚Äôs a broad question but I am truly open to anything and hoping to hear ideas I might not have considered otherwise. 

Extra info about my interests:
I can become interested in just about anything as long as it‚Äôs not actively harming communities ‚Äî- I spend my free time reading about T cells or animal linguistics or carbon capture for fun on the weekends. I particularly love the ocean, evolution/biology, animal linguistics, climate impact, soil systems, space, but also enjoy health care and learning about things like virology, pharmaceutics, etc.

I am also open to paying for a career counselor or advisor of some sort if anyone has used one they actually think is worth something.

1j640mv,My manager extended my probation period saying I‚Äôm not friendly enough with coworkers. Need advice and maybe insight?,"Okay I‚Äôve never posted on Reddit before so forgive me if this would be better suited to another community. 

I,25F, left my remote job back in early December last year to take a new role at an office job doing something completely different. In this new job I don‚Äôt deal with any customers or clients, I solely communicate with coworkers. (Basically it‚Äôs those coworkers who handle the customers face to face, I work behind the scenes). My department is very small. It was just my manager, my lead and another person who is now transitioning to be leaving. 

A few days ago I had a performance review again before what was supposed to be the end of my 90 probation period. My manager started it off by saying ‚Äú I know this is hypocritical for me to say since I missed a week of work being sick but I‚Äôm worried about your attendance these last 90 days.‚Äù 

For background before my manager got sick my team lead was out sick for an entire week. I then got sick from the same thing but because I was on probation I only took 2 unpaid days off which my manager encouraged me to do. Then about a month and half ago I had a bad migraine which unfortunately fell during our busiest day of the week. I asked if I could have a few hours off so hopefully medicine would work and I could come in that afternoon. My manager asked I messaged her before I come back in. When I messaged her before coming back I told her I was a little better and could handle the rest of the day. My manager responded to not worry about it as they had the day handled and to please just take care of myself. Believing her to be sincere I said okay. The only other time I took off was the day before our unplanned review meeting where I had another bad migraine (not on our busy day) and asked if it would be okay if I took the day off. As up until this point she made it a habit to tell both me and the rest of the team that taking care of our health is more important to her. 

Getting back to the performance review I said okay and then we went over, like above why I was out those days, and she told me she knows I can‚Äôt control having got sick (btw when I say sick I mean full committing and other issues type of gross sick). She then proceeds to go on and explain that she doesn‚Äôt like how I‚Äôm not sociable enough. That even if I fake it, our ‚Äúdepartment is under a microscope and no one cares how you‚Äôre feeling so you need to always be smiling and going out of your way to talk to people if they come back to our area‚Äù. She then said, ‚Äú I have had no complaints about your friendliness from anyone I just think you should talk more because I want more people to get to know you.‚Äù

Now for some background with me, yes I‚Äôm a huge introvert. I have 2 close friends and that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm close with my family but I live alone. However I have always worked in offices so I know how to be professionally friendly with the good mornings, happy Fridays, and participate in office lead group activities. 

I‚Äôll admit I was kinda out of depth during this meeting and felt more like she was judging and attacking my character as a quieter person rather than my actual performance at the job. Which she stated,‚Äù you are doing really good job‚Äù ‚Äúyour very task oriented‚Äù. But she seems upset I‚Äôm not leaving my work to go chat to people enough. I tried to politely explain that I do love this job and my work but that I like to keep my work and private life separate. Her facial expression seemed almost surprised by this like she didn‚Äôt understand. But to wrap this up, Because of this she said she‚Äôs extending my probation period by a month and we will see where I am at then. 

I spoke with my family and a friend about this situation as at my last performance review 2 months ago she also mention how I‚Äôm not social enough. Based on some other observations of my manager and how she loves to talk to everyone my family/friends think that maybe she is upset that I‚Äôm not acting like a friend to her and that I don‚Äôt fit in with the vibe she likes. 

I guess I‚Äôm here to ask is this normal for a performance review. At my last job my manager acknowledged that I‚Äôm task orientated and not super social but that she didn‚Äôt mind and wanted me to be me because I did such great work. So outside of attendance, which I‚Äôm just not trusting she actually cares about us and will not be taking anything unplanned again, how do I go about being social enough for her to be happy and not feel like I‚Äôll loose my job over it?

(TLDR: manager extending probation and has told me in two performance reviews that‚Äôs I‚Äôm good at my job but she doesn‚Äôt like that I‚Äôm only task oriented and not talking with coworkers outside of work related topics. No I do not work in a place where customer service is applicable and it‚Äôs rare that I see the people I work with as many are in different cities.)

Lots of my classmates and staff encourage me to give it another shot but there is also no guarantee that I might pass the academy a second time and I am feeling burnt out.

I also have the opportunity to return to my old job.

If I go to back to police academy

The pros are:

* The police academy will pay me 56 dollars an hour. If I pass and actually get a career started the job is very high pay.
* Higher prestige job
* Lots of people support me going this path from my background investigator to active police who expressed faith in me

Cons:

High stress

* No guarentee of passing, I might fail out and be out of a job again.
* No life flexibility or freedom. It is a paramilitary enviorment and I have to stay on campus for the entire time. It is like my life is put on hold.
* Might fail prohbation after the academy
* Just lots and lots of pit falls.
* Dangerous job

Go back to my old job

Pros

* job is very stable, no risk of lay off or termination
* already know the job and coworkers
* access to gym and amneties
* can study and go to online school while working, pursue other projects due to more personal flexibility
* Can moonlight and work other jobs and work other jobs to make a little extra money if needed on weekends.

Cons

* Pay is around 30 dollars an hour
* mind numbing work
* low prestige

1j5xnu5,23 and lost with what to do,"Trigger warning (mentions of sexual assault)
TL;DR 
Had to take a break from teacher training because of my poor health. I have a part time job and I've signed up to teaching agencies for supply work but I'm scared and I don't know what to do from here.

Main body:
Hi all, I (23M) am married to my wife (29F) and I'm currently lost on what to do. I live in the UK and I was completing teacher training PGCE. I had a massive battle with mental health and a travesty with my health as when I started the course, I had only just recovered from a second bout of pneumonia. I have a long history of back issues which can make walking difficult for me. I'm allergic to opium so my choice of painkiller is limited.  To cut a long story short, I had been working 70 hour weeks to try and keep on top of the work load and I feel like I just crashed and burned. I had a very nasty chest infection which nearly turned in pneumonia round 3 and I has my back flare up again. 

I had to take a break in training because of my failing health and because I had to take 3 weeks off because of it. I was unsupported in my training as it felt like it was very sink or swim. I loved teaching and getting the lesson sorted, I just hated everything else around it. Because of my health I've got a patchy resume which has seen me do LOADS of voluntary work but actual employment is mainly agency or mental health work. I really don't want to go back into care as I have been assaulted, stabbed, SA'd and injured in most ways. 

I'm absolutely terrified of what might come next and I feel like I can't do much. I'm a published author and gallery artist but I'm struggling to keep down something for a long time because of my health.

Some advice would be very welcome. ",Kebbabins,1,1.0,0,1741375542,2025-03-07 19:25:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5xnu5/23_and_lost_with_what_to_do/,3,2025

Since then, I‚Äôve been preparing for UPSC, but things have been tough financially at home, and now I desperately need a job.

To add some job-oriented skills, I also did a Data Analytics course from UpGrad, but honestly, I wasn‚Äôt super into it at the time. It was more like, ""Do something, get a job"" kind of pressure from my parents. Now that I actually need a job, I feel lost.

The biggest problem?

1. No technical degree ‚Äì Most jobs in data analytics ask for CS/IT backgrounds, which I don‚Äôt have.


2. No interview calls ‚Äì I know a decent amount, but I don‚Äôt even know where to apply properly, and whatever I do apply for, I don‚Äôt get responses.



At this point, I just really need to start earning because the financial stress is making everything harder, including my UPSC prep. I‚Äôm open to any job where my skills could be useful‚Äîanalytics, finance, anything that works.

1j5wd0d,Quit My Job Due to a Toxic Coworker‚ÄîNow They Want Me Back. Not Sure What to Do.,"I‚Äôm 21, and I resigned from my job yesterday. I had been with the company for a year and was recently promoted to Service Technician. The main reason I left was a toxic coworker in my department, along with some issues I had with my manager and just general burnout.

This coworker had a reputation for causing drama and spreading rumors. The first major issue I had with her was when she falsely accused me of smoking pot in the parking lot, which led to HR and management questioning me the next day. She only got a write-up for it. Before I even moved to this department, she had already caused problems with other teams and had been warned or written up before.

She wasn‚Äôt an essential worker, always had an attitude, loved gossip, and barely did any work. She spent most of her time in the manager‚Äôs office for hours while claiming she was behind on work.

This week was my breaking point. I had a question about a client she had emailed, so I went to ask her, but she immediately gave me a nasty attitude, claiming she didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. I reminded her that we had just discussed it two days ago, and she blew up at me, saying she had too much on her plate. I stayed calm and told her to relax, which only made her more aggressive. She started yelling, and I really had to hold back from going off on her.

The worst part? My manager was right there and saw everything. Her response? A simple hand gesture for ‚Äòus‚Äô to calm down while looking at me the entire time. Later, I went to talk to her about it, and she basically defended my coworker, saying, ‚ÄúMaybe she was right because you didn‚Äôt have the paperwork.‚Äù I had the paperwork in my hand. The conversation led nowhere, and at that moment, I decided I was done.

So, I resigned.

Fast forward to today, one day after quitting, and I get a message from the lab director (my manager‚Äôs boss). She told me they fired the coworker and apologized for the hostile work environment. She said she wished she had caught it sooner and that she‚Äôd love for me to come back, even offering an employee incentive.

Then, an hour later, I get a call from the company‚Äôs director (the FINAL boss, lol). She said she was really disappointed to hear why I left and offered to negotiate a PTO increase or whatever I wanted to come back.

Now I don‚Äôt know what to do.

When I first got this job, I started as an assembler and got promoted in six months, which I never expected, especially with just a high school diploma. But I don‚Äôt feel like things will actually change if I go back. My manager, the one who saw everything and did nothing, is still in charge of me. The company is too laid-back, which is nice at times but also a problem. Plus, I wasn‚Äôt getting proper training for my role, which made my job stressful and overwhelming.

Yesterday, I was 100% sure about my decision. Now, after their offers, I‚Äôm not so sure. Should I go back? Would love to hear some opinions.",Automatic-Policy-860,243,0.9399999976158142,144,1741372865,2025-03-07 18:41:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5wd0d/quit_my_job_due_to_a_toxic_coworkernow_they_want/,3,2025

To make a long story short he messed something up for one of the clients and the compliance officer told him they would like him to resign.  For what it‚Äôs worth, his boss wanted to keep him.

1j5vqxu,Sales vs Consulting Career Choice,"It would be to hear some perspective on my current career dilemma.

I‚Äôve recently started a role in sales at a promising SaaS startup. The team are great and opportunity to grow in a fast-paced environment are exciting.  I‚Äôm able to make hands-on contributions not just in sales, but in helping shape the product and sales process itself. It‚Äôs exciting to be part of something where my input directly impacts the product and the company‚Äôs growth. The team culture is fantastic. However, I never saw myself in a sales role until I got this job, and I worry about whether it‚Äôs the right fit for my career.

At the same time, I have an offer for an Associate's role management consulting, which provides a more structured career development path and strong long-term prospects. However, I‚Äôve heard the culture isn't great, the work is draining, and that it takes longer to make a real impact compared to the hands-on experience I‚Äôm getting in the startup.

I‚Äôm torn between:

1. Taking a chance on the startup, where I feel I‚Äôll thrive in the culture but risk sales not working out. 
2. Choosing the consulting path, which offers stability but might not have the same supportive team dynamic.

1j5vqoc,Would you accept this offer?,"Hi all, for background I worked at a large public company as a merchandise planner analyst, then moved to a smaller private company to be a financial analyst. Started my career in 2021 at 21 years old and am now 25. My starting salary was 65,000 at my first job and that slowly crept up to about 73,000 before I left after a year and 10 months. I accepted the offer as a financial analyst at 75,000 and after 2 years and some small raises I‚Äôm at about 78,000 now. 

I recently was offered a chance to interview for a senior buyer position internally which included a conversation with the team as well as an excel test. Today they told me they couldn‚Äôt offer me that position but told me they still wanted me in the department as a ‚Äúsupply chain analyst‚Äù. I was quite disappointed as I wasn‚Äôt expecting that but kind of figured I didn‚Äôt start out in purchasing so it made more sense. However, I would be doing the work of an analyst and a buyer and my career path would be ‚Äúa more advanced analyst or a category manager‚Äù which both aren‚Äôt really intriguing to me. Needless to say I‚Äôm disappointed that it‚Äôs a lateral move since I‚Äôve already been at an analyst level for almost 4 years. I know job titles aren‚Äôt super important but I feel like I‚Äôve hit a glass ceiling lol. I asked if it could be considered a senior analyst role and they said ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt exist in this department‚Äù. They also said I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience which is discouraging in general.

The offer is 2 weeks PTO (which I have now), 8% increase which comes out to about 82500 after specifics, and my own office. They didn‚Äôt give much room for negotiation on any of this. Should I stay at the company and accept this or just look externally with my current role?

1j5vq8h,Start Lying in Interviews‚Ä¶ and still pass the background check,"The quick idea here is that if you pretend to have worked for a staffing company, background verifiers will check the staffing company and NOT your employer. This is normal, no one thinks anything strange about it. You use that by redirecting the verification to a legitimate staffing company that you control (or one that you‚Äôve paid to cover for you), and then you can get yourself verified. This happens all the time, especially in IT but also some other fields such as finance.¬†

The only issue is that you need to make the staffing company appear legitimate (phone tree, website, business license, etc) but that is all doable by yourself. I did it myself after all.

And before people lecture us about ethics (those poor, poor recruiters!), I'd say that different rules apply for business and personal life. Lying to an employer is not the same as lying to your spouse.

1j5vfwx,Big Pay Bump vs. MNC Stability ‚Äì Stuck in Decision Hell!,"Alright, folks, I need help. My brain has been all over the place over this decision, and I figured Reddit might have some wisdom (or at least some chaos) to offer.

The Situation:

I‚Äôve been working at an MNC for 2 years a s a consultant engineer after my graduation. It‚Äôs been a ride‚Äîgood projects, some international work, but lately, things have been feeling‚Ä¶ off. No proper structure, unclear leadership (my seniors and manager has left the company), and I‚Äôve been doing senior-level work on a graduate salary (yes, they actually joked about it to my face). I did push back, but all I got was ""yeah, we hear you"" and no action.

They finally gave me a 20% increment, plus there‚Äôs a chance to work in Paris for 6 months. BUT there's a catch‚Äîno return ticket for an important conference where I was supposed to present my research. So if I go, I might miss that opportunity.

The New Offer:

A 5-year-old local company doing regional/international projects.

42% total salary increase (after probation) plus confirmed bonus for this year with no pro rating and increment next year

Good mentorship & learning environment ( my ex senior is there and she recommend me for the job)

Faster career growth & promotion

BUT‚Ä¶ travel opportunities are limited (based on project requirements)

Also‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a younger company with around 12 engineers mostly seniors


My Brain Right Now:

Do I stay in a well-known MNC with the Paris opportunity (but where internal chaos is real)?
Or do I take the big salary jump & growth potential but risk the stability of a younger company?

Has anyone made a switch like this before? Would you pick stability over money & career growth? Help me make sense of this, pls.

I have recently started with a new career in home improvement and remodeling. We offer everything from new Roofs, Windows, Siding, Bathrooms, etc. 

While I am very competent to be able to close sales for any product, I am very unfamiliar with the physical construction side of this career. Training completely focused on selling the products, but not the nuance of building jargon, construction, or general nuts and bolts.

There have been many instances where I will be onsite and I will call my boss to describe the project looking for input, but I am met with anger about ‚Äú don‚Äôt worry about details, just sell what I tell you!‚Äù 

When I reach out to other employees for advice if I cannot reach my boss. If he finds out, he will yell over the phone ‚Äúyou work for me, not them‚Äù 

To anyone not in sales, I know this would sound like a nightmare. However, you would be surprised by how narcissistic and bull headed sales managers can be, so I let it roll off my back.

Here is the problem, lol I know right what about all that other shit

There doesn‚Äôt seem to be an HR representative for his offices. The only other person of authority there is the Sales VP, and I have seen them get into yelling matches as well. 

I don‚Äôt want to come across as snitching about my boss, but this behavior of not answering my questions have caused several delays to my projects since they now require additional labor. This causes the quote to go up, and in my opinion can make the customer feel like they got a bait and switch on the price. 

The money is too good to pass on this job, and despite my boss I genuinely love this sales job helping people with their homes.

And I'm too afraid by the idea of job hunting again, specially jobs that require me to interact with clients. I really don't want to go the bilingual call center route. 

I must say, even though I studied formally, I feel I never learned anything of true value, so I'm not confident neither in teaching nor translation, and I don't have enough qualifications, like certificates or master degrees.  I have a C1 Cambridge certificate and a TEFL certification (I took it because I thought feeling more prepared would help me enjoy teaching, it didn't).

I'm aware I'm in an awful position due to my lack of experience and qualifications, and that my mindset is probably not the best (I have been to therapy, but it hasn't helped much in that regard) I also know my age is against me, I'm too old to just start off my career.

So please, any advice on career choice or what the best course of action for me is greatly appreciated. What would you do in my position? Please keep in mind I have been unemployed for 4 months already. If it's of any help, my language set is Spanish-English.

I'm tired of feeling stuck and useless, it has already cost me my relationship, so please, ANY life advice or job opening you can throw my way can be very appreciated.

Thanks for reading. I hope you all have a great weekend!

1j5ui4q,Need Ideas for Career Transition into Sales,"I 41m have always liked the idea of doing sales and have sort of done it through my career but been turned off by the uncertainty of being 100 percent commission. As a result I have been a corporate cog for most of my career at a few fortune 500 company's after my time in the military. I did own my own print shop for 3 years before COVID made it go belly up. I enjoyed the sales aspect of that a lot but that business had to much overhead. 

Anyway I came into a recurring source of passive income that can pay my bills and be just enough to live off. Not enough that I want to retire and not that I would want to anyway. However, it is enough that urge I have had to go into sales and be entrepreneur is getting a lot more tempting. I would like to do something that is stable, has a lot of face to face interaction, and gets me out in the community. I also would not want a lot of overhead.

1j5u6ye,University and Career Choice,"I'm currently a first-year CS major also pursuing a minor in physics (personal interest). 

I've been considering switching to a combined major of [Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/engineering/mechanical-industrial/mechanical-engineering-computer-science-bsme/#planofstudytext) \[Double Majors aren't a thing at my University\]. While I've always loved programming - and still do - My experience so far in college has left me less enthusiastic about a potential career as a software developer. 

Taking my university's cornerstone of engineering course has made me realize I may feel more fulfilled as an engineer. That, along with a on-slot of people talking about the competitiveness of the job market for CS Majors, has made me hesitant to continue with a purely CS BS. It's very hard for me to tell what I want to do as I haven't experienced much in either field, but I have to make this decision in the next month or so to graduate in four years. Looking at careers for recipients of both respective degrees showed me that jobs available to those with a Mech Engineering degree sound more interesting. {I'm very passionate about the Automotive industry and Motorsports}

1j5ttit,Should I leave my startup job after an acquisition if my equity isn't honored?,"Hey, so a little bit of background: I am a 20 y/o from India, currently in my final year of college. I joined an Australia-based AI startup when it was just starting, so I have been with them ever since June of 2024. It all started with an internship when it was just the two co-founders and me‚Äîa three-person team‚Äîand during the internship I built most of the MVP. After the launch of that product (though it failed because of a lack of marketing), I got a full-time offer as a founding engineer. The pay was extremely low (AUD 250/month), but I was promised 5% equity, and when the startup grows, my pay will increase. I can confidently say that I have poured my heart and soul into this startup because I love coding. I worked overtime and took no leave for these entire 10 months (which was a huge mistake) and I took a stack-agnostic approach. I learned and implemented a lot of AI workflows for them, even though I had no prior experience, and I learned and implemented everything. Even though I don't have a MacBook, I installed Hackintosh on my main computer to build an iOS app for them. All in all, I left no stone unturned; I was focused on my work wholeheartedly.

Now, I was sick because I injured my leg and wasn't online much, and I let them know that last Sunday. Then on Monday, I saw a LinkedIn post saying that the company was acquired by some consulting firm, which seems to be pretty big in Australia. I texted the co-founder about it, and he mentioned that my pay won't increase again because things were messy. Then today the parent company posted a blog, and I saw the names of both co-founders getting hired by the acquiring company, but my name wasn't there. I haven't had a chat with either of them yet, but this hurts. I owned 5% of the company‚Äîwhy did no one talk to me before all of this? And where do I stand in the landscape? Am I just a small fly, cheap Indian labor to them after all of this?

I am confused whether I should leave this company. I don't feel prepared for interviews because I feel super low, and I wanted to start my own app startup, but for that I need at least $3000, which I don't have (I only have AUD 700 to my name). I need serious guidance on this.",Salt_Figure_2206,1,1.0,2,1741367398,2025-03-07 17:09:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5ttit/should_i_leave_my_startup_job_after_an/,3,2025
1j5tm0j,"Please help me? Master's degree in Teaching, Linguistics or Literature?","For context, I'm in my mid 20s.

I'm hopefully finishing my degree soon. Right now, I have the opportunity to apply for a Master's degree in Teaching, Linguistics or Literature in my maternal language. 

I'm very indecisive because one of the serious problems I have is the fact that I live in an awful European country. Here (I guess like everywhere else, too), I can't find a decent job with a Linguistics or Literature Master's. In the city where I live, finding a decent job as an editor/librarian would be immensely difficult as there are simply no opportunities. 

Because of this, getting a Master's in teaching is undoubtedly the best option in my country (in terms of employment and being able to be financially independent). However, my other problem is the fact I suffer from social anxiety. Sometimes it's hard for me to socialize and I keep thinking I won't be able to make it through the interview or even the written exam.

What is the best option here for someone like me? Realistically I'm more likely to get accepted into Linguistics or Literature degree, but I'd be wasting my money and time for nothing. If I choose a Master's in Teaching, I'd have to find a way to fix myself.

I have until the end of this month to decide. Can anyone please give me some advice?",Grand-Guarantee4400,1,1.0,0,1741366956,2025-03-07 17:02:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5tm0j/please_help_me_masters_degree_in_teaching/,3,2025
1j5tevj,Torn between two offers,"Hi all,

I received a verbal offer on Tuesday and on paper it looks great. Only 3% below asking, up to 20% annual bonus (albeit with typical caveats such as company overall and personal performance) and health benefits are 100% covered. It is also remote. My biggest knock is there is no parental leave policy and my wife and I are hopeful to become parents in the next year or 2. I am also waiting on a second offer with another company I'm interested in but it seems they're dragging their feet. I had what I thought was my last of 4 rounds of interviews Tuesday as well but then the 3rd party recruiter who recruited me to apply notified me the company wants me to come in person to the office on Tuesday and then they'll make an offer afterwards. It's a bit infuriating since all 4 of my previous interviews were virtual and it was never indicated to me that I would need to go in to the office. I do have good synergy with the hiring manger and fellow team members I'd be working with in the role but this latest news has left a bad taste in my mouth. This company also knows that I'm currently sitting on another offer so I had hoped this wouldn't drag on this long. I would really like to wait on making a decision on which offer to go with full I've had a chance to review both but I'm not sure how much longer the first company will wait. The HR person initially gave me 24 hours (so Wednesday afternoon) but I've been able to keep her at bay so far. What are your thoughts? I'm also starting to have an inkling the second company may offer less than the first even though I told them what that offer was. The main thing I know for sure at this time is the second company does do 3 months of parental leave. It is a hybrid role but I won't mind driving. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

1j5oeae,New sales hire will earn significantly more than me. I feel super demotivated...,"Hi there,

I‚Äôve been working remotely as a content director for a specialized company in another country for about 3.5 years. My salary is pretty good compared to the average in my home country, but relative to standards in their country‚Äîespecially at my seniority level‚Äîit‚Äôs definitely on the lower side. Until recently, it felt like a win-win: I was relatively well-paid in my local market, and the company benefited from not having to hire someone locally at a higher salary. 

The company is now hiring a new sales person who‚Äôll be making roughly 20‚Äì30% more than I do (according to the job posting). I get that sales compensation can be higher because it directly impacts revenue, but over the past few years, I built our lead generation from scratch‚Äîcreating lead magnets, generating MQLs, and laying down an entire structure for how sales and marketing should collaborate. I also contribute at a strategic level, which means we don‚Äôt need an extremely senior Sales Rep. We can hire someone with the right attitude, even if they‚Äôre not super strategic, because I‚Äôve already set the groundwork.

It doesn‚Äôt help that our previous sales rep, who had 10+ years of experience and was likely paid twice my salary, didn‚Äôt perform well. During that period, most leads still came from my efforts.

My contract is up for renewal in 4 months, and I‚Äôm torn about whether to address my compensation concerns now or wait for the formal review process. I don‚Äôt want to seem ungrateful, but I also don‚Äôt want to be undervalued. I‚Äôm unsure if I should even mention the new hire in this conversation‚Äîpart of me thinks if I didn‚Äôt know about the difference, I might not be so upset. But now, I feel it‚Äôs inherently unfair.",asesu,1,1.0,6,1741355767,2025-03-07 13:56:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5oeae/new_sales_hire_will_earn_significantly_more_than/,3,2025

1j5oab6,I know I‚Äôm a low performer and it‚Äôs crushing,"I have a performance review next week and I‚Äôm feeling anxious. I‚Äôve had a few life changes in the past year (death in the family, a friendship ending, a really bad breakup) that have impacted my ability to work, but even before then, I‚Äôve never quite met expectations in my role. 

Over the years I‚Äôve developed a work ethos, and it‚Äôs basically this: Be told what to do and get my job done. I can‚Äôt get my job done if you don‚Äôt tell me what to do. 

I‚Äôve tried to be proactive before, but have consistently received negative feedback. Clearly there‚Äôs an expectation which I‚Äôm not meeting, so just tell me exactly what you want and how you want it done, and I will do it. 

Unfortunately, the level of managing up expected at my company is insane. I‚Äôm basically forming my own responsibilities as I go, and hopefully it hits the mark just right.

I‚Äôm a low performer at this company, and I know it. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the performance review at all. I mean, when are you, but with this manager in particular, there‚Äôs a pattern. Our conversations are never positive, and when they are, it feels fake. 

Admitting my own faults has never gone well. It just feels like I‚Äôm digging myself deeper into a hole. 

Since this is an advice sub, I‚Äôd love to know: **How do I approach this performance review knowing I‚Äôm not meeting expectations?** 

**If you‚Äôre a manager, what puts a person into the low performer category? Has anyone ever ‚Äúredeemed‚Äù themselves from this position?** 

I know I‚Äôm in full control of how well my career goes, but it feels like my manager is predisposed to see my work in a negative light. When I say I rarely, if ever, receive positive feedback, I mean it. But when things go wrong, they‚Äôre ready to provide criticism.

1j5o9mz,15 Bulls**t Career Traps that Keep You Stuck (And How to Break Free),"Beware! These career lies will cost you years. 

Want the truth? Most career roadblocks aren‚Äôt obvious. 

They disguise themselves as good advice, security, or even success.

Here are 15 career traps that hold people back‚Äîand how to sidestep them:

1/ Waiting for ‚Äúthe right time.‚Äù‚Ü≥ The perfect moment never arrives.‚Ü≥ Small steps now beat big plans later.

2/ Believing effort guarantees success.‚Ü≥ Hard work is great, smart work is better.‚Ü≥ Results are what count, so make them visible.

3/ Chasing someone else‚Äôs dream.‚Ü≥ A career that looks good on paper can still feel empty.‚Ü≥ Define success on your own terms.

4/ Staying for prestige, not progress.‚Ü≥ Fancy job titles don‚Äôt equal growth.‚Ü≥ If you‚Äôre stuck, move, no matter how ‚Äúimpressive‚Äù your company is.

5/ Learning without applying.‚Ü≥ No amount of courses or reading replaces experience.‚Ü≥ Action is the best teacher.

6/ Being loyal to a fault.‚Ü≥ If your company isn‚Äôt investing in you, why are you investing in them?‚Ü≥ Explore your worth elsewhere.

7/ Comfort masquerading as stability.‚Ü≥ Just because a job feels safe doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good for you.‚Ü≥ Growth requires discomfort.

8/ Taking outdated career advice.‚Ü≥ What worked 20 years ago won‚Äôt necessarily work today.‚Ü≥ Learn from those who‚Äôve succeeded recently.

9/ Trusting the workplace like a friendship circle.‚Ü≥ Not everyone has your best interests at heart.‚Ü≥ Stay authentic, but be strategic.

10/ Avoiding tough conversations.‚Ü≥ You won‚Äôt get what you don‚Äôt ask for.‚Ü≥ Negotiate, speak up, advocate for yourself.

11/ Overthinking instead of acting.‚Ü≥ Planning is easy, execution is what moves you forward.‚Ü≥ Start before you feel ready.

12/ Banking on job security.‚Ü≥ No job is ‚Äúsafe‚Äù forever.‚Ü≥ Build your skills, network, and options.

13/ Ignoring burnout until it‚Äôs too late.‚Ü≥ Being a high performer doesn‚Äôt mean running on empty.‚Ü≥ Pace yourself before your body forces you to.

14/ Not preparing for what‚Äôs next.‚Ü≥ Careers can shift overnight.‚Ü≥ Always have a backup plan, even if you love your job.

15/ Assuming you have unlimited time.‚Ü≥ Five years can slip away fast.‚Ü≥ If you‚Äôre unfulfilled, don‚Äôt wait - take action now. The biggest career risks? The ones that feel the safest.

1j5o4hn,Should I study psychology after high school ?,"18 year old from India, my final exams for high school just ended and I pursued a PCB Science stream ( Physics, Chemistry, Biology) in high school.

For a while now, I have discovered that I really like studying about psychological concepts and most of my free time is spent on reading books about human behaviours or watching YouTube videos from psychiatrists and psychologists and understanding more about human behaviour. I enjoy listening to people's problems and I always try to help people with mental conditions, with the limited knowledge I have, but I try learning more everyday. 

I don't have much interest in physics, while chemistry is something I find okay. Biology is what I am mostly passionate about learning from the stream. Now that I have finished my high school, I don't know if I should pursue psychology for real in my undergrad.

1j5mjso,10 Interviews Strategies the Top 1% Swear By,"Want to stop blowing your chance at interview? 

The top 1% swear by these strategies. From 10+ years in headhunting, I've studied the top-interview performers. 

And I'm happy to share them with you to get you unstuck and into the career you deserve: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Research Deeply: Go beyond the company website. Study their latest press releases, earnings reports, and industry status.‚ÄúI was reading in your Q4 earnings report and noticed‚Ä¶‚Äù

2Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Storytelling: Prepare to share specific examples that highlight your achievements. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses. ‚ÄúI headed a team in implementing X which lead to Y% rise in Z.‚Äù

3Ô∏è‚É£ Personal Connection: Find something in common with the interviewer or the company culture to discuss. This builds rapport and makes you memorable.""I read that you implemented a new IT system last year - I did something similar in my previous role.‚Äù

4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask Insightful Questions: Show your depth by asking about challenges the company faces, recent industry trends, and the team‚Äôs strategic priorities.

5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ÄúCould you elaborate on the current challenges the team is facing.‚ÄùQuantify Achievements: Whenever possible, attach numbers to your successes. This concretely demonstrates your impact.‚ÄúIn my last role, I increased customer satisfaction ratings by 20%.‚Äù

6Ô∏è‚É£ Practice Mindfulness: Reduce anxiety and boost your focus with mindfulness exercises before the interview. A calm presence is compelling.Say to yourself: ""Stay present, stay calm, and focus on articulating your value clearly - you got this.""

7Ô∏è‚É£ Dress the Part: Tailor your outfit to the company culture while leaning towards the professional side. What you wear for one company to another will differ. First impressions are powerful.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Follow-Up Thoughtfully: Send a personalized thank you email that references specific points from the interview. Express enthusiasm for the role. Be memorable. 

9Ô∏è‚É£ Use Silence Wisely: Don‚Äôt be afraid of brief pauses. Thoughtful silence as you compose your answers can be very effective.""That‚Äôs a great question, let me think about that for a moment.""

üîü Showcase Adaptability: Discuss how you‚Äôve successfully adapted to changes or challenges in previous roles. Flexibility is highly valued in any field.""When our company merged with a competitor, I was tasked with‚Ä¶‚Äù

1j5l1uo,"Laid off, but I didn‚Äôt just push pixels‚Äîshipped some serious stuff","Last year has been brutal but offered so much growth. From intense code reviews to shipping fast and roasting each other based on bugs found in regression (light hearted fun nothing serious), wild ride. But recently couple of senior resources and other team (including myself) got laid off due to funding cut and it feels, kinda scary to be in the market again.

I was able to get this opportunity through networking with the founder, as for my previous devrel role. Detail is to be more than someone who writes good and scalable code, you've got to know how to craft meaningful user experiences with all edge cases and need to contribute new ideas for their business growth as well. 

At my last role, I worked on a¬†3D geospatial visualization tool, building out¬†measurement and annotation features in Three.js, optimizing¬†large-scale image uploads to S3, and ensuring¬†real-time interactions in a distributed web app. The product involved¬†mapping, drone/aerial imagery, and engineering visualization, so performance and accuracy were key. (damn how did i even worked on all of this, imposter syndrome guys).

Moving ahead, remote role would be the obvious cake I'd like to eat but as it goes, extremely hard to get one even with linkedin outreach and all. Since this was my first corporate kind of gig, being back in the market after experience is scary for me. (how much do i want working remote from either thailand or colombia, literal dreams).

1j5kpwi,I‚Äôm not really sure where I‚Äôm going with my career,"I 27M feel pretty lost right now. I was recently fired from my job about 3 weeks ago due to doing something they deemed as unsafe, and I don‚Äôt think I qualify for unemployment because it was technically a violation of company policy and rules. I tried speaking to a rep to confirm this but they were no help. I‚Äôve been trying to find a job ever since. Doordash and Uber isn‚Äôt an option for me. I don‚Äôt really have any skills or any notable qualifications. I‚Äôve pretty much done warehouse work my entire career and honestly I‚Äôm tired of it. 

I hate the intense productivity standard and I really hate the mandatory overtime. I hate working 50 sometimes 60+ hour weeks with the occasional weekend and holiday on top of that. Sometimes I just hate waking up because I know i have to go to work and be there for a painful 10 hour minimum shift. I just feel so exhausted after every shift. After coming home all I wanna do is shut off my brain and watch YT or play some games just to distract me. I‚Äôm slowly starting to lose my passion and enjoyment of these things because I just always have work in the back of my mind. Sometimes it helps but other times it just reminds me that I‚Äôm only distracting myself for a short period of time until I have to go to sleep and go back to work again. It‚Äôs just a viscous cycle and it sucks. I‚Äôm always thinking what will I be doing 20 years from now, will I be happy, will I be working another meaningless job with no goal or ambition or passion in life. 

Right now I‚Äôve been applying everywhere cause I desperately need to pay my bills that I‚Äôve already been behind on, but I‚Äôm having no success. I‚Äôve applied to over 30 jobs PT and FT and so far only 1 has called me to schedule a phone interview which had to be canceled because of a technical issue on their side. Idk what‚Äôs worse having one day bleed into the next, and watching bills pile up knowing I can‚Äôt do anything to stop it, or working long hours at a brutal job and just hating my own existence. How do people do this? I don‚Äôt hate the idea of working, every adult has to do. I just want to find a good career that pays well and has low stress. I feel very under qualified for a lot of jobs out there and I can‚Äôt really go to school because I can‚Äôt afford it. I don‚Äôt want to have a bunch of student loan debt just for a piece of paper that says I‚Äôm qualified. It doesn‚Äôt even guarantee me a position anywhere. 

Idk, I feel very lazy as well. Like I can take this time to learn how to code or learn some different software for a tech job or something along those lines but I‚Äôm not. I just feel like doing that takes a lot of time and a lot of effort for something that may or may not benefit me. I understand that pretty much every decision in life is like that, but for some reason I just find a way to justify it and psych myself out every time before I even start. I‚Äôm definitely willing to put in the work, but I feel like if the pay or success isn‚Äôt guaranteed then I don‚Äôt really bother. Instant gratification is a bitch. I feel like I‚Äôm expecting something to just fall in my lap, like a easy way out, like some magical job that pays me millions for very little work or something. Idk what to do, I just wanna be financially stable and independent with a job that doesn‚Äôt make me want to jump off a bridge. I could really use some advice.

1j5k1jp,Fight or submit?,"Summary:

Same company for past 8 years. New CEO and leadership are terrible - confirmed by others outside the company. 

My manager was demoted (from C-suite to upper middle management) despite strong performance, only because he wouldn't bow to CEO. He is staying because of kids and keeps his same package.

I expect to be told I'm going to be reassigned to a different role which, in my opinion, is a demotion and a career set back. I will likely keep my same salary and benefits etc.

The work life balance is good, but the chaos of the company (it's a complete mess that somehow makes money in spite of itself) and most importantly the people are severely impacting my mental health.

In the country where I am, reassignment that could be interpreted as a demotion can be a violation of labour laws.

My dilemma is whether to fight and potentially leave with a severance package of around 8-10 months or tow the line and keep quiet. If I leave, I will also need to figure out what to do next as I am living in a foreign country. I can not leave the country due to commitments.

1j5iaxx,Curious to know what's going on,"The small company I work for (100ppl) has recently become even more political and are cost cutting. I've been wanting to leave them since I started but due to personal issues I held on. As of 2 months ago, I started looking for a new job and the market is picking up. There are now restructure in the company due to cost cutting and I think I'm next (see story below). I honestly don't care if they don't renew my contract, but because this is political, I'm curious to understand a few things and if anyone's gone through this I'd like to know what happens next!

Some context:
I work for a satellite office and the HQ is in the UK. Recently they announced a restructure and have let some of our offshore devs go. The region I work in is struggling and hasn't made much profit (we have 3 regions worldwide (UK being one of them). We are in need of a new client otherwise we won't exist. In my region we have - 1 credit risk manager, 1 compliance, 1 Project manager (who was brought in by one of the MDs and has made herself indispensable and has her fingers in all the pies, but doesn't do her actual work and I can't stand her or her toxic behavior), 2 BAs (one of them is me) and 2 MDs (one recently joined because he has connections and we are hoping he will bring in clients but he has asked the whole team to help with the Biz dev). I was brought in by an exec who works in HQ (we used to work together). 
When they announced the restructure, we were told that it was only going to impact the devs, but it turns out that it's impacted everyone. 
Last week, the exec that brought me in, told one of the MDs that I was going to be reporting to the product team in the UK. I didn't find out until last night when my new boss called me!! The next day (today) I spoke to the MD in my region and I told him, apparently he's known about this since last week!! The other BA is now involved in biz dev with the other MD. 

Here is what I think is happening and I'd like your opinion:
- I think they're going to keep me until we go live with the client I'm currently managing (14th april) then they'll also let me go. Because there is no way we will get a new client before then and they won't need 2 BAs
- they already got rid of someone that joined our region in dec, citing cost cutting

Im kind of annoyed at the fact that the exec didnt give me a heads up last week, nor did the MD say anything when he found out (and he is HR as well!).

1j5i0xx,Will working with CPG consumer insights data help me get into media/tech analytics? Or am I wasting my time?,"Okay, so I‚Äôve been talking to this woman who works in a CPG company as a brand manager. She is helping me learn how to analyze CPG consumer insights data, to track trends and come up with findings. And I really appreciate that from her. But at the same time I get disheartened by some things she says. 

Like last time I told her that I got really excited when I got an interview from **a reputable digital media company(it owns big brands like people magazine, based in NYC)** and she told me those roles are mostly for people who come from generational wealth. I felt disheartened. Because I actually want to work in Consumer Insights but not in the CPG domain. More like media and tech. Like a top tier company like a FAANG, or something else. But since she‚Äôs said that I‚Äôve been feeling a bit bummed out. 

She also told me that I will have to make sacrifices in my career and told me that her first job was very low paying. But she took the job for the experience and she worked long hours etc. but she said she did it to have the job she has now. But the thing is, I don‚Äôt want her job. As I don‚Äôt want to work in pure marketing like CPG. I‚Äôm glad shes trying to help me. I don‚Äôt have real corporate work experience but I am trying to get some through courses and projects. 

My concern is, is this woman of any use to me or no? Is going through sample/masked CPG consumer insights data going to help me in any way? I‚Äôm trying to learn some IT stuff as well to get into a data analytics/tech role, and have some experience working for an IT consulting startup, class work and volunteer experience. I will be honest and say that I am very lazy and get distracted easily and procrastinate a lot.

1j5hw2i,Need Career Advice: Switch Sectors or Stay for MBA?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm 24M, currently working as a mechanical engineer in an EPCM company in the oil and gas sector. Honestly, my job isn‚Äôt that exciting, and the growth prospects don‚Äôt seem great either.

I recently had a career counseling session, and the advisor suggested that I switch sectors‚Äîmove away from oil & gas and get into something more relevant to India, like the automobile industry. The idea is to gain experience in a different sector and then aim for an MBA from a Tier-1 university, which could lead to better opportunities and packages.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: In the next few months, I‚Äôll be getting a promotion from Graduate Engineer Trainee to Engineer with a 20% raise. On top of that, I‚Äôll have the option to work the second shift, which comes with an additional allowance of nearly 50% of my in-hand salary. If I switch sectors now, I‚Äôll likely have to take a pay cut.

So, should I switch industries now for long-term benefits, or should I stay where I am, make the most of the salary bump, and focus on preparing for MBA entrance exams before making a move?

I‚Äôm a 20-year-old student in France, currently entering a double master‚Äôs degree in Law and Art History. My goal is to work internationally, mixing law and art history, potentially in art law, international transactions, or cultural heritage law.

I‚Äôve heard that having dual bar qualifications can be useful for international careers, but I‚Äôm unsure about the best way to pass the US/UK Bar... I also had the idea to do a LLM in international law/business law ? 

‚Ä¢ For those working internationally, is a US/UK Bar qualification actually useful, or would another route be better for my goals?

1j5gnqs,Which country should I move to? Australia or Singapore?,"Hi, I'm an early career professional. Less than 3 years exp but have a Masters from a European institute. 

I am currently faced with a choice of which branch of the company I should join in the medium to long-term. Australia or Singapore? More specifically for Australia, if I choose it, the city choices would be Melbourne or Sydney.

I know this is a bit of a very open question but I'm happy to hear people's opinions on either. If I were to sum up what my points of consideration are, it'll likely include the following:

\- quality of life

\- earnings and savings (in relation to tax, cost of living, etc.)

\- career growth potential / flexibility

Even though seeking permanent immigration is in the cards for the future, it's not a very weighty consideration for me at the moment as I'm more inclined to explore the world first (professionally through roles and personally through leisure travel) before pursuing a place to settle into. 

  
Thank you in advance!

  
P.S. If this piece of info helps: I've lived in SG before and know the way of life there but I've never been to Australia.

1j5gkhz,Am I irresponsible for wanting to leave my high-paying job?,"Here's the deal. My career has bounced from high-paying industry that shall not be named, to K-12 teaching, then back to industry. I would much rather be teaching. The first time I taught it was hard to convince my significant other to walk away from a huge paycheck with loads of long-term incentives that got bigger each year, but I did it, and then eventually left the classroom made my way back to making bank again. After being laid off recently and then getting hired into a role I really despise, I realized how much I hate corporate and I want to teach again so badly. 

Trouble is now I have 2 kids and we've built a lifestyle around my big ol' paycheck and spouse's regular-sized salary. That said, we've saved so much for retirement that we've been told a few times that we could save nothing else ever again and still retire at 65. Cash flow is the real problem. We'd have to cut our spending by $7k/month to make that pay cut work. And just to talk numbers... I'd be going from making a total of >$330k per year all-in to making $75k. 

Spouse is (again) 100% not on board with this move. The sentiment is suck it up buttercup and we can think about an offramp plan for 5 years from now or something. Think of the kids. We could pay for both kids' colleges entirely with just one year of that pay difference. Definitely don't bring up the fact that our retirement savings is 100% from my career.

So, am I insane for even considering walking away from a job that eats at my soul every day but has a pay:work required ratio that is through the roof? Or is fulfillment, meaning, and having work align with my values worth pressuring my spouse to get on board?

1j5f9f4,Which should I choose?,"A) $40 per hour, full-time position with benefits in a FAANG company. The role is not perfectly aligned with my goals: instead of being a writer, I'd be editing instead. Contract is a hard 12 months. Monthly earnings would be about $6400. 

B) $70 per hour, part-time position with no benefits at a ""disrupter"" startup. The role has given me my dream title and there are great opportunities to do exactly what I want, but their needs are so scarce that I may only get about 10-15 hours of work per week. Contract is indefinite and likely multi-year. Monthly earnings are about $2,800. 

I'm torn because while option A pays twice as much at the end of the month, the hourly rate is also nearly half what I currently make. At $70 an hour, I make enough to live, and I have a shit ton of free time. That said, I like money just like everyone else and I'm ambitious, so I want FAANG on my resume pretty badly (even if this role is only tangential to what I really want to do). 

I'm probably going to try to do both tbh, but if push comes to shove, I wonder which choice would be wiser.

I was given corrective action at my previous job in healthcare for something that was totally my fault. The situation just reinforced that my coworkers can‚Äôt trust me to help with anything less they risk me getting them in trouble. Towards the end I experienced outward bullying due to not being trained fast enough and perceived laziness (I would constantly ask what I could do to help, but I was always told nothing. This happened every day for months so I gave up). Any time I tried to do something and take initiative I was told I missed something or was doing it wrong. I feel I am untrainable and cannot learn new skills unless it is shown to me step by step, which most places can‚Äôt do because they assume you have some knowledge and aren‚Äôt a blank slate. Because of all of these factors and feeling like I was a danger to others, I left. I now feel that I have nothing going for me career wise and no career prospects since I feel I cannot go back to direct patient care or further my education in it. This is all I have ever done for work.

I have a biochemistry degree, tried and failed to get into grad school. Tried and failed to be a pharmacy tech, did it for 5 years but was taken advantage of due to constantly asking for things to do. I tried to work in a lab and was fired for making a mistake after less than 2 weeks. I feel I am unable to work on a team and cannot collaborate with others due to deficiencies in my personality. The only thing I was ever good at was inventory management but this requires a degree that I do not have. 

If I was going to do anything, I would want a hands on mechanical/electrical repair job, but this is impossible since I have no experience.

1j5b7db,Got a new job but I don't like it.,"I (in my 30s) got a new project manager job about a month ago at a smaller company than my earlier one. The pay and the role are the same, but the scale and quality of work is quite different. My boss is great, gem of a human being, but the teammates are just okay - friendly but not friendly, don't know how else to put it. I know everyone is just doing their job and your colleagues are not your friends, and even though my boss is great, things still seem very odd.

It doesn't feel like I've been pushed to the deep end, but I also don't feel like I'm learning much or adding anything to the company. One month is not enough time either, but if first impressions are a thing, I think I feel let down and deflated. I wasn‚Äôt promised anything, but I was hoping the work would challenge me a bit more. While being onboarded, I was given smaller tasks but the projects I currently work on are utterly boring. I am dozing off in meetings even though I should be the one to ensure the project stays on track. I am one of those people who is a sucker for working and overworking (I know, terrible), but this company is the opposite. I have work life balance for the first time in a long time and I can do some side hustles or have some downtime, but I'm still not happy.

I interviewed at other companies that have great projects, out of which I really like 2. Haven't heard back from them (been about 2 weeks). Both these companies have good standing and are well known, + the role would be a bit more challenging. I‚Äôm probably not going to quit if I don‚Äôt have another job lined up, but I think I would jump ship should the opportunity arise. The company I‚Äôm currently at offered me the role much faster than I anticipated, and I had to leave my former workplace since things started to get way out of hand. Out of all my options, this was my last resort.

My former company was extremely toxic. Spent a good 2 years as a project manager hoping for things to get better but alas, they never did. I learnt the ridiculously hard way and I do understand the privilege I have, but I'm so confused. I saw a bunch of posts where people talk about being in a toxic workplace and most of the advice is to leave, but I feel stuck since everything is good, but I don‚Äôt feel good. My friends say I should be happy I have a job in this economy. They matched my pay; they offer me a better life (I truly am so grateful) but what if it‚Äôs not making me happy? Need advice on how to move forward.",Business-Coconut2578,1,1.0,5,1741308841,2025-03-07 00:54:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5b7db/got_a_new_job_but_i_dont_like_it/,3,2025
1j5ar1b,"Stay at my current company or leave for same role with ""potential"" better opportunity?","I have been working as a BIM Technician at a mid-sized engineering consultant for over 10 years. While I‚Äôve been passively searching for new opportunities in recent years, none have come close to matching my current pay. I believe my compensation is fair and competitive in the market, but I feel stuck in a dead-end position. There are no opportunities for title promotions‚Äîat least not in my current office‚Äîand we don‚Äôt even have a BIM Manager. As a result, I have no one to look up to except the engineers.

Over the past few years, I haven't learned much in my role. I've tried to enhance my skills on my own, but progress has been slow due to my workload and not able to apply new skills due to the (less complex) projects I am working on. Many of the larger and more complex projects are out of reach for me because I‚Äôm too busy with my current group‚Äôs work.

Recently, I received a referral for a similar role at a large global company and was offered the job. The pay is comparable, but I would lose several perks, including fewer vacation days, no free gym access, and lower overtime pay (1.0x instead of 1.5x). The new company is also farther away. However, the workload would be lighter, meaning less overtime (and therefore less pay). On the other hand, working for a larger company could potentially provide more opportunities to advance or even transition into a different role, as they have multiple discipline departments.

Would it be worth leaving a stable job of 10+ years for the potential to grow in the future?",dlaw029,1,1.0,1,1741307531,2025-03-07 00:32:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5ar1b/stay_at_my_current_company_or_leave_for_same_role/,3,2025
1j5a40g,They Regret Letting Me Go‚ÄîNow They Want Me Back. I Named My Price. Thoughts?,"I started  at a residential real estate company as an admin making $40K. Over four years and three promotions later, I became Director of Marketing, but I was only making $68K. When they abruptly fired my assistant without telling me, I took on even more responsibilities and proposed a salary renegotiation asking for $80,000 laying out everything I had done. I was easily the best they‚Äôd had in my role, but they only gave me a $4K bump to $72K.

Two months later, I handed in my three-week notice and accepted a $92K offer as a Digital Marketing Manager at a much bigger company. Fast forward four months, and my former CEO called, offering my job back. I declined but said I‚Äôd help on a project basis.

Then, my former manager called, saying they regret letting me go, they need me, and they‚Äôll give me a team and hybrid work. He asked me to come up with what it would take for me to return. Later, he secretly told me, ‚ÄúYou have a ton of leverage right now. They‚Äôre desperate. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short.‚Äù

Meanwhile, I‚Äôve gotten texts from 10 different people at my old company saying they need me back because the new girl can‚Äôt do anything I could and I brought the energy to the company and was the glue that held all departments together.

So I went big. I drafted a six-page proposal for a Director of Marketing & Business Development role, asking for:
	‚Ä¢	$100K base salary
	‚Ä¢	2% of gross revenue from commissions
	‚Ä¢	Guaranteed minimum compensation of $125K annually

They‚Äôre getting back to me next week. I know they‚Äôre struggling‚Äîthere‚Äôs no one even training the new hire. My value has officially been proven by me leaving.

I love the company and the people, but my current role is great. I‚Äôll only go back if it‚Äôs irresistible.

What do you think? Would you take it if they meet the demands? Anyone been in a similar spot?",1ConfusedAf,1518,0.9700000286102295,325,1741305672,2025-03-07 00:01:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5a40g/they_regret_letting_me_gonow_they_want_me_back_i/,3,2025
1j59zc7,"Feel like I picked the wrong degree, do I go back to Uni or move on?","Hello! Im a 23F from London, UK. I graduated with a 2:1 in International Relations from a top uni. I hated my degree, got really depressed and anxious towards the end and had to delay graduation by a year. I picked the degree based on a fantasy I had when I was 14 about joining the UN and making the world a better place, but didn't really have a job in mind. I excelled in written subjects and found current affairs interesting and so when I found IR, my brain locked into that decision and I never thought about pursing anything else. As far as my other subjects went I was also great in the sciences and was decent at maths (but didnt really enjoy it). Only during the 2nd year of uni did I think seriously about what I wanted to do in life after. I came to the realisation that a lot of the options that IR can lead you to were something I couldn't care less about ,fundraising, policy, comms, research, consulting. I've done internships with the government and NGO's to really see if it's for me and I dont think it is. I liked aspects where I was doing things with my hands, talking to people etc, but I cant imagine writing reports for the rest of my life. I feel like I would have loved and excelled in a more vocational science degree, where you tangibly see the difference you are making. Something like Radiography (2yr pre-reg), Pharmacy (5yr w foundation), Medicine (4yr grad entry), I loved sciences and cant help but think I've absolutely derailed my life by picking a social science with no clue what career I would do with it. Im learning to code right now and interested in cybersecurity and software engineering. Would it be stupid to go back to uni again for, being amongst people younger then me who got it right the first time and do a science or do I just make peace with the past and move on and try something in tech?

Current position:

- On a second pip with current employer of 7 years. 

- Currently making 74K/yr and will have a baby next month, so my plan was to take FMLA in May and really look for work during that time.

- company matches 6% 401K

- eligible for 15% annual bonus (though I haven‚Äôt gotten it this year due to pip)

2-3 days in office

New offer:

- transition to a different industry that I would like to grow in

- 79K base salary with no bonus

- 6.5K annual towards higher education (which I plan on doing)

- no company match or pension

- 5 days in office (20 mi each way from home)

Also, every role I‚Äôve interviewed for before this year was 100K+ base salary, bonus eligible, and hybrid, but that‚Äôs dried up since late last year. I will likely take this opportunity as a fresh start for my career, but I was already underpaid and overworked at my current role (which drove me to hate my job and ultimately got me on pip), and now I feel like I‚Äôm signing up to be underpaid yet again (thank you horrible job market). 

Would you take the job or take FMLA while on pip and job hunt for a better deal (which I especially need with this new baby on the way that I have to feed).

I‚Äôm currently a distribution system operator for a local co op, make $37 hr and free benefits and it‚Äôs about a 50 min drive.
Possible promotion coming up which will put me at $40hr and we get a small 5-10% bonus every year as well and supposedly consistent 5% cost of living raises every year . I absolutely hate my schedule 

I have an opportunity (pretty much an offer) to go to another company as a Transmission System operator where start pay would be between $38.50 -$40hr insurance is great not free but really good, better PTO, hellacious retirement package, and once I pass my NERC exam pay can go from $88,000-110,000 a year until I finish in house training which take about 6 months to a year then pay range is between $110,000 - 132,000 ( lower end of these numbers more likely.) but they have a $12,000 bonus as a trainee $16,000 bonus once I pass my test and $24,000 bonus once I make Operator and they do a DuPont schedule which is a lot better than my current schedule as I‚Äôll only work night shift once a month.
Only kicker is it‚Äôs about a hour and a half drive home.

Or I have an opportunity to go back to being a Journeyman lineman/Troubleman. Loved my job just hated being away from my new daughter so much.
That job offer $57 hr Monday -Friday 7-3:30 no weekends and no call out (only stay over to catch calls if needed and storms) benefits are decent, pto is good, and retirement is alright, lots of OT from storms and staying late and will make the most overall throughout year also has a decent bonus system as well.

1j57ts5,Toxic Workplace,"Just looking to hear other peoples thoughts on what I'm currently going through at work.

I work in the firearms industry. My job title is Compliance Coordinator. I essentially ensure all of our products whether they are imports or exports or in house manufactured products are following all state and federal laws and other compliance requirements. I am salaried and my work load is more or less on a if needed basis. I don‚Äôt really have daily tasks to complete but tasks come up everyday from either the marketing department, manufacturing, or from the C suite. I typically get all my work done and only work on things multiple days if they are big projects.

¬†

With all that said we recently had a CEO resign for one of our 3 companies under the same building. All 3 companies are owned and operated by the same main company and all make the same products but that‚Äôs not important. Anyway, when the CEO of that company resigned, instead of looking for and hiring a new CEO, one of the board members/partial owners stepped in and is now our ‚Äúinterim CEO‚Äù for that company. Talking with more veteran employees (I've been here 4 years) they all say he is someone who will fire someone on the spot for something small.

The other day one of my work colleagues in the same position as me but for one of the other 3 companies came to me in a panic and told me to rush to his office. Once in his office he closes his door which is quite unusual in my workplace, and he tells me that they are watching me. Apparently that ‚Äúinterim CEO/ board member/part owner‚Äù saw me in my office on my cell phone. He did not go to my boss‚Äôs office and tell her but instead went to a colleague of mine who has been here for around 10 years. Apparently that CEO asked him if I look for work to be done or if I am able to do my work in a timely manner. Which to me is totally unprofessional. My boss was livid and didn‚Äôt really know how to react. So she scheduled a meeting with her boss which is the CEO of one of our 3 companies not the same ‚Äúinterim CEO‚Äù but another CEO. Remember we have 3. Not sure if that‚Äôs a norm but whatever.

Well that meeting was yesterday and when she told me how it went I was instantly sick to my stomach. He apparently told her that it was brought to his attention that I was on my phone at my desk playing videogames‚Ä¶.. This is extremely far from the truth and my biggest comeback to that is .. What if I was on lunch? Or taking a 15 minute break? If you had asked me wouldn‚Äôt this have been settled? He also asked her if I wanted to be at work. Apparently because I show up at 7:55 and leave right at 5, to him it seems like I either don‚Äôt want to be here and work isn‚Äôt getting done or I don‚Äôt have enough work to do. So how should I handle this? I'm not going to toot my own horn, I'm only 30, so I'm fast and can get my work done easily and efficiently. Why does coming early or leaving late show how much work I'm doing? CEO is about 50 something so that gives you an idea of what generation they are from. As a salaried worker and a member of management I don‚Äôt think I should have to go to our breakroom to be on my phone for a minute. Our breakroom is primarily for our hourly employees who don‚Äôt have desks and work in manufacturing. I have a whole office so why should I have to be scared? We do not have a no cellphone policy and like I said earlier I was more than likely taking my lunch or on break watching tik toks. I rarely ever get on my phone because my wife and I talk on Microsoft teams all day so no need to text. So is this toxic or am I just entitled?

Thank you random strangers please help advise me.,"Okay so Like many people have gone through before I was without a job for a very long time almost a year. I was ready to give up hope I felt so defeated. Then out of nowhere I got a call and a job offer through a local agency. It was for an office position at a Hospital it pays well my management is amazing and very encouraging. I have been here almost one month now and they keep complimenting me and letting me know what a good job I am doing. All very nice and its A LOT to learn. I was intimidated at first but have grown to like it and im really getting into it. So out of nowhere an employer that I was interested in 3-4 months later finally tells me I can have the job. I had no offers now the minute I start something I am offered a position that pays $6 dollars more per hour and its ""FULLY REMOTE"".  They even sent me equipment in the mail and it is at my house already. Management at my new job let me know how they have struggled to find good employees that stay there and now they are so happy because they have come across me. I would feel like such a complete turd to leave after all they have shown and taught me especially after all the nice things they have said. I almost wish they were jerks it would make the decision easier. Plus on a personal note I wanted to move to africa to live and potentially have a son there and that remote job allows me to work there as well even though I wont be moving for 2 years I want 160k saved before I move. So to move and have something that is rare and hard to get like a remote job is a blessing. Its Like I have been blessed twice and dont know what to do. I would feel like a total jerk to leave its challenging but its fun and it already feels like home. On the other hand that 6 dollars extra and the remote thing is a beautiful opportunity. Its like do I send the computer back and keep working my office job or do I say goodbye to the hospital and take the remote position. I reached an impasse so was like let me summon the aide of random knowledgeable strangers to help me determine my fate. What would you do if you were me? I cant believe that they waited till after I took this job to give me their time of day lol.  I have to turn one down unfortunately I cant have them both but I will be starting 2 other jobs soon that dont interfere with one of these two. What do I do? Help please from somebody that is good at making tough decisions. Did I mention the one that pays 6 more is way easier not that its something I was thinking about just saying its much easier and pays more. I like where I have started though and the people there its nice quiet and friendly and as long as you pay attention and focus you do fine here. Sigh any advice??? please I could use some. I just cant make a decision so was like let me see what the people say if anybody. If I turn remote down will I be kicking myself in the future like ""damn I shoulda took it"". What would you do if in my shoes? Anybody?

so this coworker i thought was my friend took screenshots/screen recordings of my private story and showed it to my manager. i was talking shit on my manager and coworkers obviously like most ppl do on their private story. nevertheless, i got talked to about what i posted and said about my manager and coworkers, although i was not written up. 

now the SAME CHICK who leaked my private story (mind you ive literally done nothing to this girl, she moved to my store from chicago and i was the first person to get to know her well, get her number and hang out with her outside the store. ive been nothing but nice to her which is why this is so frustrating. idk what i did to her) is now calling me ‚Äúracist‚Äù for stimming the quote ‚Äúthey‚Äôre eating the dogs they‚Äôre eating the cats‚Äù while we were both on bar together. 

i have autism so i pick up on words and quotes and just say them out loud sometimes. this chick (at the time we are still friends) laughs and says ‚Äúomg you shouldn‚Äôt say that around me it sounds bad.‚Äù i was confused so i asked her why and she said ‚Äúbecause im asian‚Äù immediately dropped my smile and started profusely apologizing. 

she continuously laughed and brushed it off saying ‚Äúgirl idec i say that im gonna eat my friends dogs all the time.‚Äù even tho she said she didn‚Äôt care i was still seriously apologizing to her throughout the entire shift, clarifying with her i never had any intention on directing that towards her, or even directing it towards any race. i was literally just stimming. 

i then VIVIDLY REMEMBER us having a conversation on how my old asian friends would say they were gonna eat my dog as a joke, relating my past to her, which prompted her to say ‚Äúyeah i say it all the time to my close friends‚Äù which i replied ‚Äúso does that make me your close friend!!‚Äù and then a couple days later i wore a shirt with my dog on it (yes ik i love my dog more than most) and she said something like ‚Äúoh dinner‚Äù or ‚Äúmmm im gonna eat that‚Äù !!!!!!

anyway, this happened months ago, and is now being brought up completely different from how it happened. saying she felt offended and didn‚Äôt know how to bring it up. i mean fair ‚Äî everyone deals with trauma different wtf do i know as a white person but also i never ever EVER meant it in any way towards any race. i just say shit bc i‚Äôm fucking autistic and dumb. i‚Äôve learned my lesson ofc to stfu at work but now i‚Äôm scared for my work future. i‚Äôve been trying to promote for almost a year now and now im trying to transfer to get away from all this drama. but they want me to write a STATEMENT about what happened and it‚Äôs making me sick to my stomach. because i feel no matter what i do, she will definitely not admit to the things she said back to me that day. there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôs going to admit she said ‚Äúim gonna eat that‚Äù to my dog shirt. 

i‚Äôm scared im gonna get written up and then not able to transfer and then not able to work bc im so anxious & everyone at my work thinks im a terrible person. ugh. this sucks. ik a lot of it is my fault for adding her to my private story, talking shit on my coworkers, and just being plain stupid with my words. but i‚Äôve worked with this company since i was 16 (im now 20) and ive never been spoken to about my work ethic, about how i treat people etc. i‚Äôve always been praised for my work. so this is such a fucking beat down. what do you guys think i should even do. i mean my fucking District Manager is asian :( and in no way would i ever want to make someone feel less than bc of the color of their skin. i‚Äôm very liberal and an activist so this just go against everything i value. i‚Äôve spoken to my POC friends and they‚Äôre helping me out by educating me but WORK WISE idk what to do.

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm currently going through the background check process for a new job and ran into an issue with address verification. My credit check came back with an address discrepancy because my current address wasn‚Äôt updated in TransUnion.

I contacted TransUnion to update it, but they said it could take up to 30 business days. Meanwhile, the background check company informed me that my credit check has been put on hold or wasn‚Äôt accepted due to this discrepancy, and only my employer can request modifications‚ÄîI can‚Äôt do anything directly.

I reached out to HR at my new job, and they forwarded it to the onboarding team, but I haven‚Äôt heard anything back yet. I‚Äôm really worried‚Äîcan they take back my job offer because of this?

To make things more complicated, my driver‚Äôs license still has my old address, while my utility and phone bills show my current address. I don‚Äôt want this to delay my start date, but I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

1j55ifl,Looking to move up and out of retail/food service; throw some ideas at me,"Tl;dr: recently quit a job in special ed, overqualified for the retail and food service jobs I‚Äôve had; stuck in a mental rut and looking for ideas to broaden my job search 

Hey guys, 

I‚Äôm looking for tips/leads/suggestions to help
me get out of the dead-end retail and food service jobs where I keep landing and then flaming out after a few months. I keep applying for menial jobs, eventually landing one, and then often discovering that the conditions are even worse than at the last job I quit (although not always: I still haven‚Äôt had another job as degrading as cashiering at The Home Depot). 

For background: 

-I have a bachelor‚Äôs degree in geology and history. I worked for six months as a junior environmental consultant on soil and groundwater remediation projects. The office was a Dilbert hellscape, and I basically gave up on the job until I got fired. 

-Next, I worked intermittently for several years on an estate winery owned by relatives. I loved the work, but I was never paid a wage, only work-trade for room and board as my relatives‚Äô marriage went into a yearslong tailspin, plus some wine as barter payment (of significant value, but well short of market value for my work, not fungible, and no FICA contributions). The hippie scene drove me nuts: too many slumlords justifying themselves for charging deeply indigent tenants rent to live in shacks without indoor plumbing, slyly pretending they weren‚Äôt soliciting money from rich people they kept around, a rat infestation in the winery building, a paranoid schizophrenic living in the shower room, ad absurdum. I called code enforcement when I learned that a borderline-nonverbal autistic tenant had stolen a trash can from the winery and shit in it until it was full to the brim, then left it under the eaves of his shack and skipped town. 

‚ÄîSince I still loved farm work (and do to this day), I finally moved out of town for a while and worked seasonal commercial farm jobs in the Willamette Valley, mostly either picking blueberries or tending wine grapes, plus a few shorter jobs working with other crops or helping run a small crush pad. 

-For the past few years, after relocating to Santa Rosa, I‚Äôve been working more consistently, but not nearly as consistently as I‚Äôd like, mostly in retail, briefly as a night porter in a bowling alley, and most recently, from late August until the end of January, as a special education aide. I‚Äôve also worked 150+ hours (I‚Äôm trying to lowball my estimate) as a garden volunteer. 

Right now, I‚Äôm shooting resumes out on Indeed, mostly for entry-level food service, warehouse, and retail positions. Encouragingly, I‚Äôve already had three phone interviews in less than a month, for a retail position, a hospital sitter position (with sixty applicants for one slot!), and a job on a creamery production line. 

I definitely want to move up into something less dead-end and underpaid. Realistically, I won‚Äôt be going into management; I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of dirty managerial tricks, and I would refuse to take part in using the same tactics on a new cohort of defenseless underlings. 

Otherwise, I‚Äôm mainly stumped as to where to look for ideas or leads. If any of you have ideas, even if they feel off-the-wall, please sound off in the comments!

1j55a99,The career path I want or the path I should follow?,"Hi!

I'm a junior in a prestigious undergrad program and I'll graduate with a dual major in film and education. Being a cinema studies professor has been my dream for ages and still is. I've done ample research and educational work through internships and similar opportunities and I'm entirely convinced it's the thing that would bring me most joy.

Unfortunately, I feel like I can no longer ignore the fact that this career path is highly unsustainable and perhaps unachievable. Humanities profs make little money, tenure is disappearing, jobs are disappearing, and even grad school offers are disappearing. It's gotten to the point where professors who have mentored me, my friends, my family, and my career counselor all tell me that it's a bad idea.

Law school has been my backup plan, not just for the money (though I do understand they (usually) make more than humanities profs) but because I think I would get some enjoyment out of it. I wouldn't like it even a fraction as much as I would like teaching, but I'd like it more than a lot of other career options.

I'm getting to a point where I need to make a decision and I'm just absolutely torn. I want to follow my dream but I don't want to commit career suicide by pursuing a lengthy grad school program just to graduate and be unable to find a job / unable to make any money.

1j558hd,"HR role: comfortable stable but no-growth role, to change?","[34/F, 10 years of headhunting experience, both tech and non-tech] 

I am aware job market is crazy now, it took me a year of search to finally land a job. But I‚Äôm constantly second guessing my decision.
I‚Äôm in a country where I don‚Äôt speak local language so my chances are low from the start until I improve my language skills. Can only apply for international companies but that will require heavy commuting or relocation that is not possible because of family reasons.

So a year ago I was desperate and accepted the first offer I got. It‚Äôs a position at non-profit, not even HR department but international project support that includes hiring. Hiring process was not transparent and after joining I realized recruiting is not really recruiting but sending emails with offers and seeing who accepts and a lot of paperwork (no digitalization): scanning documents, chasing for signatures, filling countless templates etc. 

No expected progression. The pay is also very low BUT office is around the corner of my house, I have total freedom, can organize my hours around school timetable of my daughter, can nurture hobbies and the colleagues are great - we became friends immediately, see each other after work and joke a lot.

Now I have final offers for 2 other companies - senior positions but in small HR teams, one is logistics sector, another one is international certification. Both are growing, offer 50% more my current salary, clear structure for growth but also much more demanding and will require commuting to another city few times per week.

My fear that my current position is not future proof since I‚Äôm not progressing and soon I won‚Äôt be able to catch-up with current HR trends since I‚Äôm already not in HR. But also I have a stable job after a long time and this will mean risking it and today‚Äôs economy is harsh.

1j551mq,What would you do with your experience in my situation?,"Hey everyone, thank you so much in advance for taking the time to read this!

I‚Äôm in a bit of a dilemma about what to study, and I could really use some advice. I recently moved to the U.S. (been here for about a year) and just finished high school. Now I‚Äôm looking into university options, but my financial situation makes it impossible to afford a state university. The best option for me is WGU since it‚Äôs online and more affordable, and I‚Äôm fine with teaching myself.

I‚Äôve always been into business‚ÄîI love the idea of running something of my own, and I also really enjoy designing. At the same time, I love tech and being on the computer, but I‚Äôve never had actual experience in anything tech-related, so I don‚Äôt know what a career in that field would be like. I know tech would take me more effort to learn than business, but I‚Äôm willing to do the work.

I‚Äôve been reading tons of Reddit threads, and people seem super divided on everything. Some say business degrees are too general and not worth it, while others say it depends on the specialization (WGU offers Business Management, Marketing, and more, but I don‚Äôt know which one would be best). On the other hand, I was leaning toward Computer Science and even started taking Sophia courses to transfer, but I keep second-guessing myself.

The biggest thing stressing me out is how people say tech is really hard nowadays‚Äîhard to break into, harder to succeed in, etc. Plus, since my only option is WGU, I keep seeing mixed opinions about its reputation. Some say it‚Äôs fine, others say it‚Äôs a problem for employers, and it‚Äôs making me unsure about everything.

So my questions are:
	‚Ä¢	Is business really that ‚Äútoo general‚Äù and not worth it? If not, which specialization at WGU would be the best bet?
	‚Ä¢	If I go with tech (Computer Science), how can I make sure I actually get a job afterward? How do I get my foot in the door during or after university?
	‚Ä¢	Since WGU is my only option, what‚Äôs the best way to make the most of it and avoid any downsides people talk about?

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice from people who‚Äôve been through this or know the best paths to take!

When I say 'way less qualified' I mean she has worked for the agency for 4 years, and prior to working at the agency has no additional experience.  I, however, have worked for the agency for 8 years, and had 5 years experience prior to working there.  I also have supervisor experience, and experience in the unit where the promotion was given, which she does not possess.  Every one of my direct supervisors were advocating for my promotion.

For a long time, I have suspected that my commissioner has a personal issue with me, as this is the third time I've been passed up for a promotion, but the first one that I was truly the most qualified for.  While being told I was passed over for the promotion, I asked the staff coordinator, with whom I have a good relationship, very bluntly if the woman in charge of our agency will even entertain the idea of promoting me while in discussions, and she confirmed that she will not. When I told her I would likely be looking for a new job after this, she encouraged me to do so, confirming that my current job is a dead end.

1j54ajm,Advice on my life and career,"Hello, Career advice community!

First, thank you for taking the time to read my post‚ÄîI really appreciate your input!

I‚Äôm a college student, close to graduating, and I‚Äôm struggling with a major decision: should I pursue my startup full-time or commit to the Army full-time?

I started my startup in my second year of college, and I love building a company, meeting new people, and creating something of my own. But as graduation approaches, the people around me are concerned about job stability, which has made me second-guess my path.

I was in the ROTC program for a while but left. However, I did attend basic camp (a condensed version of boot camp), which I enjoyed overall‚Äîthough there are aspects I‚Äôm not too excited about, like attending another camp after graduation, waking up early, and eating MREs. I recently spoke with a captain about rejoining, and she was very welcoming, but I still feel torn.

One of my biggest concerns is that I don‚Äôt want to half-ass anything I pursue. If I decide to go all in on my company, I want to give it everything I have. But at the same time, the structure and commitment of the Army offer a different kind of stability and challenge.

For context, I‚Äôm currently a junior in college, 21 years old, and male (if that matters).

1j538ny,"My friend was promoted, he is poor at his job but a great people person. How do I handle this?","So our structure recently was that we are all on the same level with one manager and a senior manager. The manager above us doesn't have any technical or operations knowledge but the senior manager does. My friend was promoted to team lead but he also doesn't have any technical or operations knowledge.

The issue this has caused is for instance, he is told repeatedly that x person does this and y person does this but he just doesn't get it so we are repeatedly given the wrong task and we lose time redirecting it to the right person. 

I am left to pick up the heavy lifting because neither the team lead nor the manager is able to help on the more technical requests so it is left to me to help on all of the more technical tasks the other team members are doing. This includes tasks given to the team lead and ones given to the manager. This often means spending hours talking through it and helping them figure it out.

The job has now become exhausting. Originally, I said I would just try to keep out of it and just leave everyone to their own devices but now they pressure me as clients pressure them to get things done and they don't know if it can be done or how long it would take or if what they are asking for would cause more trouble than it's worth.

1j52j3m,Engineer or Doctor career advice,"(I‚Äôm grateful I get the opportunity to have a dilemma like this)

Hey all, as this school year nears its end. I am struggling to choose between pursuing something in healthcare such as a dentist (general practice) or doctor (family) , or being an Engineer (biomedical). 

When I speak to people who chose engineering and not health care they typically mention how they hated biology, but in my case I enjoy biology and human anatomy. I enjoy learning how the human body works and being able to directly diagnose people and help them with something important as personal health. On the flip side I‚Äôm also good at maths and physics although I didn‚Äôt have the best teacher I still managed to get a 90+ in physics. Problem solving is something I enjoy and helping people is something I enjoy however it seems that both of these things are achievable in healthcare and engineering.

I also can‚Äôt see myself sitting in a cubicle all day long I want to socialize with people and see my impact instead of doing it at a distance if that makes sense. 

I‚Äôm also lowk afraid to pursue dentistry or medicine because of how hard it is to get in within Canada as there are only a handful of universities. I would 100% apply to America because I think it‚Äôs a lot easier to get in compared to Canada but it‚Äôs still difficult and I don‚Äôt like the idea of leaving my family to go to Australia, Ireland or the Caribbean to obtain an MD since I know that‚Äôs a last resort for many aspiring physicians. 

I‚Äôve currently applied to many health science and engineering programs across Ontario and as the year approaches its end I‚Äôm still not 100% sure.

Maybe this is my brain actualizing that I can‚Äôt pursue everything I have a passion for in life? And that life is getting real? And I‚Äôm panicking about making the right decision? 

If anyone has gone through something similar and can provide advice to help me figure myself out I‚Äôd greatly appreciate any input!

1j51yan,Is it a bad choice? Should I switch from Accounting to Electrical Technologist Diploma?,"
I‚Äôm 23 and was working as a senior home worker making $27/hr with no degree or experience. I switched to a part-time job and started my Business program with an Accounting major. I was told that apparently there is an accountant shortage and my instructors still say that there is a shortage. But, salaries don't reflect that at all! IMO. Anyway, I did one semester and my grades are exceptional. Accounting isn‚Äôt that hard for me. I also kinda like it. But, I recently met some ppl who mentioned a ridiculous amount of hours that they have to work and that no overtime is industry standard!! I checked entry-level jobs on Indeed. Pay for new grads ranges from $49-55k. I made more doing my last job with zero qualifications, plus a first aid certificate lol !!!! 

Plus, after completing the degree, getting a CPA license is crucial for any career progress. Some employers pay for it but it still requires considerable time and effort. Which is totally fine but the reward for all that effort is not quite good.
All of this got me thinking if I made the right choice. 

I checked that electrical engineering pays more $$ for any level. I am also interested in how electricity works. So, my college has a 2-year Electrical Technologist Diploma that has a bridging pathway to the second semester of 2yr Electrical Engineering in a university. 

I did not take any science courses in high school. I will need to take grade 11 and 12 courses in Chemistry and Physics. I will also need Pre-Calculus to get accepted for the diploma. This means that I will need to find a full-time job again and do these in series. 

My family thinks I should stick to it and it's my ADHD trying to make me switch. Lol.

So, should I take the risk and drop my business program to pursue electrical engineering to make $$??
Or 
Am I being unrealistic and asking for too much? Should stick to what I started?   

Thanks for your help in advance. üôè

I currently work for the federal government as a water plant operator, I currently make about 77-80k a year with no OT, but we always have OT because of short staffing.
The schedule is swing shifts that rotate weekly. One week I‚Äôm on afternoons, next week I‚Äôm on mornings, the next week I‚Äôm on overnights. With one weekend off a month. 

My wife is a RN, she works overnights and we share a mortgage together. We just bought a house last year in November. I currently have two years with the federal government and have more steps to fill out in the wage system. 

The Monday-Friday schedule sounds good, but currently would create a slight conflict with my wife‚Äôs schedule. 

Is this job worth jumping for? Should I stay with my current employment?

1j513ac,I feel like I'm wasting my life. How to get out of my rut?,"I'd appreciate some clear guidance of what to do because as the days go on, I'm starting to feel depressed and I have no one to lean on. I'm almost 32 and really don't have a solid career. I went to college, got a degree, started a blog (which I loved and was kinda making a living off of it) and now that an establishment made a negative post about me and after receiving hate and backlash from their fans, I haven't gone back in over a year. I've had odd jobs like retail and fast food but at my age, I feel like I should have a career. I am not going back to school because of expenses and I feel like I'm old. I thought about starting a new blog but thought about the years and time that it took me to build that one up, it makes me scared to even start a new one. 

My degree was in Business Administration but had no emphasis as I knew I wanted to go into blogging (or fashion) and I have no clue what to do now. I love to cook (hence why I did my food blog) and love doing things around the house, exploring/traveling etc. I've started my own small business on Etsy that's kinda doing ok but I'd like to have something consistent.

1j5131m,Have I lost my mind? Considering a career change,"I'm considering a career change from Human Resources to Nursing and am struggling to weigh the logistics of the situation. 

To break down my current situation - I have 6 years of HR experience, and I started a new job last October with a $115k salary plus a bonus. Good schedule and benefits. My partner has a job in the same location, making $110k, and travels for work heavily. It's a VERY HCOL area, and because we moved from out of state to work here, we've struggled to keep any significant savings in the bank. My new job and salary have enabled us to start saving close to $1700 per month, which is game-changing. We're finally on track to have a proper emergency fund and maybe replace our old 2007 Ford Explorer this summer. We just replaced our other car, so there's a new $460/mo payment as well as a few loan payments (I got a business degree, and we own a house out of state), totaling about $1200 in debt a month. 

The problem is, I can't stand my job. I went into HR for the hours because my partner was in the military when we got married, he was the only person I knew in the whole state, and I wanted to be able to see him. Now, 6 years later, I've obviously had some success and advancement up the corporate ladder, but I've struggled to find meaning (or even basic engagement) in any position I've had. I hate the work and have to force myself to do my daily tasks. I feel terrible for that, but it's true.

I can start Nursing pre-requisites after hours and continue saving money, but eventually, the return to school would be full-time, and my partner would be the only money maker $110k doesn't go as far here as it should, so things would be tight. I'm 26 now, and it could easily take me until I'm 29 or 30 to complete nursing school, depending on the program. They're also very competitive as I'm in SoCal, so it's a risk and depending on where I'm accepted, I could end up commuting long hours for school and clinicals. This is a huge financial change. It would mean no new car, no vacations, very little fun spending, and basically a 360 from what we thought the next few years were going to look like - we were aiming for financial stability, buying a house, and potentially planning for a family around 30; this would push all that back. 

So, is it worth it to go through all that hell to get into a job I would actually enjoy and find meaning in? Or do I just buckle in and keep trying to like my desk job in favor of the money and benefits I have now?",howaboutanartfru,1,1.0,10,1741282649,2025-03-06 17:37:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j5131m/have_i_lost_my_mind_considering_a_career_change/,3,2025

1j50rx4,Negotiating Salaries,"I've got a job interview tomorrow for my first permenant role in a corporate company. I have had a temporary role at the same company before so I am really looking forward to the interview, and I hope I get the job.

However, on the job description, it explains that the salary ranges from ¬£25,000 - ¬£31,000 per annum. It does not say whether the salary you get is based on the experience you have for the job.

Forgive me if these are silly questions, I have only had zero hour contract jobs in the past so haven't had any experience when it comes to negotiating salaries.

Firstly, say if i started off with ¬£25,000, would that slowly increase to ¬£31,000 as I gained more time and experience in the role? And if that is the case, how often would I see this increase happen?

If it was the case where I had to negotiate my salary and stick with that salary for a year, how do I negotiate? Whilst I haven't had an exact role that reflects the tasks exactly, I have had experiences with doing all accountabilities required in all my previous jobs, so I know my experience wouldn't be worth the lowest salary available. Additionally, my previous salary was ¬£27,000 per annum, so ideally I do not wish work backwards from that. I would rather have at least the same salary as I did.

1j4x0g3,Is AI employee activity tracking going to destroy IT?,"Wanting to get some opinions on this. AI applications such as activity trackers running on employee's machines are great for detecting if people don't show up for work either in person or remote, and are great for - what's the buzz phrase now - ""optimizing employee's work day by identifying areas where there are inefficiencies.""

  
Without naming particular tools, there is a big move in the industry to implement these tools recently. Leaving the entire political thing going on now out of this. It's industry-wide.

  
The concern is this:

  
For normal office users on 9-5 jobs, sure, making sure someone is on e-mail or meetings or creating Excel workbooks is great. Whatever people who don't do Software Engineering do all day. But when it comes to Software Engineering, I'm finding that the ""better you get"" at your job, the less time you actually spend ""doing"" and the more time you spend ""thinking"" and ""researching."" 

  
Sure, part of your day may be spent writing unit tests, part of your day could be spent writing code. But the more and more you get deeper into programming - unless you want to take on leadership - you end up doing a LOT of research all day. Furthermore, much of the research that may help you grow the most is probably - hopefully - not going to be on production impacting systems to where you could cause an outage. 

  
So the problem is - only 1 hour of your typical work day on any given day may actually be spent interacting with your computer on ""known business sites"" - even in the office. The rest of your time could be Googling things, surfing blogs, and forums for answers to questions. Watching YouTube training videos. Etc. 



Many of these ""performance auditing tools"" track that stuff as Personal time, without even disclosing the URLs you are visiting to your employer. And they don't capture activity on non-company devices at all. And I wouldn't want them installing spyware on my phone, either!

  
Sure, your management, and several levels of leadership above your management at any given company may know this is how Software Engineers work. In general even Google tells you that Software Engineers, the better you get, you do less interactions in your IDE and do more research to find out answers and then just type them in and things magically work if you're good.... 



But if levels of leadership at the C-suite level look at these activity trackers at a typical Fortune 500 company, and make decisions without even asking your director or VP of the organization based on those tools... then basically the people in some of the the highest skilled positions are the least productive and first to be let go. Basically like what is happening at a high level across the US right now. But employers have firepower that has no context now.

  
What's going to happen first - are all the highest skilled workers going to be laid off, or is the industry going to realize that productivity != typing in Office products all day?",f00dl3,0,0.25,4,1741272254,2025-03-06 14:44:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j4x0g3/is_ai_employee_activity_tracking_going_to_destroy/,3,2025

1j4wj1x,"I see what other ppl make at my org, bring this up in negotiations?","At my organization, a salary adjustment just happened that brought the organization closer in alignment with national salary averages.  Some staff got huge salary increases, up to 15%.

Apart from the union negotiated % increase, I got no salary increase because my job title nationally has a low salary associated with it.  

However, the job descriptions connected to my title vary widely.  Some ppl with this title just push paper around, it's just administrative work, some include extensive writing tasks, and some include compliance. 

The jobs for my job title that include all three of these dimensions garner the greatest salaries, up to 40K above what I am making.  And that's what I do, I push paper around, I do extensive writing and editing, and I am the compliance expert for the organization, the latter centered on interpreting regulations. 

I have asked for a salary increase before through the union but was denied.  But now, seeing the salary increases that others received, I am stunned. Even without seeing these increases, I wanted to ask again for a salary increase, but now I am just incredulous.  

I feel like they take me for granted.  Should I ask for an increase without referencing the other staff salary increases (yes, rite?) or should I say that I don't think this is fair and include my knowledge of these salary increases.

1j4u2su,To be or not to be a Certified Surgical First Assistant‚Ä¶,"Yesterday I was accepted into americas only Masters of Surgical Assisting program, which equips graduates to take the national exam to become a Certified Surgical Assistant (CSA). I desperately want this job. I love the OR and human anatomy, I love doing delicate and precise work, I love being able to help people from mostly behind the scenes. I have a non clinical bachelors degree and I am not an RN, PA, Surgical Technician, etc.

Here‚Äôs the problem: my husband is military, and the five US duty stations he can be sent to over his remaining 15 years are CA, WA, NY, VA, SC. It is not legal for a CSA to practice in CA, WA, NY (among a few other states). We started in SC and are currently in VA through 2028. Should we be sent to 3/5 of those places, I would have zero employable qualifications. I know myself well, and there is absolutely no way I could go 4-5 years without practicing as a CSA and then jump back in when we switch duty stations again. But living in separate states would also be an ENORMOUS challenge in its
own right. I can‚Äôt stomach the idea of being apart like that (especially since there‚Äôs a very real chance we end up on opposite coasts if I stay in Virginia).

I currently do not qualify for any BSN or PA programs that could get me into surgical first assisting other ways- by the time I did gather those requirements, it would be too late for me to start and finish the program before we PCS again. And frankly, I really don‚Äôt WANT to be a nurse or a PA. All I want is surgery. The other option would be to become a surgical technologist, but the thought of moving backwards to an associates degree that will put me across the room from the job I actually wanted is painful.

I‚Äôm being torn between following my dream and being realistic/cautious. My family is arguing back and forth and I just need the advice of people who are directly impacted by this choice and don‚Äôt feel the pain I‚Äôm going through here. Please, I appreciate any advice or perspective you can offer.

TLDR: I have a shot at my dream job, but it might leave me unemployable at 3/5 of my husbands potential duty stations. I need help deciding what to do.

1j4t9p0,Feeling off for a while can‚Äôt tell what I want to do anymore,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my situation and see if anyone has been through something similar.

I graduated two years ago with degrees in Web & Mobile Development and Creative Computing. Since then, I‚Äôve struggled to find a traditional programming job. Instead, I‚Äôve taken on freelance clients, mostly working with MERN stack, LAMP, and WordPress. But even in freelancing, I often feel like I don‚Äôt fully know what I‚Äôm doing, which makes me doubt my skills. I never know what should i know and how to practice i feel like i am in a loop of not knowing how much i really know. I graduated also with high grades and considered my self to be relatively good, but not excellent. Now i am too tired to even read a requirement and my brain can't work, it's like i don't brain anymore.  

In my spare time, I work on personal projects like building a NAS due to personal needs, making my own website and sketch ot apps or a couple years ago i got into robotics and started to make self-drawing robots, but none of it really helps me land a job. And since LLMs and GPTs became  available, I find myself writing less and less code‚ÄîI just prompt, fix, and move on. This makes me feel even more disconnected from the idea of working as a programmer in a company, or be interview ready.

On top of that, I‚Äôve gained 40kg since graduating, and I feel drained. I taught at a university for six months, but it didn‚Äôt lead to anything long-term. I thought maybe to do a PhD but got lost and could not find an valuable opportunity. Lately, I‚Äôve been trying to get better at deep learning, but the learning curve feels endless, and I‚Äôm too stressed to actually undestand and learn. I also got a math certificate but i feel like i can't reember anything of what i learned and the feeling of ever be good enough to get hired in the field is stronger.

Also the truth is, I‚Äôve always wanted to do graphic design, arts, and music, but I ended up in computer science because it was the only offer at the time when i mover into the country, even though i wanted to pursue a more creative study. I had to pursued this field more out of necessity than outt of passion and not doing it led to move back to my home country, so I just kept pushing forward. Now, after nine years and two degrees, I feel completely lost. I am working in a restaurant to maintain but i feels even worst, crazy hours and I am losing sight of what i am becoming.

Right now, I‚Äôm working in a restaurant just to stay afloat, but it‚Äôs exhausting, and I feel like I‚Äôm losing sight of myself. I‚Äôm considering switching to graphic design by taking some courses, but it feels daunting to start over. At the same time, programming doesn‚Äôt feel right for me anymore, even though I keep making plans to improve‚Äîbut I never follow through. I even had an AI-related interview recently, and I couldn't even program a simple MNIST classifier. That really hit me.

Any advice would be really appreciated.

I‚Äôm sorry to vent like this, but I feel like I need to take a step back and rethink everything. Has anyone else felt this way?

2.) ( One of the most reputable in my country) "" your combination of skills is interesting, Would you be available for a quick call? This won't be a full interview, I'd just like to check what you'd be interested in focusing on before we set up a full interview"" - I have to email them back and I can decide when the call will be sometime next week.

1j4q8x0,Did I gave up too quick?,"


hi, I was approached some time ago to work in the special education. I am a speech therapist and normally I work 1 on 1 with a client. However, within this school I was assigned a class of 5 kids. So I would be working in a classroom setting, along with a teaching assistant. The goal was to encourage speech and language skills and communication. The children are non verbal and very autistic, ages 4-6. When I started it suddenly turned out to be 7 children instead of 5 (I had not been told this). There were no toys in the class even though the class had started a month earlier. There was no onboarding, no one knew what the intention was and I had to figure everything out on my own.The assistant couldn't tell me much either, she just returned after a burnout. I had no access to children's files (only after 4 days).Parents had been told that I was on vacation for a month and therefore did not attend earlier (I was still working at my former employer, why say I was on vacation???).

After 2 days the assistant got sick, apparently she had just started again after a burnout, but again she was not doing well. Then a teacher came into the classroom, this was nice because for the first time I saw how it worked in a classroom. The next day another assistant was put with me, but she had started the same day as me..we were both new and didn't know much yet. The next day I was all alone in a group of 7 children. Totally irresponsible and not okay towards the parents and children.I had to entertain these children without toys.

I indicated that I have no experience with a class, since you normally work 1 on 1, and that I do need something of help/help. I also indicated that I was surviving and did not experience the first week as positive. My supervisor was quite light-hearted about this.She indicated that this is normal and everyone feels this way the first 6 weeks.Then I was asked how I wanted to work towards the goals of this class, I indicated that treatment materials should be provided first.‚ÄúOh, we may have to order that...indeed there are no toys,‚Äù was her reply. Then she said ‚Äúmaybe we should sit down next week to discuss things‚Äù.

Colleagues were not okay with me not receiving guidance and said there should be a teacher in front of the group instead of a speech therapist (and on reflection, I agreed).I have no experience in a classroom setting and much more was covered than just language development, speech and communication. Behavioral problems etc., personal care (1 day I was just wiping butts). There were many employees with burnout, a lot of employee turnover.Not much seemed right about the organization.The supervisor said ‚Äúyou don't really need to do anything with the kids‚Äù.

After my first week, I immediately quit and left. The lack of treatment materials/toys, no supervision, onboarding, lack of communication. It all didn't feel right and thats where my decision was based on. Now looking back, I'm thinking: should I gave it more time? Maybe I would have get used to it. I don't know.

1j4p5i9,UI UX Design or Data Analyst?,"Basically I am a webdev looking for career change. I think I've had enough of too logical sense of coding which I usually fail at. Now I am thinking of switching my career to something else.

After lots of pondering, I think I am leaning towards these 2 (ui/ux design and data analyst).

I am not sure how to pick between those 2. I am not ""bright"" in Mathematics but also not BAD (I know simple mathematics and some basic formula in certain situations) but I am also not that analytical kind of guy (as in I don't ask questions that much which later would pop in my head instead).

On other side, I love design! Also love to see a good beautiful design with correct flow. But the thought of it will require a lot of feedback with client tires me.

But I know either way, I'd want to work in an in-house company. Agency really not the way for me (had bad experience with it).

How should I pick between these 2? I am currently taking online course for Data Analytics and been enjoying it so far.

1j4ozku,Workplace retaliation so miserable I want to quit,"

For over 14 years, I have been a dedicated and reliable employee. If you review my timekeeping records, you will find that I rarely called in or had absences. In fact, I can confidently say that the number of times I called in over the past 14 years can likely be counted on one hand. During that time, I was consistently given raises, promoted to Lead MA, and received Employee of the Month honors several times despite being late or leaving early. At no point did I receive any disciplinary actions regarding my attendance and my work performance was never called into question. .

About two and a half years ago, after the Medicare guideline changes and the resulting takeback caused workload increases, making work overwhelming. The understaffing led to burnout, and the pressure of managing a larger volume of work took a toll on my mental health. I reached out to Dr/Boss to express that the workload had become too much for me to handle and we needed to hire one clerical and one clinical MA before a total office collapse due to crucial task not being completed.   From that moment on, I began to notice a drastic change in how I was treated.  Instead of taking my advice, a phone operator was hired under the strict pretense she was not to help me but to only answer phones.  When I had to ask her for help I was immediately screamed at by administration ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt keep throwing money at the problem‚Äù Right after that a nurse practitioner was hired who harassed and bullied me for a year with multiple meetings that were never required before, one meeting in particular resulted in her screaming, crying and shaking over me obtaining an authorization.   Two years later I was told by administration ‚Äúyou were right we were operating understaffed‚Äù.

Attendance rules were immediately updated after I complained, and I was written up for the first time in my career. Since then, I have multiple write-ups, related to attendance even though my coworkers have been late and called in without any consequence. I have been relocated, excluded from meetings, uninvited to holiday gatherings, demoted, stripped of responsibilities, and subjected to verbal abuse, including being screamed at, cursed at, and scapegoated. I have been undermined, had my work called into question and embarrassed professionally.   I have over heard HR discuss my time keeping with a coworker for no reason and when I confronted them about it and asked if it was an issue I was immediately gas lighted and told it didn‚Äôt happen even though I was standing right there.

I was told in private that any issues regarding my step daughter‚Äôs care were my husband‚Äôs responsibility and should never be an excuse for missing work and to my knowledge that rule has not applied to anyone else. Recently after I called in sick due to illness.  I was threatened with having my hours reduced to part-time‚Äîsomething I have never seen happen to any other employee in my department. I have been accused of not obtaining authorizations, even though upon checking I successfully obtained 149 approved procedures from February 18 to February 28, 2025. Despite this, my hard work and dedication have been dismissed, and I feel that I am being unfairly scrutinized.

I have not complained, and I have continued to do my job to the best of my ability. However, I now find myself in a position where I have no way to defend myself, and I am being treated unfairly. The stress and emotional toll of these actions have affected me personally and professionally, and I feel that I must speak up to ensure that this situation is documented. I have always been a dedicated employee, and I believe I deserve to be treated with professionalism and it‚Äôs not happening.  I‚Äôm supposed to find out this week if they are reducing me to part time.  I really just want to walk the fuck right out the door.  I have no job title or description I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing now they have taken everything.   I don‚Äôt have another job lined up but I‚Äôm applying.  I can‚Äôt get unemployment if I quit.  Should I consult with a lawyer?

1j4nmo1,Should I ask for more money on my promotion?,"Hello folks! A bit of background for this question:

I (25M) am currently the Assistant General Manager of the highest-grossing restaurant in my hospitality group (we profit about 33% more than the next closest concept). I was hired on at $55,000 and the company, which is rapidly expanding, took a risk on me in this role. I was a risk because, at the time of my hiring, I had the least hospitality tenure out of anyone in the building except for our hosts and bussers (about 5 years total), and no prior salaried management experience. However, I have been a manager part-time for one other restaurant, and I've been a manager in other fields as well.

  
Upon my arrival, I was working about 50-55 hours a week but discovered some inefficient records and reporting systems at my location which I immediately set about improving. Long story short there, I created and have been maintaining, for the past 10 months or so, a new financial record-keeping system and a new anti-theft-oriented cash-tracking system, causing me to work roughly 70-75 hours a week. For this work, I was offered an additional $8,500, bringing me to a total salary of $63,500 during this time.

  
I am now about 3 weeks short of a year with the company and was recently offered a GM position which would entail overseeing the physical transition of one of our concepts to a new location in the same city. The concept does not have a GM currently, making me the opening GM who has to learn the culture and procedures from the ground up. I have been told my responsibilities with the record systems that I created will be removed, and that the $8,500 will be removed from my salary. However, I have also been told that $10,000 will be added to reflect the GM promotion, bringing me to a total compensation of $65,000. I view this as a $1,500 raise as opposed to a $10,000 raise.

  
I have not transferred full knowledge of my systems to any individual, not even my Director of Operations or my CFO, and I don't believe they can run the systems effectively without me no matter how much training I give them. They simply don't understand excel the way I do and don't know how to engineer or edit a complex spreadsheet engineered for ease of front-end use. Additionally, I know I have been given this GM position over any other candidate in the company or any outside hire because they view me as the most valuable and effective of my peers (current GM's in the company not included). Finally, I know current GM's in the company all make well over $65,000.

  
Given the value I've added to the company and the proficiencies I've demonstrated, but still considering my lack of experience, should I ask for more money? Or does the $65,000 (which I know is at least $15,000 below market) seem fair in the wash?

1j4nams,What do you think of this hiring process? [Content Copywriter],"I applied for a junior content writing position with a sales company. The main task is writing SEO blog posts. 

An automated message reached out and gave me a link to a writing assessment. 1.2-2k words, complete with SEO research, to be completed in 48 hours. 

I passed the assessment and was contacted by HR. I will be going for an in-office interview next week, where I will need to do a 3-hour SEO assessment, and this is what caught me off guard. Are they trying to make sure I didn't churn out content using AI? What was the point of the previous assessment then?

I looked them up on Glassdoor, they're known to have no tolerance for people who want to learn on the job + they don't have a good onboarding process. They pride themselves on work hard with no play. The red flags are adding up for me, personally. 

I did research their product but I didn't think to look up employee reviews until now. Feels like a mistake. 

Am I right to say that even from the hiring process alone things seem to be... difficult? 

Idk. Is it standard that hiring processes

1j4mfvt,Update: WFH Job in Jeopardy because of ActivTrak,"Hi, r/careeradvice community - I wanted to provide an update to my previous post from about 3 weeks ago, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io5jgx/wfh_job_in_jeopardy_because_of_activtrak/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I got a lot of good, bad, and entertaining advice from the comments, and wanted to share what has happened in the 3 weeks since. 

TL;DR: My manager and I had a little difference of opinion about my merit increase and bonus, and I'm now job hunting in earnest. 

Last week, I got my fifth annual performance review from my manager. We are ranked 1 through 5 in each category, with 3 being ""meets expectations."" She always says that a 3 is an ""A,"" with a 4 being an ""A+"" and a 5 being ""next to impossible to achieve, because no one is perfect."" She also said our department VP would not allow the middle managers to give anyone a 5 unless it was extremely well-documented and justified.

In previous years, raises have corresponded with our overall final score. In the past, I have scored between a 3.5 and 4, and they rounded up, so I received a 4% increase each time. 

This year, because we missed our target, our company capped all raises at 2.5%. So even if a person somehow got a score of 4 or higher, they'd get the same 2.5% raise as the person who got a score of 2.5. (I did ask a few different questions to clarify this system - would the 4 get a 2.5% and a 2 get a 1%? No, pretty much every individual contributor who scored a 2.5 or higher got 2.5%). 

In addition to the cap on raises, the company did not fully fund the company portion of our merit bonus. So instead of a 1.5% bonus, I got a 1.125% bonus. 

My overall score was a 3.75, but as she hinted at in our previous discussions, my manager did score me at a 2 for the ""productivity"" section due to my ActivTrak results. 

I took copious notes during my review, and here are some close-to-verbatim quotes (I removed as many identifying details as I could): 

* ""I had to score you at a 2 for productivity because of your active hours in ActivTrak, but you know you get more done in those hours than other people do in a day."" 
* ""Your best work is far and above the best work of anyone else on the team."" 
* ""We could not have made it through that \[project\] without you."" 
* ""You took a lot off my plate this year and took the lead on a number of projects which stretched your skills, and I am grateful."" 
* ""You kept calm and carried on, even in the face of unexpected challenges, and our department's success is a result of your hard work."" 
* ""Because you are so good at \[task\], while others struggle with it, you raised the standards that you are judged by."" 

Anyway, I tried to be open-minded, asked questions, and took lots of notes during my review. Then, I surprised myself by being frank and pushed back. 

I told her that it was becoming increasingly difficult to meet my personal financial goals on my salary. I told her that I was hoping to be rewarded for my contributions with more than words. I told her that while I valued the feedback and liked hearing where I could improve, that it was difficult for me to stomach being held to a different standard than my other teammates. And, I told her that a lot of the feedback she provided was the same as the last 3 years; and even though my role has evolved and expanded, my title and pay have remained static. 

She got defensive and told me that we have ""fundamental philosophical differences in our approach to work,"" and also told me that I should work hard for the ""reward of a job well done,"" and not put so much weight on financial rewards. She said what gets her out of bed in the morning is the work, not the money.

That really rankled me, so I told her that we are working at a for-profit company, not a mission-driven charitable organization, and that my philosophy about working hard shows through in the results I achieve. I admitted that it is hard to be motivated to improve, knowing that I'm giving a 4% effort but only getting rewarded for 2.5% effort.

Then, she *really* pissed me off by telling me that she sat down and calculated it, and that even though I was missing out on 1.5% of the salary increase and 0.375% of the bonus I was entitled to in the past, it ""only"" amounted to about $650 annually. 

I was so cheesed off, I told her if it was ""only"" $650, the company should have no problem rewarding me with that little bit extra.

I asked her about the direction of the company, if we were in trouble, why we didn't hit our target, if we were over-leveraged, and what the plan was to stop the turnover. 

She didn't respond well to that, either. She said missing our target was a result of an accounting error, and I suggested that maybe accounting should take the brunt of their error and not our department. I also pointed out that I noticed a lot of activity, recognition, and rewards and bonuses in Sales, and a lot of turnover and terminations in Shared Services. She said since we don't bring in money, we can't be surprised that the cuts targeted our department. And that they don't legally have to give us raises or bonuses, and we should just be happy we even got anything.

Red flags abound! When management starts talking about what they ""legally"" have to do, it's a sign that they're not concerned with retaining and motivating their staff. 

So, it's no surprise that I've made it a goal to apply for at least 5 positions every day until I get an offer, and I have done so every day since my review. I've already had 2 phone screen calls. I'm reaching out to contacts through school and previous companies I've worked for, and asking friends if they're hiring.

Please wish me luck on the job search! And if you know of any companies that are actually interested in rewarding their hardest-working employees, please shout them in the comments below!

1j4lzip,To apply for a WFH position?,"I'm a professor and I've been with my school for over a decade. I teach a few in-person classes, but mostly teach online because our on-campus enrollment just keeps declining. I work in my office on campus Monday-Friday. Since COVID, the faculty offices have not been the same because several started doing virtual office hours from home.  Other than interactions with students, I don't have much social interaction with colleagues. 

I'm considering applying at another college I sometimes adjunct for. The position is completely online teaching, and other than a few meetings a year, is WFH. I would make more money, and I think that's the biggest reason I'm considering applying. My current college is a small institution and I feel valued there, for the most part. The other college is really big and I know there will be more annoying bureaucracy to deal with there. 

I've been teaching for 21 years. I really love being in the classroom and working directly with students, but it is draining. I feel it's becoming more and more challenging to keep students engaged‚Äîthey're all so addicted to their screens! But teaching online, I feel I don't really get to know students. 

I'm worried I won't be happy working from home all the time. My spouse is retired and he's around the house most of the time. I'm not sure being around each other more will be good for us. He's been somewhat needy for my time when I'm not at work and I think that's because he gets lonely in the day. I want to go to the gym and workout in the afternoons, but feel guilty doing another thing away from home when he seems so needy for my time. (And no, he's not interested in going to the gym.) Damn, as I type this I think I should be posting in a marriage forum instead. Lol. 

I've been over-thinking whether or not to apply since I received an email about the new position yesterday. I don't know if I'm just worried about change, feeling anxious I'll be rejected (I interviewed at this college years ago and didn't get hired), or feel guilty for leaving my current school. 

Those of you who work from home, are you happy? Should I apply?

Seriously, I don't understand these interviews anymore... I'm a VP/Senior Director level in Product Management in tech.

Last month, I had a lot of interviews. I reached advanced rounds in several companies, but it didn't work out for whatever reason.

There was one of them that looked very promising. I reached the final round. They told me it would be on-site and I would meet 6 people.

When I arrived, they put me in a conference room with glass doors in the middle of the office. And then I did 5 Zoom interviews back-to-back without any break. Each one of them was a full hour of interrogation on a different topic. It was very difficult to focus in the fourth one, but I continued and remained professional. I felt that the whole day was one of the best interview performances of my life.

Today I got rejected.

I don't understand what the point of all that was. Since most of them are Zoom calls anyway, why didn't they let me do them at home and take breaks?

I've been looking for a job for 10 months and I need to take a break.

I've done a lot of interviews, but they were all weird in some way. Not one of them was a normal conversation where they ask me typical interview questions.

1j4kinb,Admin In Australia,"Hey everyone 

Does anyone do admin in the real estate industry 

I'm currently trying to get in admin in Australia (entry level). I currently work in a warehouse doing a computer based job however the place I work at is not great and I'm looking for a new job

I went to an interview recently and asked about the pay and they said it's the award rate , I looked up the rate and it's roughly 48k full time. The job I currently work at I get paid roughly 48k as a part timer working 6.75 hours a day ( which I already think is bad for the type of work I currently do)

There is a lot of growth opportunities in this place which is exciting however I have heard from other reddit articles that this real estate company never pays above award rate

I'm not sure if the pay-off of the experience will be worth it and if i should just do it as it's a foot in the door 

Anyone work in this industry and have advice ?

Currently I have been told I need more experience,  more networking, and I need to move from level 2 role to a level 4 role, (because they won't hire a level 2 for a level 5 role-despite me fitting 75-80% of the requirements.)

I was a stay at home mom from essentially  ages 22-32. At 40, I about 8 years of work history, most of it within warehouse and logistics. 

I recently received my associates degree in business management and I'm currently taking courses to complete my bachelor's in Supply Chain and Logisitics Management.  I'm also enrolled in a data analytics mentorship at work that starts in a few weeks. 

I am really starting to serious feel pressure to be earning more.. I have absolutely nothing in retirement and I can barely afford to make ends meet. I can't afford to add more than the 5% I'm currently putting into my 401k. 

I could really use some guidance and assistance in how to advance my career faster than I am at the moment. Where are some good places to find this kind of assistance and how much should I expect to pay?

1j4hb33,DBA or PhD in Sports Management? Seeking Advice for Career-Oriented Path,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm considering pursuing a fully funded doctorate in Sports Management or a related field, but I‚Äôm torn between a DBA (Doctor of Business Administration) and a PhD in Sports Management.

A bit about me:

I have a Master‚Äôs in International Management with a focus on Sports Management.

My career interests lie in working with sports organizations, clubs/teams, or federations rather than academia.

As of now, I don‚Äôt see myself going into teaching but rather contributing to the industry through management, operations, or strategic roles.

From what I understand, a PhD is more research-focused and leans towards academia, while a DBA is more applied, industry-oriented, and suited for leadership roles. But I‚Äôd love to hear from those who have pursued or are pursuing either degree.

1. Which would be the better option for someone looking to work within the sports industry rather than academia?

2. Do you know of universities that offer fully funded DBA or PhD programs in Sports Management (or related fields like Sports Business/Administration)?

3. What‚Äôs the best approach to finding funding opportunities and applying for these programs?

Would appreciate any insights, experiences, or recommendations! Thanks in advance.

I am not sure how to take that because my current role is basically the same role I applied too, and the reason I applied to it was to start from the bottom and learn the company's systems and work my way up to other roles.

1j4dg47,Contract negotiation,"I‚Äôm an accounting student set to graduate with a BBA in Accounting in December as well as a real estate certificate. I also have two internships experience, currently one with a public accounting firm doing auditing.

I applied to a full time position, Accounting-Asset Management for a Commercial Real Estate company. The position is a full time role but they‚Äôre only looking for someone with an associates degree in accounting or finance. I applied and informed them I could work full time starting in May and then 30 hr/ week when I finish school in the fall semester. Long story short the accounting director loved me and offered me the job.

However, they‚Äôre offering me the job with compensation of 20$/hr (40,000 annualized). I asked him what the position starts at for a regular hire and he said low 50,000‚Äôs. 

I already feel as though I‚Äôm more valuable than what they‚Äôre looking for (higher degree, and relevant work experiences). So, I think it‚Äôs fair that I should be receiving the equivalent hourly of $50,000 ($24/hr). What do you guys think?

Side note: I spoke with a principal at the company (different sector of the business) as he was a guest speaker in one of my real estate classes. He suggested I apply for the role even though it‚Äôs full time. He also passed along my information to the accounting director after I sent him an email following our conversation.

1j4d6m8,I left my job and never went back and I actually do not care at all,"I told my job I had a family emergency and they said ‚Äúok‚Äù because I needed to get out of that living hell.

Backstory: I was hired to be a part-time, remote marketing person. 

Guess who was required to be a full time, in person, basically secretary. Me.

I have another job and told them my hours, my hours were constantly drug out and I was required to stay longer than needed, forced to do unnecessary work for my position, as well as not receive the necessary information I needed to perform my job (aka I‚Äôm just sitting at my desk waiting to leave but not allowed to leave early like my coworkers because my boss wouldn‚Äôt let me idk)

I just received an email that my position was being terminated and I have not been happier

I literally do not care. Find someone else to do your bitchwork and stop making job postings of a position that you don‚Äôt even know the requirements for.

Anyways, hope you all have a great day!

1j4clhq,Help! Does anyone know how I could help my friend get his job back?,"Ok, so there is this guy that I know. Let's call him Rob. He is a 31 year old single male that worked his dream job. He worked hard and grinded for years to get that job and he finally did. Rob works hard. He follows the rules, gets rewards, and is always praised. He got multiple raises and was on track for a promotion. He was unofficially the best employee at the building. Rob had a boss. The boss is a man that is somewhere in his mid 50s I think. He is a great boss. The boss has been in the industry for a while. He actually cares about his employees. The boss is always the last one to leave the building. He stays after hours just to make sure that his employees get the help they need. He fairly rewards everyone. He helps everyone and ask questions when they need help. To be honest out of all my bosses in my life. He is in the top 3. Rob was even about to get fired a few times and the boss saved his job. The boss also trained Rob making him the great employee that he became. Rob even admitted this himself and admires the boss. If it wasn't for the boss's help and kindness Rob would've gotten fired for previous mistakes. The boss has one issue though. There is a rule that coworkers can't date each other. Especially a supervisor and a subordinated. A new girl was hired there. I think the girl is 27 or 28 years old. She's pretty. A lot of the guys talk about how they want to hook up with her. Anyway, one day Rob was having a conversation with the boss. The boss was honest. He told Rob that he was having a secret relationship with the new girl. (Just to make it clear. The boss wasn't cheating or anything. In fact, he was recently divorced.) Rob told the boss that this isn't right and he should be following the rules. Rob told the boss that he is disappointed in his unprofessionalism and that he should stop. Rob is a man of principle and morals. He decided to file a report of everything that the boss told him so that the company could launch an internal investigation. Rob started telling all of the coworkers in the building about the boss's corruption. He told all the coworkers that it isn't fair that the boss could get away with breaking the rules but everyone else can't. He even blasted the boss on social media about how he is breaking the rules and how he should be disciplined for his corrupt actions. Anyway, the boss passed the investigation because Rob lacked evidence. It was a case of he said she said. Rob was called into the office and was terminated from his position. This is a serious problem. Rob has a mortgage and bills. He is single and lives by himself so he has no help or support. He also has a nephew that he is helping to put through college. He is helping to pay the nephew's tuition. Without his job everything falls apart. Another thing is that the boss has mass connections in the industry. Not only is Rob fired, but the boss will probably blacklist him from getting any other job in the industry. Rob has no evidence of his claim so he concluded that there is only one way he might be able to get his job back. He met up one on one with 27 year old girl that is dating the boss. He asked her to file a report and tell corporate that her and the boss is in a relationship. If she admits what's going on then his case will be more credible and he might be able to leverage that to get the boss in trouble and get his job back. The girl told Rob no. She said that she loves the boss and is standing by his side. This angered Rob. He told her that he has a mortgage and a nephew that is depending on him to get through college. If she doesn't go through with this case then he'll lose everything and so will his nephew. She told him no. She's love the boss and that's final. He continued to try to pressure into it but eventually she left. Now Rob is unemployed, most likely blacklisted from the industry, and is on the verge of losing everything. Rob was complaining to me about how he is suffering and getting fired because of his boss's mistake and how it isn't fair.

1j4cidq,Revitalizing The Job Market: Key Takeaways From President Trump‚Äôs Address," Revitalizing The Job Market: Key Takeaways From President Trump‚Äôs Address u/Forbes  



Last night, President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, placing the job market and economy prominent in his agenda. He outlined a multi-faceted strategy. This includes tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation.



They are all targeted for enhancing growth and job creation. Trump promised that these policies would revitalize American employment, particularly in manufacturing and tech. However, some of the timelines and aspects of the policies were light on specifics.



Trump highlighted steep tariffs already imposed on imports from Canada and Mexico‚Äî25% on most goods as of March 4, 2025‚Äîcontending that this would aid in pressuring companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., thereby potentially making overseas production costlier.



He framed this protectionism as a jobs engine. The hope was that businesses would hire domestically to avoid the levies.



He also shared plans for ‚Äúthe largest tax cut in American history,‚Äù extending his first-term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions set to expire in 2025 and slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% for domestic manufacturers. Trump claimed this will inspire business investment, boost hiring, and offer workers larger paychecks.



Deregulation rounded out his trifecta, with a pledge to axe ten regulations for every new one, freeing businesses from bureaucratic shackles to expand and onboard staff.



He pointed to billions in pledged investments from companies like SoftBank and Oracle as proof of surging economic confidence under his leadership.



Trump previously announced a joint venture called Stargate, involving OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, which aims to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years.

1j4c44z,Was forced into a ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù and im not sure how to take it,"
I‚Äôm currently a Project Engineer working on battery pack validation for a big Automotive OEM in Germany. My manager recently offered me a different role as a Systems engineering TeamnLeader, which is a step up in position but in a completely different area‚Äîinfotainment and car key communication. I rejected this role a week ago because I want to grow into leadership roles and my long-term goal is to move to the U.S. in the next two years (for personal reasons) and find work there. I declined the switch, thinking that staying in battery validation would keep me more desirable to U.S. employers, especially in the EV industry. Keep in mind, i literally had 40mins to decide. My reasoning was basically battery tech is more interesting to me and i think it has more growth potential plus id be competing with software engineers in the US (which there is an oversupply of) in Infotainment. I also need more technical expertise before I move into a leadership role.

Coming to today: she informs me that due to the low amount of projects in the team, she needs to move me to a different area cause im the only one ‚Äúmarketable‚Äù or experienced enough that other teams would consider taking me. There are a couple of newbies on the team and they need projects, otherwise it goes out of her hands how the situation escalates. 

Now this new position is a promotion into higher management. Id be a Project Leader for the Software development in battery packs. If i wasnt forced into this role, i might‚Äôve actually been glad about this new position. What do you guys think? I have zero experience in software since ive mostly been doing hardware battery pack validation so inexperience in that technical area is worrying me too.",thyexorcist,1,1.0,9,1741204269,2025-03-05 19:51:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j4c44z/was_forced_into_a_promotion_and_im_not_sure_how/,3,2025
1j4bxub,Is a Bachelor's in English with a minor in Business a decent idea?,"Before COVID hit, I completed a ton of classes towards getting an English AA-T degree because I wanted to be an English teacher.  I love reading and writing, it's definitely a passion.  Something funky happened towards the end of completing my associate degree and I meant to follow up with the counselor, but COVID hit and I was thrown into survival mode.

I forgot about my English degree, I just honestly couldn't cope with online school with ADHD while trying to survive the madness going on.  I had to move out to protect my parents while I worked to try to pay bills, my mother-in-law was dying from cancer, her son was being abusive... It was a very intense time and it took everything in me just to keep my head above water.

I ended up moving further away from that college.  I went to a new college and decided I'd go for a business admin degree because... honestly, between the low pay, school shootings, and the impacts of COVID on classrooms... I just didn't think it was a great path anymore.  

But after reviewing my transcripts and what my current school offers as an English AA-T degree... I could get my AA-T right now (if the meeting goes well?) and minor in Business.  

I'll probably get the English AA and then finish out my business admin associates degree since I'm not too far off from being done.  

But now I've moved even further away from the city and this small town is really peaceful... Little to no crime.  I'm tempted to reconsider teaching...

1j4beu0,When to call it quits?,"
I‚Äôve been having all kinds of thoughts about my current job. I‚Äôll try not to ramble. There are a few other posts on my profile with more info. 

Basically, i‚Äôve been working in communications for a fairly large organization for about four years now. I‚Äôve been the manager for 2. 

I stepped into the manager role when my old manager quit. Since then, I‚Äôve learned a lot. Now, I‚Äôm starting to run into the same challenges and obstacles that made my old manager quit. 

One of the biggest things is that I am supposed to report to Executive Director. The ED has been a revolving door since I started. I‚Äôm on my third boss. One of them didn‚Äôt even realize they were my boss. I‚Äôve heard the current Executive director say they have one foot out the door. This is starting to get to me. If they leave, I‚Äôm not sure I can handle having another new boss. If things are so bad at the top, why am I still here? 

In the past two years, 2 directors have quit because they are tired of this place. The last one was just last month. In the last few weeks, 2 other directors have went on stress leave. I can also think of a few other managers that have left because they were done with this place. Out of all the people that left, none had another job lined up. They just pulled the parachute. 

 I have some days where I don‚Äôt give a shit and things are fine. Then, I reflect on all the people that have left, I wonder why I am still here. I just don‚Äôt have the next move. I‚Äôm nervous to quit with nothing else lined up. I‚Äôm trying to get some irons in the fire but so far, there is nothing concrete. What would you do in my situation? When do you call it quits without a plan?  ",dylan95420,3,1.0,5,1741202564,2025-03-05 19:22:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j4beu0/when_to_call_it_quits/,3,2025

1j4ac37,Starting to feel quite lost and confused as to where I‚Äôm going,"Since I was 11 years old, I have been on a path to have a future career in criminal investigations or crime intelligence analysis. I am extremely passionate about this field.

In grade 12, through the mandatory career education class, we were required to find a mentor (someone in our desired field) who can give us guidance of what our next steps should be after high school, and info about what the field would be like as a career. I had a police officer as my mentor, and he explained to me that I don‚Äôt need to become a police officer to work in my desired positions, and that my Bachelors in Criminology (which I am halfway through currently) would be sufficient for landing a job.

Now I‚Äôve been starting to look more into my career options as I head into the second half of my degree. I‚Äôm quite confused. In my area, most crime intelligence analysts are through the police, if not through the city. But they require knowledge about certain data entry programs and some math. The police occasionally offer ‚Äúcivilian crime investigator‚Äù opportunities, however only in cyber crime and financial crime, and they require knowledge on computer science and accounting. 

My degree has only included one statistics course, in which I did not use any data entry platforms such as Excel or what not. I‚Äôm starting to feel really lost on where to go, and I know that I‚Äôm only 21 and still have time, but not having an idea of where to go anymore is scaring me and I‚Äôm feeling discouraged. I‚Äôm spending all my time and all of my effort for this degree and now I‚Äôm worried that it‚Äôs not going to even be worth it.

1j49z40,Pay cut?,"
Hi all,

I am interviewing for a role at a top tech company (one of my target companies to work for + one of the largest in the world). The role would be very interesting and work on projects I‚Äôm already familiar with (due to partnerships with my current employer). However, it would be a bit more junior compared to my current role. I am 29 but have grown a lot with my current employer and got promoted 4 times in 5 years. 

I spoke with the recruiter today and he told me more about the (non negotiable) offer - it seems like I would have to take a pay cut on my base salary for this role (around 13%). However I would have stock options plus a better bonus than what I currently have, which would make the total compensation package pretty much the same to what I currently make.

Now the question is: do you think it‚Äôs worth it to take a pay cut in base salary and accept a ‚Äòless senior‚Äô role to pursue a career in a top company? I guess the upside is that it would look great on my CV and potentially open up a lot of future opportunities. Anyone has been in similar situations and can share thoughts?

1j49msw,I left a $300k job at 25 to pursue my dream career with a starting salary of $65k and I'm so f*cking happy I did.,"I'm a passionate person who enjoys work and finds a lot of gratification from it and two years ago, I had a very challenging decision to make. I had a fantastic job and great career trajectory, but I hated my job. I was miserable when a sick job - my dream job - popped up but I barely had any savings (shit ton of student loans), lived in the highest COL area in the US, not a trust fund baby, parents not in a position to pay my rent. I struggled for a few weeks trying to figure out what to do and finally admitted to myself that (once you are able to afford basic needs and fulfill your financial obligations, of course) money means shit if you're miserable. I took the plunge, started my dream job and absolutely fell in love. I absolutely struggled finanlly. I had to pinch pennies, I had to do odd jobs at one point, but I was actually having fun. I was able to excel quickly and two years later I'm making low 6 figures - I'm definitely not making what I was before but I get to do what I love and still have pretty of room for upward mobility.

I don't know why I felt inspired to make this post but I've had a lot of new grads reach out to me recently to ask questions about my previous career and they all seem to be mindblown by the fact that I chose to leave. So I guess I just wanted to say it's ok to turn down the big bucks once your necessities are covered and it's ok to change your mind. I wouldn't trade my first few post grad years for anything - I grinded and learned a ton but I'm pumped to know I won't be sitting in a multi million dollar vacation home in 20 years wondering ""what if"" (don't get my wrong if I happen to marry rich I'd love the vacay mansion)!

It's also totally ok if you're someone who does want to make a shit ton of money so you can retire early or travel or do whatever. Some people aren't passionate about any sort of career and that is 100% ok - I absolutely think we should work to live and not live to work (I just happen to be passionate about my job and it's fun).

1j49c5n,Gen Z-ers Are Forced To Redefine Their Own American Dream,"Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, face an economic landscape far more daunting than that of previous generations. This entails skyrocketing housing costs, cumbersome student debt, a tough time finding and keeping a job, relegated to gig type jobs.  These travails contribute to derailing them from the traditional American Dream path. 



In the current economy, it‚Äôs harder for them to secure safe jobs. Many have lost faith in America‚Äôs institutions, and feel somewhat cheated, compared to the older generations who seemed to have had it much easier. 



They witnessed their parents getting laid off in the financial crisis of 2008, with some losing their homes. The Gen-Zs came of age during the COVID crisis. Many young adults had to leave college and move back home for health safety reasons. These and other factors led to the Gen-Zs feeling that their lives will be much different than their parents. This may be the first generation in recent history that may not do better than their parents.



Psychologically, they‚Äôre wired differently too. Growing up with smartphones and social media, they are constantly seeing the struggles of peers. They‚Äôre not necessarily rejecting the American Dream out of laziness. They just can‚Äôt catch a break. 



Living At Home With Little Savings



According to the National Association of Realtors, the median sale price for an existing home in the U.S. hit a record-high of $426,900 in June 2024. The median income for full-time Gen Z workers aged 18-27 hovers around $47,000, making homeownership a distant dream for many. According to a Clever Real Estate survey, 60% of Gen Z adults worry they might never own a home. 



Financial stress is pervasive, with 46% feeling anxious about money most of the time and only 37% feeling secure. As of 2024, the average federal student loan debt was $38,375 per borrower.



The quality of jobs remains a concern. AI, automation, offshoring, and layoffs makes it tough to find a new job. As companies institute cost cutting measures, it‚Äôs also hard to hold onto a job too. The gig economy‚Äôs growth and wage stagnation have made upward mobility scarce, leaving many Gen Zers reliant on precarious part-time work.



Housing affordability remains a significant challenge. Rents consume 30-40% of their income. In 2023, 31.8% of young adults aged 18-34 lived with their parents at the national level. Traditional milestones like marriage and children are also being deferred. Nearly half (49.7%) of renter households in the U.S. were cost-burdened in 2023, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing costs. Additionally, 42.5% of renters paid gross rent exceeding 35% of their income.",Visual_Cartoonist_77,0,0.30000001192092896,3,1741197643,2025-03-05 18:00:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j49c5n/gen_zers_are_forced_to_redefine_their_own/,3,2025

I‚Äôve been at the current agency I work at for 8 years and been in my current supervisor role for 5 years.

Also supervising is a constant challenge- I will be supervising up to 9, currently at 6. I have interviews to fill the last positions so increased work load brining on the new hires and one current one is not preforming well. We are large enough where I have to work with HR to address so it‚Äôs a slow maddening process. 

New job opportunity is in a similar field, requiring the same credential. This one is completely remote 95% (which I love), requires something that is a strength of mine but also will not have the variety or challenge that my current position has. There will be repetitive tasks, which are not my favorite. 

Current agency reports that there are advancement opportunities for me. Also has more flexibility overall. 
Both positions pay the same, potentially the new one may pay a little more.

1j462o3,Real talk: do employers actually care about University of Phoenix degrees?,"TL;DR - most employers care way more about your actual skills and experience than where you got your degree from.

Hey all, I see this question pop up a lot, and since I was stressing about this exact thing a few years ago, thought I'd share my experience. I was pretty nervous when I started job hunting - you know how it goes, you google UoP and suddenly you're convinced you've made a huge mistake. But honestly? It hasn't been an issue at all. In my experience, employers care WAY more about what you can actually do than where you learned to do it. I've worked alongside people from traditional universities, and no one has ever cared about my degree being from Phoenix. I know UoP grads working at major companies, hospitals, and government jobs, so that whole ""no one hires Phoenix grads"" thing is just false. 

quick tips that helped me:

* focus on getting relevant experience - internships, projects, anything
* get certifications if you're in tech/business
* network (yeah yeah, everyone says this, but it works)
* don't be weird about your degree - confidence matters

1j45sij,Uncertain future at work. Advice?,"Throwaway for confidentiality reasons. Location: CA, USA. 

I‚Äôm an account manager and have been in the same role for about 7 years for my client. I built this account from scratch, and we‚Äôve had a solid good 5-6 years, but in the last few months, my team has been reduced by half (due to dismissals and voluntary departures). Recently, these roles have not been backfilled and/or have been outsourced to other competing accounts, even for projects in which we‚Äôre directly involved. 

Our contract is in the process of being renegotiated, and my manager has shared that there‚Äôs disagreement as to wage rate increases, and the need for my position/high compensation has come into question lately. (We have low turnover. Also, in my time here my compensation has grown significantly, and our client has been aggressively cost cutting). All this has made me very anxious and uneasy about my further. I‚Äôve also felt that I‚Äôm being deliberately left out of projects or conversations. I can‚Äôt help but feel a sense of worthlessness and like I‚Äôve failed. 

I can see the writing on the wall, and have been actively seeking other roles. My questions are:

1. given the current geopolitical and economic state of things, should I stick it out as long as I can, or take what I can get now if an offer is presented to me elsewhere? my concern is that if more layoffs take place, newer employees tend to be among the first to be let go. 

2. Would you accept a wage cut and stick it out for a bit until the job market eases off?

3. In the interim, what would you suggest I do to make myself more useful/less expendable?

Additional context: I‚Äôm a super commuter (6+ hrs round trip, daily). As a result, I spend more time on the road than in the office which is not good for optics not productivity. I work as much as I can while train commuting. We have 3 children, and a mortgage.

1j45kwz,"Re-tooling, what options are out there?","Some things are changing for our little family and I'm inquiring today for perspectives on how I should proceed in the months ahead, first a little context (bear with me it is bit lengthy).  
  
I chose my career path later than most, in my early 20s, college right out of high school didn't suit me as I did not know what I wanted so I went straight to work, floating around in several industries to find the right fit. Growing up my father was in construction¬†for 40 years, I saw firsthand the toll trade work can take on ones body (he's now in his mid 70s, arthritis in both hands and torn rotator cuffs from swinging a hammer, no cartilage in his knees from flooring and ruptured discs in his back from roofing) and the lack of employer retirement benefits due to the constant¬†ebb and flow of the business, hiring and firing.¬†  
  
Seeing this I knew that manual labor had very little future, that if you start at 18 and aren't a site super or manager level by your mid to late 20s, you had a high chance of detrimental health problems in your golden years. So I played to my talents for computers and creative design, pursuing computer design and architecture, attending a trade school to save costs and get the drafting/humanities credits done before moving on to a degree. I was in my 2nd year in 2008, when the housing bubble burst. Wanting to stick it out as I had a passion for doing something I was finally good at, I graduated 3 years later top of my class to a market that had no jobs in my area or even within 4 hours drive.¬† Most entry level positions in architecture and design are dubbed ""interns"" and the lack of construction from the housing bubble collapse, no positions were being offered except for ""free"" positions, essentially volunteers with the hopes that if you do a good job, you'll eventually be hired.¬†Being married with a 2 year old and another on the way I needed stability and took a job in retail as that's all I could find.  
  
I'll say this, I have no talent for retail, I'm not pushy or competitive by nature, I can relate¬†easily to people but trying to upsell a product that costs 25% more and has little to no value increase for that 25% was not for me. As I live in a very rural area, the company was an hour commute to the office and required 10 hour days and 5 on Saturdays on a salaried position. However, I'm not one for handouts or assistance, so I handled it, did what I had to do to support my family as my wife did while I was in school.¬†  
  
Eventually once the market began to rebound in 2017, I found a position at a firm I had been eager to work at since school, working in a studio that handled design and document drafting for large retail chains (ironic I know) and was finally beginning¬†to establish a nest egg as my previous salary only covered paying my student loans and a trust fund for my special needs sons care when my wife an I no longer can.  
  
A year and a half later in March of 2018, the tariffs on steel and aluminum were implemented, our primary client, a large retail grocery chain, canceled all of their jobs for the next 2 years. I understood the reasoning, as retail grocers rely on quantity¬†of sales for profits having very slim margins, the increase of construction costs was too much to absorb to keep the bottom line in the black, that's profit & loss. The unfortunate part for me was my department, having a lack of work, had to cut costs as well and my position was eliminated, last in, first out.  
  
So I was back in the job hunt, returning to retail in the interim even though I qualified for unemployment, I had a job the next day. I spent the next 2 years re-tooling my career path, leaving behind the computer design and licensed architect pursuit as I needed 3 more years of internship before qualifying to sit for exams. I eventually landed in an HVAC firm as an install project manager where I have been for the last 4 years, the benefits are good, pay is average and the commute is only half an hour, allowing me to do what I really enjoy which is be a dad, attend school concerts, coach my kids sports teams, serve on the PTO etc.  
  
All through this time, my wife's employment was the anchor that held everything together,¬†she's worked at a Head Start program for the last 10 years as a cook (yes I married the lunch lady) and her schedule allowed me to work the long hours and weekends as her schedule aligned with¬†our children's school schedule. Her salary may not be high, but the situation worked for us. Even though the last 4 years with inflation certainly hit the personal finances and savings ability, I was able to retain some past clients and connections to do some home design and surveying/drafting on the side on my own schedule, and the savings we had on daycare was the main point of her continued employment as our area has few daycare options and they all cost more than her monthly salary. We had the ability for my kids to go to my folks place every now and again, on teacher workshop days and the like, but they are both in their 70s and my mum is handicapped so we tend to avoid using them as a daycare resource as much as possible.  
  
Now that the lengthy context is out of the way (my apologies) we get to the heart of my conundrum and why I am seeking some opinions on how to proceed.  
  
My wife's head start program is shutting down due to the federal¬†funding cuts, and her position will be eliminated at the conclusion¬†of this academic year. We had planned for her to take this summer off and saved for her to be with the kids during that time (she worked summers last year as a custodian cleaning the centers). With her out of work¬†though, we can't afford to keep going without her salary, we can tighten as much as possible but as I said earlier, we have a trust fund established that 20% of our income goes towards to save for our sons future care, this is a need, not a want as I will never put him into a state run home after witnessing many of them during one of my past jobs and I will not put the financial obligation of his care onto my other kids.  
  
My current job is also coming to some hard decisions, a lot of our HVAC components are imported from Canada and Mexico, along with aluminum and steel cost increases, our company is facing substantial increases to operating costs with talk of layoff in the future should the trade war be prolonged, again I understand this, it's part of the landscape. In addition, with the cost of building going up over the past few years, my side hustle's dried up as my clients are now doing the work themselves, jobs are becoming scarce.

Our fiscal projections with my wife out of work, are deep in the red, we can't tighten anymore, don't¬†take vacations or splurge on anything other than a night out once a month as a family (always spend under $200), I brown¬†bag lunch or leftovers and haven't ever bought an $8 latte with my own money. Everything I spend money on is either for supporting our household and my family, we even bring picnic¬†lunches to sport games instead of eating out. I've pulled up my bootstraps to the point the straps are threadbare and broken, literally have same pair of boots I bought 30 years ago (never discount the value of a quality pair of boots).  
  
So I'm currently¬†mulling over our future and looking at options, I've had several recruiters reach out to me over the past 2 years to work for companies outside of my home state, a few in Canada. My home however, is where I want to be, 4 generations of my family have lived on our land, I'm raising my kids in the house I grew up in, all of my family live near us, I have a deep connection to this land and don't want to leave.¬†  
I'm not here to debate policy, nor as a woe is me moment, I deal with what's in front of me regardless of the situation as I always have. What I am looking for is input on what options are out there, should I move and leave behind my families legacy? uproot my kids from their friends and my oldest from the support team he has had for years for a new job? Do I leave them behind and go work someplace that we can have a single income in order for my wife to stay home with the kids? I don't see this as a viable option as I'd be supporting two homes. My wife has been actively looking for work since November as we saw the writing on the wall when it came to head start programs, being in a rural area however, schools are not widespread, we have 5 within a half hour drive, 7 within an hour drive (one is private) and the vast majority of cooks in the kitchens are our age with no plans to leave or retire (she knows all of them as they attend workshops together). Many daycares wouldn't¬†take my special needs child as they are hesitant they can support his needs and those that would we couldn't afford as her salary wouldn't¬†even cover it.  
  
So I'm genuinely asking what options there are for us, what we can do, we just want to do our jobs well and go home to our kids. I realize that in today's world we have to adapt, the era of working a manufacturing job for majority of one's career is long gone in our state, my grandfather worked at the same mill for 45 years, raised 7 kids on one salary and that mill now sits as a burned out shell, its not coming back anytime soon that will allow either my wife or I to work at it. My wife can't be a teacher or even a substitute as her anxiety can be overwhelming and let's face it, teaching is more of a calling and passion than a job. Her skills and education are in cooking, she does it damn well, restaurant schedules aren't compatible with school schedules and the janitor positions at most schools are 3rd shift,¬†she's also not great at driving large vehicles so bus driver isn't a good fit. Starting our own business isn't an option as we have little to no savings for the capital investment and of course, kids schedules.  
  
We've looked at so many options, and none of them are good, hence why I'm posting here in the hopes there might be some ideas out there we haven't thought of.  
  
I post this question in good faith, I understand there's a long context that can seem like ranting, I just wanted to provide a clear picture of the issues surrounding this situation to avoid some of the basic questions that always pop up.  
  
I appreciate those of you that have read this far and look forward to any insight on how best to proceed.",Colddoseoreality,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1741188383,2025-03-05 15:26:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j45kwz/retooling_what_options_are_out_there/,3,2025
1j45h4i,Enterprise R-A-C ‚Äî> Med/Pharm sales *Breaking into new career*,"I‚Äôm looking for advice. 

Background/Situation:

‚Ä¢Currently a registered nurse with around 10 years experience in bedside hospital care. 

‚Ä¢Looking to make more money for my growing family and I believe sales is a career field where I could do that. As a nurse I‚Äôm pretty much at an income ceiling without going for advanced degree like a nurse practitioner, and that isn‚Äôt an interest of mine.

‚Ä¢With no hard sales experience I‚Äôm having trouble breaking directly into pharmaceutical or device sales. I‚Äôm also in a smaller more rural area <10k population but ‚Äònear‚Äô (1.5 hr) drive from a 50k population area with more opportunities.

Plan:

‚Ä¢There is an Enterprise Rent-A-Car near me and is hiring for a Management Trainee position. 

‚Ä¢I‚Äôve heard great things about the quality of training and education provided to develop business and sales skills regarding this position.

‚Ä¢I‚Äôm also aware that companies like to recruit from Enterprise, which is a strategic goal/hope of mine to develop skills and find a way to break in.

Concerns:

‚Ä¢I have a young family and wishing to grow. So time and resources are precious. But I‚Äôm early 30s and consider a sacrifice now to be potentially worth it down the road 5-10 years from now and for the rest of my working years.

‚Ä¢I would be reducing my income to 1/3 of what I currently make, for an uncertain amount of time.

‚Ä¢I would be working more hours, for less money, and altering our current childcare situation (wife and I work opposites and avoid childcare, we‚Äôre both nurses and work 3 days per week) but I‚Äôd be moving into a 5-day a week role. This wouldn‚Äôt be a concern if I could make 150k+ and have my wife SAHM but that may take years.

TL;DR

1j4358p,"Even When You Want Or Need A Job, Why You Should Decline The Interview","The job market isn‚Äôt too hospitable lately. If you are a white-collar professional seeking out a new job, you have to be prepared for intense competition. There is a significant surge in applications for each job opening. This may seem counterintuitive, but despite the challenges, there are times when a job searcher should consider taking a pass on the opportunity to interview. 







Although you might desperately need a new job, sometimes you're better off walking away. While you may be unhappy in your current position, you don‚Äôt want to get into an even worse position. 







A job applicant might decline an interview for a number of reasons. It includes personal priorities, and doing due diligence and research, or engaging in interactions that raise red flags. For instance, the company might have a poor reputation‚Äîthink consistent Glassdoor reviews citing toxic culture, high turnover, or unethical practices‚Äîwhich can scare off candidates who value a healthy work environment. 







Alternatively, the applicant might have received another offer that better aligns with their goals, or the role itself might not match their expectations after further review, perhaps due to salary, location, or career trajectory.







Why You Should Walk or Run Away From An Invitation To Interview







In some cases, inappropriate behavior during initial contact‚Äîlike an unprofessional email from a recruiter or an offhand snide comment that signals bias or disrespect‚Äîcan crush your interest. Timing also plays a role. Life changes, competing commitments might make pursuing the opportunity impractical, and you don‚Äôt want to be pressured to accept the invite. 











It‚Äôs reasonable for a job seeker to decline an interview if a company initially promised remote work but later switched to requiring returning to the office, especially if remote work was non-negotiable. If the job description provided the salary, but when the applicant spoke with the recruiter, and the compensation was significantly lower than what was advertised, it‚Äôs smart to walk away instead of getting into an argument. 







That kind of bait-and-switch can also signal deeper trust issues with the company‚Äôs culture, which is a valid reason to walk away. Similarly, hearing credible reports that the hiring manager is a toxic or unreasonable person. Firsthand accounts from past employees about micromanaging, disrespect, or unfair treatment could justify declining, since a bad boss can make a potential dream job miserable. 







Other reasons to pass on an interview, even in a tough job market, include discovering the role‚Äôs pay is far below market rate or doesn‚Äôt match the candidate‚Äôs needs. Finding out that the company has a history of layoffs, financial instability, or realizing the job‚Äôs scope has shifted into something less aligned with your skills or goals is a big red flag.  







Sometimes you need to trust your gut feelings. ",Visual_Cartoonist_77,0,0.25,1,1741181563,2025-03-05 13:32:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j4358p/even_when_you_want_or_need_a_job_why_you_should/,3,2025

1j427pd,"Mid-20s, Just looking for some career advice regarding two choices I possibly have. Move to New England to start a career where I‚Äôve always wanted to or temporally move to Spain?","
I am an American citizen who grew up in New England. I moved away to another part of the country during middle school. I've always wanted to go back to the area. However, right now, I live aboard in East Asia as a teacher. I do want to go back to America sometime soon.

I should clarify that the Spain job would last a bit less than a year. 

I do have an opportunity to go live in Spain. I've wanted to live in Europe for a long time and this would probably be the best chance that I have. However, the application process is lengthy and is especially complicated when applying from so far away from the USA, but other people have done it. I am wondering if I would rather have a long-term vacation in Europe then live abroad for another year. But, maybe this seems like some ridiculous complaining about a great opportunity. It's just that when I look at the process for getting apostilles and things like that, it just seems long and tedious.

It also seems like there is a good chance for me to move to New England. I guess I've always seen my life being there? I still have many friends and connections there despite being away for more than a decade now. I've felt perpetually homesick since living and after living in other places and having different life experiences, I still really enjoy being back. I see myself having a career, etc. there and I'd be excited to go back and it wouldn't be as tedious as going to Spain. Though I also wouldn't necessarily have a job lined up. I guess I'm ready to start a career and go to grad school.

I guess I just find the process for going to Spain complicated and costs a little bit of money but I know I should probably just do it. At the same time, maybe I just want to have a long vacation after I finish my contract here, and then go back to New England which has always felt like home to me. I would like to start transitioning into urban planning related fields.

1j422j2,Is there a polite way of telling my boss my career goals under certain circumstances?,"Howdy y'all,

A few weeks ago, my boss asked my what my goals were. (I posted about it in this sub to get some advice on this matter see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isd2ct/how_do_i_tell_my_boss_my_goal_is_to_make_as_much/)) After much thought, I determined what I wanted to do: be a controller. I have done aspects of the role in the past, and really enjoyed it. 

Part of the role though, is managing cash flow, and ensuring that we have enough money in the bank for payroll and overhead cost. It is something I really enjoy when we have the money as it's just a matter of reporting and ensuring that money is in the right bank account. When money is tight and I'm telling people that they won't get paid this week is something I can't do though. I have done it in the past, and it tears me up inside. 

Recently we let go 3 managers  and their direct reports have absorbed those individuals jobs as well as maintained their own. To me this shows were a little strapped for cash, as the normal course of action would be just to back fill those 3 positions, but it has been close to 2 months now and there hasn't been any job postings out there. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it is a red flag to me that potentially we are trying to be more efficient with cash flow. It is something I do not want to be a part of if were managing cashflow. So is there a way I can politely and professionally tell my boss ""Hey I'd love to be a controller if cashflow isn't an issue""?

1j40lsj,Stuck in a High-Paying Tech Job I Hate ‚Äì Need Career Advice!,"Hey everyone,  

I really need some guidance, and I figured this is the best place to get honest advice.  

 *My Background:* 
- I‚Äôm 22, from India, and a *Computer Engineering graduate*.  
- I got a *campus placement* in a tech company with a *12 LPA salary* (which is considered great for a fresher).  
- I‚Äôve been working here for *7 months now*.  

*The Problem:*
- I *absolutely hate coding*. Like, every single day, I dread my work.  
- I‚Äôve realized I enjoy *managing, organizing, planning, and leading teams* rather than writing code.  
- I love *interacting with people, making presentations, and taking charge* of projects.  
- But in my current role, it‚Äôs just *coding all day*, and I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating.  

 *The Dilemma:*
- When I tell people I want to switch careers, they say,  
  - *""You‚Äôre just a fresher, every job is boring at first!""*  
  - *""Give it more time, don‚Äôt rush!""*  
  - *""You‚Äôre lucky to have a 12 LPA package, don‚Äôt throw it away!""*  
- I get their point, but deep down, I feel like *this field is just not for me*.  
- The biggest fear? What if I *jump into another field and realize later that I hate that too?* I don‚Äôt want to make another mistake.  

 *Options I‚Äôm Considering:*
I‚Äôve been researching career paths that *align with my strengths (management, planning, leadership, communication)* and found these options:  
1. *HR (Human Resources)*‚Äì Talent acquisition, employee engagement, etc.  
2. *Marketing & Brand Management* ‚Äì Digital marketing, PR, product marketing, etc.  
3. *Operations & Strategy* ‚Äì Project management, business operations, consulting.  
4. *Event Management*‚Äì Corporate events, weddings, brand activations, etc.  
5. *MBA (CAT/MBA CET)*‚Äì To transition into a business/management role.  

What I Need Advice On:
- Am I *rushing my decision*, or is it valid to want a change?  
- Has anyone here successfully *switched from tech to HR, Marketing, or Ops*? How was the experience?  
- Would an *MBA be a good choice*, or are there better ways to transition?  
- Any other career options I should explore based on my skills and interests?  

I would *genuinely appreciate* any insights or personal experiences! I don‚Äôt want to feel lost anymore.

1j3zyhd,"Stuck Between GATE, Placements & Internships ‚Äì Need Advice","I'm currently in my 3rd year, 2nd semester pursuing Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from a tier-3 college. I need some guidance on how to balance multiple priorities:

1. Internship: I'm doing a 6-month LLM R&D internship at a startup, ending in August 2025. After this, I have another 6-month Data Science internship lined up.


2. Placements: My college placements start in July/August 2025, but no companies come for AI/ML roles. I know very little DSA and need to start preparing.


3. Academics: I need 8.5+ SGPA in all semester till end of 4th year to maintain 8+ CGPA overall.


4. GATE 2026: I'm interested in MTech in AI and want to prepare seriously.


If I focus only on GATE, I might miss out on placements. If I don‚Äôt crack GATE, job security becomes a problem.

If I prepare for placements (DSA), I won‚Äôt get enough time for GATE.

My internships are good, but since my college doesn‚Äôt bring AI roles, I‚Äôll have to rely on off-campus jobs if GATE doesn‚Äôt work out.


TL;DR:

Internships: 6-month LLM R&D internship (ends Aug 2025) + another 3-month Data Science internship lined up.

Placements: Start in July/Aug 2025, but no AI/ML roles. I know very little DSA and need to prepare.

Academics: Need 8.5+ SGPA till the end of 4th year to maintain 8+ CGPA.

GATE 2026: Want to pursue MTech in AI and prep seriously.

1j3yua6,My short story,"Hi all!

TLDR: I've quit my job and am looking for a job.

I have over 15 years experience in finance (audit, reporting, reporting). For the last few years I have been working in the family office of one of the richest people in my country, doing everything from hiring cleaners, preparing financial analysis, reviewing financial statements, negotiating loan agreements with banks, to buying companies and real estate. During this time I managed to become financially secure - I bought several properties and built up a diversified portfolio of shares in both growth and dividend companies. Last year I decided to leave FO, mainly because I wanted to spend more time with my family. I have already recharged my batteries and would like to return to the job market, but it turns out that my unusual experience is not an asset. The biggest obstacle I see is the fact that the market requires specialists to know tools/techniques that I don't know because I haven't used them, and a vicious circle begins: they won't hire me because I don't know the tools/techniques they need, I won't learn these tools (in practice, because I can do training, of course) because no one will hire me without knowing them. I am willing to take a few steps back in my career (also financially) just to get back into the market to work (for market money) with the caveat that when I leave the office I want to be able to turn off my phone and computer to spend time with my family. Let me know if you have any advice or perhaps someone is looking for a partner to introduce a product or service to the Central and Eastern European market - I am able to get involved in an area where I see potential.",Interesting-Dark-542,1,1.0,0,1741164811,2025-03-05 08:53:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3yua6/my_short_story/,3,2025
1j3ytrw,How to shift mindset at work when you're burning out?,"I am burning out from work due to covering two managers who left for the last 2 months (I'm at the associate level), plus many more headaches from the corporate politics.

I have tried telling my manager about my workload several times, but was met with superficial ""we can chat about this later"" with no follow-ups. She also contributes to giving me more tasks, despite already knowing my plate is full.

I am looking for a new job but overall my burnout is affecting me at work and outside of work.

At work - I'm no longer motivated to do my tasks, have discussions/meetings, etc. I don't trust management, so everything they say gets a mental eyeroll.

Outside of work - my brain feels so cluttered that I can't even focus on looking for jobs. I am more short tempered with family and friends.

I hate how negative I'm feeling and want advice to how I can shift this mindset... to make work somewhat more enjoyable & to have this not affect my life with family and friends üôè",Pure_Television_5932,4,1.0,5,1741164742,2025-03-05 08:52:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3ytrw/how_to_shift_mindset_at_work_when_youre_burning/,3,2025

1j3yl1s,Fashion industry- help pls,"I've (28F) been working in the fashion industry for the past 2.5 years. I've had public relations experience in entertainment (film specifically) as well as with hospitality (restaurants) for the past 5 years as well as professional entertainment experience since 2017. 
I've worked with a lot of really big celebrity names in my current job like Cara Delevingne, Jennifer Coolidge, Jason Derulo, Erykah Badu, etc etc. 
I was hired as a stylist/ sales consultant however I have since taken on the role of administrator/ manager in my time working my current role. 
I also manage all of our social media accounts. 
I haven't gotten any pay raises for my increase in responsibility outside of a 75¬¢ an hour increase after my first year of work. Also for the record- this sounds super glamorous but I make about $18.50 an hour with no benefits whatsoever- in California. 

I currently do about triple the work of the majority of our other employees (there's five of us for two locations, only one other coworker does similar work to me)- I manage all of our payroll; for both the employees and the designers we carry for two locations, I oversee all commission pay out, all of our inventory records/management, all of our client relations (rental management/ event rentals), oversee all alterations, and I also work as a lead fashion stylist. I also make costumes per the request of the owner. 


I used to work 5 days a week in order to ensure all of the main clerical work would be done and I would have ample time for any scheduled clients or styling sessions. 

My boss decided out of the blue that I would be working 2 days a week now because ""sales have been shit"" even though I see about 2 people a day who don't have money to spend on $2,000 custom clothes. The cheapest thing we carry are $69 sunglasses. I couldn't even buy the sunglasses with my own pay. 
My boss now has his immediate family and his best friend who kisses his ass working most of my shifts- two people who I've had to train an insane amount of times on basics- two people who call me an abundant amount of times on my days off for simple questions because they don't want to learn they want to be told what to do (hence the insane phone calls) 


I've stopped answering their calls/messages on my days off because they didn't even have the guts to tell me I'm being ""punished."" I always show up 20 minutes early to get settled and low and behold- the person supposed to cover my shift the other day showed up 15 minutes late and told me she was supposed to cover the shift. They didn't even tell the scheduling manager- it was the worst management I've ever experienced from people trying to run a business. But when we got ahold of everyone they fessed up that this was a ""punnishment"" for my lack of sales (despite me doing all of our clerical work as well- along with having fires and floods in our area the past few weeks.) 

I don't take any of it personally because I feel as though it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life and they're pulling excuses out of their asses as to why they're taking my days away (for example I showed up for my first shift last week doing $1400 in sales and the four days prior it was $0 in sales from my owners family member during their shifts). 

I feel like my bosses are slowly trying to phase me out/ get me to quit instead of firing me (you get unemployment if you get fired but it's harder if you quit..?)
So in this economy I'm trying to figure out if this is grounds for a case of unlawful termination or what I should do? 
I've been looking for other jobs in the meantime but I haven't found anything yet however I can't keep living off of 300$ a week with my schedule change. 


What should I do? We don't have an HR department because it's an independent company but I can't just take it and not do anything. It's too much of an abrupt shift over mothing/ with no grounds to stand on.

I could always offer to do their designs, then go to one of the local printers myself and do their printing for them (for an extra fee, obviously).

* My goal is to land a **Junior SAP Consultant** role (preferably in SAP MM or WM) by **August 2025**.

# My Plan to Get Into SAP:

‚úÖ **March ‚Äì May 2025:** Learn SAP MM from free resources (OpenSAP, YouTube, Udemy, etc.) and practice in SAP demo systems.  
‚úÖ **April ‚Äì June 2025:** Gain hands-on experience by working on real SAP processes, transactions, and case studies.  
‚úÖ **June ‚Äì July 2025:** Take the official **SAP MM certification** exam.  
‚úÖ **July ‚Äì August 2025:** Apply for **Junior SAP Consultant** positions or SAP-related roles.

# My Questions:

1. **Is this a realistic timeline to land an SAP job with no prior experience?**
2. **Would my computer science degree help me stand out, even if I don‚Äôt like programming?**
3. **Would it be better to stay in my company, gain SAP experience internally, and switch later?**

1j3vdpb,Career change into neuroscience,"Hello,

Hoping people on here can help me finally end this constant loop of uncertainty I'm in!  

Sorry in advance for the long post. Please be gentle with me..

I'm based in Canberra, Australia currently working as a market insights analyst at a comfortable place, earning a decent wage (could be better for my age but moving around constantly hasn't helped).

I studied psych at uni and ended up enamoured with consumer psychology, and did many years of qualitative market research (along with a couple of other project management, and product management stints). Market research was soul destroying. I still cringe.

I've changed jobs every 1-2 years and every time find myself feeling so jaded and dissatisfied. After a lot of thought I realised I'd love to lean into science. I've continued to be fascinated with psychology and the brain, and craveeee to do something more purposeful. 

I would love to study neuroscience (ideally how nutrition and the gut interacts with the brain but it sounds like that requires twice as much study?) to contribute to research or policy. I don't think I want to do individual treatment ‰πÅ‚Å†(‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚Å∞Õ°‚Å†¬†‚Å†ƒπÃØ‚Å†¬†‚Å†‚Å∞Õ°‚Å†¬†‚Å†)‚Å†¬†‚Å†„Ñè


My fear is:
- Could doing a master's in neuroscience get me a job? 
- What jobs DO exist in this area? I'm sure there are roles I have no awareness of (for example a friend of mine mentioned TMS treatment). 
I'd be happy to relocate to Melbourne one day too.

From a quick look on seek and indeed there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of job ads for neuroscientists or researchers.


TLDR; I'm a 34 yo Australian psychology graduate who's been working in market research, project management and analysis for the past 11 unfulfilling years. I want to study neuroscience to change careers into something that truly fascinates me. Seeking thoughts and advice!

Thanks :)

Although I am in my probation there's not much work but I have fairly understood what my work would be once I am old in the system and this is not something that I genuinely want to do in the longer run.

I will get no help from my college placement cell, if i leave they might hold onto my degree, I am actively looking for jobs but not landing in for interviews, it feels like i am doing injustice to myself by just slogging and also to the company i am currently working with....

I need suggestions as to what should I do-

1)Hold onto this until I land up somewhere better

2) Leave this right now and start job hunting full time

3) Should i slog here for one year and then leave!!

  
The travel is something I am hating the most!!! it feels YUCK!!

1j3u1n7,Started new job - can‚Äôt stand boss and travel reqs,"I recently started as an engineer within a company and got a 25k pay raise. It was nice boost since my wife and I recently bought a house and we now have a kid on the way. I am now 2 months in and I can‚Äôt stand my boss. He talks my ear off all day, constantly argumentative with myself and our suppliers, and is rude to people. Basically he‚Äôs an a hole, IMO. To add, my JD said up to 25% travel because it might require traveling to a supplier to support qualifications or issues in our specialization. My boss will escalate every little issue with suppliers and we are on a plane out there or by car. I have now traveled 4 full weeks in the 8 weeks I‚Äôve been here. And 3 of these trips were worthless as we just went to check up, and then he shot the shit with them and I came along for the ride (because I‚Äôm in training or whatever). I was thinking of going to his higher up and saying hey, this is well above the agreed travel for my position, what can we do here? It doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to let up on travel as apparently he does this a lot (didn‚Äôt know this upon onboarding). He also is in his late 60s so he might be impending retirement but I‚Äôm not completely sure. 

If anyone else was in a similar position, any feedback would be greatly appreciated. If it continues this way I‚Äôll probably just start applying elsewhere but at the same time want to make it work but these so far have been deal breakers.

1j3tkgo,MRI Tech V.S. Dental Hygiene?,"Hi! Thinking about pursuing one of these fields. Just want a job that I can just clock in and clock out and don't have to think about much after work. If you currently work in this field can you tell me a little bit about your work routine and work-life balance? What is the most and least stressful part of the job? Any other crucial information will be appreciated. For reference, I am based in Chicago IL

From my understanding of MRI tech:

There are a few prerequisites, then it's two years for rad-tech and two more years to specialize in MRI. As well as some time to complete ARRT certification. Being an MRI is more mathy than dental hygiene, and has a less repetitive routine. You need to be able to lift things and stand for long hours. Longer shifts, work holidays, and less flexibility to choose your hours. I've heard horror stories about bloody body parts.

From my understanding of dental hygienists:

There are a lot more prerequisites, and prerequisites can take 2 years in themselves. After that, there's a long waitlist for dental hygiene programs. If you get accepted, it's a two-year program. Then there's a period of time for clinical hours and certification(?) Being a dental hygienist is more repetitive. You need to be able to stand for long hours, but you do not need to do much lifting. You have more flexibility in your schedule and most hygienists work part-time. I've heard horror stories about gross mouths.

1j3t2qi,What career should I pursue?,"I am a 19 year old female trying to figure out what path to take. I‚Äôm very interested in healthcare. My first job was at mc donalds, I‚Äôve worked as a CNA, Cashier at a gas station, and I recently started as a pharmacy tech in a hospital inpatient pharmacy. I‚Äôve taken a year worth of nursing pre-reqs so the basics like human anatomy 1 & 2, chemistry, developmental psychology, microbiology, sociology, etc. I‚Äôm willing to go to school from 1 to 6 years. I‚Äôd prefer something shorter but I know I could stick it out if it was worth it. I‚Äôve looked into rad tech, sonography, nursing, pharmacist, physical therapist or PTA, and Physicians assistant. I was really interested in nursing but I got discouraged after being bullied by other CNAs at my old job and when going to HR they told me I couldn‚Äôt be a nurse if I couldn‚Äôt handle that. I don‚Äôt want a toxic work environment which I know is place dependent but the nursing field has a really bad reputation for that. I know for a fact I don‚Äôt want to work in audiology. I can‚Äôt stand being forced to repeat myself 3-4 times because my voice is softer. I‚Äôm really just looking for any idea maybe careers I haven‚Äôt considered or knowledge about certain fields.

I don‚Äôt want to have to take work home with me. I‚Äôm hoping for a decent work life balance. I decided to try out pharmacy to learn more about medicine since it‚Äôs very valuable in treatment and many healthcare careers require some sort of pharmacology courses or knowledge.

1j3rple,I feel like I am being setup to fail at my new job,"

Background, I'm fairly new in my career. Graduated college coming up on 3 years now. Have over 2 years work experience. I work in Corporate America at a company, let's say Finance and Real Estate. 

I was interviewing for other places while at my old job as I thought it was time to job hop. This new company is much better for my resume.

The interviewing process went really fast. I interviewed with like 6 people in the span of 3 days. Got the offer like a week later. This had me very excited, feeling like I nailed it. This probably shouldve been a warning sign. 

I arrive at this new job and am told my direct manager is going on Maternity leave very soon. I didn't realize how soon until like 2 weeks before she left. 

I was given basically all her work with about 4 weeks of half assed training as people are constantly busy with other things here. And I'm really struggling with the weight of that. Trying to learn as much as possible while also consistently getting calls from other departments, people who make deals, etc asking me a bunch of stuff I wouldn't and couldn't possibly know. 

They didn't hire me because they were impressed. They hired me because they needed a body ASAP on this team.  I feel like I'm doing certain things really well, I'm on top of my work and get stuff done. But I've been here BARELY over 3 months and the levels of expectations put on me and the absolute lack of help or training is really getting to me and kicking my ass. Not only is it starting to take a toll on me obviously mentally and emotionally, but it's honestly getting to the physical point. Barely eating, trouble sleeping because I'm constantly think about the fucking Microsoft Teams pings I'll be getting the next day asking more questions that I don't know the answers to. I come home constantly exhausted, unable to really do anything or enjoy my hobbies when I'm home. 

There's basically never any down time, just more problems always popping up. Something I really miss about my last job. Only saving grace is 2 days of Work from Home but even those aren't enjoyed very much due to all of the above

1j3rn2h,Neuroscience researcher thinking about master's in computer science,"Hi, I'm having some questions about career changes, and any help is appreciated!

I graduated with a BS in neuroscience last spring and have since been working at a national research institute doing neuro research. I planned to apply to PhD programs in neuroscience during college, but I've changed my mind and no longer think that path is for me for many reasons I won't go into. I love working with data and enjoy solving challenging problems, and after speaking with professionals from different fields, I think I want to explore data science/ML.

I'm thinking of applying to research-based master's in CS programs, since I still love research and could see myself pursuing a PhD in CS to specialize in AI research. However, I don't have a traditional CS background or have taken any CS courses outside of an intro python and an R for statistics course in undergrad. My research is pretty bio-focused, but I have used Python to analyze behavioral data and model impulsivity behavior for a project. I also have a pretty strong statistical background, as it's a main part of my job. I love learning, and I've been working on some datathons/kaggle competitions to gain some experience in ML and also just to have some fun working on cool projects.

I was feeling hopeful about this path but I'm now feeling quite stuck because I'm worried I won't be able to get into any programs or find a job in the field. I'm currently having a touch time finding a data analyst position with my experience, and I feel like it's because my work experiences were all in a traditional academia setting, and I'm worried that my lack of CS background will make it harder for me to get into master's programs, especially ones that are more research-focused than industry/professional programs.

I would love to hear any advice you may have. Do you think this career change is a good idea? Are there recommendations of programs or projects/skills I should develop before applying to grad school? I would also love to hear about your experiences, if you also transitioned into CS from a non-CS background.

Hi all,
I (29m) am currently looking to make a career pivot. For the majority of my career I have worked in a Marketing Operations type role, both client side and with an agency. 

Over the last year or so I have become increasingly dissatisfied with the role and am looking for a transition to either post sales implementation or pre-sales engineering. I hold two bachelors degrees, a BA in Business Management and a BS in Information & Technology Management. I am currently targeting roles with companies I am familiar with, I.e. hubspot, but am having a hard time getting traction. 

I reached out to a career coach and they want to charge nearly $5000 for their services which seems very high. 

Does anyone have any advice for transitioning out of Marketing Ops or into pre/Post Sales Engineering? Has anyone worked with a career coach? If you have, was it worth it? How much did they cost? Would you provide a reference for them?

It's clear that they already have this all mapped out.  I'm asked for my thoughts and I do express concern, but ultimately reluctantly said I will go to the new team if that is where I am needed.  In retrospect I wish I had pushed back harder, but I think they would have transferred me anyway.  In the first 2 months, they moved me around to 3 different managers and it's been completely disorganized and chaotic.  I don't like the work and it's something I would have never selected to do on my own.  They finally did give me a promotion last month with a small salary increase (less than 5%).  But that doesn't change the fact that I am very unhappy.  It's been worse the past month or so because they have dropped a ton of new work on me with very little training happening.  So I guess I am wondering if I should stick it out longer (maybe like a year or so) and then maybe try to transfer to a different department?  As I said earlier, I do really like the company.  Or should I just find something else external and get the hell out of there?  My gut tells me it's only going to get worse.

1j3pilg,Will I be quietly fired after maternity leave?,"So I have always been a top performer in my company: had three pay promotions ( increase in grade pay level) within 5 years, compensation increase every year, multiple stock and cash awards etc. Very good performance reviews every year for the last 7 years.

But last year, i got unlucky and got a new boss. A bad one. I was pregnant all through working under her and she made my life a living nightmare. So much so that I had to take an earlier than planned maternity leave to run away from the stress. It became pretty clear to me that she doesn‚Äôt want me as part of her team. 

Fast forward many months later, I discovered she gave me a pretty bad performance review. My first one in seven years. I am not too surprised as I know she really dislikes me for whatever reason. But still it hurts, especially that I worked my butt off when I was pregnant to deliver great work.

In normal times, I will look for another job as the writing is on the wall. But I am pregnant again and don‚Äôt want to start another job while 4-5 months pregnant. My plan is to go back to work and work for 4 months to be eligible for maternity leave and unemployment EI.

I feel stuck: I want to contest the unfair performance review but afraid of the fall back (will probably suck it up). I am afraid she will continue to make my life hell ish while pregnant. Afraid she will make my life hell ish regardless because I am coming back from  maternity leave pregnant. Afraid to get fired as she can use the negative performance review as an excuse. The thought of going back to work under her make me sick to my stomach but I need the job :(

I‚Äôm trying to get some irons in the fire. I talked to a marketing agency today. They could offer me part time contract work. It could lead to a salary job if there is more work. The salary would be a pay cut from where I am now. I could probably take on other freelance work too.

I'm currently under investigation for about 14 allegations of ""unauthorized"" access, searches etc. small company, about 14 staff members. 

I was a senior team member (2nd highest in company) with full access to all systems within the company, I was never told about restrictions or limitations on me when being granted access to these systems. 

My employer is accusing me of accessing resources, files and employee information (login events only for work from home) without authorization. 

In my investigation meeting yesterday, it was put to me that I should have followed the employee handbook, where all activities need to be authorised by the director. In short I was given ""trust"" and had no authority. 

Is this typical for systems like this? They've got me in a complete box here as the handbook is the be all end all of policies and access rights. The last time I read the handbook was in 2021, I've since had 5 promotions. 

The handbook makes no mention of admin privileges etc. 

Alongside this, I have some quickfire questions:

1. Is ""its a small company"" a valid excuse for not providing training to me or staff members around data protection, compliance or GDPR? 

2. If I chose to resign now (3 month notice period) will this go against me in any potential investigation or disciplinary?

1j3nk1s,Stuck Between PA School & Teaching‚ÄîParalyzed by Indecision,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been stuck in¬†**serious career indecision for years**, and I need some outside perspectives. I‚Äôve gone back and forth between¬†**Physician Assistant (PA) school**¬†and¬†**teaching (high school chemistry or math)**¬†for so long that I‚Äôve completely burned myself out thinking about it. I need to finally decide, but every time I try, I spiral into doubt and second-guessing.

# Background:

* **Education:**¬†Bachelor‚Äôs in Biology
* **Experience in Healthcare:**¬†2 years working in a hospital as a medical scribe
* **Experience in Teaching:**¬†Private tutoring for years + substitute teaching experience
* **Personal Values:**¬†I want a stable career, meaningful work, and work-life balance. I value¬†**autonomy, impact, and a clear purpose**¬†in what I do.
* **Financial Situation:**¬†Both PA and teaching provide stability, so money isn‚Äôt the deciding factor.

# Option 1: PA School (Physician Assistant)

‚úÖ¬†**Pros:**

* Allows me to use my science background in a direct, practical way
* More career flexibility (specialties, locations, work settings)
* Respected profession with good stability
* I already have healthcare experience, so it‚Äôs familiar
* I could help underserved communities and use my bilingual skills (Arabic)

‚ùå¬†**Cons:**

* PA school is¬†**intense, expensive, and demanding**
* High-stress job‚Äî**I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll burn out**¬†in medicine
* I don‚Äôt feel a strong emotional pull toward PA‚Äîjust that it ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù
* I¬†**don‚Äôt love**¬†the idea of seeing patients every day for the rest of my life
* I keep hesitating, which makes me wonder if I really want it

# Option 2: High School Teaching (Chemistry/Math)

‚úÖ¬†**Pros:**

* I‚Äôm naturally¬†**good at teaching**, and students say I‚Äôd be a great teacher
* I enjoy¬†**helping students gain confidence**¬†and breaking down complex concepts
* More structured schedule, summers off, better work-life balance
* I like¬†**organizing lessons and being creative**¬†in how I teach
* More opportunities to¬†**mentor, lead, and build relationships over time**

‚ùå¬†**Cons:**

* **The classroom setting is overwhelming**¬†at times
* Not sure I‚Äôd enjoy teaching for¬†**decades**‚ÄîI fear it could get repetitive
* Dealing with¬†**difficult students, school politics, admin stress**
* Less flexibility in career growth compared to PA
* **It feels like the ""easier"" option, but I‚Äôm not sure if that means it‚Äôs right**

# The Problem: Indifference & Fear

* **I don‚Äôt feel strongly drawn to either option.**¬†I don‚Äôt wake up thinking, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to do this.‚Äù
* **I feel indifferent about PA, but also scared of committing to it and hating it.**
* **Teaching feels more manageable, but I fear I‚Äôd be settling**¬†like teachers who are unhappy.
* **I have anxiety no matter which I choose.**¬†If I pick PA, I‚Äôll stress over burnout. If I pick teaching, I‚Äôll stress over feeling stuck.
* I keep¬†**waiting for a ""sign"" that one is right**, but I‚Äôm running out of time to decide.",Calm_Safe6553,1,1.0,0,1741127369,2025-03-04 22:29:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3nk1s/stuck_between_pa_school_teachingparalyzed_by/,3,2025

From what I understand, employers can use this, saying that an employee didn't do their job if they didn't finish the project on time or task in working hours and apply financial measures to their salary...which is absolutely crazy.

Some of my more experienced colleagues start work at 8-8:30 AM and stay till 7 PM or even more almost every day, they don't have a normal schedule. And to the point of all, overtime work is not paid at all.

I'm not doing this yet as I just started a few months ago, but the head of the department has already suggested to me that I should do the same thing in the future so that I don't have to stretch out on a project for a super long period because I have to be fast.



I honestly don't care about days off as compensation and other such magic, for me a job is a job and that's it, I don't care what crap and sermons they have to say about it, as long as it's in the contract, that's all I care about, if you see that employees can't handle the workload and you want to finish projects on time, hire more people and treat them right.



Changing jobs is a pain with the whole search and recruitment process, and this practice of working overtime seems to be widespread everywhere...

1j3ltgu,When to endure at a job vs. quitting on conscience?,"I may soon be facing a situation where I will be working directly for someone with whom I have deep, fundamental disagreements about issues that deeply matter to me as matters of conscience. Worse, as an executive comms professional, it'll be my job to make this person's deeply flawed arguments on those very issues as polished and persuasive as possible. I feel like I can't do my job in good conscience if this new person becomes the head of my company.

My job is stable, pays well ($140k) for what I do, has incredible benefits, and I'm very good at it. I'm seen as the brains and knowledge bank at my company. I'm the fastest writer who writes the cleanest copy with the least amount of research/input needed. They find me very valuable, and my job security is rock solid. I'm certain I could stay here another 17-25 years and retire comfortably with $2-3 million, despite being sightly behind on retirement at my current age (42).

I'm also a single mom, and have a 6-year old daughter to support. But I'm currently saving about 30% of my income without any hardship, living comfortably but frugally on a take-home pay of only $84k in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.

If this person is hired, part of me wants to listen to my conscience, quit, and take some time off. I haven't taken more than 2 weeks off in more than a decade. Between unused PTO payout and my emergency fund,  I could survive up to one year of unemployment without touching retirement funds, and I could spend the time figuring out what I want the second half of my career to look like. I'd also get really deep, immersive time with my kid while she's in 1st-2nd grade. But it would also probably set my retirement plans back by about 5+ years, and any similar job I will find will almost certainly work me harder for less pay.

The alternative is to find a way to do my current sweetheart deal of job as well as I can, while keeping my conscience intact. This executive is not doing anything illegal, criminal, etc, but our differences on policy and where to take the organization are irreconcilable, and I believe that their views will directly harm large numbers of people for at least two generations.

What should I do? Find a way to work with integrity despite deep disagreements, and keep my good thing going?

I‚Äôve always been excited by the idea of working with/for early stage start-ups and making an impact. Not necessarily to stay but to move on to next as I feel my need for being present reduces with functionality and protocols defined.

Please share your thoughts and ideas that might ring a bell in my mind.

PS: I am still on a skilled worker visa and would continue to need one for couple years, if that makes any difference.

1j3la3f,Am I about to be let go or it‚Äôs in my head?,"Hi,  

I was hired by a semi-public sector company three years ago, in a role that was a promotion over my previous position in a public sector organization. The two main reasons I decided to leave my previous job were the opportunity to work from home and the promotion. In this new role, I replaced an employee who had been let go a few months before I joined. After I was hired, I learned that the team had actually decided to hire two people to replace that former employee, effectively splitting his responsibilities between us.

These two people are myself (in an indeterminate role) and a term employee. When I was hired, I was told that I would be working on the organization‚Äôs migration to a new ERP system, while also taking over some of the tasks of the previous employee. However, over the past two years, the situation has been quite different. 

My manager ended up taking on the lead role for the ERP migration, and I‚Äôve been effectively filling his ‚Äúreal‚Äù role within the organization. My involvement in the ERP project has been minimal, and I‚Äôve mainly been replacing my manager‚Äôs responsibilities. Over time, my exposure has been limited, and my role has remained relatively small within the organization. 

Since this isn't a fully public sector job, I‚Äôm aware that I could be let go at any time. I‚Äôve grown concerned that my position may be at risk once the new ERP system is in place and my manager resumes his role. Here's why I think this:

- I‚Äôm not assigned many new projects, and as I mentioned, my tasks are things my manager could easily take over.


- There‚Äôs been increased discussion about converting the other resource (the term employee) from term to indeterminate. She was also assigned one of the new projects that provides exposure at a senior level, which is a multi-year initiative.


- Last year, there were financial pressures and a plan to cut 30% of the workforce, which was only avoided thanks to last-minute additional funding. When I discussed this with my manager, he mentioned how ""it would've been hard to make decisions between so and so.""


- The new CEO, who joined about a year ago, questioned the necessity of replacing the fired employee with two people, including me.

Given all this, I now have the opportunity to pursue a similar role in the public sector again. However, this role would require me to be in the office four days a week. While I suspect my current role may eventually require at least two days a week in the office, a four-day in-office schedule would be challenging for me. At this point, I‚Äôm weighing the options: either stay in a remote job with uncertain stability, or take a role that requires more in-office time but potentially offers more long-term security.

I‚Äôm looking for advice since this is my first time facing such a situation. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking things or if my concerns are valid. I just have this gut feeling that once the ERP is completed, my position may no longer be needed, and that, in the event of another economic downturn (or even sooner), I could be let go. Any insights would be really helpful.

1j3jy7c,Job Negotiation Advice,"I need some advice on how to handle a negotiation for a job offer I just received. Some background context...my previous role was at a director level making 189k a year with a sizable bonus target (17%), along with unlimited PTO.

The offer I received, however was 170k, a lower bonus target than my last job, and 19 days PTO. The one plus is they contribute 5% of salary to 401k (in addition to a separate match).

Is it reasonable to request a base salary of 190k, and PTO of 25 days?

1j3jl7k,Pre employment drug screening ‚Äúdelays‚Äù???,"I completed a 3 part interview process that was drawn out over 2 weeks. I provided 7 references that completed surveys on me and all references must‚Äôve made a great impression because the next call I had was the offer. After a brief back & forth I agreed to a revised offer, signed all onboarding documents, had a tentative start date of Monday 3/10 and was emailed info to get urine test at my local LabCorp.
Side note: I just had a 3 level cervical discectomy and fusion. This employer is aware and I had my Zoom calls with them while in a cervical collar. 
Upon completion of the urine test, I advised the lab tech that I recently had surgery and offered documentation of all authorized scripts from my providers with the name and # of my pharmacy. Also being New Jersey resident(and company is in NJ) I provided documentation that I‚Äôm medically authorized cannabis patient with my doctors contact info as well.  The tech kindly refused to take the documents and told me to just forward it to my HR contact at the company.
This was last Wednesday 2/26. On Thursday morning 2/27 the HR rep received my documents and thanked me, advising they‚Äôll be in touch after screening is completed.

There has been instances where she throws me under the bus for things I didn‚Äôt do and I have to advocate to my director about serious issues. 

She uses our one on ones to talk about heavy things she‚Äôs dealing with in her personal life and it makes me a little uncomfortable when she starts breaking down and crying to me. She‚Äôll also call me outside of working hours to randomly to talk about non work related things and her personal life. 

I‚Äôm supposed to be learning a program she is fluent in and has been throwing me off to other people for training that aren‚Äôt helping me. No matter how much outreach I do to start training no one will get on the phone with me or offer assistance. We are supposed to be a collaborative group. 

No matter how many times I tell her I am struggling to learn on my own she keeps telling me to reach out and ask for help when she can easily teach me. I‚Äôve talked to my director in the past about my struggles with her and she has told me to keep trying as well. This was a couple months ago. She is remote in another state while I am in person in the office everyday. 

Should I go to my director again and ask for a team switch to another supportive manager in my office? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll get shot down again and look weak.

1j3j3g5,About To Be A Sales Manager,"Hello, I am just wanting to open up a little discourse around good and bad manager‚Äôs/management styles that you have encountered or that you practice. I am 24 years old, and have been working in the life insurance/annuity space for coming up on 3 years. Since getting sober a year ago my business has really flourished, and I have been in a leadership position since April of last year just within my agency. This includes training in the form of ride alongs, morning classes focused on both product and tactics (for lack of better word). Starting 04/01 of this year, I will begin as the Managing Director at a different office that has about 14 agents. Of those 14 - half are in their 60‚Äôs and beyond and won‚Äôt be looking to me for any influence at all, as they are veterans and only come in once a week to file paperwork or get away from their spouse. One agent is the company star, who writes about $20M annually in annuity sales, and the other 4 are newbies who I will be directly tasked with developing. My track record is pretty damn great at my current position, but my current agency has myself, another like me, and then the MD who really doesn‚Äôt do much because he has myself and my counterpart. My new position I won‚Äôt really have anybody to lean on, so I will be leading every class, and will be training likely 4/5 work days per week. My question is -  are there any documentaries, books, movie scenes, quotes, or just general stories y‚Äôall would be willing to share that could be helpful/impactful for a young sales manager? I will still be focused on my own production, but my incentive aside from profit sharing on the bottom line is a bonus of ~50% of the income that agents make in their first year. It doesn‚Äôt come out of their pay, but just an additional bonus. Example: Steve makes 60k his first year, I get 30k as a bonus. 

I am really not very anxious about the new gig, but just want to hear from some who are more experienced. I think I will be able to interview and recruit younger people pretty easily, but I am worried I‚Äôll just be too young in the eyes of new recruits over the age of say 35, who just don‚Äôt wanna have to listen to someone who they perceive is just a kid every morning. I am already really focused on seeing them as people apart of my team, as opposed to just my bonusable subjects, but just wanted to post this as I am open to anything advice or pointers from some who have maybe been in a similar position or have knowledge of someone in a similar position. Stories of success and failure I‚Äôm sure are both helpful so please don‚Äôt hold back.

1j3iq98,"SVP is asking for a 5 star review 2 weeks after starting, it's making me uncomfortable.","I just started working for a small amenity experience company whose clients are commercial real estate properties. I am not entering my 3rd week after about 1 week of onboarding. When I say small, I mean around 70 employees. Even though it's only been a few weeks, I'm starting to see a lot of red flags pop up. 



Leadership is inexperienced, many of them are ex-fitness instructors who now hold director, VP, and SVP titles with no other experience other than internal to this company. It doesn't¬†appear like any of them have led real teams in any other company.¬†My previous experience includes experience and culture management for two other companies, one being a series E global startup with 2,000+ employees, and another more established billion dollar company. It seems crazy to me that I have more corporate experience than these leaders in my new company. The majority of new hires seem to come from the hospitality industry, mainly restaurant and hotel workers who seem really thankful and lucky as this is a foot in the door in a more corporate role. 



Now, a few days after starting this new role the SVP of People reached out to the new hire cohort on slack, 4 people based in 4 different major cities, asking us to help the company reach their goal of having a certain amount of positive glassdoor reviews and to leave a review by tomorrow.¬†I thanked this SVP for their message and proceeded to not leave a review thinking it would be dropped. 



Now, the SVP called me out in the same slack group with the rest of the new hires asking me to leave a review by the end of the day as it ""should only take 5 minutes"". The thing is, I feel incredibly uncomfortable doing this. This is a position I've been in for essentially two weeks before this was asked of us, I think it would be disingenuous¬†to leave a review when I don't yet have an accurate view of what it truly is like to work for this company, effectively burying actual negative reviews from former employees who shared their true experiences. From the looks of the previous reviews it looks like this employer has a history of being not so great to past employees.



It also seems incredibly unprofessional to have a ""leader"" in this company effectively back new hires into posting misleading 5 star reviews, and then doubling down on an employee who has not yet posted. I have never had an employer directly ask employees for favorable reviews. I also feel like I don't want to rock the boat in this new position. Any advice would be great, it feels like I'm being put in an uncomfortable situation.¬†",232753,1,1.0,3,1741115346,2025-03-04 19:09:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3iq98/svp_is_asking_for_a_5_star_review_2_weeks_after/,3,2025

Hey all!

I‚Äôm writing this after finishing sobbing on my couch oops lmao. I(27M) recently graduated college late. I suffered from really bad mental health and epilepsy through college that caused me to fall behind and take long stints off(through covid mostly) I was also never the smartest cookie.

I had two internships in college that I actually liked. I also just accepted an entry level IT Technician role last week and today was my first day.

The thing is, for the last couple weeks even before this job I‚Äôve really been being introspective on if I really like IT or if I just did it to prove to myself I was not stupid and could get a degree. I unfortunately believe it was the latter. The more I do the work the more I hate sitting at a desk, the more I hate the constant up-skilling and continual learning. I know it‚Äôs only been a few different jobs and LITERALLY one day, but I‚Äôm basically worrying myself into panics attacks every night on if this career is even for me. 

I know most careers require learning, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to learn I just don‚Äôt want to feel the pang of guilt if I‚Äôm not putting in the extra effort AFTER work. Are there jobs I can go in and get my work done, come home and turn my brain off? Because I feel like if I try that in IT I will be stuck and never progress.

My current plan is stick this job out and see how it goes over the next few months and see if I develop a love or find a niche that I enjoy in it.

I‚Äôve looked into some electron unions apprenticeships near me since maybe some of my learned skills could help, but I‚Äôm just so lost.

1j3gl91,How bad of an idea is it to tell a new boss something personal?,"I literally just started a new job Friday last week. For context, I have vaguely known my new boss for two years from networking happy hours at my old office. She‚Äôs also close personal friends with some of my former supervisors/colleagues, so it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs a stranger. 

My boss is already making plans for me to attend a conference across the country soon. She‚Äôs really excited about + encouraging me to meet up with her brother while I‚Äôm there for several reasons. He‚Äôs a local and would be able to give me recommendations (I‚Äôm traveling alone), plus it‚Äôd be a good networking/mentoring opportunity since he works in the same field and has a similar background to mine. 

The issue is I know my husband wouldn‚Äôt be okay with this. I‚Äôm not looking for advice on that end of things. I just don‚Äôt know how to politely decline meeting with her brother while still going on the trip. It would look so bad if I say yes now just to appease her and then later flake on her brother. I‚Äôm open to being honest with her about the reason why I can‚Äôt see him but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to to get so personal so quickly.

1j3fthl,Leaving a family run business (Dad's the owner) to create my own business and name for myself,"I'm a 24 year old Female, turning 25 this year. I've been working for my father going on two years now. Prior to working for him I was a general manager at a well known Auto Body Repair Facility. I've worked my way up in the Automotive industry since 2020. Managed a coffee chain in 2018-2019, started working when I was 14.  When I started working for him it was VERY toxic because my older sister (39) could not deal with me giving her direction (I have more experience in this field) she tried to basically get me fired on numerous occasions. She would gaslight our dad and despite us having cameras and me giving him proof time and time again he never corrected her, or resolved the situation. I was going to quit but she ended up quitting before me so I stuck around. 

My dad and I have always had somewhat of a strained relationship. My mother and him divorced when I was around 4 and I've only had somewhat of a relationship with him since 2019. (More than 10 years no contact after they divorced) He's not a great father to put it bluntly. He is narcissistic and blames everyone but himself for the majority of his problems. He can be very disrespectful at times and instead of communicating and trying to resolve issues with his kids (I am 1 of 4) he tries to give us money or shower us with material items. - This has never worked on me. 

Point is, I've been ""managing"" his shops for a little over a year and it's an absolute nightmare. Anywhere I've ever worked or managed the higher ups NEVER get involved with a managers employees because it breaches chain of command. Anyone that's ever worked in this industry knows chain of command and communication is everything and it will mess up production if it is broken.  Nonetheless he continually gets involved or if I give an employee a task he will override it. This has affected everything to where my employees no longer see me as their boss but a facilitator or equal. I feel like I'm back at square one. Another issue is he has a serious woman problem. I KNOW ITS NOT MY BUSINESS! But I find it so disrespectful to have three, four, five women coming in the office every other day to ""see"" him. It's a bad look and especially a bad example for my little sister (she's 8) There have been times where these women would come in the office disgruntled threating me to tell them where his is!! I feel like no respectable man especially ""FATHER"" would behave this way. 

Anyways I've talked to him about all these issues and spoke my concerns and he said he will change but it only gets worse or he stays the same. Needless to stay I'm struggling with the idea of sticking around with the ""hope"" that I may someday own the company or leaving to start my own business. These are my prime years and I feel like if I stay here I'll kill my potential. I've lost all my motivation to stay here and I talked to him about this and he keeps saying he's going to get a lawyer to do the paperwork but it never happens. I've put my own money into this company dedicated hours on hours to where I have no time for myself or my fianc√©, just to come to work and be belittled, disrespected and ignored. What would you do? PS thank you for reading my rant if you've made it this far.

1j3fggq,"How to escape a job that has me in 'golden handcuffs' i.e. decent pay for my age and good hours, but boring and unfulfilling?","I work a cushty 9-5 from home 3 days a week, barely any actual work and on ¬£50k but feeling very unfulfilled, somewhat depressed and starting to think I'm being left behind. What can I do to escape this cycle and find a new career?

For some context, I work in a niche university admin role that I've carved out for myself, I'm 27 and have been working in this role for 5 and a half years.

It worked well for some time, it gave me job security during covid, and has allowed me to pursue a lot of external interests in that time, I'm on ¬£50k and work from home 3 days a week. I'd say I probably do a solid 8-10 hours work a week, so it's very easy and I realise how lucky I have been to have such an easy ride.

The issue I have, and I feel very spoilt saying this, is that I feel bored, unfulfilled and like I'm wasting my life away. I want to be a motivated person who strives for better but I feel like this job is a bit like being stuck in a pair of golden handcuffs. I'm not sure where else my skills would be relevant, but at the same time I don't want to take a huge pay cut and retrain. My salary is ok for my age I feel, but now my peers are starting to overtake me, and have a clear career plan while I'm stuck doing the same job I've been doing since graduating almost.

I hate the fact that my job forces me to be lazy, there's just not enough work for me to fill more than an hour or two a day at most, part of this is my fault, I've created processes that help me acheive tasks much quicker than before, but also, we are just overstaffed.

I've spoken to recruiters about what roles my skills would fit and they've been hugely unhelpful, either telling me to get on grad schemes (even though I'm not even eligible for most) or telling me to stick in the university sector, which I don't really want to do, I want a higher paced job with a clear career path (and better pay tbh).

Am I being spoilt here? Or is it normal for me to feel a bit dejected and unfulfilled with my career and life at the moment? Would love any advice and suggestions for my next steps, and help finding a new career, I wouldn't mind a slight pay cut but I don't want to start from nothing and throw away all these years of work",sweatie12,4,0.75,10,1741107474,2025-03-04 16:57:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3fggq/how_to_escape_a_job_that_has_me_in_golden/,3,2025

1j3dr6b,Accept or wait?,"Hi. Since Reddit helps me in so many other areas, figured I could give it a shot for career advice.

If you were to come to this situation:

Job 1: Not something you want long term. Weekend and holidays shifts are required. Pay is not amazing. Library services, so not a lot of room for growth, especially financially. Gets you into the government, so all benefits are applicable. Good entry level position getting into the government, I guess. My resume went fast through all stages and they already contacted me, nothing certain but even without a degree I have way more experience than they required (2 years requirement vs 10+).

vs

Job 2: Something you have lots of experience on but no degree. (Still qualified for minimum requirements, though). Not exactly long term career either, but open to it. Administration services, so pay and growth are possible. Also within the government, however, not entry level so you don‚Äôt know your chances. (I have no degree, but have 10+ years of admin experience). Position closes in 2 days, then they will start reviewing applications.

Since they are in totally different stages (and Job 2 has a longer process due to the position itself), chances are that I could possibly see an offer from Job 1 before I even advance through Job 2‚Äôs process.

I want the security of a government job, want to grow within it and make a career out of it. But without a degree my chances are not that great. 

What would you do?

      I'm a welder in a fab shop that has about 30 shop workers spread between two locations. I've been here for 10 years and have climbed my way to being the lead welder at our shop. I'm the only one in the shop who can do multiple weld processes, fit, roll, saw, pretty much everything (but my full time role is welding). I've demanded raises on two different occasions and have received them both times (""we really value what you bring to the company and our main goal is too keep you happy and keep you employed with us"") but I'm still not content. I am receiving $31.50 per hour with 100% free healthcare (the free healthcare is whats holding me back from exploring other options). My problem is that I will weld something in not exaggerating double the speed sometimes triple the speed of other workers. I will fit and weld something that takes the next best shop worker 8 hours and I'll do it in 5.. the other main welder of the shop will take 15 hours on something and I will complete the same exact item in 6 and done at a higher quality as well. Part of me tries to tell myself (""keep doing what you're doing, don't worry about others or how much they're making"") but the more practical side of me knows they're only making a dollar or two less than me per hour or maybe even the same wage. Very frustrating considering how much more money I'm consistently making the company, how much faster I'm working for barely anything more than the next guy.

Hi there,

I am a software dev in India. I graduated in 2024 and was placed at my current company through campus placements. However, as a fresher, this job turned out to be horrible. There is no guidance, no system, nothing just an environment of constant stress and fear. For instance, I had no training and was given my first task in Linq right away. After that I was asked to migrate a website from [asp.net](http://asp.net) webforms to .net core w/o any knowledge in .Net / c#.

In addition to this I have to deal with constant taunts and strict (unnecessary) rules like 10min only for a washroom break. Till now there has been no code review, no architecture of my migration project and the seniors don't even listen in meetings.

That all said I am looking for a new opportunity and am met with the question ""Why leave so early?"" by almost all recruiters. My friends and colleagues advised not to mention the toxic work culture. What reason should I give?

I only really know SPSS and R, and it's been years since I've used Python- I'm also just not huge on CS in general. I love my major, but I realized far too late that it's very interdisciplinary which isn't helpful when looking for jobs that want specific majors/skills. I've taken a couple of Speech Pathology classes as a part of my major and really enjoyed them, so I was also thinking of shifting gears and getting a masters to become a certified SLP. On the other hand I could pursue a masters in data science, but I'm not sure how difficult that will be with my limited coding experience.

I have designed and implemented the avionics software making all the needed technical decisions and I currently lead a team of 7 people in the developement of the avionics.
How should I include this experience in my CV?

I am a university student (CS) and a member of my university‚Äôs rocketry association.
I have been (and still am) responsible for designing and implementing the rocket‚Äôs flight computer‚Äîan important role within the association that led to my selection as Team Leader for the Software Department.
I have handled almost all technical decisions, including technology selection, software architecture design, implementation, flight algorithm development, and more.

The association is a non-profit organization structured as a startup simulation, meaning it operates similarly to a small company.

So, here‚Äôs my question: How should I include this experience in my CV?
What job title should I use?
Should I list it under work experience, specifying that it‚Äôs a student association, or create a dedicated section?

1j3aey8,What career might be worth it for me?,"I have things I enjoy and have interest in: Crime, Psychology, investigations, AI ethics, Skincare, Overall finding ways to help people or bring light to things. 

I suppose I‚Äôm willing to go to school for a long period of time as debt wouldn‚Äôt be much of a worry because of my GI bill.

Doesn‚Äôt mean i  necessarily want to though. I have other goals raising a family traveling the world and I feel like with certain majors and careers any type of distraction could be a huge liability. Sure i could do those things after but is it bad that i wanna do it while im a little younger and enjoy my youth? I dont want to feel like i wasted it.

With today economy and inflation it seems like some jobs just may not be worth it. I would want a high paying job. Honestly more than 100k because im realizing for some thats not even enough anymore.

And im willing to put in the work and time but only if it something i enjoy.

i thought about being a pysch np sounds greats sound like i could handle it 100 percent, but ive also seen how saturated it has become and how many people get in just for the money itself.. im sure its very competitive can i even make it and if i do will i really be making as good money by the time my army service is up? How hard is it to find a well paying job within it?

Being a investigator sounds amazing the passion i would have for that is insane. I want to help people, solve cases, understand things. but they dont seem like they get payed that well. Money is a key factor for me whether i have a passion for it or not. Plus i know that work life balance would be sickening. I don‚Äôt think i would necessarily mind due to the passion, but i want to think about my other goals and passions as well that need some sort of work life balance 

Ive thought about the FBI but competitiveness makes me question. 

Dermatology sounds great although a lot of schooling i feeling like i would enjoy everything i would be learning, but again its insanely competitive. One of the most competitive in the game for good reason. Work life balance is amazing money is amazing. Life must be amazingüò≠. 

As you can see competitiveness scares me. I dont want to do all this schooling to just struggle where i really want to be. So many people with degrees don‚Äôt even get there job of choice. Job searching in the market has been horrible lately and many jobs are more saturated than ever before. i want a good work life balance and also great money for the ability to travel and when i do decide to have a kid to have them grow up extremely comfortably, as they deserve. I want something i can look forward to everyday.

Given my interests and what i look would you guys have any suggestions. Sorry for this being kinda long.

1j3a0ta,Career Advice For Federal Public Workers Pivoting To The Private Sector,"Career Advice For Federal Public Workers Pivoting To The Private Sector  

u/Forbes

  



You can start your new career by updating your resume and LinkedIn profile. Be patient, it will take some time to get a feel for how things run in the private sector. The lingo and tempo will be different.



Networking is critical. It‚Äôs not the time to be shy. Reach out to people who can help you. Connect with private sector professionals via LinkedIn, industry events, and  alumni networks. Engage recruiters who specialize in government-to-private transitions. Also, the recruiters that  you chose should have a strong focus on the types of jobs you want next. 



They‚Äôll be able to walk you through the interviews and help coach you throughout the process. You may want to enlist the aid of a Career coach to advise you throughout the transition.



Ask people for informational interviews. Seek out former colleagues who have already made the leap to the private side. They can provide valuable insights into the cultural differences.  



While somewhat scary, starting a new career can be exhilarating. You may end up saying ‚ÄòI should have done this years ago‚Äô.



The pivot from the public to private sector will be a big change. Matters such as  compensation, working hours, expectations, and benefits may be very different from what you were used to getting. 



While salaries in the private sector can be higher, especially for senior roles, the total compensation picture varies much more than being in the government.



Federal employees frequently enjoy more generous benefits, including robust retirement plans like the Thrift Savings Plan, comprehensive health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, and structured vacation time.



In contrast, private sector benefits can be inconsistent.  Some companies offer competitive packages, while others provide less. Work hours also differ. Public sector roles often involve fewer hours and more predictable schedules compared to the private sector‚Äôs longer, less predictable demands.



The uncertainty surrounding layoffs and transitions can take a psychological toll on federal workers. Recent reports of mass layoffs have sparked fear, anxiety, anger, and even panic attacks among employees, with some feeling a deep sense of betrayal.



Older workers may feel some subtle ageism discrimination. They may face some  depressive symptoms as reemployment prospects diminish. Many public servants tie their identity to their roles, a job loss can lead to a profound sense of disconnection and diminished self-worth.



You may feel financial stress, strained relationships, and a lingering stigma around layoffs. Even those who retain their jobs may deal with survivor‚Äôs guilt or anxiety over future job cuts. If you feel overwhelmed, anxious and stressed out, don‚Äôt be afraid to seek out the services of a therapist.

1j39qfl,A Colleague from Another Department Escalated Issues to My Manager...How Do I Approach This?,"Hey all, I need some advice on a situation at work.

I‚Äôve been working on a project with multiple stakeholders, and communication has been tough due to misalignment and lack of accountability. I occasionally reached out to a colleague (Colleague A) from another department for advice although they are not involved in the project at all. They gave me useful input, but I ended up solving the issues on my own.

The issue is that Colleague A, who doesn‚Äôt report to the same boss and had never met my manager before this, even escalated concerns about my ability to manage stakeholders to my manager, suggesting I need more support. While I understand their intentions, I‚Äôm upset they didn‚Äôt come to me first. I‚Äôm worried my manager might feel blindsided, since I hadn‚Äôt raised these concerns myself.

For context, I have regular meetings with my manager, but they‚Äôre often busy, and I try to come prepared with solutions to save time. I also tend to look stressed during calls with stakeholders, and Colleague A, being more experienced, would often ask what‚Äôs wrong and offer advice.

Should I address Colleague A directly, or speak with my manager to explain things from my perspective first?

1j3969k,Seeking career guidance after struggling with CA- unsure which corporate path to take,"Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm 23 years old and graduated in 2023 with a B.Com degree. During my graduation, I cleared the CA Foundation exam and then appeared for the CA Intermediate exams while pursuing my B.Com. Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt able to clear the CA Intermediate exams despite giving it my best shot, even after attempting it 3 times after graduation.

At this point, I‚Äôve made the decision to step away from the CA path and focus on launching my corporate career, but I‚Äôm feeling quite stuck when it comes to figuring out what field would be the best fit for me.

Here‚Äôs a bit more about my situation:

Education: B.Com graduate with CA Foundation cleared (but unable to clear CA Intermediate)
Skills/Experience: Strong understanding of accounting, taxation, and finance (due to my CA preparation), good analytical skills, and experience with financial modeling and problem-solving through my coaching and study.
Challenges: I‚Äôm struggling to figure out what direction to take next. I‚Äôve considered roles in finance, accounting, and consulting, but I‚Äôm unsure which path would make the most sense given my background. I don‚Äôt want to waste time making another wrong move.
What I‚Äôm looking for:

What are some corporate career paths that someone with my background (strong finance/accounting foundation, analytical skills) could pursue?
Is there any advice on how to transition from CA to a corporate role smoothly?
Any insights into fields where the transition would be relatively easy and rewarding based on my current skill set?",Calm_Refrigerator624,1,1.0,0,1741089595,2025-03-04 11:59:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j3969k/seeking_career_guidance_after_struggling_with_ca/,3,2025

While most would see this as a win, I just can‚Äôt seem to get excited for it. It‚Äôs a fully remote role in digital marketing making 65k annually. During the time I was laid off I had to create my own luck because no one would hire me. I began freelancing and secured 2 clients, one of which I am in a contract with now. I was able to start my own side business doing digital marketing and trying to find clients, I started an Amazon influencer program so that I can make additional income. All these are great side hustles but don‚Äôt particularly pay a ton of money yet to cover all my expenses.

Wifey was holding it down for me for that time I was laid off, covering the food, our place and some. I love and appreciate her for that because without her I‚Äôd likely be at my parents place which would suck. But idk, it‚Äôs just something that is inside me that is pulling me in the opposite direction. I just feel like corporate America isn‚Äôt for me.

I think my new boss has a crush on me. He is currently working out his notice for the rest of the month. He makes flirty comments. This isn't anything new, I work hard on my appearance and men finding me attractive is the norm. 

The other night, we were at another supplier dinner (this is where our supplier takes us out for dinner, and they pick up the tab). 

As soon as I enter the restaurant, I can see he lights up. We sit at different parts of the table at dinner, but at the end when some people start to trickle away, he sits next to me. Afterwards we all get a drink at the bar (there are like 7 others here). My boss and I have a one on one chat about his holiday home. He asks me, can I ask a personal question - but someone hears and immediately intervenes, and suggests we all call it a night. 

I use the opportunity to go to the bathroom. My boss follows me to the direction of the bathroom, and just outside the washroom door, he asks me: ""**do you want a line"".** No i tell him. 

I call it a night at midnight. I am not drunk, and want to go back to my hotel room. 

My boss insists that he has to drop me off to make sure that I am safe. He suggests I hold onto his arm as he walks so fast. He hails a cab and says he will get it to drop me off. 

in the taxi, he takes a line of coke. 

in his drunkeness and with all the substances he had taken, the taxi drops me off at the wrong hotel. I jump out the car because i am so uncomfortable and have to walk 45 minutes at night time (no cabs are around and uber isn't available) to get back to my room.

i've been waking up at 4am every day and sitting on my laptop and writing in my notebook for hours n hours w trying to figure out what to do. i have an EHCP, which apparently means i get free education (at only college, not uni) until i'm 25 so i feel that i should take advantage of it, but have literally no idea what course to do and if it would even lead to a career??? i could do an apprenticeship but again, it's knowing which one. i know for sure that i need to get far away from this city and maybe even move to another country, as England is in such a massive state right now but won't all countries be the same?? i am more than happy to learn a new language but which one??? people tell me to start a business... but doing what???? i have written lists of careers but all need a degree.

But due to some complications at home and financially not stable, in these past 4 years, I haven‚Äôt been able to build the business.
Though I learned all the things. The research, the facebook/insta ads, the google analytics, Adobe Illustrator, photoshop, canva. I even know how to build websites on Wix and Shopify. 
I had few reacquiring health problems related to spin and some autoimmune disease. Though I managed to get out of those with god‚Äôs grace but all the injuries acted as hinderance as each took me about 3-4months to get out of plus each happened after 7months apart. It was tough to start and then again restart! 
In July 2024, I felt like I am now fully fit and I could anything in this world. Turns out I fell in love with a girl and she was like you the my world, I am going to marry you and I let my guard down and I too fell in love. And she out of no where when I made her my world she flew to USA and broke off with me as I was nothing. I felt so much heart broken that I literally lost 15kgs in 2months.

In a nut shell, I have going through physical pain, emotional pain, soul crushing pain as well and I am 29, I feel lost. 

I am here for advice.

I too have come to 4 options for me:
1) Go to Usa and do a degree, find a job and live there. The age factor is a thing though, it‚Äôs March, and I am in doubts as to even think of getting an admission in Sept this year. Of course It will take another. Or am I wrong. Please guide me.
2) I take up an entry level job in any IT company or an advertising company full time. But again the age factor is a big thinh and my confidence can go further low working with 22-23 yr old.
3) I take freelancing or a remote job and also work on my business

1j33jy8,I don't know what to do going forward in career steps,"Hello,

I, 22F, recently finished a diploma in veterinary nursing in November 2024, I've been applying to jobs for this careers since around September when I realized that the placement I was at was not going to hire me at all, for lack of funds and it's a small clinic.

I haven't been able to find a job since, I've applied to every veterianary nursing job in my city and the surrounding towns. I once applied for a junior role and they gave it to someone who has more experienced, this is when I started to lose hope. I've lost alot of hope in finding a job as a Veterinary Nurse. I've been applying to other jobs, retail reception, and still haven't had alot of luck.

I should probably say that my old old stepmum told me to become a Veterinary Nurse because I like animals, that was her reason and so I signed up to do it. 

I want to change careers and do something else. I hated the work environment towards the end of last year, my vet didn't like me and I'm not really sure what i did, and I never wanted to go to that placement again but I needed to for hours and sign offs. The nurse I worked under was lovely and I wish her the best because without her I probably wouldn't have gone back to that placement. I know this is getting very long but idk lol.

I came across a job working at a plant nursery in my area and I really want it. And because of that, I want to become a landscape designer. Someone who designs gardens and stuff and then go on to become an architect. I know it sounds silly but when I was told to think about what I liked about being a Veterinary Nurse I really couldn't find a reason like at all, everyone else I graduated with knows what  they like and knows why they became a nurse (for good reason, help animals, foster etc etc). But for me i always just felt like I was in a limbo. 

So I'm just asking for advice considering it's only been a short time frame. I decided that I wouldn't do the landscape if I get a job as being a vn but I would do it if I get a job not in animal care. Sorry that this is really long, I just needed to get it of my chest.

Any advice?,"To give some context, I work for a tiny, new subsidiary of a multibillion dollar government contractor. Initially I signed the offer under the name of subsidiary company but due to some internal issues (likely with benefits not properly set up), I had to sign a new offer letter under the parent company. 

Well today, a different but very large subsidiary (4,000+ employees) just announced they will no longer be fully remote and employees must work in office 5 days a week. I'm now worried that since I'm ""technically"" an employee of the parent company, that I'll be swept under their rules if they mandate it. 

I'm fully remote, about 1,500 miles away from where they're located. This is a dream job for me, I've got amazing bosses, and it's a major salary boost from my previous company after I was unemployed for 9 MONTHS. 

My offer letter specifically states that I'll be working from home in my state. Not sure if that changes anything.

1j32dmq,Am I wrong for asking for a raise after receiving two promotions?,"I‚Äôve been at my company for almost three years now, and in that time, I‚Äôve been promoted twice. I started as an HR assistant making $19/hr, then moved up to HR coordinator at $22/hr, and now I‚Äôm the office manager making $26/hr.

What‚Äôs frustrating is that in the last year, my workload has significantly increased. I‚Äôve essentially absorbed the responsibilities of a hiring assistant and an office manager while still being expected to maintain my HR coordinator duties. My company never replaced those positions‚ÄîI just took them on.

To make things worse, I have access to payroll and can see that I‚Äôm making the same as a billing specialist and what the previous HR generalist made. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm handling KPI management, recruitment, HR compliance, and general office operations‚Äîessentially working the equivalent of three jobs while saving the company two salaries.

I want to ask for $30/hr because that‚Äôs what the previous office manager was making, and I feel like my responsibilities far exceed that role now. I also graduate in May with a Bachelor of Science in Public Health, which strengthens my qualifications.

I know I‚Äôve already received a $7/hr increase in the past two years, and I don‚Äôt want to seem greedy, but for the amount of work I do and the money I save this company, I still feel underpaid. At the same time, I can‚Äôt afford to leave right now, so I‚Äôm feeling stuck.

1j32742,Should I leave my job? I feel stuck.,"I make $180k + 20% bonus in tech. 

My department‚Äôs manager was fired in November of last year and was replaced by someone else. This person has zero experience in what we do as a company and as a department. On top of that, they are incredibly unprofessional to the point where I have reported them to HR for they way they treat people.

We are stuck on working on this person‚Äôs internal project since I and the rest of the department were basically pulled off of all client work. The company realized this was a mistake and have been slowly trying to put us back on client work, but until then they want us to keep working on this internal project. Their excuse is ‚Äòsince you‚Äôre not billing, you can work on this initiative.‚Äô

Said initiative is outside our purview - we‚Äôre essentially creating marketing and training materials and that is not what we were at all hired to do. Companies have whole departments to do this and they‚Äôve stuck us with doing this work. It wouldn‚Äôt be so terrible except that the person in charge of it (the one who was reported to HR) is the one we‚Äôre essentially reporting to and they do not listen to us and makes us do work that makes zero sense because they have no idea what we even do. 

When we try to voice our concerns, they get very combative with us and threaten to bring in the CEO. This person believes that since the CEO gave them this internal project that they have carte blanche to do whatever they want and treat us however they want.

I could start looking for a job now, especially because it‚Äôs prime hiring season but a) I am concerned about the market with news of tariffs going into effect and the private sector pulling back and b) I would lose out on my bonus which is paid out in July if I did leave.

1j32708,"College advice. Which path to take, graphic design or mechanic.","Don't know if this is the right sub for this,  but I'm kind of lost in life at the moment.  I'm in college for graphic design, I enjoy it, my professors like me and give me great comments  and feedback for projects, and my grades are good. But the further I get into it the more I dislike the thought of going into it as a career. It's hard to explain, but I think I would slowly grow to hate it overtime, and I'm scared of the direction the career path seems to be going down. 

Currently I work at a bike shop as a mechanic, the pay is shit, but of all 4 jobs ive had, I actually love every aspect of it. The people, the work, the customers, etc. but Iike I said, the pay is bad. My coworker who has worked there for 12+ years and currently is the manager at our location makes barely enough to support him, his wife and kid, and relies on income from his wife to live a very modest, but comfortable enough life. My parents have said that God has given me talent galore, and plenty of work ethic. Which I agree, I have never hated any of my jobs, and enjoy working, but Im lacking the motivation for my non art classes, and it driving me nuts. I would like to maybe become a car mechanic, as I find it interesting and already like working on my car, I've only replaced simple stuff like the timing belt, accessory belt, throttle body, tires, breaks etc, but I could definitely see it as a career path.

I‚Äôve been offered an okayish job with bit less salary pay and less PTO which surprised me since the offer is below market rate than I expected. However, I am currently unemployed thanks to layoffs early this year. 

So unfortunately with the way this job market is now, I have no choice but to take it. But with this new offer, the only thing that would really hurt me in my future career after this job is the title they offered. 

I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to approach the potential employer with changing the job title before accepting the job. Since on paper, it is a lower title that demotes me at this point within my career of 10 years in the field. It just feels like they threw it together not knowing what to name it.

1j31ve2,Almost took the wrong job out of desperation. Here are 3 things I wish I knew sooner,"Four years ago, I was at rock bottom. Let go after a decade. COVID-era layoff. Depressed as hell. I felt like absolute dogshit - like I had wasted my best years and had nothing to show for it. I spent months lying in bed, barely eating, convinced my career was over. My wife? She didn‚Äôt buy it. Every day, she‚Äôd tell me: ‚ÄúQuit it. You know you can do better.‚Äù Over and over. Until one day‚Ä¶I listened.

I almost settled for a garbage job - same pay, worse commute, soul-crushing. But then, by pure accident, I stumbled onto the listing. It was everything. Every requirement? I had it. They needed someone ASAP? I could hit the ground running. It was close to home. No training required. It was so stupidly perfect that it felt unreal.

I told them straight up: ""I can do this job, and I‚Äôll do it damn well. But I have another offer on the table."" They moved fast. Offered me double. Now? I‚Äôm three years in, making *three times* my old salary, five minutes from my house, working for a company the media calls ‚Äúrecession-proof.‚Äù No stress. No job-hunting ever again.

Here‚Äôs what I wish I knew back when I was spiraling:

\- Your brain is a liar when you‚Äôre depressed. It tells you you‚Äôre worthless, that you‚Äôve peaked, that you‚Äôll never get better. That‚Äôs not reality. It‚Äôs just your brain‚Äôs way of protecting you from disappointment. Don‚Äôt trust it.

\- Your network is your cheat code. The best jobs aren‚Äôt on Indeed - they come from random conversations, LinkedIn messages, people remembering you exist. The more you put yourself out there, the more ""lucky breaks"" you'll get.

\- Confidence isn‚Äôt a feeling, it‚Äôs a strategy. I didn‚Äôt *feel* confident when I told that company I wanted them. I *acted* confident. And guess what? It worked. People believe in you when you believe in yourself. Even if you‚Äôre faking it.

A few books that low-key saved my life during that time:

\- [The Defining Decade](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-defining-decade-by-meg-jay) by Meg Jay

Everyone in their 20s needs this. To me, even though I‚Äôm in my 30s, this book also helped. It‚Äôs about why your career, relationships, and habits matter way more than you think; and how to stop wasting time on the wrong things. No fluff, just real talk.

\- [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck-by-mark-manson) by Mark Manson

If you‚Äôre stuck in self-pity and spiraling, this will snap you out of it. It‚Äôs brutally honest, hilarious, and will make you rethink what actually matters in life. Such a game-changer.

\- [So Good They Can‚Äôt Ignore You](https://www.befreed.ai/book/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-by-cal-newport) by Cal Newport - This killed my ‚Äúfollow your passion‚Äù mindset. Instead, it teaches you how to build real career capital so opportunities chase *you*. Hands down the best career book I‚Äôve read. His other books are all pretty useful. Really good author.

\- Mindset by Carol Dweck

¬†If you‚Äôve ever felt like you‚Äôre ‚Äújust not good enough,‚Äù read this. It explains how success isn‚Äôt about talent - it‚Äôs about believing you can improve.¬†

Part of this was absolutely my fault, and I've learnt a lot in terms of what I should definitely be looking for when conducting another job search, but I'm unsure as to what I should do now. 

For context, this is account manager role in tech, and my previous position I held for 6 years, so am not usually this jumpy, but am also aware there would always be a transition period for me. 

That being said, the role itself is not as was advertised, and the commission is based on an expansion target that is double what the current employee in this role has done in 2.5 years. 

It's not meeting clients in person, everything is done virtually, and it's 5 days in the office mandatory; aside from in office working, I was not told about the above. 

The onboarding couldn't have been worse, has come with no structure or training, and when I asked what the day looked like, I was told to sit with the current account manager and have ad hoc conversations... Not great right üòÖ

I pushed through the initial shock, have come back for the past week each day hoping for it to improve, or give me anything to take as a positive, but I'm at a loss. 

Im based in Sydney and had a lot of great traction with applications before this, so I'm wary but not necessarily scared of the job market being too tough. 

My question is what now? It's clearly not the right fit but I hate the idea of being so jumpy. ",Glennbaa,2,1.0,5,1741057627,2025-03-04 03:07:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j314fg/i_took_the_wrongwas_missold_a_new_job_advice_on/,3,2025

Would this count as 5 years of experience as a translator? When I asked about this in these groups, the one that pays me told me that, since we're not doing ""official"" translations, it wouldn't count as professional experience, and advised me against putting this in a resume, because it might even attract unwanted attention to the group, since, by his own words, this would count as ""illegal"" translations, which I don't know the consequences of, but I figured I shouldn't get them involved anyway since they asked me not to.

When I asked the non-profit group, however, they told me that they didn't know if I could put it in a resume, which got me wondering how ""professional"" something needs to be to count as professional experience, because even if I didn't get paid, it's still something I've been doing consistently over the last 5 years that put my skills to the test.

1j2yjn7,Did I make the right choice leaving social work?,"Hi all, just looking for some advice/perspective on this. I am a 25f social worker in the midwest, I work in a nonprofit that does homeless shelter/housing programs through HUD and have been with my employer for 5 years since graduating college. I was promoted to a supervisory role and now make 55k. I recently became interested in switching careers to IT and started studying for an entry-level tech certificate back in November. Then, threats of federal funding cuts had our organization discussing layoffs in January so I decided to throw out some applications for tech roles with ""studying for A+ cert"" in my resume. I very surprisingly landed an entry level IT support role starting at 25.50/hr (~53k).  I put my two weeks in at my current role today and it absolutely crushed me. I actually cried at work speaking to my boss about it and can't stop thinking about how much I'll miss my team. But in social work, I basically hit my pay ceiling at 55k with a bachelors degree, and getting my first role in tech will open up other doors for me with a much higher earning potential.  But now I'm worrying I made a dumb decision because I am going from salary to hourly pay, new job requires on-call work and they were not 100% clear about scheduling etc. And starting a new field where I have absolutely no experience.

1j2xl85,"Feeling Stuck, Undervalued, and Losing Confidence in My Data Science Career","**TL;DR:** Struggling with self-doubt and burnout after working hard to get into data science. I‚Äôm stuck in a job with no real growth opportunities, feeling underpaid and undervalued, and struggling with technical interviews. I am losing my passion and confidence. I‚Äôve been job hunting for a while but continue to get rejected, and I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here. I feel like I am no longer cut out for this field.

I am feeling so horrible inside and really needed to get this off my chest. Any advice, words of encouragement, thoughts, etc., would mean a lot to me right now. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I‚Äôve been working as an R&D Data Scientist for an AI company for 3.5 years now. I got into data science because I was passionate about statistics. I worked hard and had a great time achieving my career goals. I went to grad school, learned everything I needed to land a job, and achieved my goal of becoming a data scientist. My first year at my current job was great. I was learning, growing, and excited about my work. But after that, everything started going downhill.

I‚Äôve consistently asked for a raise and promotion, only to be met with excuses. My salary is significantly below market rate, and I‚Äôm living paycheck to paycheck. It's so frustrating to see jobs I am qualified for that easily make $30k+ more than what I do given the field and the state I live in. Despite doing good work and being proactive, I‚Äôm told there aren't enough projects or that I haven‚Äôt ""proven"" myself enough. I‚Äôve worked on numerous projects, but since a lot of them have not gone to production, I‚Äôve been told there's no strong ""story"" to justify a raise or promotion. The lack of projects in production has worked against me in terms of getting anyone above me to advocate for my growth, despite my efforts. Data issues, poor results, and other challenges‚Äîwhich were out of my control‚Äîhave held these projects back. As a result, I feel stuck and overlooked.  My manager even told me to start looking elsewhere because they likely won‚Äôt be giving raises this year and there isn't a strong enough reason for them to convince higher ups to promote me or give me a raise. I've been asking for a raise or promotion every year since I finished my first year.

One of the worst parts is that I feel completely stuck. There‚Äôs been no opportunity to do real data science work, no machine learning, no statistical modeling, nothing that originally excited me. The projects I am put on are usually just analytics-based projects, the 'real' stuff is given to the rest of the team. After years of this, I feel like I‚Äôve lost so many of the skills and knowledge I once had and that makes me feel insanely horrible inside and I don't have any confidence in myself.

I already started job hunting last year, but the market has been brutal. I‚Äôve applied to countless jobs, gotten ghosted or rejected, and had only a handful of interviews. I recently got the chance to interview at a company I‚Äôve always wanted to work for, but I‚Äôm losing confidence in myself. My biggest struggle is technical interviews. I code every day in my job, but I feel like I don't have experience with the types of coding challenges these interviews throw at me. I freeze up, and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not cut out for this field anymore. I‚Äôve practiced on various coding sites like LeetCode, but I continuously struggle to confidently solve the coding challenges.

I worked so hard to get here. I never minded putting in the effort because I truly loved this field. But now, I feel completely defeated. The technical interviews, despite my experience and passion for data science, feel like they work against me. I have the grit, curiosity, work ethic, and experience in the field, but it hasn't translated well during these interviews, I'm assuming due to the technical coding rounds. I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm not cut out for this field anymore. My passion has been drained, and I don‚Äôt know what to do next.

1j2xg73,Vague Job Expectations & Self-Defining Roles ‚Äì Is This Normal?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice from people who have experience in HR, organizational design, or just navigating ambiguous roles at work.

A while back, I was hired for a knowledge and learning role at a mid-sized nonprofit. The job description was fairly clear at first‚Äîthere were specific projects and responsibilities listed. However, once I started, it quickly became apparent that the actual expectations were vague, and the organization wanted me to define my own role to a significant degree.

The biggest challenge? The only other person working in this domain (my direct supervisor) had built the entire framework from scratch and had been operating solo for years. She‚Äôs brilliant but works in a very independent and intuitive way, doesn‚Äôt enjoy managing, and has admitted that she doesn‚Äôt want to have to explain her thought process in detail. This has left me in a weird situation where I‚Äôm expected to work within a system I didn‚Äôt create, but without full insight into how or why it was designed this way.

Some issues I‚Äôve run into:

I was initially given specific projects, but those expectations have now shifted to ‚ÄúYou can do more‚Äù‚Äîwithout clear direction on what ‚Äúmore‚Äù looks like.

My supervisor is reluctant to work closely with me, so I don‚Äôt have much mentorship or structured onboarding.

Important discussions about our work happen between leadership and my supervisor, and I only get looped in after decisions have been made, without context.

I want to be proactive and engaged, but I often feel like I‚Äôm operating in the dark‚Äîguessing at what‚Äôs needed rather than being set up for success.

Recently, I was told that my lack of vocal participation in meetings makes me seem disinterested‚Äîwhen in reality, I just second-guess myself because the work environment is so ambiguous.

I‚Äôve put together an action plan to ask more questions, be more visible, and try to integrate myself better. But I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîis this a me problem, or is this just a fundamentally unclear job structure?

Would love to hear from others:

Have you ever been in a role where you had to define your own responsibilities?
How do you push for clarity when leadership doesn‚Äôt seem to know exactly what they want?
Is this kind of ambiguity a red flag, or is it just how knowledge-based roles work sometimes?
Any advice for making this work without burning out from the constant need to prove my value?

Thanks in advance for any insights!",Dialecticdoggy,1,1.0,1,1741046520,2025-03-04 00:02:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2xg73/vague_job_expectations_selfdefining_roles_is_this/,3,2025
1j2x4ig,Been self-employed for 12 years. How can I transition into a new career?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been feeling lost for months, and a friend suggested I come here for advice. Hoping to get some fresh perspectives!

My Background:

I‚Äôm 31 and have been self-employed for over 10 years since graduating with a Computer Science degree. Over the years, I‚Äôve worn many hats, including:

Consulting ‚Äì Helping early-stage startups with pitch decks, creative strategy, and fundraising.

Startups ‚Äì Co-founded two tech/gaming startups (one was asset-acquired, the other was taken over). Didn't make enough for it to be worthwhile.

Design Studio ‚Äì Spent most of my career running my design studio (Me+biz partner with different freelancers) delivering projects for gaming/Web3/tech clients. This included websites, UI/UX, branding, and slide deck design.


I led business development, creative direction and project management while hiring and managing freelance designers to execute projects.


Where I Am Now:

Last year, my business partner and I went separate ways. Since then, I‚Äôve been trying to run my studio solo, but the market for creative work is tough, and handling everything (client management, sales, project execution, finances etc) alone has been overwhelming, especially in a market that has been struggling in what seems to be a race to the bottom.

So, I‚Äôm thinking it might be time for a career change‚Äîbut I‚Äôm stuck.

My Challenges with Job Hunting:

1. I‚Äôm a generalist. My experience is broad, and is all my 'own' stuff. While I know I can add value to a company, it‚Äôs hard to communicate that well in a CV.


2. My job titles feel ‚Äòcringe‚Äô on applications. Writing ""CEO,"" ""Founder,"" or ""Creative Director"" for past owned ventures feels like a red flag when applying for mid-level roles.


3. I‚Äôm either overqualified or underqualified. Some see me as overqualified because I‚Äôve run businesses; others think I lack the ‚Äòright‚Äô specialized experience (as some roles require X years in a specific role or industry - especially finance.)


4. I don‚Äôt know what jobs fit me best. Since I‚Äôve always done a mix of things, I struggle to pinpoint what roles I should be applying for.



What I‚Äôm Looking For:

- A remote role (or hybrid if local).

- At very least a ¬£40K base salary. (Then I can do occasional creative work outside to bump that up)

- Stability, but with a clear career trajectory.

- Probably a mid-level role‚ÄîI don‚Äôt expect to enter at leadership level, but I want room to grow.

- I‚Äôm open to all industries, but I particularly enjoy sports (human performance & cycling), automotive, tech, and finance. I have a lot of experience in gaming, but I think it might be time to move on from that.


My Strengths & Interests:

- Creative but analytical. I love creative problem-solving, but I‚Äôm also love analysing and utilising data (both in work and in my cycling)

- Used to working alone but also in a team. Have a strong iniative to get stuff done and find solutions.

- People-oriented in a work setting. I‚Äôm fairly introverted outside of work, but in a business context, I‚Äôm great at working with creatives and confident in engaging with leadership/C-level management. Not afraid to share my expertise or conflicting opinion.

- I feel I have a very unique and diverse background & experience. I have operated in the capacity of an agency but also in a startup environment. I understand business well and how each section of a business operates.

- Love digital focused industries, but I am also a big lover of the outdoors.


Roles I‚Äôve Considered:

- Product Manager (As I have a product background and enjoy building digital products for past clients. However, I lack recent specific experience in a PM specific role)

- Account Manager (As I have managed and built relationships with hundreds of clients over the years and I have enjoyed it)

- Project Manager (As I have managed and delivered hundreds of successful creative projects over the years. However, I feel like my value goes beyond this role)


These seem to align with my experience, but I worry that hiring managers will see my background as a red flag. Would they assume I wouldn‚Äôt stay long? Would they think I lack the right experience? Question why I would want a 'demotion' of pay or role?

Key Skills (All in the Context of Running My Own Studio):

- Client Management
- Project Management
- Account Management
- Creative Strategy
- Design Management
- Creative Direction
- Business Development
- Sales Strategy
- Design Leadership
- Product Management


Given my experience, what job roles would you recommend? And do you have any advice for someone in my position who‚Äôs struggling to transition from self-employment to a full-time role?

1j2vl4y,I got a promotion the day before giving notice. Now I have no idea what to do...,"Over the last three years, I have loved my job. My boss is great and really supportive, and I have a lot of internal equity in the company. I work as a data analyst for about $75k and 5% bonus target. I've done a lot for the company, including helping build out their business intelligence platform and doing a lot of work outside my job description.

But the last six months haven't been as rewarding. The longer I've been there the more siloed it's felt. It's been hard to grow. I took on new projects, improved my technical skills like SQL, got my Masters in Computer Science. But there was never talk of a pay raise or a growth path. And the job is pretty demanding - I work with all of our internal and external shareholders on ad-hocs. I'm pretty tired most weeks. I've always been highly praised and told senior leadership adores me.

And then we got a new CEO who rubbed me the wrong way in town halls. The company is going through growing pains as they transition from a medium to a large company. There's been RTO initiatives as well, which have been stressful. But thankfully, I was as an exception - although now I feel a little more isolated than I once did. Regardless, remote work is priority number one in a lot of ways.

I've been disgruntled since September and have been looking for jobs. I've gotten a lot of interest, including 3 offers and rejected them. I just determined in the end that we did not align culturally, and I felt a lot of loyalty to my boss / current company. And then a really great company reached out and made me an offer for a mid-March start date. It comes with really everything I wanted - senior title, a fully remote company culture, and a salary of $100k with a 15% bonus target. Another big factor for me leaving is my student loan bills are coming and they are very large. At $77k, it would have taken almost all of my disposable income.

I took last week off and planned to give my two weeks notice to my boss in our 1:1 on Tuesday. It's bonus season and our payout is next Friday. Because it's just 5%, I haven't really cared that much. And in the past three years, I've never received my full target due to company performance. My boss calls me for a surprise Zoom meeting today to tell me about my bonus. Not only am I getting my full bonus, I'm being promoted. Senior title, new bonus target of 10%, and an $85k salary. He gushed about me during the call, talked about how much senior leadership has loved me, and I am one of the few people company wide getting a title re-adjustment this year. They ""had"" to get me promoted.

I was very surprised. I've never gotten this recognition and bump. But it's still below my new offer. The new company is really, excellent, but the pay difference instead of $25k is just $15k. Do I go and start all over at a new place just for $15K? How do I even break the news to my boss tomorrow? The call was a surprise and I kind of just was digesting all of it and couldn't really respond with anything other than gratitude. I wish this had been done earlier, but I'm also not sure it could have with all the executive leadership changes in the last year.

I was basically going to say in our 1:1 tomorrow that I I applied for over the holidays that was put on hold, it came off hold yesterday and gave an offer out of the blue. During the call I was also going to offer contract work to keep the relationship. Now I'm doing it the day after I finally got a bump and my boss said so many nice things. How do I handle this? Should I just stay where I'm at? Everyone in my orbit is sort of saying I applied for other jobs for a reason and the money's still significant, but my dumb brain is all stressed out about what to do because I can't put this off any longer. Is there any reason to just stay? How do I even approach this? We have our weekly team meeting before my 1:1 and I know I'm going to get some kind of special shoutout.

1j2uxi7,Petty client escalation to change the account manager,"My manager knows I‚Äôm a high performer and I‚Äôve been 5 years excelling in the job - they understand that the client is over reacting and taking things out of proportion and they are giving me the option to keep or let go of the account.

Worth noting; I‚Äôm going through fertility treatment and I‚Äôm trying to avoid stress at work  and this is a (annoying-always-escalating-things-high-demanding) client who requires meeting on a weekly basis and can be rude and unprofessional.

1j2uudg,I am lost,"Last september I lost my job that I thought would be the best step in my career when i started it (2years ago). I got the fancy title, big salary etc but during my time I didn‚Äôt like the culture and way of working and they did like 4 layoff rounds in the time I was there. When I signed my garden leave agreement I thought, this is all going to be ok, i‚Äôll have a similar job with a competitor or any other business in no time‚Ä¶ well that didn‚Äôt go as i thought and I am still without job (that should be solved soon though, as you read below).

Fast forward to today, I learned a lot about myself, networking and that networking is actually the most important piece when searching for a new position in the senior/executive level üòÖ. 

I got introduced to a former supplier in the beginning of January and this took off quick, multiple interviews within weeks and they told me that they wanted to hire me as a senior director, just have to go through some loops and get the position approved. Location was flexible in europe, good salary etc. I have been waiting for the official offer for a few weeks but still nothing, should come this week they tell me.

Now the following I need advice with. I was introduced to the usa president of one of my previous companies in November, he had now come back to me last week and told me he wants to hire me for a position in the USA as a director (they don‚Äôt really follow strict levels and I report directly to him). I already told him I am about to receive an offer and that I cannot hold that off for 3 weeks (he told me he will need about 3 weeks to get everything done).

As I am without job and have one offer definite coming this week I cannot run the risk of losing that but honestly me and the family are kinda excited about the opportunity to go to the USA as long as the money is good.

What kind of advice kan you give me on my dilemma? 

The other topic I am struggling with in my mind, but knowing it is kinda stupid, I come from a VP position for a smaller (2000people company) and the two current ones are both 10.000 plus. The europe one offers a snr director role and the USA a director role but both in the regional management team and lot of nice challenges, should I just stop focusing on that for now?",oppernemo,1,1.0,3,1741039494,2025-03-03 22:04:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2uudg/i_am_lost/,3,2025
1j2unyv,Financial job advice - from processes to quantitative,"Hi everyone,  
I'm 29, Currently, I work in a process-oriented role at a large Italian investment bank, but my academic background is in statistics and finance, and I'm looking to transition to a career that aligns more with my technical skills and interest in finance. Specifically, I'm very interested in risk (such as market risk or credit risk) and would like to explore opportunities in investment banking that require statistical knowledge, quantitative analysis, and programming, but without being overly technical.

Over the years, I've gained experience in PMO roles, so I also have a background in process management and project coordination. I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to move into a role more focused on risk, or other similar positions within investment banking, where my academic background could be useful.

What I‚Äôm aiming for is a role that combines both quantitative and ""qualitative"" skills, since I imagine that no one would hire a 29-year-old who hasn't dealt much with numbers in his first 3-4 years of work. I've come across roles like **operation risk specialist**, which require about 80% process study and 20% analysis, but honestly, I'm not too enthusiastic about those.

Thanks a lot to anyone who has suggestions!",Bipbip99,1,1.0,0,1741039047,2025-03-03 21:57:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2unyv/financial_job_advice_from_processes_to/,3,2025

Going from fully remote to either in office everyday or travelling (anywhere from 25%-40% travel....but probably more closer to 25% than 40%). Will also going from internal work to client facing work.
* **Pros:**¬†Going from 150k to 200k is a very big bump. I'll also get to work with software/technology that I have much more interest in than the stuff I work with currently. Will be a good learning experience.
* **Cons:**¬†Their will be a lot more pressure to get things done in an urgent manner. The WLB will almost certainly be worse (I have good WLB now). One could say the company culture leans towards ""toxic"", though it depends on the position tbf. Even though I'll enjoy working with this new tech more, it will be more difficult as it is new to me + I'll be expected to hit the ground running. Actually a bit surprised they sent me an offer, but suppose they are confident I'll be able to pick things up quickly etc. Lastly, the job reviews on glassdoor have been very hit or miss, either saying they enjoy the work & experience vs. ""Stay far away"".
* **Personal**: 32 year old Male. Currently renting + paying off student debt. I have a partner, but we are still a few years away from marriage. No kids or pets.
* **Overall thoughts:**¬†This would be a great learning experience, and would help me get back on my career track. I've been doing work that I haven't enjoyed for 3 years (but the WLB and team is so great I've stuck with it). My major concern is that taking this position could cause me a lot of stress (tougher deadlines, longer hours...would be going from a solid 40 to 50-60, and I really want to stay working in a remote/hybrid environment). I would say even if I take it, I would potentially leave after 1 year, and take all the experience I learned to find a more laid back job.

He‚Äôs indecisive, constantly panicking, and demands daily reports that don‚Äôt really add value.

On top of that, a coworker is trying to overstep, acting like he‚Äôs the new marketing director. It‚Äôs frustrating because I don‚Äôt care about leadership, but I can‚Äôt stand someone stepping out of their role and making my job harder. Sometimes I handle it well, other times I lose my patience.

I‚Äôve been hustling, hitting targets, even working extra hours‚Äîbut it doesn‚Äôt feel appreciated. Salary-wise, I know I‚Äôm underpaid, even compared to coworkers below me in the hierarchy. Despite promises of bonuses, nothing has happened.

1j2ta6i,Freddie Mac vs Top 10 Bank?,"Currently have two job offers (exact same base salary) with Freddie Mac and a T10 Bank based in NC. 

Both have great benefits except the Bank is 4 days RTO right now vs Freddie Mac is 3 days only. Bank does have a pension as well (have to stay 5 years)... BUT I most definitely felt the most comfortable with all my Freddie Mac interviewers, the Bank interviews felt strictly business not much personality IMO. I think culture wise I am 100% better aligned with Freddie, however..

Given the current state with Freddie/Fannie potentially being in talks of being privatized by current administration, would it be better to choose the Bank? Or is the likelihood of that pretty remote and I should focus on personal fit more? This is somewhere I am hoping to stay long term (exiting consulting at the moment, first time in industry)

The benefits include bonding with your child, improving the well-being of the mother and family.Early involvement for a father in a child‚Äôs life fosters stronger relationships.It also promotes gender equity at home by challenging the outdated idea that moms should handle all caregiving. When fathers opt out, mothers often bear the brunt, reinforcing traditional roles.Supporting mothers‚Äô recovery and careers is another key benefit. Dads taking leave reduces stress on moms during postpartum recovery and allows them to return to work sooner if desired. This could lessen career interruptions that lead to wage gaps.For fathers, taking leave improves mental health and life satisfaction by allowing them to adjust to parenthood without the immediate pressure to keep working. It also challenges workplace stigma, normalizing caregiving as a fatherly role. On a societal level, it drives change by dismantling gender stereotypes.Economically, dads using leave maximizes benefits worth $6,000 to $10,000 per person according to a McKinsey report.

Before I ask my question, I‚Äôll provide some background. 

I left my former job at the end of 2024. I did not mind working at my former company and I learned a lot and had a lot of great experiences there. Unfortunately, the room for professional growth and increases to my salary were non existent and extremely small. I had very open conversations with my former boss and decided that it was best for me to seek other employment. Some information I was privy to before I left was this; they were by going to have to let someone on my team go by EOM Jan 2025 due to financial hardship in our division. 

I knew I was leaving and did not want to see anyone get terminated (truly no one deserved it, we just simply did not make money), so I rushed and took a position I wasn‚Äôt super confident in.  I do not enjoy this role or this company, and now that 2025 budgets are in place I‚Äôm having success with my revamped search as mentioned. 

My first week in this role, an almost coworker abandoned his job after being ‚Äúsick‚Äù for two weeks (I‚Äôm in a professional field at a very well known company so it was odd). My superiors are exceptionally paranoid right now and me and my colleagues are under constant micromanagement. For instance, an illness spread in my office during my first month and 10+ people were out, including me. I was accused of searching for a new job during that time (I hadn‚Äôt started yet) and things were incredibly tense. And even went as far as providing proof of my doctors visit and medication prescriptions to get some heat off me. 

What advice does anyone have to offer in terms of managing this transition out of this company? I have ample PTO to use, I don‚Äôt have any issues completing my work and I‚Äôve been effective in navigating this odd landscape I‚Äôm in. My concerns are that I‚Äôm under a microscope, it‚Äôs obvious that there is a level of paranoia about more employees leaving, and honestly, my boss is kind of a snoopy jerk. 

I appreciate any insight anyone has to offer! Thank you. ",DipAndDingers,1,1.0,0,1741029597,2025-03-03 19:19:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2qvea/managing_interviews_us_based/,3,2025
1j2qnpc,Stay or leave?,"Recently I resigned from my current job in a start up because the company decided to revoke an incentive which made for almost 15% of my annual income. (65% is earned from fixed and 35% from incentives) Assume I got paid 85 in total. Also going forward there will be negligible incentives.

Got an offer elsewhere with a pay cut but in a very large and reputable organization.
Taking everything into account my compensation would reduce to 70% of the 85 meaning now I will make 60 but it does make sense in the long term due to brand value it would bring to the cv.

Due to some technicalities that offer may be revoked (50:50) but I got a retention plan from my current employer giving me a 25% hike on the fixed ctc + a fixed annual bonus that would bring the compensation back to 85 and without the risk that comes with incentive plans.

Current job is hybrid with 8months wfh and 4 in office for which I travel. New job would be 100% in office.

It‚Äôs a heart vs mind situation. Heart says f*** it and move on but the mind says the money is alright and I can spend another year with my current employer.

Basically, where I live currently feels there is nothing really left for me here anymore. I have always pretty much hated where I lived due to how triggering it is being here as a lot of factors led me to have such negative experiences. I am in therapy and working through my traumas and etc trying to get better little by little, but I know a key factor in why I‚Äôm not able to fully improve is because of where I am living and how it is triggering me daily by being here as I‚Äôve had too many bad memories. I‚Äôm 25F, it‚Äôs been hard for me to find a stable job (many were seasonal roles and I was let go after they didn‚Äôt need us) although the jobs I have had previously look good on my resume. 

I know I won‚Äôt be young forever, and I would love to move if I had the chance- which is why I am applying to jobs also out of state and etc as well. Parents are very supportive of me wanting to leave but know how much of a struggle it is. Due to me having a rough time getting a job, I considered going back to school to get an MBA. 

Aside from that, parents offered me to just move into our vacation home (out of state)  and get even a fun job for the time being while there since I don‚Äôt have a job right now anyways. I can envision the job I‚Äôd have. And I actually had a thought of what I‚Äôd like to do as a possible job- I would love to open a cafe, although it may sound silly it‚Äôs been a thought I had for a good 5 years and I just have a good feeling I‚Äôd get so much joy from it. Parents are supportive of that idea if I really want it but told me to get more experience working in one first. Am I crazy for thinking this? I reel lost in life anyway, and I feel like i really would thrive by moving elsewhere since being where i am right now sucks the life out of me. Or should I go for that MBA? Not sure what to do, feel so lost! My heart says go because its so so difficult for me to live where I do and be in the environment I‚Äôm in, I get a lot of panic attacks being here if I‚Äôm being really frank. But to move without knowing a soul where our vacation home is, seems really risky without also having a job there too. 

As weird as it might sound, I really feel that I could thrive in the right place, and it starts with a better mindset which I can‚Äôt fully get there without leaving this toxic / traumatic area. There‚Äôs nothing left for me in my hometown, and I am young. But I just don‚Äôt know how this could go? And even with the move, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm finding a job here anyways. Thoughts?

My issue is I work with Dentists who are not the nicest to work with. Like genuinely I dread coming to work most days and can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve cried at work.

I do like my job but it‚Äôs hard to work in these conditions. I love the other girls I work with, we all get along so well which I think is part of the reason I‚Äôm so hesitant to leave. Basically I started a course in January which should help me become a Dental Hygienist in the future which has always been my dream job. But now more than ever work has been really rough and I want to leave more than ever. But if I leave then I‚Äôll have to stop the course which could potentially put any career progression for me on hold for the foreseeable future. 

Basically, I‚Äôm just asking whether it‚Äôs worth quitting and sacrificing this course or whether I should just stick it out and hope that work gets better for me. Or at least long enough for me to complete my course and move on. Everyone I ask has given me different answers and advice and I just feel really stuck. Anyone been in a similar situation? Or just have any advice to offer up?

1j2pqcv,"I don‚Äôt think I want to be a therapist anymore, what should I do?","I‚Äôve (27 F) been a middle school therapist providing 1-1 and group services for 2 years now and while I love the kids I have to come to terms with the fact that I do not like doing therapy. I have to decide soon if I‚Äôm going to stay another year or leave. I‚Äôm almost done with my hours to become licensed as an LPCC (2,000 out of 3,000 hours). At the rate I see students this could take another 1/1.5 school years and I‚Äôm already dreading it especially because I commute an hour each way daily. 

I love the work/ life balance of having so many days off and having good pay but the actual day-to-day of my job feels unsatisfying, boring even, and I feel like I would do better in a different role. My position is new so it feels unstable but it has potential. I‚Äôve been told by students that they love talking to me but the role of a therapist doesn‚Äôt seem like a good fit for me personally. 

Some options I‚Äôve considered are doing k-12 school counseling, try to get into college counseling (competitive), or group private practice which I don‚Äôt think I would enjoy 8 hours of therapy but at least I would gain hours quickly then do something administrative & non-client facing in this field. I‚Äôm very organized, practical & planned out. (Side note: Husband & I want to have babies soon so I don‚Äôt feel comfortable commuting for long unless I had to)

1j2ph7m,In need of genuine advice,"Hey everyone,



Okay, so here's the deal. I'm a 22-year-old Civil Engineering student in my final semester in India ‚Äì like, graduation is right around the corner in less than 5 months. The thing is, I've had this growing realization that civil engineering just isn't it for me. What really gets me excited is finance.



I know, it's a pretty big leap. I've got the whole technical background thing going on, and honestly? My GPA isn't very outstanding. The grading system at my university is brutal, seriously, it's like they try to make it hard to get good marks! I'm a little (okay, a lot) worried about how that's going to look to potential employers in finance.



But I've been trying my best to learn what I can on my own. I did that job simulation in Investment Banking with J.P. Morgan on Forage, and I'm grinding through that Finance & Quantitative Modelling specialization on Coursera (University of Pennsylvania). I also actively manage a personal investment portfolio, it's been a really valuable learning experience.



I know I'm not going to walk into some fancy analyst job right off the bat. I'm totally prepared to start small, even if it's something that doesn't seem directly related to finance at first, as long as it gets me a foot in the door. I'm ready to learn, work hard, and prove myself.



So, given my situation ‚Äì civil engineering degree, less than perfect GPA, and a genuine willingness to start from the bottom, what kind of jobs should I even be looking at? Are there any companies out there that are cool with hiring people from non-traditional backgrounds and giving them a chance? Any roles that I haven't even thought of? What are the must-have skills and certifications I should be focusing on in the next few months? And how do I even begin to network when my GPA might be a huge turn-off?



Seriously, any advice you can throw my way would be amazing. I'm feeling a bit lost and stressed about this whole thing, and any help would be a total lifesaver.



Thanks a bunch!",King_Divyansh,1,1.0,0,1741026263,2025-03-03 18:24:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2ph7m/in_need_of_genuine_advice/,3,2025
1j2ph1b,Please Tailor Your Resume & Cover Letter,"NOTE: Thanks to the person who pointed out my spelling error. I checked and double-checked the previous version of this post and didn't proof the title. I took it down out of shame as I cannot edit titles.

I‚Äôve done¬†**resume and cover letter workshops, interview trainings, and a bit of applicant coaching**, and while I don't consider myself an absolute expert, one of the biggest pieces of pushback I get is from people with a bit of entry-level experience (or a lot of entry level experience, maybe even some ""shift lead"" or ""assistant manager"" experience) who think their resume and cover letter are¬†**already excellent**‚Äîbecause they‚Äôve used them for every job they‚Äôve applied for and gotten most of those jobs. Until they are trying to take the next step.

Here‚Äôs the hard truth:¬†**sometimes, it wasn‚Äôt your resume or cover letter that got you the job.**¬†Sometimes, the company just needed a person, and you were a warm body with enough basic and discernable qualifications to fill the role. That works great when a position is less competitive, but when you‚Äôre applying for¬†**jobs with strict minimum requirements, preferred skills, and high applicant pools**, that generic one-size-fits-all resume you‚Äôve been using?¬†**Not going to cut it.**

**Why Generic Resumes and Cover Letters Fail When It Matters Most**

I recently sat on¬†**two search committees**, one for a¬†**public organization**¬†and one for a¬†**nonprofit**, and I was¬†**blown away**by how many candidates probably met the qualifications but got¬†**instantly overlooked**¬†because their application didn‚Äôt make it easy for the hiring committee to see their fit. The organizations I work with both have HR units that make the first pass to see if the candidates meet our required/minimum qulaifications. Then we decide how well they meet those based on the evidence offered in their material. The harder it is to find that evidence, the less likely it is you are considered.

Let me say this loud and clear:¬†**If a hiring committee has to dig through your resume to figure out if you‚Äôre qualified, they won‚Äôt.**

One of my grad school professors once shared that when he was a city manager (for the second biggest city in his large west-coast state), he would give a resume and cover letter about 1 minute total and if he didn't find what he needed, it got tossed.

The people who¬†**explicitly connect the experience they have to the requirements/preferences of the company shared in the job description**¬†rise to the top, while those who assume ‚Äúmy experience speaks for itself‚Äù fade into the abyss of rejected applications. Especially if those ""my experience speaks for itself"" people have long resumes.

**Stop Making Recruiters Work So Hard**

1.¬†**Actually Read the Job Description (Yes, Really)**

* Find the¬†**minimum requirements**¬†and¬†**preferred qualifications**¬†and highlight them.
* If you meet them,¬†**make it blatantly obvious**¬†in your materials.
* If you¬†*kind of*¬†meet them, use your¬†**cover letter**¬†to show how your transferable skills compensate.

2.¬†**Make Your Resume Job-Specific, Not a Career Scrapbook**

* **Use the same language as the job posting.**¬†If the job says ‚Äústakeholder engagement,‚Äù don‚Äôt just say ‚Äúworked with teams.‚Äù Match your language to theirs.
* **Prioritize relevant experience.**¬†Your last job might have been your favorite, but if it‚Äôs¬†**not as relevant**, it doesn‚Äôt need to take up prime real estate at the top.
* **Cut what doesn‚Äôt apply.**¬†If it doesn‚Äôt help your case for this role, why is it there?

3.¬†**Write a Cover Letter That‚Äôs Actually About This Job**

* A generic cover letter that could be used for¬†**any job in any industry**¬†is worse than no cover letter at all.
* Address the¬†**specific organization**¬†and explain why your background aligns with¬†**this**¬†role.
* If you don‚Äôt meet every preferred qualification, use the letter to¬†**make a case for why your other skills compensate.**

**Why Some People Get Away With Generic Applications (And Why You Won‚Äôt)**

If you‚Äôve been getting jobs with a generic resume and cover letter, it‚Äôs probably because:

* The job¬†**wasn‚Äôt that competitive**, and they just needed someone who met the minimums.
* Your network got you through the door, and¬†**the resume didn‚Äôt matter as much. This happens more than we believe. I've had countless positions because of my network.**
* The company was desperate to fill the role, and you were available.

That won‚Äôt work when:

* The job is highly competitive, and¬†**dozens of other applicants**¬†are explicitly aligning their experience with the job description.
* The search committee is¬†**scoring**¬†applications against specific criteria, and your generic materials don‚Äôt hit the right points.
* You‚Äôre going after a¬†**higher-level role**¬†where strategic experience matters more than just ‚Äúhaving done the job before.‚Äù

**Bottom Line: Do You Want the Job or Not?**

Search committees aren‚Äôt sitting around playing detective, trying to figure out if you¬†*might*¬†be qualified. Often times, they are helping with a hiring process in addition to their primary responsibilities (at least in public organizations and non-profits). They‚Äôre looking for applications that¬†**clearly match**¬†what they need. If yours doesn‚Äôt, they move on. If they have to work to see how you might match, they move on.

So before you submit another generic resume, ask yourself:¬†**Do I actually want this job, or do I just want to throw my hat in the ring and hope for the best?**

Take home lesson: the people who¬†**land interviews and offers**¬†aren‚Äôt just hoping‚Äîthey‚Äôre making it¬†*impossible*¬†for the hiring committee to ignore them.

1j2k4v4,Is it insane to leave a job without another one lined up?,"I'm looking for honest feedback. 

I've been working at a tech company for the last 8 years. I worked my way up from a contract employee making less than the Customer Service Associates to a Site Admin role to a Coordinator role to a Program Manager role and in 2024 was promoted to Senior PM. 

This environment/job is not a good fit for me. I started out as a naive people pleaser with poor boundaries and that combined with my ADHD -- I burned out. I think I'm still recovering, but the company is doing everything to get people to leave to avoid layoffs. 5 day RTO (which is between 1-3 hours each way for me), hiring freeze/no backfills so people take on multiple jobs, pushing for people to do more with less but faster and at a higher bar, and there's even talk of pay decreases for non-top tier performers. On top of that, my team has a decent chance of being folded because we can't really prove our value and its made the environment a stressful pressure cooker. It's taking a toll on my mental health and well being. 

I've been looking at jobs and I know the job market is tough right now. Every remote job has like 5-6k applicants, but honestly...I need a break. A real break. My partner put me under their health insurance and we crunched the numbers so I have enough saved to be out of work or work part-time or take a pay cut if needed for a year, but I'm not sure if that's too rash/foolish. 

So here are the options: 

1. Stay 3 months to save more, apply for jobs rigorously and cash out final stock RSUs and then resign. 

2. Stay 3 months to save more, apply for jobs rigorously and cash out final stock RSUs and then take a leave of absence. 

3. Stay until I have a job offer or the team gets canned (whichever comes first). ",isingtoomuch,1,1.0,0,1741012883,2025-03-03 14:41:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j2k4v4/is_it_insane_to_leave_a_job_without_another_one/,3,2025

1j2jod1,My manager keeps gaslighting me.,"Hi so I've been working at this job for almost a year and this particular manager will say something and then we agree on it and then they will act as if they never said it and place the blame on me. 

For example: Just recently this manager told me that I was off on a specific day and told me that they would send the new schedule to me that specific day they gave me off so I would know when to come in for the rest of the week. Awesome, I agreed. Then that specific day comes and I'm waking up to multiple calls from that manager and of course I did not answer because it's my off day and at that moment I was busy. I receive a text that says, ""Hey (my name) remember you said you were supposed to come in today and be off _____ and _____"". And of course I don't remember that because they NEVER communicated that to me. I don't mind when they change the schedule but I don't like the gaslighting. If the manager wanted me to come in on the day they gave me off instead and take the other days for off days, they should have communicated that to me right? 

Another example: This manager made a mistake and I discovered their mistake and there was no way to fix it at that moment so I decided to wait to let them know. Whenever they came in I communicated it to them and they asked me did I fix it, I explained no and why I couldn't fix it and they told me ""That's where you messed up"" basically placing the blame on me even though they are the one who made the mistake in the first place. 

They're also always reading the system wrong and it seems like they blame me for mistakes that OTHER employees make and it's odd. I'm thinking that recording all of our future conversations is the best bet so if we have a verbal agreement on something they can't act as if it never happened. I don't know if that's legal but I don't know how else to deal with this.

1j2frbk,What should I reply to my boss?,"Hi everyone,

Just for context, I resigned a week ago. I have a 6 month notice period, which usually becomes garden leave. My boss has instead decided I need to work 3 months of it. He hasn‚Äôt given me any projects or goals I can hit to shorten it. He has given me no projects at all. It feels like they‚Äôre doing this just to ‚Äúget their money‚Äôs worth‚Äù.

Anyway, the whole reason why I quit is also because I spent a year building a model that my superior immediately rejected and said they would build their own. I never had a chance to improve, had no feedback, etc. I was told to help them build their own model, but they have been extremely secretive since (I have never seen the file). I have been sending the results of my model monthly while they are still building another model, but around 1.5 months ago, they said they would send their own results.

I don‚Äôt want to step on any toes, so I didn‚Äôt send mine for January. My superior also didn‚Äôt send theirs (even though they said they would). No complaints. I have since quit and didn‚Äôt send my results again for February. 

I just got an email from our boss asking for commentary and my forecast numbers, how it‚Äôs important they receive it before a certain date etc. I‚Äôm sorry but 1) I resigned and you‚Äôre not shortening my notice period, why should I do anything more than the bare minimum? and 2) My superior said their model was ready! I thought we were not using my model anymore??

I would love some advice.

I work in higher education admin, been here for 9 years. However, due to a huge restructure 70% of admin roles are being cut, and nearly everyone is at risk of redundancy. They have consolidated 4/5 roles into one and those jobs will be incredibly difficult (from just knowing a tiny part of it!)

My area has been absorbed into a more general 'student helpdesk' - so I am at a disadvantage to less specialised admin colleagues, who have more experience in general areas and know more about undergrad programmes.

I have been offered voluntary redundancy, or to take the chance with the tiny number of new roles set up.

If I went for the new roles, and didn't get one, I would stand to lose about 10k (voluntary redundancy vs compulsory)

Even when I do, I‚Äôm not interested in editing it. It takes me forever to find footage I actually enjoy working on but I never do.

1j2e7k9,Workplace trouble,"Workplace culture

I‚Äôm curious what your thoughts are on this since I‚Äôve started here at a new job and company  I notice I‚Äôm ignored often and not included on lunch breaks for e.g if my department goes on lunch they purposely don‚Äôt sit with me or ask me to join. There‚Äôs x2 lunch areas (inside and out) , I‚Äôve noticed whenever I sit inside they go out and vice versa. Today I decided to sit outside where they normally sit ; they walked past me without any acknowledgment and sat somewhere else

I‚Äôm the newest member to join the team although I don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation- I have a feeling they don‚Äôt like me or I might‚Äôve said something that offended them. They don‚Äôt even look at me or acknowledge me let alone say hello in the mornings despite me saying ‚Äògood morning first‚Äô I‚Äôm often ignored

It seems like there is also favouritism going on ; the girl that started before me has been here for 3 months and told me she was signed off almost immediately after training , she knew people here from university already apparently she had completed training and they signed her off immediately. - I on the other hand have also completed training and was ready to be signed off however the trainer reported to our manager that I seemed overwhelmed (without even consulting me) and told me that once I seem confident enough that they‚Äôre happy to then sign me off. 

As soon as I was asked about my previous work experience and what degree I have (I don‚Äôt have one ) that there was a shift in the attitude towards me. I don‚Äôt know why they are being so blatantly exclusive without giving any indication as to what I‚Äôve done wrong. I want to ask although I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone or make the situation worse, I also suffer from very severe social anxiety.. sitting alone and looking like a reject every day is not helping with that . I‚Äôve gone out on a limb and tried to be friendly and approachable but it doesn‚Äôt seem like enough

1j2brx2,My job put me on a mandatory LoA.,"Only, they used ADA. I never requested a leave. Much less a leaving concerning ADA.

I recently had a very scary medical experience that put me in the hospital and now need to have MRI/CT/EEG Scans, etc.
Due to this incident, I am unable to bend or lift for long periods of time due to the immense pain that I am in. 
When I asked my manager for help carrying heavy items, they responded that was no problem and to let them know if I need any help. (This is in writing.) She then went to HR notifying that I asked for help and was told that since my manager agreed to it, I would still need a doctor's note for accommodations and that this would need to be reviewed by management, but that since the manager agreed I should be ok. Not.

HR then called me after hours notifying they were putting me on a LoA.

I never asked for a LoA.

I was told that my benefits lead would be calling me. I never got a call. I did get an email saying I was not approved for FMLA but was approved for an ADA leave and that I had requested it in the ADA paperwork. I never requested a leave. I brought in a medical doctors note saying that I would not be able to lift past 15lbs and cannot be off the floor 3ft, but never requested or signed anything requesting a leave. I find it very pecularior they were able to get these accomodations when I have not been at this company a year, but more angry that they lied on the paperwork saying I requested it.

1j29ctl,Where do I go from here?,"Hi so this will be a complicated one. I M22 am having a bit of a career crisis. I  did retail for a while but burned out through two jobs in one year, mostly due to stress.

I am pretty medically compromised, I have Shunts in my head, active epilepsy, and also ASD. This means that anything driving is never happening (a lot of jobs seem to tack ""DRIVING PREFFERED!"". I also had 35 surgeries which has caused brain damage that has affected my memory, I still function though and talk and act ""normal"". I feel all my old employers never saw the pure chaos in my brain and just thought I was a quirky guy who was a big forgetful. 

I recently moved up north with my partner, and I honestly don't know what to do for jobs..I am thinking of taking a standard retail job? It didn't end well last time, but is there any alternative? My coordination isn't great either which is a common side effect of my disorder (the one I need 2 Shunts for). I can't drive, is there anything simple or freelance I can do to make a living? 

I do qualify for state benefits to which I have used for a month, which would actually (barely) cover me going forward. I don't want that though, I want to work. I just feel I have a lot of barriers and I feel like ASD makes it fairly tricky anyway, but add in no driving, poor coordination, and memory problems it just kind of makes life a little rough. I haven't had the best luck in interviews either yet so far, and I promise I haven't gone into ""this"" in any of them. I just try and act friendly and smile.

I rarely disclose my disability into a fee weeks after a job offer, maybe that is the problem? Or should I just take state benefits? I don't know I feel bad and like a leech if I do that.

I heard they were an 'MLM' company, however the sources on the internet says they are not. They were also rated A+ on BBB. So I was wondering what is up with the hate if it seems like a good place to kickstart your career?",Asleep-Box-1923,0,0.33000001311302185,7,1740964831,2025-03-03 01:20:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j270ex/thinking_about_starting_my_financial_career_with/,3,2025
1j26zcq,"I quit my job, but my former employer says I was fired after two weeks of not showing up to work.","
I was the assistant manager for a small retail store. My boss always reprimanded me for not focusing on customer service, despite my sales performance meeting or exceeding goals. 

One morning I opened the store alone, and in the first hour we exceeded sales targets by 30%. My boss arrived at the start of the first hour, and immediately pulled me into the back for a reprimand. I had assigned an associate to restock product to the sales floor, when I should have assigned him to stand by the door and greet customers. This is why our sales were down, I was told. She went on to tell me that when she arrived, she had seen me writing something down instead of helping customers (we are required to keep track of our KPIs by the hour by writing them down on Daily Agenda sheet.) She told me she hated scheduling me to work by myself, because she had zero confidence in me as a manager-on-duty. 

Again, we had sold 30% more than our stretch goal for the day. 

So then I quit my job as her assistant manager, then and there, without giving the standard two-weeks‚Äô notice. I told her I was done with her, and done with the job. I said I didn‚Äôt want to work for her. I said she was clearly wrong based on the numbers, and that I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate being reprimanded for things I could prove on paper weren‚Äôt happening. 

I also told her she could go fuck herself. 

And then I pulled my belongings out of my locker and left the store, less than two hours after the start of my shift. I did not return. I did not call or text or send an email. No one, not my former boss or the district manager, or HR, attempted to contact me. 

I received my final pay on the next scheduled payday, by direct deposit. The paystub shows my final day worked as six days before. 

I‚Äôm in California. If you quit without notice, they have three days to give you your final pay. 

My former employer considers someone to have voluntarily resigned after missing the third consecutive scheduled shift (no-call, no-shows.) 

So either I quit, and they paid me three days late, or else I just stopped showing up to work, and they accepted my resignation on the third day, paid me three days later, which means they paid me on time. 

HOWEVER:

First, I say I quit. 

Secondly, I got a letter from the company saying that I was terminated TWO WEEKS LATER after my last day, and a week after my final pay was deposited into my bank account. 

I say this is clearly my former employer pretending they didn‚Äôt know I had quit. They are saying I was fired a full week after my my last pay was 
direct deposited, because any final paycheck should be issued as a live check. 

So they‚Äôre saying they gave me two weeks to show up to work, so that I could be ‚Äúfired‚Äù without earning any wages for the period. 

But in fact, I quit. How do I prove that I quit verbally? How do I prove that I voluntarily resigned, and that I didn‚Äôt just do a no-call, no-show for two weeks?",stakeburnscatter,151,0.8799999952316284,84,1740964738,2025-03-03 01:18:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j26zcq/i_quit_my_job_but_my_former_employer_says_i_was/,3,2025
1j26nrr,Which Path Will You Choose?,"Picture yourself at a grand crossroads, where paths in every direction offer vistas of potential futures. Each path represents different career paths because they bring separate obstacles alongside distinctive benefits. What criteria do you use to decide your professional future direction? How does one direct their path after choosing a destination?

My career navigation began from a location that felt uncertain to me then. In my first year out of school, I faced my life's crossroads while holding dreams but facing self-doubt. I determined a professional direction by choosing the pathway that seemed most captivating at that moment. Professional success depends more heavily on adaptability than any particular technical expertise because one must dynamically shift between walking, running and changing paths completely.

No experience during the early stages proves unproductive. Regardless of their apparent unimportance, all my previous positions formed a collection of abilities and knowledge that shaped my professional identity. Every obstacle I encountered at work was educational, even though I originally saw them as mere obstacles.

The path demonstrated obstacles that made the journey less than consistent. An opaque fog embraced the path, making the upcoming direction hard to discern. Reaching out to others became essential at these particular moments. Networking beyond establishing professional relationships means creating platforms of mutual support that connect mentors to peers to mentees who provide assistance no matter what the circumstances.

So, what's your story? Engaged in your professional development, you now face choices about your career trajectory. Your life goals keep you going despite being challenged by fears about their achievement. You find yourself either at a critical decision point or have walked along several paths that led to unpredictable destinations.

Let's share these stories. Every professional with any work history is worth sharing because their journey matters. Which methods do you use when responding to changes during crucial decision moments? Please share the guidance you would give new professionals taking their first steps in pursuing their careers.

1j25wg3,Should I seek my desired career or grow at my current employer?,"Hello everyone, 

This is my first time posting here so I apologize if I make a mistake. 

On the tail end of 2023 I obtained a bachelor's in information technology and have been looking for over a year for a new job. Between the sparse interviews on constant denials I feel I am at a crossroads amongst an ever growing mountain of self doubt in my education and abilities. 

Management opportunities are opening up at my currently employer who've I've been a part of already for 15 years. The pay is 15k-20kmore than what I make now but I feel that should I take this leap I will be even more hesitant to leave. Let alone the horror stories I've heard from those that do pursue management in a supply chain field. 

I've been doing what I can with what time I have to continue to look around and network but Im growing more and more unsatisfied with what I am accomplishing both in and outside of work. Additionally the conversation of children has come up with my SO. I want to be the best provider I can but I rather not be completely miserable at my job. 

While this is a long shot I was hoping for some external unbiased advice. 

If more details is needed ide be happy to give more. 

TLDR: I have a degree in IT but I am hesitant to take a role in supply chain management. As it would become even harder to pursue my desired career.But the financial gains could make it worth it but the stress is an unknown.

Bounced around a few shops within first 2 years some from end of season and lack of work to being promised fake promotions( offered verbal promotion but never received it and they back tracked on it). So after finding this company I‚Äôm almost here for a full year. I have about 2.5 years of infield experience by the way. Recently they fired our manager who was a hvac tech who was about training his guys and promoting growth from within to always having our backs. The company I work for is trying to turn our department around go towards the private equity or selling the division route like many companies have done in our area. Our new manager comes from that world and is a plumber who knows absolutely nothing about this trade. Most of the managers beneath him and my coworkers are unhappy with his changes. He has started brining in greener techs and slowly has been putting people on PIPs, complain to us on the phone for either following industry standard task or asking for assistance on jobs that may require two guys or a smaller tech labeling them as a waste of resources. As one tech leaves two greener(newbies) techs start. Mind you this manager can‚Äôt tell the difference between equipment types or safety recommendations. Recently I was placed on pip and I know you can graduate from it but also know it can go down hill as well. I have been applying and I have received offers or high interest from some companies and going through the next few steps. I do have reluctance to leave due to the start of my career, aside from this shit manager the company itself is very good, a recognizable brand that people trust, and I actually enjoy my coworkers. Honestly I just don‚Äôt want to be known as the guy who jumps ship, I don‚Äôt want to be out of a job, but I also do want to be pushed out either due to the pip.

I have experience in other facets of Construction prior and before that spent time working BoH in & out of Kitchens & taking odd second jobs such as Auditing and Data Entry & Analysis.

I've invested alot of my personal time learning about my trade and money back into my trade to have all the tools I need which is VERY uncommon for guys in my trade. I take my time at work incredibly seriously, and it's kept me employed so far. Recently I started contracting on my own, and I've been hoping around a little bit based of my dignity/pride and not letting people walk all over me.

I recently left one of the higher end companies in my city to go work for a company who has a bit of a bad rep in my industry. However they've treated me very well and been super accommodating to me.

I took a 1 year long 1-1 coaching from J and she helped me a lot. This was 2021-2022. Then In end of 2022, I ended up finding a great job, which happened to be the same industry my mentor was in. Anyways there were some times when J would say ""you should help me when you learn some stuff from K"" (k was my boss from new job) and ""but don't tell K that's your plan haha"". She's also forwarded me J's newsletter and basically wanted to be featured in J's services and just times where I felt uncomfortable as if I needed to introduce my mentor and bring her business to my boss and like help out my mentor.

Anyways last November I quit my job and mentor doesn't know. She texted me during that time asking for advice and if I heard anything in the business world as things are slowing down and that she misses me. I didn't reply, I was stressed out from toxic job, family and health issues. She texted me next two months with ""hey how you are"" ""hi are you doing well"" then I finally was gonna text and just tell her things are rough rn and I need time. But then she messaged ""we need to speak"" and I froze. The day after she called and I didn't pick up.

I don't know. Is this how a mentor supposed to be? I feel like she just wants my help because o who l used to work for. Am I over reacting?

1j216of,Need advice on manager misconduct,"Throwaway.  I'm a nurse with 38 years of experience, however, the last 4 years I've been an assistant nurse manager on a unit in a federal facility. Unfortunately we get patients who are significant placement problems and we  hold them for months if not years, waiting for suitable placement. 
     This is where the problem comes in. We have a patient who has been with us for 6 months, awaiting placement. He's rude, abusive and hates brown people. He's uncooperative and then just in general, not a good person. The nurses are getting exhausted dealing with his abuse. Recently manager took a week off, and the nurses approached me about his behavior.  I have done everything that I can including going into his room and shutting him down on multiple occasions, but he relapses back into the same behavior.

In the last month we have had to receive no less than two patients from other units where the patients were behavior problems and could no longer be managed on their floor.  So I asked the head nurse of my service if we could arranged transfer him off our floor to give our nurses a break. 

Well manager came back and when I updated her on my plan for the patient she became rapidly intensely angry, saying that we don't do that on this floor. She immediately charged out into the nurse's station, called a quick meeting and berated the nurses, telling them that if they didn't like working there they could leave. And if they're not grateful for that, then there are plenty of other hospitals in the city. 

I was flabbergasted. I only have a bachelor's degree in nursing, but I'm married to a man who spent 40 years in corporate America, and has his Masters in business.  To me, this is unforgivable for him, for a manager to communicate to their staff that she values them so little that she would rather they leave than try to assist them. The next day,she wanted to have a conversation with me about it.  Unfortunately for her, this is something I feel incredibly strongly about, and I am not willing to give on this point. The conversation was short, sharp and ended with me telling her that we have a difference in management philosophies and I'm leaving. I grabbed my stuff and went home for the afternoon.

I detailed this episode to the head nurse, and of course she equivocated, saying she couldn't make any suggestions or provide any guidance until she heard my manager's side of the story. I finally understood that she was unwilling to get involved, so I told her I would address this directly with the manager myself. 

Here's where I need a little help. I've been doing some internet digging, looking for articles regarding this type of treatment and what it communicates to employees. I'm having difficulty finding what I'm looking for. Does anyone have any references or papers they can point me? 
Or even just some strong talking points I can  use  to help her understand just how damaging this behavior is. ",ScreenNaive6318,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1740948915,2025-03-02 20:55:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j216of/need_advice_on_manager_misconduct/,3,2025

1j1yvaw,"Should I accept offer from my boss, and take more responsibility on mysel? (That i am maybe able to handle)?","Hello,

I am a 19 (almost 20) year-old male from Slovakia.

I work at a small company (under 15 employees) as a technical manager. My job is to order parts for production, manage the warehouse, order whole products (we work in the construction segment), work with AutoCAD, and basically handle everything related to managing and completing our orders.

Recently, my coworker left the company to work in Germany.
He worked with the CNC machine.

This is his last week, and my boss knows that no one else is able to work with that CNC machine.
Since I‚Äôm young, my boss sees me as a ""young talent"" ‚Äî he picked me for that about a year ago (I‚Äôve been working here for one year, the longest I‚Äôve ever worked anywhere).
Now, he keeps mentioning the CNC work to me more and more.

To be honest, I don‚Äôt like that type of work ‚Äî it‚Äôs repetitive.
You make the program, put the profile in, start the milling, take it out, and repeat.

My boss claims that it‚Äôs possible to handle both my current job and the CNC work at the same time, but me and my coworker disagree ‚Äî we think it‚Äôs too much.

Now I‚Äôm thinking about offering to try doing both ‚Äî my regular job and the CNC work.
I want to tell him that I‚Äôll try to learn the CNC, but that he should still actively look for someone new to fill the CNC position.

I‚Äôm willing to do it because someone has to, and I‚Äôm probably the best candidate right now.

At first, I wouldn‚Äôt ask for a raise.
But if everything goes well, I would ask for my salary plus half of the salary of the coworker who left.

I also need to say ‚Äî CNC work will definitely take more of my time, and it will make it harder to get my regular work done on time.

On top of that, I‚Äôm also running my own startup, so this adds even more pressure.

Now my question is: 

Should I try to take on more responsibility? 
How should I phrase it to my boss? 
Is it too much? 
And how about pay? ",Mata11TV,1,1.0,5,1740943075,2025-03-02 19:17:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1yvaw/should_i_accept_offer_from_my_boss_and_take_more/,3,2025
1j1ykhd,Health issues,"TLDR : (M23)  my health has led to a patchy resume. I got a bachelors in health and social care but I'm unsure of where to go. I've just had to stop teacher training due to health complications and I don't know what to do.

Context:
Hi all, I'll try to keep the story as brief as I can. I'm (M23) in the UK and I've had a rough few years. I came from poverty and growing up in a church as I've had extremely hostile family member around me.

I got into university and got a job working in different charities shops and supply teaching. I finally finished my degree and got into care and that's when my health took a serious decline. A few years ago I got into a motorbike accident and I've not fully recovered from it. Occasionally I get flare ups in my back which cause excruciating pain and require me to walk on a cane sometimes. I also have a history of getting pneumonia twice and nearly a 3rd time for a stubborn chest infection. 

I've tried going into a masters and tried teacher training but I've not been able to stick it out for them because of my failing health. I've tried my absolute hardest but it feels like my health is crushing me. I'm married and my wife is doing her best to help me out but I don't know what to do here. 

I'm a published author and I've got into art galleries before but I'm scared I won't be able to get into a job because of my employment stints. I feel like a complete failure and I feel like this is something that I can't get over without help. 

I'm taking proactive steps to try and help myself. I'm applying to 5 jobs a day and I'm trying to organise a career coaching session.

Some advice would be helpful.

1j1yh1y,Need Career Advice ‚Äì Which Job Offer Makes More Sense?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm currently deciding between two job offers in the finance industry and would love some outside perspectives. Each role has its own advantages, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what makes the most sense for my career long-term.

# About Me:

* 10 years of experience in finance
* Currently an assistant manager and feel 70-85% confident in stepping into a full manager role at my current company
* Uncertain about how well I‚Äôd transition directly into a manager role at a new company ‚Äì not sure if I‚Äôd be expected to perform at 100% from day one or if there‚Äôs a transition period
* Both jobs are in the same city, so location itself isn‚Äôt an issue
* Not sure yet if I prefer long-term stability or a faster growth track
* Open to relocating in a few years after gaining more experience

# The Two Offers:

**Option 1 ‚Äì Assistant Role (Path to Higher Leadership)**

* Starting Salary: $80K
* Signing Bonus: $10K
* Guaranteed Year-End Bonus: $10K (with potential for more)
* Total Year 1 Earnings: $100K
* Career Path: Position is expected to transition into a higher leadership role, but exact timing and salary progression beyond the first year are unknown.

Pros:

* Higher total compensation in Year 1
* Structured training and development across multiple locations before moving up
* More flexibility for internal moves or even relocation later

Cons:

* Not in a leadership role right away ‚Äì need to go through a training period
* Promotion timeline isn‚Äôt guaranteed ‚Äì could take longer than expected
* Not sure where I‚Äôll be placed into a management role ‚Äì could be 20 minutes from home or up to 1.5 hours away

**Option 2 ‚Äì Leadership Role (Immediate Responsibility)**

* Starting Salary: $96K
* Signing Bonus: $2K
* Total Year 1 Earnings: $98K+ (depending on bonus structure)
* Career Path: Already in a leadership position, but not sure about long-term salary progression.

Pros:

* Immediate leadership role ‚Äì no waiting for promotion
* Higher base salary from day one
* More stability and job security from day one
* Location is set ‚Äì commute would be 15-20 minutes from home

Cons:

* Fewer opportunities to transition out of this role later
* Higher workload and pressure from the start
* Uncertainty around how well I‚Äôd transition into this new system, culture, and expectations

# What I‚Äôm Trying to Figure Out:

* Does it make more sense to take Option 1 for the higher total comp and long-term flexibility, even though it starts at a lower level?
* Or is it better to take Option 2 for the immediate leadership and stability, even though the career path beyond that is less clear?
* For those who have moved into a leadership role at a new company, how much of a transition period is usually given?
* Would love to hear any insights or personal experiences ‚Äì thanks in advance!",OkIncome2856,1,1.0,0,1740942118,2025-03-02 19:01:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1yh1y/need_career_advice_which_job_offer_makes_more/,3,2025

1j1xaq9,The email I sent to my boss is this reasonable?,"Dear Bb, 

I hope you're doing well. I am writing to formally express some concerns and to request clarification regarding my current role and compensation.
           When I initially started, I was told that I would not be placed in a dangerous situation, but unfortunately, that has not been the case. I have taken on significant additional responsibilities, including but not limited to coming in early, staying late without prior notice, training staff on the computer systems, and working between two locations for a few months before receiving a pay adjustment. Additionally, I have been asked to work on my days off and/or alone at the Walnut Street location, even if only for a short amount of time, despite having made it clear that I am not comfortable working there alone due to safety concerns. I also want to address that I am currently not receiving compensation reflective of these added duties, which include performing tasks that would typically fall under a managerial role. To this end, I believe a pay adjustment is warranted. Specifically, I am asking for a pay increase to $19 per hour. Given the nature of the work and the additional responsibilities I have taken on, I believe this is a fair request. I also want to highlight some personal financial challenges I have been facing. Over the past year, I have worked multiple jobs and still struggled to make ends meet. I made under $20,000 last year, and with my rent increase, I will be paying $15,240 annually. (This also is the average price of rent in most areas) With my current monthly pay, which barely exceeds $2,000, it is incredibly difficult to cover basic living expenses such as food, gas, and other necessary costs. Furthermore, I am ineligible for government assistance, as my income is too high for programs like SNAP, yet I am not earning enough to support myself without constant financial strain. Additionally, I noticed that when William was hired in October, he started at $18 per hour, despite having no college degree or certifications. Given that I hold a degree and relevant certifications, I am concerned that my lower pay could be related to gender, or that I may be undervalued compared to other staff members. This, combined with the recent concerns regarding safety at the Walnut Street location, has made me re-evaluate my future with the company. I understand the challenges of retaining employees, and I do not take these concerns lightly. However, I believe that I should be fairly compensated for my contributions, especially given the risks I have been expected to take. If I am unable to receive a pay adjustment or if my concerns are not addressed in a timely manner, I may have to explore other opportunities. I look forward to discussing this further and hope we can reach a resolution that reflects my commitment to the company and the work I have been doing. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, Rebecca McCarty",Wolfbabe127,4,0.5699999928474426,76,1740939235,2025-03-02 18:13:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1xaq9/the_email_i_sent_to_my_boss_is_this_reasonable/,3,2025

I met with the hiring managers for feedback and i spoke to my own manager who told me she is hopeful something will come up in my department or at the company but said it would be wrong to suggest that I should rely solely on that and to keep my options open for my own good.

1j1wx44,Stuck Between Two Job Offers ‚Äì Take a Risk or Stay Put?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm looking for some advice on a tough career decision between my current job (Company A) and a new opportunity (Company B - Snapchat). Would love to hear your thoughts!

# Company A (Current Job):

* **Industry**: Digital content media house
* **Role**: Staff Writer
* **Pay**: $25/hr, full-time
* **Schedule**: 9-6 PM, hybrid (3 days in office, 2 days WFH)
* **Commute**: 5 min drive, can go home for lunch
* **Pros**:
   * Stable, full-time job
   * Just offered a management promotion starting April 1, expected 10-40% pay increase
   * I‚Äôm good at the job and have significantly boosted the platform‚Äôs success (\~100% growth in 10 months)
* **Cons**:
   * Unfulfilling work (mostly writing social media videos for kids ‚Äì not what I want to be doing long-term)
   * Startup culture means I‚Äôm doing a lot of tasks outside my role that I don‚Äôt enjoy or want experience in
   * Burnt out and not excited about the future here

# Company B (Snapchat):

* **Industry**: Social Media / Tech
* **Role**: Can‚Äôt say much, but it aligns with my future goals in social media, brand/CD/media management
* **Pay**: \~$1/hr less than Company A, **before** my upcoming promotion (which would further widen the pay gap)
* **Schedule**: In-office **5 days a week**
* **Commute**: 30 min drive in the morning, **1 hour+ drive home with traffic**
* **Contract Length**: **3 months** (with high probability of extension, but nothing guaranteed)
* **Pros**:
   * Much more aligned with my career aspirations in social media & digital branding
   * Huge resume boost (Snap Inc. name carries weight)
   * Potential stepping stone for better opportunities in the industry
* **Cons**:
   * Lower pay (compared to both my current rate and my upcoming raise)
   * Full-time, in-office schedule with a long commute
   * Only a 3-month contract ‚Äì no guarantee of stability after that

# My Dilemma:

I‚Äôm eager to gain new experience, build my portfolio, and push my career forward. Company A is comfortable but unfulfilling. Company B is exciting but comes with risks‚Äîlower pay, longer commute, and no job security beyond three months.

I **hypothesize** that even if the Snap contract only lasts 3 months, the brand recognition and experience will open up more doors for me in the future. However, I also don‚Äôt want to make the wrong move, take a pay cut, and end up jobless in a few months.

Would you take the leap, or stick with the safer but less exciting option?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.",KeyCobbler2904,3,1.0,7,1740938303,2025-03-02 17:58:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1wx44/stuck_between_two_job_offers_take_a_risk_or_stay/,3,2025
1j1wpxd,Switching to medical administration.,"I‚Äôm a 22-year-old female, and I only have my high school diploma (my grades are not the best). Also, English is not my first language, so sorry for any grammar mistakes. I mentioned in another post that I went to hair school, but I didn‚Äôt like it, and I‚Äôm considering dropping out; however, it will cost me $7K. I‚Äôm not interested in anything else‚Äîdoing hair was my last option, but it‚Äôs not for me (though it is an amazing career).
To give you some background on my life, I have worked in a lot of physically demanding jobs, and at the end of the day, I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to move. I would just lay down until the next day because of the exhaustion from standing for hours, lifting heavy stuff, and working in awkward positions. That‚Äôs one of the reasons hairstyling is not for me‚Äîit‚Äôs also very physically demanding, and there are a lot of awkward positions involved.
I‚Äôm not looking for a job that pays six figures or anything. I have a family supporting me, and I still live with them. Also, in my culture, my husband will be the one responsible for covering expenses. I‚Äôm not saying I want to depend on anyone‚ÄîI have worked since an early age and have always paid for my personal expenses. Now that I‚Äôm getting older, I‚Äôm more interested in feminine jobs that won‚Äôt make me sweat or destroy my body‚ÄîI‚Äôve had enough of that.
People around me are trying to convince me to continue hair school, saying that I will waste my money if I drop out. I know that I will be in debt and that paying it off will be difficult, but the school is so expensive. If I finish it, it will cost me $17K‚Äì$18K for something I don‚Äôt enjoy and that takes years to build up a good salary and clientele. I know I will give up before reaching that point.
I‚Äôm looking for a stable job that isn‚Äôt physically demanding, which is why I‚Äôm considering medical administration. I know a couple of women who work in this field, and they are doing well‚Äîthey always smell nice, are well-dressed, and don‚Äôt seem to have a lot of stress. I understand that some people hate sitting at a desk all day in front of a computer, but for me, that would be a blessing!
Sorry for the long paragraph, but I want to learn more about medical administration and whether it‚Äôs a good career choice for my situation. I know that every job has its challenges and that there is no such thing as a perfect dream job‚Äîit all depends on perspective and whether it‚Äôs a personal fit.
What are the pros and cons? How long does it take to study? How hard is it to study? And is it a feminine job that allows you to dress nicely without being physically demanding?‚Äù",yallijustgothere,1,1.0,0,1740937812,2025-03-02 17:50:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1wpxd/switching_to_medical_administration/,3,2025
1j1wakw,IT or Medical Field?,"Hi, I am 28 years old (M). I'm currently in sales for a wine and spirits company. Its a decent gig. About to hit two years in this job. So far, pay has been in the 60s (which is a combination of a small salary and the other big part is incentives). The work/life balance is great. Probably big reason why I stay here. However, the constant stress and pressure of hitting numbers every month is getting to my head too much. Plus incentives is not guaranteed and pay every month greatly varies because of incentives. Im also not the biggest people person either.  I wanted to try sales for a year or two to just gain experience. I potentional can make 100k with my sales job but thats a HUGE IF. If everything goes my way which 90% wont be able to. 60-80k is more likely. I am willing to give up the hours I work to find a more constant paychecks and not have to worry about pay/numbers like I do with this sales job. I am eyeing to move to IT as field tech/data tech to eventually, hopefully, move to a system/network admin. My employer has a Guild program that pays for an AAS cybersecurity program. Ill be able to earn the comptia A+, sec+ and net+. However, I've constantly seen how people say it is very hard to break into IT. Plus, the lay offs that I constant see makes me worried. I know someone who went to a bootcamp for programming and hasn't found a job in IT. 

  
My other option I am considering is in the hospital. I've always thought about working in that field. More so, Sterile Processing tech. I saw the pay is pretty decent and wouldn't mind to travel for a bit if I am able to find a job for that. I also feel like it might be easier to find a job in this field. It would be cool to move up from that tech spot as well if possible. I was going to go to either Houston Community College, lone star or san jacinto and I will pay to get the sterile processing certificate on my own.

  
I do want to try to match my current pay (60k yearly) quickly. Im willing to take a pay cut for like a year. More so, I want to be in the 70 or 80s yearly. Eventually, I do want to make close to 100k which I know everyone does. Just trying to find a realistic path to it.

  
I can also make my sales job work with being part time sterile processing tech as ive seen a few part time postings for it.



Any advice or opinions on either careers would be great. Hearing other people's experiences would be great.

1j1uuz2,How can I transition from the financial to the entertainment industry?,"Hey, I‚Äôm facing a dilemma.

I am a third year business administration student from France. I have a concentration in finance.

All my past internships and summer jobs have all been in the banking/ financial industry. I‚Äôve worked in banks, insurance companies that are widely known as well as the Volvo group. But as I‚Äôm reaching my final year of bachelor and I HAVE to get an internship this summer in order to graduate (it is a mandatory credit-bearing internship), I‚Äôm slowly realising that finance and banking are not things I‚Äôm interested in or ever was. Matter of fact, I find it boring (not to offend anyone passionate by these fields). I just followed the crowd. Everyone around me was talking about M&A and Private Equity and I just followed them but now I‚Äôm realising that what I really want is to work in the tech and entertainment industries. 

I have a strong passion for A&R and project management and I‚Äôve cold emailed people in big entertainment companies such as Sony, UMG for a summer internship and so far all the responses have been‚Ä¶ Nonexistent to say the least. (But hey these are the rules of the game, you can‚Äôt cold email, offer to work for them and expect a response lol) 

I have no experience working in the music industry (except being a songwriter for a band for a couple of months), I know no one working in this industry, all my LinkedIn invites are either ignored or refused. But I have a few experiences in project management in creative field such as overseeing a commercial video shoot(budgeting, casting actors, scouting locations, marketing), overseeing an ad campaign, developing start-up designs but I haven‚Äôt included them in my resume, I simply put them in the leadership section because they weren‚Äôt professional experiences more like volunteering and the companies weren‚Äôt well known unlike the banks I‚Äôve worked in.

I think the main reason I get rejections is because not only this industry is closed off to outsiders but also because my profile is so finance-centred. 

I really want to work in the music industry or film but I don‚Äôt know how to go about it and make this transition. Does anyone have some ideas or advice?

1j1ttgh,"Have no clue what route to go, dont wanna make a everlasting mistake","Hi everyone!

I am having a hard time with picking a career choice that will work out the best in all aspects. Back story: I have anxiety including social (though the social is getting alot better), OCD, anger management and some depression. It makes the social interactions at work hard, in regards to anger, and some jobs hard for me in terms of getting overwhelmed. I have a hard time keeping a job longer than around 6 months because of how overwhelmed with anger I get. Usually it comes from working with people who act horribly and project onto others and bad managers who dont do their job and make my job harder. I have worked with really great people in the past, but it‚Äôs usually a handful that make me angry. Everyone keeps saying I will experience this no matter which job I choose. I just cant work with people who do this and it ruins everything for me. I know Im the common denominator in all of this, so to some extent I need to pick a career that I will last in.

 In terms of the anxiety and anger I have been seeing a therapist to work on it, and he says its not my fault that every job has had all these bad interaction and that I just work shitty jobs (Barista, cook, retail). Though unfortunately because I dont have a job right now I am not seeing him. 

I was in school to get culinary degree but decided to get a bachelor in Communications just in case things didnt work out with culinary. Now I am a senior, and I need to pick a career path. My two choices would be to: 1. find some way to work with food (food magazine) or 2. Work in academia. I had a conversation with my professor on going to grad school and I fully understand all the downsides to pursuing it. I feel peaceful with the idea of pursuing this and that this is the most logical choice, but I feel passionate about culinary. 

The phd lets me work independently without stress from people around me, yet it will be stressful in itself. I think I have learned enough coping mechanisms to deal with school anxiety and stress where I know I can get over it. 

In terms of culinary, working with others who create workplace drama angers me to the point of a depressive episode . I need to work alone or with a pre-chosen group of people who I know I see eye to eye with. The last option is lowkey unrealistic, which is why I am not so sure of getting into culinary.

I have thought about creating a blog and expressing my culinary passions through there, while also pursuing graduate school? Or even pursuing working for media companies that focus on food?

Im honestly not sure, and just want to know how much I should consider my emotional needs over type of work. Thank you for your responses and time (: Means alot ",Uhhhhhhhello1,1,1.0,0,1740930566,2025-03-02 15:49:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1ttgh/have_no_clue_what_route_to_go_dont_wanna_make_a/,3,2025

1j1sade,Should I agree to be a leader of this organization?,"Should I agree to be a leader of this organization?


I live in the US. A club started in my town co-hosted by a township agency. They want to break away to become a non-profit, and I have the opportunity to be a board member. I‚Äôve hopped on, but it‚Äôs not a non-profit yet. 

My understanding is that they say so long as we are joined with the agency, we are covered liability-wise. But if we break away before becoming incorporated as a non-profit, we are only covered for events held at their building with them, not any on our own. 

For various technical, donation collection, and other reasons, the group is committed to breaking off prior to becoming a non-profit. During this transition period, I‚Äôm concerned that if someone holds something outside of the agency and there is a lawsuit, I could be liable with the other leaders even if I am not present at the event. Especially if the club name and money from donations was used. 

What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to lose this opportunity, but I don‚Äôt want to liable while the group is not connected to an organization with its own liability.

1j1r3bd,Just got promoted‚Ä¶but disappointed in no title change. Am I overthinking this?,"TL;DR: I got a promotion, highest performance rating, great bonus/equity, but not the Manager title I thought I was working toward. I‚Äôve been acting in a Manager-like role and was never told I wasn‚Äôt in line for it. My boss said I got great feedback, but I still didn‚Äôt get the title bump. Now she‚Äôs moving me under another manager on the data side to learn technical skills, which honestly feels like a demotion, but she assured me it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm taking the weekend to think about it. Did I misplay this, or is this just how corporate promotions work? Looking for advice!

So I just got a promotion and a 10% raise, which I appreciate, but I‚Äôm feeling a bit let down. Here‚Äôs the situation:

	‚Ä¢	I was offered my old boss‚Äôs role, which I assumed was a Manager title, but I took on a high-risk/high-reward AI project instead, thinking it had more long-term upside.

	‚Ä¢	Turns out, even if I had taken my old boss‚Äôs role, it would‚Äôve only been Supervisor, not Manager‚Äîwhich I was never explicitly told.

	‚Ä¢	I thought I was delaying, not giving up, my shot at Manager.

	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôve been essentially acting as a Manager, leading the AI initiative and taking on high-level responsibilities.

	‚Ä¢	My boss said I got great feedback in calibration meetings, but for some reason, I still didn‚Äôt get the title bump.

	‚Ä¢	I got the highest performance rating, a strong bonus, and equity, so on paper, I‚Äôm being told I did really well.

	‚Ä¢	I didn‚Äôt explicitly put in my self-review that I wanted Manager, but I told my boss many times that was my goal. She even mentioned she was surprised I didn‚Äôt include it in my review.

	‚Ä¢	After that, I sent her an email making my case for Manager, but it seems like that didn‚Äôt change anything.

	‚Ä¢	I would ask her from time to time if I was in line for Manager (or at least a promotion), and she never said no‚Äîso I assumed I was on track.

	‚Ä¢	I also found out that frequent grade jumps are rare, so now I‚Äôm worried about how long it‚Äôll take to get to Manager.

	‚Ä¢	Now, she‚Äôs moving me under another manager on the data side to learn more technical skills, which honestly feels like a demotion, even though she assured me it‚Äôs not. She told me to take the weekend to think about it.

I love my job and the AI work I‚Äôm doing, but I feel like something isn‚Äôt adding up. Either my expectations were off, or I wasn‚Äôt given the full picture.

For those who‚Äôve been in similar situations‚Äîis this just how corporate promotions work? Did I misplay this? How should I approach my next steps?

Would love different perspectives on this.",achilles369,0,0.33000001311302185,5,1740922891,2025-03-02 13:41:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1r3bd/just_got_promotedbut_disappointed_in_no_title/,3,2025

A 2024 analysis using O\*NET data, the online database for about 1,000 occupations, revealed a startling trend. 



White-collar professional jobs are more susceptible to be disrupted by AI compared to manual or outdoor occupations. 



This pushes back on the notion that high-paying roles requiring advanced education are immune to automation.



AI technologies, particularly generative AI, go beyond traditional automation by replicating and extending human cognitive functions. 



It creates content, processing large datasets, and aiding decision-making. The technology can potentially impact a wide range of jobs, including those requiring creativity and complex thinking.



Occupations in tech, finance, and law were up until now long considered safe. Now, these prestigious white-collar jobs are open to being disrupted. 



This rapid advancement is reshaping professional landscapes, leaving many white-collar workers anxious about their future.

Hi there, posting in her for a bit of advice as I've had mixed responses from friends and family and would really appreciate a bit of advice slash help.

For context I'm 23 and I live in the UK - I graduated with my degree in 2023.

I've been working some jobs and was fortunate to get an internship late last year towards my chosen career goal and was super useful and fun but the commute wasn't manageable as it was based in London, it was temp and the couldn't keep me after.

My industry has been facing a lot of uncertainty and lay offs etc with current developments and a lot seems uncertain, most of the jobs are also in the capital, and TBH I just really don't want to live there or move.

Since Christmas and this internship I've found a non job but I'm miserable and hate it, it's in a super market cafe not sure if I'm earning enough money.

when looking for other jobs from this I found something that isn't hugely dissimilar to my career path.

it's local to where I am not based in the city
I'm definitely a candidate with experience and translatable skills
it's not direct but could still be interesting etc
The dilemma:

Me and my partner have an extended trip planned due to a family wedding in Australia, i planned to do 6 weeks in SE ASIA followed by 4 weeks in Aus for the wedding, starting from Sept - Mid - Nov (2 and a half months).

This is 6 months in advance , I haven't been offered interview yet but I just want to know whether I should tell them, not tell them, what do I do here?

1j1n6sc,Need advice on career selection,"Hi all. I am currently a junior math major with ~1.5 years left on my college journey. Ever since I have started this major I have been facing the dilemma of pursuing a career in academia or moving to a field that requires advanced mathematical knowledge and application skills such as software development, statistics,data analytics and perhaps math education.I have a big project on LiDAR technologies where I am trying to integrate rough set theory,quantum detection and TDA into this technology alongside with the other project I have that is to simply build an archive consisting of advanced math subjects to further educate people(this falls into the education category,sort of like tutoring). I also stand the chance to land a job in a government institution(national statistics institution of my country) if I do well on the entry exam which has nothing to do with statistics whatsoever(it's a general employment exam). This semester being the last serious semester due to the fact that the faculty made it easier for students to graduate on their last year by making the courses on senior year super easy I believe I can handle everything I have listed so far. I have interest in all of these fields however I am currently considering academia to be a bit of a luxury since I have two more younger brothers and a set of parents currently considering retirement.

1j1mnve,Wondering about resume gaps,"In 2023 the industry that I had established myself in for 6 years collapsed and is still no longer in working condition. Because I was left to basically switch careers overnight, and the job market where I live is in shambles, it took me nearly a year to find even a part-time job. Because I'm disabled I do find it difficult to stay in one workplace for long, depending on what my role is (a lot of movement and juggling physical tasks, like retail and fast food/server roles), and the only jobs I'm good at (desk jobs that focus on problem-solving) are not willing to accommodate my university schedule while I pursue my career switch. My LinkedIn looks pretty bad right now as far as consistency and I'm not sure how to make it look presentable and in a way that will make people want to reach out to me when I apply for their jobs. 

What I have listed right now (summarized): 6-year career with details about moving up the ladder and management experience; 3-month part-time job (started 8 months later) where I was let go because the place was engaging in wage theft and I was discovered giving my co-workers advice on how to get their money; 3-month insurance job (started 3 months later) that told me to resign because I started school on a part-time schedule and they didn't want to accommodate the slight shift in hours because of ""policy"", my current part-time job (started 4 months later). I also have everything I did before my career but it's a bit spotty as well.

1j1m3ej,"31, no documented 'real' job, with mental health history. Needing help ASAP. (UK)","I'm sure some might think this is a joke, and I wish it was, but it's not.

Hi everyone. I need help. Badly. Feel free to be as harsh as you feel is needed.

Through a combination of untreated mental health issues (depression and social anxiety,) having Asperger's reducing my confidence/self esteem and admittedly comfort from some family inheritance, I've left myself in a horrible position for the better period of 15+ years.

Since leaving school, my only jobs have been intermittent work with family and family friends (who are all sole traders.) Unfortunately because of them having to rightly concentrate on their own wage, these jobs aren't sustainable for full time employment and/or growth. The work from family, which I am grateful for, honestly have been more like charity thrown my way to keep me busy while I've been 'comfortable.'

Recently, I've come a long way in my MH issues after a long battle, but I still feel insecure in myself in general due to my neurodivergence and my clear lack of work history.

Right now, I'm lucky. Money and a roof over my head are not immediate pressing issues. However, I'm not stupid in knowing that won't be the case forever.

I want, and NEED work. I'm curious about going the apprenticeships route as a way to get an actual opportunity to learn a skill and grow in an environment that I'm sadly not used to. And also if it's viable at 31. or, with how bad the job market seems to be for others on here, if I'm just frankly screwed.

I've got an interest in I.T (broad spectrum, I know) and the jobs I've had with family are trade jobs, something I'm not interested in and more importantly for employers, not really good at. The problem I'm thinking with I.T right now is the surge and growth in AI, combined with the job market already being awful, possibly making any chances of getting into the field even smaller than they already are. Any advice would be much appreciated.

1j1j49r,To Job Hunt in Earnest or Stay to Invest?,"Hello guys!

About six months ago, I stepped into a director role with a company undergoing significant financial restructuring. I was appointed due to a right-sizing initiative, taking on this role temporarily due to language barriers and geographical limitations, as I am based in the Asia and the team is in LatAm. Since then, I've focused on developing two local team managers who are native speakers and have strong connections with our clients. This strategy was adopted to mitigate my inability to directly engage with our client base due to the language gap and at the same time develop them because they have the most potential for this role.

My primary responsibilities include unlocking business growth opportunities and engaging strategically with partners, which have been challenging due to the mentioned restrictions. Recently, our executives emphasized the need for hands-on leadership and a deep understanding of client challenges to boost our necessary revenue growth, also hinting at the issue of redundancy in leadership.

This shift has left me stressed, as it appears the concerns I had about my position are becoming a reality. Despite contributing to other company projects to offset my limitations, I feel my efforts may go unnoticed, as I am less active in visible communications like Slack. My direct lead also did not mention any alternative roles and my guess there's none available because of the current financial crisis.

Just two days ago, I received a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)‚Äîmy first in over a decade with the company. While I am committed to meeting the PIP‚Äôs expectations, my motivation is waning, and I am considering other opportunities.

I am contemplating reaching out directly to our executive for candid feedback on my contributions and potential future at the company. Another part of me thinks it might be wise to discreetly explore new opportunities. However, openly indicating that I am ""open to work"" on LinkedIn isn't an option, as it could lead to immediate termination. I'm considering asking the CEO for permission to openly seek employment for a set period.

I would appreciate any advice on how to navigate this situation. Is there a better way to approach this issue? Should I start job hunting in earnest?

1j1i84j,Undecided between studying Artificial Intelligence and Fllm/Animation,"Greetings. To have a better context, I'm currently struggling to decide which path I should take in life.

I'm M33 with a BA in Software Engineering. I've been working in the tech industry for more than 8 years, but I suddenly burned myself out of the typical corporate environment, incapable of using my creativity. Over the years I became truly interested in video editing, telling stories and animation. I've always been a video game and movie fan so I learned how to edit videos and do some special effects here and there. But mostly I spent writing on blogs about video games and writing scripts for my channel.

At this moment, I have an opportunity to participate in a Master's Degree scholarship for either Artificial Intelligence or Film and Animation. I did in fact have some interest in AI, considering I've did some certificates in Python looking to pursue that path. However, with how things are going, I don't see companies doing any interesting stuff with AI. It is all looking stagnant and they all want to replace artists and people instead of actually helping humanity. More money for billionaires, you've all heard the discourse. But of course, it will be a safe salary. In Animation/Film, every time i talk about that my eyes spark. Everytime I write stories and practice my skills I'm the happiest person, however I know it is a somewhat unstable industry. I know I have very cool ideas to try, but that is all a hit or miss these days as well and most people are interested in engineering and AI.

So my main question is? should I keep in the engineering route (Reason) or shift to film/animation (Love)? I know I can simply study animation as a hobby until I'll be successful, but I already did that, working as an engineer by day and learning writing and production skills by night. I'm the worst at deciding on my own I guess.

But in order to keep the peace I have to pretend to be extroverted and keep up a fake smile.

I'm looking for some insight on what to do, as I'm feeling anxious about thinking about it.

I received a job offer from a company I interviewed last week, the offer is supposed to expire on Monday. At the same time, I'm supposed to interview with another company in which I'm more interested next week. I was waiting for the manager to schedule with me last week, but I haven't heard from him yet (company recruiter told me I passed to the next phase). I emailed her last Friday letting her know I haven't heard from him yet, and that I got an offer and haven't heard back neither.

Would that be ok for me to ask the company that sent me the offer to extend the deadline?

I was hired during the pandemic and was able to get a couple years of experience sort of in industry, although not in R&D like I wanted. I was part of the massive layoffs that happened and struggled to find a job for over a year. I was so worried about no longer remaining relevant in industry that I settled for a Masters in Biotech, I‚Äôm aware of the controversy. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt discover another program at my school until after the fact, that actually gives more hands on lab experience and a year paid internship. If I joined the program, I would end up broke and have to stay another year at the school. However, I do think it would open up opportunities in R&D, as I have not been able to land a summer internship even. 

My question is, is it worth it to maybe invest in this program? I‚Äôm worried about not having any more work experience once I graduate and being stuck in retail jobs. The longer I work at those kinds of jobs, the less likely I will get back into industry. I really am passionate about working in the lab and can‚Äôt see it any other way. I‚Äôve asked people around me what they think and they all just say they don‚Äôt know, but mostly lean towards no due to financial reasons.

I know the struggle to meet company expectations is common everywhere but the mismanagement of numbers and budgets on top of working with unmotivated teens has me feeling like it's a losing battle. A competitor is opening in our area soon, and the company essentially told me Oh well when I submitted the report. I want to find a relatively stable management job where the challenges don't involve a teen shift lead getting upset at a customer and shutting the building down early for the night without informing me.

My SO of nearly four years got an opportunity to work in another state a few months ago. I asked my manager if there were any openings in that state, and while he provided some options, they were quite far from my SO‚Äôs workplace. Because of that, I didn‚Äôt pursue them.

However, a few days ago, my SO received another job offer in Seattle (a completely different role). I‚Äôd like to explore whether there are AM opportunities there where I could potentially transfer.

As the title says, I am looking for a job in the field of operational excellence and/or supply chain.  
I have a pretty strong profile and have gotten some offers to work as a supply chain consultant, but I have always been asked to work only on one project or specialise myself in one sort of supply chain software.

I thought consulting would be ideal to get a variety of work experiences, but I guess not, or maybe I haven't been to the right consulting company.

1j1bavi,"27F. If I quit my stressful admin job for a 'simpler' job (ex. bar back, dishwasher) while doing a tech bootcamp, am I hurting my career?","Hi. I'll *attempt* to keep it relatively short but I do have a bit of a rant. TLDR at end of post.

I'm working an admin job at a STEM department in a university. I've had two full time jobs here over the last two years- my first full time jobs, and I've definitely added valuable skills to my repertoire. However, it's been extremely stressful and really hasn't gotten better, causing mental distress, burnout, and some weight gain. 

I've consistently felt overworked, underpaid and borderline exploited. My boss calls people stupid, useless, waste of space behind their back and has apparently been reported to HR before. 

My old boss left after SHE had enough and I was encouraged to take her job. So for a few months, I did my old job, learned her job with very little training, and hired and trained my replacement. 

It was a terrible time in life. I had the worst panic attack of my life and ended up collapsing in my apartment from stress. This lead to months of depression, burnout, and desire to no longer exist on this planet. My apartment has been a disaster for months but luckily, I'm finally starting to feel better as I'm planning my exit. 

This prompted me to get tested for ASD, which I was finally diagnosed with (ASD-1). There's probably severe ADHD in there too. 

This line of work does not work for me.

I studied art in school and I am ready to finally make a career decision. I keep circling back to product design or massage therapy (which I probably won't go for for various reasons). 

So, UX design it is. I'm aware that the tech industry seems to be in shambles but I am somewhat confident I could do well in this line of work with enough determination and grit. 

My question is:

While I'm doing a UX bootcamp, would it be ill-advised to do a day job like dishwashing or bar backing? I'm not sure if this will set me back career-wise and look bad on a resume.

I'm desperate to try work that will be completed each day and not be taken home with me. I'm tired of the nightmares and anxiety. I want to have a job that will leave me with enough mental energy to devote to studying something more fruitful. 

I'll add that my rent is CHEAP and my expenses are pretty low. 

TLDR: Neurodivergent person wanting to quit my 9-5 office job due to mental distress. If I take a job like dishwashing or barbacking while doing a tech bootcamp, will this negatively affect my career?

1j1931i,"Is it terrible to have a work ethic that I absolutely must come into work not matter what. If so, how to fix it‚Ä¶","Sorry if this is in the wrong forum; this is my first time posting a question. 

Here is a bit of context behind my inquiry . I'm one of four managers in a business, and being a manager (and being who I am), I hold myself responsible for many aspects of the business, even if I am not directly responsible for those things . While some might view this as a control issue, I see it more as a sense of motivation and passion/drive for success. I also have a great appreciation for having an amazing team dynamic and strive to be the one who stands out from other businesses in the industry. It's just in my nature; it's how I was raised and the values I hold. 
My main question today is about calling in sick, especially as a leader and as someone who is in a position that requires at least one manager in the building at all times. I feel guilty and stressed about calling out. It eats at me and makes me worry far more than it probably should. While a lot of people are totally fine calling out-even if they do it so often that it means losing their job-it just doesn't sit well with me. 
It's very hard to run a business, especially when you are the one who has scheduled people to work that day and assigned them specific tasks , only for them to call out. But yes, I realize this is the whirlwind of life, and it's going to happen no matter what. To be honest, it makes the job kind of fun. (Call me crazy, but I do like a bit of stress in the workplace and love overcoming challenges.) üòÇ
I find myself writing this post due to being in another one of these situations. I'm currently sick, so I message my supervisor. And of course, he gives me what we, as managers, are trained to do to handle these situations: staycalm and positive, leave the decision up to them, don't make the person feel guilty for not coming in, wish them well, etc. But for someone like me, this kills me!
I pretty much need to be told that Unless you make it clear that the performance of the business will not suffer with my absence, I‚Äôm  coming in. I will pretty much always come in if I need to. 
My current boss is relatively new to this building, but not new to the company or industry. He is probably just learning my work ethic and standards, and most likely not taking them seriously. He 's more of a chill person, I guess?
But like I said this drives me crazy because I then feel guilty, like I'm letting the team down and going to be looked over for per motion when that comes down the line. 
How do I tell this new supervisor that communicating with me this way can be dangerous for my health? 
For example, In the past when I worked at another location for this company, my previous supervisor knew me much better. They would often have to practically force me to go home or to not come into work because I physically couldn't or was in the emergency room. I know it's a bit extreme, but hey, like I said, I'm passionate about my job, haha .
I recognize that this is a bit extreme, but I really appreciate that kind of dedication to success; it's how I was raised. Sorry that this became more of a rant than anything, but I apparently had a lot to get off my chest. 
Any ideas or thoughts? 
Can you relate in any way? 
I know I'm very stubborn, so it's going to be tough to change my ways, but pretty much any advice is appreciated. 

Thank you!",Individual_Place_278,3,0.7099999785423279,1,1740861308,2025-03-01 20:35:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j1931i/is_it_terrible_to_have_a_work_ethic_that_i/,3,2025

1j17a2y,Specialize or Generalize? Choosing Between UX in Cybersecurity and Product Management,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a UX Designer currently working at a Scam Detection Platform. Finding great opportunities in UX Design has been challenging, so I decided to specialize in a specific industry‚ÄîCybersecurity.

To build expertise, I started the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate and have already completed the first part. My goal is to understand cybersecurity products and how security specialists use them, and ultimately stand out as a UX designer in this industry.

However, a friend recently advised me that being a generalist is better than being a specialist since the tech industry is evolving rapidly. He also mentioned that UX in Cybersecurity is a tough niche with fewer opportunities and suggested that I take the IBM Product Manager or IBM AI Product Manager course instead because, it would allow me to work on UX Design and Strategy, giving me more career flexibility.

Now, I‚Äôm at a crossroads. Should I double down on UX in Cybersecurity and carve out a niche, or should I broaden my skill set with Product Management to open up more career opportunities?

If you've been in a similar situation or have insights into these career paths, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts!

1j16jzp,Private Banker - how to change roles?,"Hello all, happy Saturday.

As the title suggests I'd like to change my role.

I have been working in finance since 2008, I've worked both in NY, London and moved back home in 2013 to Glasgow - this was following the passing of my Mum to cancer as I wished to be closer to support my Grandma.

When in New York, London I worked in asset backed securities for a relatively short stint before transitioning to Wealth Management at UBS, where I worked as an assistant to two senior bankers and their client books. During this period I began studying professional qualifications in 2012 - IMC, and the CFA. The IMC was completed in that year, I then progressed to the CFA curriculum.

I then moved to Glasgow, and secured a role as an investment manager for a large Wealth Management shop, where I reside today.

I built investment portfolios for clients, supported trading activities, and provided investment commentary to the banker population. I managed around 1.4 bn of assets.

During this period I completed the final level of the CFA in 2016.

I moved into a new role within the same business in 2021 as a Private Banker, where I manage a large client book with AuM of circa 100m. I am licensed and regulated within the role and I help to provide advice in line with a clients objectives.

The role that I have is dynamic in the sense that each client is a different puzzle to help solve. However, I find that I am now struggling to enjoy the job as more and more is expected of me without the compensation, alongside the company being a difficult place to write business. 

I do not see myself remaining in a role like this over the next few years as I'd like to expand my skills and try something different, but I don't know where to start, I'd like to possibly try and transition into another role within finance, even outside of wealth.

I still do have a big interest in macro economics, geo politics and the financial markets.

I've been looking at roles on linkedin but I find it difficult to understand how I might be able to frame my core transferrable skills and apply them to the job specs I see. 

I do live a modest lifestyle, so no lifestyle creep, and mortgage has been cleared. 

Any thoughts, guidance would be most appreciated.

Best wishes, M

1j15v0f,Social Work as a Career or Return to State Police?,"I‚Äôll summarize this best I could.

About a year ago I had an injury while I was a cadet to be a trooper. The injury took close to a year to heal and I was on workers comp. At first , I was still interested in returning to the academy (I‚Äôd have to restart from day 1) . However, as time went on my interest and drive to return faded slowly. 

I was offered an opportunity to return this summer to the academy. I‚Äôd start off making about $68k as a trooper with plenty of OT if I make it through the academy. It‚Äôll be a complete lifestyle change for me, I‚Äôll probably have to relocate across the state. 

Recently, I was offered a job at a nearby county for behavioral development. It‚Äôs essentially a social worker for disabled children and adults. Starting salary is 38k, so pretty bad. However they do promote and offer raises fairly regularly if you stay longer. On top of that it seems like a very relaxed office environment. I get full benefits and the people were incredibly kind. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd struggle at all with this job and would have no issue relocating closer to this job. 

The thing is, I am conflicted. I think the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù is going to bother me if I tell the state police I don‚Äôt want to return. I‚Äôd never be able to reapply to them if I opted for that route. While the injury I sustained wasn‚Äôt something I could control, it does bother me not returning to finish something I started. Even if the alternative is a cushy social worker job.

1j15sqa,Need Advice: Should I Take This Offer & Relocate?,"Throwaway account for anonymity.

I‚Äôve been at my current tech company (5K+ employees) for 5+ years, leading a team of ~10. The culture has become toxic, especially after a recent acquisition. My leader, who I used to get along with, has become unpredictable since a new C-suite joined, and they seem to lead with fear. Feedback is unclear, expectations shift without warning, and I feel gaslit. My team is also struggling and I can‚Äôt effectively support them in this environment. My performance reviews were strong in past years, but this year, my leader rated me highly, only for the C-suite to downgrade it and my leader suggested I ‚Äúgut check‚Äù if this is the right place for me. I‚Äôm concerned I‚Äôll be laid off, so I‚Äôve been job hunting.

I just got an offer from a well-known company in LA. I don‚Äôt live there, and the role requires relocation. The original offer included a sign-on bonus and stock grant to offset what I‚Äôd be leaving behind, but after running the numbers, my take-home pay would actually decrease. I countered, asking for a raise that would make relocation financially worthwhile. They increased my base by 10K (I asked for at least 15K to break even) and bumped up the sign-on and relocation package, but the clawback terms mean I‚Äôd be locked in for at least a year.

So my dilemma:
	‚Ä¢	Stay in a toxic job where layoffs seem inevitable at some point and keep searching for another job.
	‚Ä¢	Move for a role that could boost my resume but doesn‚Äôt offer a real financial step forward while starting over somewhere I don‚Äôt know anyone. 

I‚Äôm scared to uproot my life, but I also don‚Äôt want to turn this down and then get laid off and regret not taking a job when I had a chance.

1j149wd,A dilemma; stay or go?,"Hello everyone,

I moved country in August to work with a company I really enjoy working for. I was already working for them in my previous country but things didn't work out and I proposed to my employers that I would be willing to leave my favourite city in the world, where I had a nice personal life set up, to help them with a very exciting growth opportunity for the company. It also meant working closely with someone I get on extremely well with.

However, I have been really struggling to settle in this new city and I can distinctly split my time here as really loving my work but not enjoying much outside of it. Another big factor for not being able to settle is that my visa has not been sorted yet. It's a new company in this country so I knew it would take a little time but this amount of time is pretty unacceptable. Everything feels temporary without a visa. I am spending more on accommodation than I did in my previous country and despite receiving a pay rise, I now have less disposable income.

In a moment of anger and annoyance, I applied for a job in the city I love and I have been successful. I am familiar with the entities I would be working with and it'll very likely be a bit of a shit show and a headache of a job. The pay increase is roughly 30% more than what it I am receiving now and the working week is a day shorter. I'd be financially very comfortable with this role. However, it is a 10 month to 1 year contract and after that I will be searching for a job again. 

Is it crazy that this is such a dilemma for me? For so many people it would be an easy one, go for the money. Do I stay where I get a tonne of job satisfaction and see if having a visa and being able to do the basic things help or do I go for the financial satisfaction in a city I love? I am worried that I might be romanticising the city I left because I was there for 6 years and it was a more open and convenient way of life compared to where I am now. 

I just want to hear opinions from people who don't know me!

1j13cn6,Forced to Relocate for Work‚ÄîBut I Don‚Äôt Want To. What Would You Do?,"I‚Äôm in a tough spot and could use some advice from anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar.

I‚Äôm the breadwinner for my family, currently living in a high cost of living (HCOL) area that I love‚Äîgreat for my hobbies, passions, and overall lifestyle. I work remotely but travel frequently, and I‚Äôve been at my company for 15+ years with a very comfortable compensation package (base, bonus, stock).

The problem? My company is relocating my job to a mid-cost-of-living (MCOL) city and is pushing me to move ASAP. They‚Äôve offered a lump sum relocation package, but after taxes, I‚Äôd still be coming out of pocket for parts of the move. On top of that, moving means buying a house at 7% (versus my current 2.75%) or renting, which doesn‚Äôt feel great financially.

Beyond the financials, I don‚Äôt want to live there. My hobbies and passions would require long road trips or flights, it‚Äôs not a great fit for our child, and my wife‚Äôs income would take a hit in the new location. She‚Äôs been supportive, but she‚Äôs also back and forth on whether she really wants to go.

I‚Äôve been job searching for a year and finally got an offer that lets us stay where we are, but it comes with a $70K pay cut due to lower bonuses and stock. On the plus side, it‚Äôs remote, the travel seems less intense, and it keeps us where we‚Äôre happy. However, it‚Äôs a consulting role, and I‚Äôve spent my career in industry, so I‚Äôm unsure how that transition would feel.

My current employer knows I‚Äôm hesitant and is trying to keep me in some capacity. Options they‚Äôve floated:

A lump sum relocation package (which still leaves me out of pocket).
A different role that might not require relocation (but could be a step down).
Staying on for a year to help transition someone else into my role.
A severance package if I decide to walk away.
At the same time, the company is changing‚Äînew leadership, shifting culture, and a tough market. I worry that even if I do move, things may not be as stable as they seem long-term.

I‚Äôm stuck trying to figure out what‚Äôs best:
1. Move and give it a try for a couple of years.
2Ô∏è.Try to negotiate a hybrid/remote option or a different role.
3Ô∏è. Take the new consulting job and see how it plays out while still looking for something better.

For those who‚Äôve been forced into a work relocation‚Äîor made the jump from industry to consulting‚Äîhow did it work out for you? Any advice for navigating this?

1j12xbt,"Which career should I choose, medicine or aviation?","Hi, So I‚Äôm actually lucky enough to be able to choose from two great career paths that I love. 
I‚Äôm in high school right now I absolutely love physics and maths, I do love biology and chemistry too
.
Now the things deterring me from medicine are: 
1- Doubt, am I good enough to be a doctor? To cut open a human to make them feel better? 


2- RESIDENCY, my cousin is a resident doctor in general surgery and he seems to be in the hospital more than outside. This doesn‚Äôt seem healthy AT ALL. Whenever he visits, coffee is like water to him, he has some gray hair even though he is in his twenties and the bottoms of his eyes are a different color of the rest of his skin
.

Other than that I‚Äôd love to be in his place he is a very smart man and whenever people ask him about anything he gives very detailed information and mentions studies and scientific evidence to all the information he says.

Now for aviation the only thing that is deterring me from pursuing it is the fact that I am kind of leaving science behind. Now of course pilots need to know meteorology, maths and physics but it doesn‚Äôt have the opportunities that medicine offers when it comes to research and ‚Äúpioneering‚Äù
.

Also I‚Äôm really thankful that I don‚Äôt need to worry about tuition fees as both paths are going to be paid for. So the MUCH higher opportunity cost of medicine doesn‚Äôt really have a difference here
.

My father and brother both think that medicine is so strenuous and doctors don‚Äôt have enough benefits and pay to justify going through all the training. My older brother and mum both think that medicine gives you more ‚Äúreason‚Äù (?) and is also more secure and stable.
.


I will be making the decision in about 4 months as I am now in my last semester of high school. Medicine will be 6-7 years depending on which university I go to+ How ever many postgraduate training I do. Aviation on the other hand will only take two years and the program is made in partnership with a big airline company that is going to be for everything and give me a job right after I finish.

1j12kh5,How To Get A Job Or Hold Onto Your Role During Difficult Times,"How To Get A Job Or Hold Onto Your Role During Difficult Times [Forbes](https://www.linkedin.com/company/forbes-magazine/) 

 Embrace New Technologies, Create A Personal Brand



AI can‚Äôt do everything. The real edge lies in human creativity, emotional intelligence, and grit. These traits can be replaced by algorithms. Whether you‚Äôre hunting or holding, confidence grows from owning your narrative and staying one step ahead of the chaos.



Creating a personal brand to stand out in a crowded job market is all about showcasing what makes you uniquely valuable. Start by identifying your niche‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs your knack for problem-solving, storytelling, your hybrid skill set, or your passion for a specific industry like renewable energy. Then, amplify that through a consistent online presence.



Get Noticed By The Right People and Take Action



Many people withdraw from social interactions when they lose a job or feel that they are falling behind their peers. You need to be brave and bold. Get out there to be seen and heard. Polish up your LinkedIn profile with a sharp headline and results-driven summary. Share takes and insights on social media platforms that cater to your career sector.  



Authenticity can be your best secret weapon. Be yourself, don‚Äôt just parrot buzzwords like everyone else. Allow your personality and values to shine. Employers wade through a sea of sameness, so a brand that‚Äôs bold, clear, and human gives you an edge. Treat yourself like a startup. Iterate, test what resonates, and don‚Äôt be afraid to niche down hard. Specialists often outshine generalists in a glutted market.



Referrals Get You In TheDoor



Referrals hinge on trust. Nurture those ties before you need them. People love helping when it feels organic. Make it a conversation, not a transaction. Getting a referral for an interview is like unlocking a VIP pass to an exclusive club. Start mapping out your network. 



This includes friends, former coworkers, classmates, close and distant relatives. There is always that one person in the crowd who knows everyone. Be that person‚Äôs buddy. LinkedIn‚Äôs a goldmine for rekindling relationships, searching for new connections at target companies. Then craft a concise, friendly message to people who can help make introductions and recommendations on your behalf. 



Don‚Äôt just ask for a favor. Offer context such as ‚ÄúI saw your team‚Äôs working on X, and my experience with Y might align‚Äù. You can keep in touch by sharing relevant articles, and a quick congrats on their recent wins. 





Tap Into Mentors, Sponsors And Coaches



Start with a coach if interviews are your achilles heel. A coach will aid in helping you get some wins and build confidence. You can later seek out a mentor for sustained growth. Sponsors come later, once you‚Äôve got traction. Take action on your own. Prepare for an interview with mock interviews. Practice what you can say to your boss to get a promotion and raise. 



A mentor‚Äôs great for long-term guidance. They can help you navigate your career. They‚Äôll share their vast wisdom from someone who‚Äôs been there before. You can find mentors through industry groups, former managers, or mutual connections. 



A sponsor‚Äôs more active. They‚Äôve got skin in the game. A sponsor will vouch for you inside their network. Target senior folks at your company or field who already know your work. A coach, though, is the interview ninja. They‚Äôll drill you on answers, body language, and curveball questions.

1j10vtf,Did I gave up too quick?,"

hi, I was approached some time ago to work in the special education. I am a speech therapist and normally I work 1 on 1 with a client. However, within this school I was assigned a class of 5 kids. So I would be working in a classroom setting, along with a teaching assistant. The goal was to encourage speech and language skills and communication. The children are non verbal and very autistic, ages 4-6. When I started it suddenly turned out to be 7 children instead of 5 (I had not been told this). There were no toys in the class even though the class had started a month earlier. There was no onboarding, no one knew what the intention was and I had to figure everything out on my own.The assistant couldn't tell me much either, she just returned after a burnout. I had no access to children's files (only after 4 days).Parents had been told that I was on vacation for a month and therefore did not attend earlier (I was still working at my former employer, why say I was on vacation???).

After 2 days the assistant got sick, apparently she had just started again after a burnout, but again she was not doing well. Then a teacher came into the classroom, this was nice because for the first time I saw how it worked in a classroom. The next day another assistant was put with me, but she had started the same day as me..we were both new and didn't know much yet. The next day I was all alone in a group of 7 children. Totally irresponsible and not okay towards the parents and children.I had to entertain these children without toys.

I indicated that I have no experience with a class, since you normally work 1 on 1, and that I do need something of help/help. I also indicated that I was surviving and did not experience the first week as positive. My supervisor was quite light-hearted about this.She indicated that this is normal and everyone feels this way the first 6 weeks.Then I was asked how I wanted to work towards the goals of this class, I indicated that treatment materials should be provided first.‚ÄúOh, we may have to order that...indeed there are no toys,‚Äù was her reply. Then she said ‚Äúmaybe we should sit down next week to discuss things‚Äù.

Colleagues were not okay with me not receiving guidance and said there should be a teacher in front of the group instead of a speech therapist (and on reflection, I agreed).I have no experience in a classroom setting and much more was covered than just language development, speech and communication. Behavioral problems etc., personal care (1 day I was just wiping butts). There were many employees with burnout, a lot of employee turnover.Not much seemed right about the organization.The supervisor said ‚Äúyou don't really need to do anything with the kids‚Äù.

After my first week, I immediately quit and left. The lack of treatment materials/toys, no supervision, onboarding, lack of communication. It all didn't feel right and thats where my decision was based on. Now looking back, I'm thinking: should I gave it more time? Maybe I would have get used to it. I don't know.

1j10g0a,Laid off in 3 months and not sure how to position my self for next role.,"I want to get managers' perspective here.
Background: 
I have a PhD and have a good resume with multiple awards. I was hired a senior AI researcher in a startup. 
To me from the very beginning working with the immediate manager didn't feel right. They were ignoring me and my ideas from the very beginning.  But because it was paying my bills I stayed and planned to apply for jobs in parallel. Never gave me any negative or positive feedback. And after 3 months gave a massive negative feedback in front of CEO. And then after a week I was fired with the reason, performance wasn't enough. Anyways.. I am actually quite happy because I knew it wasn't the right place and genAI is quite hot. 

Current situation: 
But now, how to show this in my resume and what to write about the duration ? Because if I write correctly that I was a full time for 3 months that will raise questions. And I feel a little uncomfortable. 

Friends suggested a few options: 
1- removing the experience altogether as it was quite short ( but I feel senior AI researcher may be relevant to show in getting my next job) 
2- write short-term/contract/ temporary etc. explicitly 
3- let it be full-time and just say that it didn't work out or give another good reason 

What are your thoughts on this? My situation doesn't seem rare to me. Will appreciate all your thoughts.

I'm currently in my third year of BSc Biotechnology and considering an MSc in Neuroscience in India. I'm really interested in the field but, I have a few concerns and would love some advice from those who are already in the field or have experience with it.

1. What is the scope of an MSc in Neuroscience in India?
2. What kind of job opportunities are available after my masters? Are there hospital-related jobs as well?
3. Is research the main career path, or are there opportunities in industry, clinical settings, or other sectors?
4. What are the average salary expectations for neuroscience jobs in India and abroad?
5. Any recommendations for good universities or programs in India?

1j0zqaq,Boss repeats word for word what I say,"My boss is a very nice, empathetic person, but I am noticing patterns that cause problems. 

 One issue is that she isn't really listening to her underlings, she more absorbs what anyone around her says and then claims the knowledge as her own.  The information we exchange is not propriety information, so she's not stealing anyone's ideas per se, but when I or her other supervisees share our perspective on work we are responsible for or our expertise, it becomes hers and she will repeat it at meetings without any reference to the person who shared that opinion or expertise with her. 

And sometimes, this happens from one day to the next or even within a day.  One time I delivered a presentation for leadership in the morning, and at a different meeting in the afternoon, she repeated verbatim sections from my presentation by saying, well my gut feeling on this is x, and I was thinking to myself yes, that's what I just presented on in the am, so how can this be your gut feeling?

At a different meeting, ppl actually caught on that she was repeating something I said word for word the week prior, and no one nodded or commented, everyone just sat there listening as she repeated verbatim what I said the week before and in the end she stumbled over her sentences and ended on a giggly embarrassed note, because of the icy silence. 

I need to get promoted at this job and get a salary increase, I have delivered, and I need to not have her pretend that my viewpoints grounded in the knowledge I bring to the table on issues are actually hers.  

Any ideas for strategies?

1j0x052,Quant finance career advice,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice on how to get my career back on track. I‚Äôve been working in a credit risk role for the past three years, mostly because of the location ‚Äî I really like where I live, and this job has allowed me to stay here. But the problem is that the work has been incredibly bureaucratic, and I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm not developing any transferable technical skills. I don‚Äôt feel challenged, and I‚Äôm definitely not learning anything new.

What‚Äôs frustrating is that I used to be good at the core technical skills (math, programming, and modeling), but after years of not using them, I feel like I‚Äôve lost that edge. Now, I‚Äôm in this weird place where I want to pivot into something more interesting ‚Äî quantitative finance or a quant analyst role ‚Äî but I have almost zero confidence that I could land a job like that right now. I don‚Äôt have much practical experience in programming except the occasional R scripting, and the gap seems bigger every day.

I guess my questions are:
	‚Ä¢	What‚Äôs the best, most efficient way to upskill in quant finance and programming while working full-time in a draining role?
	‚Ä¢	How do I rebuild my confidence and technical foundation without feeling completely overwhelmed?

1j0wjq9,Need reassurance /advice,"Hi everyone,

I don't know if this is the best place to post but I am really struggling and could use some affirmation...

I've been a in a role for two years at a large organization, was valued and praised and had big success on projects the first year, then got a new manager and my scope of work completely changed to box me into an operational role the second year.

Recently a new opportunity opened to move to an adjacent department as a few of their people with the same role left.

I applied to the senior role (although a stretch), was shortlisted and interviewed. Rejected, but invited back to the final round for the mid-senior (against two externals). Completed an assessment they said they were impressed with, had an amazing interview, felt it was mine and I get to finally escape my toxic department and prove everyone wrong. Rejected on Friday right at the end of the day.

Then I find out that my department leadership wants to collaborate with those new hires, after years of working in silos, and depriving me of the opportunities they will give them.

I feel completely humiliated and worthless. It's really hard not to internalize and wonder if it's my fault and that I'm not cut out for this field, but I found it so fulfilling like l've finally found what's meant for me. 

Has anyone faced a setback like this where their leadership slated or didn't believe in them or nurture their potential? Did you overcome it? Should I take it as a red flag I should give up on the career?

I was previously working in EdTech for about 2 years but was laid off unexpectedly. 

I had worked in higher ed previously, applied to my most recent position thinking it would be similar to my previous roles and BOY was I wrong. The Director was a power hungry person, constantly belittling us, telling us we have ‚Äúno reason to be stressed‚Äù, and that he had ‚Äúears everywhere‚Äù. I lived in constant fear of him, was undergoing the worst anxiety of my life, lost a total of about 40 pounds in 7 months and was living my own personal hell. It got to the point where recently, he gave us a business days notice that our work schedule would be shifting from 2 days in office to now 4 days (9am-5pm), which honestly I didnt care but it was more the principle. 

That same day he sent this notice, I informed him I would be resigning. I had a few interviews lined up for some tech startup jobs but nothing cemented. I also have a few months of savings lined up as a backup plan. So, point is, I had plans in place. 

Come the last week of my job: the director is ignoring me, ALLL week. Won‚Äôt say hello to me, won‚Äôt respond to my messages when asking clarification questions, won‚Äôt acknowledge my existence. I am having daily panic attacks about this man and his coldness. Every day I ask him and his boss for a sit down conversation to clear the air and end on a high note. He continues to ignore me. My last day was SUPPOSED to be today (2/28/25) but he emailed me at 2:00 pm PST on 2/27 informing me that at 4:00 pm, I had to turn in my laptop and all materials, that it was my last day THAT day. Because he said so. 

Imagine the shock and horror on my face when I saw that email. He hasn‚Äôt spoken to me or anything the entire week but he sent this final email. 

It made me feel so small, so disgusting, and si human. Of course I didn‚Äôt finish off the day. I cried a little and then drove home. 

My question is, should I omit this work experience from my resume? Obviously can‚Äôt use him as a reference. I also have a consulting / freelance job on the side for customer success process implementation that I‚Äôve been doing. So would it be weird to have just that fill the space of my resume?

1j0qyqd,Employee at company I'm interviewing at spoke to my current employer,"Im currently a few years into a role at a company I've been pretty content with. Recent changes and internal issues have made me decide to at least consider looking around to see whats out there, not in a rush to get a new role but open to it if the right opportunity comes up, no harm in that right?  
  
I do 1 screening interview at bigger company in my same field and they decide to proceed with more interviews with the team, great!  
Except one of the people I'll be interviewing with next used to work with my old boss whose now a higher up at my current company. So he decided to hit him up asking about me, my experience and if it lines up with what their looking for. I understand wanting to ask a trusted former colleague to vouch for someone, but Im at least 3 interviews away from a potential offer, this guy hasn't even talked to me yet, I don't even know if I'd want the role that badly, but he's gone and made my current employer aware Im looking elsewhere. This would have felt way more appropriate during the end stage of interviews if they need a reference/last BS check on me.  
  
Luckily on my end the boss reached out to let me know this, and honestly was very supportive about the possibility that I move on, even giving advice for the interviews. However I know this person will still keep a note that Im a flight risk now, great person but business is still business. I've always tried to keep my options open, so still advancing at my current place is on the table but now will they want to invest in me further that I've shown I'd consider leaving?  
  
When I first heard about this from the boss I was caught off-guard that someone would do this and honestly its still bugging me. It feels unprofessional/careless of my well being to reach out like this so early in the interviewing process, and honestly has given me a negative impression of this person (Im pretty sure I know who it was) before I've even met them.

1j0qjck,Can't stay at my current job in logistics/operations much longer. Don't particularly see career prospects in this industry. Currently work an aviation-adjacent position. What's the best way to get into the field?,"Hello everyone, I could use some career advice. I can't speak to anyone at work about this and I don't have any personal connections who know anything about either logistics or aviation. I also posted this to r/careerguidance looking for advice

Currently, I am working in transportation of high value, time-sensitive goods. I'm effectively working under Logistics Manager title. For several reasons unrelated to my question, I cannot stay at this job much longer (schedule, commute, effects on my health, etc).

I've been applying for other jobs in logistics without much luck so far. I'm thinking that it may be an opportune time for a career pivot for a few reasons:

1. The job market - logistics included - seems to be as tight as it's ever been. I've applied to several positions for which I feel I'd be a good fit, but haven't had much response. I'm sure if I keep cracking away at it, I'll find something, but who knows how long that will take, or what an offer would even look like. I'm concerned even if I found something, it would have similar downsides that I am having an issue at my current position.
2. Due to the specialized product I work with, my experiences as a ""Manager"" are not immediately applicable to other industry jobs. While I know I have the skills and competencies to perform any of the jobs I apply for, if hiring managers are even looking at my resume, they're seeing that I don't run a warehouse and pass on my application.
3. Regardless, I'm seeing that the maximum pay for Logistics Managers/logistics industry in general caps around 150K annually. Based off my experience and the job descriptions, these usually tend to be ops heavy positions, require poor hours, and involve considerable stress. I'm okay with those conditions (perhaps except hours/schedule), but I'd prefer to work in a field with a higher compensation ceiling.

For these reasons, I'm looking to pivot away from logistics and towards something else. My sights are currently set on aviation since I work with aviation partners on a regular basis (sending flight requests, approving flight hours, approving timing and routings). I'm under the impression that there is greater earning potential in this industry.

I'm particularly looking for advice regarding my next move as I'm beginning to feel my career is being boxed in, and I don't want to waste time progressing though the wrong industry. I'm also concerned that my current job might be my only chance to pivot to aviation, as it's not super frequent for logistics positions to be in such close proximity to aviation operations without some prior experience.

I saw that most aviation positions require some kind of FAA certifications, so I was thinking of getting a dispatch certificate as it seems to be relatively inexpensive and doesn't take very long to acquire (I've seen as little as 6 months). However, I'm seeing that dispatchers also aren't having an easy time getting hired either, and I would most likely have to relocate in order to take a job (not an option at this time). I was ideally looking for something remote.

I was also thinking of getting an MBA in aviation from Embry-Riddle. Obviously, the recruiter seems to think it's a good investment, but I'm not totally convinced. It's a hefty price, will take at least 1.5 years to complete - and I'm not fully buying the value of an MBA these days. At least it is fully remote, but there's no guarantee a placement after graduation would be (if they can even guarantee a placement anymore in this market).

I'm sure hiring in aviation are pretty tight overall, so maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree. I just don't want to miss my chance to work in the industry as I'm not sure I'll be able to secure an aviation-adjacent position like I have now. Aviation seems like there's lots of room in management to grow, and you can gain merit through various certifications (CAM - I know that's difficult to attain, but at least it's a clear career progression goal, or others ).

Does anyone know of other ways to break into the field? Other certifications or good places to start? Or any other fields that are natural transitions from logistics?

If anyone has any thoughts they would be greatly appreciated. I don't really see any other options in my career at this time. I'm feeling somewhat constrained and I don't have the time or resources to spend advancing my career in something that doesn't suit me. Again, unfortunately relocation is currently not really an option either, which places a further constraint - but I'm hoping that I could secure something remotely at least. That might be a big ask these days, and I'm grateful to even have a job, but I am at least trying to see if I can fine tune my trajectory a little better.

Thanks!

1j0q4ts,How much of it is my fault?,"
I‚Äôve been at my job for a few years now. It‚Äôs my first job out of school and it requires a higher education to get into. In many ways I am doing very well. I do research and development, product development, technical writing, manufacturing, equipment validation and maintenance, some project management (limited), and process improvement. Since it‚Äôs my first job I‚Äôm continuously doing things for the first time. Even when I‚Äôm completing advanced scientific technical work. A significant portion of the work I do is regulated and recorded. If something is not done correctly it must be written up. Why it happened, root cause of the issue, risk assessment, actions to prevent it from happening in the future. The works. 

Here is my issue. 

I‚Äôm learning *a lot* but I make mistakes. Some of them are small and entirely my own, others I can‚Äôt help but feel like I fell into a trap that could have entirely been avoided if I had been better informed by coworkers or other departments. 

For example. I was assigned a piece of equipment that originally had been assigned to someone else on my team. A certain piece of this equipment had been out of compliance for years, but no one realized it because tasks were not being completed appropriately. When I was given the instrument I wasn‚Äôt trained on it. Nobody walked me through everything I needed to do. They just told me generally what needed to happen and that was it. The only reason we‚Äôre realizing now that this part was out of compliance was because I made a mistake when logging my work. The department in charge of compliance never noticed that this equipment wasn‚Äôt being maintained properly either. So it became a whole thing. At this point I‚Äôm the owner of the equipment and it feels like (even though no one has said it) that everyone thinks it‚Äôs my fault. I understand that I‚Äôm responsible for the equipment now, but I also feel I should‚Äôve been warned of this maintenance that needed to occur when the instrument was transferred to me. Fortunately the out of compliance part didn‚Äôt cause any damage or loss. 

Another example. 
I developed a protocol that we use a lot of the time. I got input from the whole team in terms of structure, what needed to be included/not included. Everything. I encouraged everyone to give me input and let me know if there was something that needed to be fixed/improved. The protocol has been set and stable for a while now. *Now* I‚Äôm coming to find out that there is a an error in how the protocol is implemented. Certain processes have to be completed before the protocol can be started/completed. Nobody told me about these processes. The team has been aware of these processes, but they haven‚Äôt been completing them either and haven‚Äôt spoken up about it. I‚Äôm only realizing what‚Äôs happening now because once again I made a small mistake that led me down a path where I started looking into the whole thing and boom. It‚Äôs become much bigger than it was before. 

There is structured documentation the company keeps and every employee has access to that talks about basically every single process, but I was not aware of the specific document that was relevant to my protocol because there are tens of documents and each document can be many pages on its own written in dense technical language. My boss has known the entire time how my protocol was implemented, has mentioned previously how this process isn‚Äôt followed, and never spoke up about how this needs to be addressed or fixed. When my boss did mention it in a meeting once (can‚Äôt remember the context it was a while ago) nobody said it was an issue that needed to be addressed. So now here I am feeling like it‚Äôs my fault but once again feeling I should‚Äôve been warned about this. It was one of the first protocols I wrote when I was first hired. At the time I didn‚Äôt know all these complexities. 

To keep it short because this is long enough. I feel shitty and I don‚Äôt know how much of the blame to take and I don‚Äôt know if me asking the question is my way of deflecting blame to protect my ego. Any advice would be very helpful thank you.

1j0obh9,Feeling overwhelmed and stressed at my new job ‚Äî should I resign?,"I (25F) have been working at a tuition center as an admin assistant for nearly two weeks now, and it‚Äôs been a real struggle. In this short time, five employees have already resigned so the team is severely understaffed. There are only six of us (with just four admins) handling three branches and over 100 students, which is a lot for such a small team.  Even though there will be 2 new admins starting soon, I'm afraid they would resign in less than a month like previous two admins too.

On top of that, my colleagues expect me to pick things up quickly, despite only being there for less than two weeks. I know it's because we're understaffed but this had made me feel stressed and incompetent when I make a little mistake. Last night was my first solo shift at our busiest branch, and it was a bit of a disaster because I alone had to do 2-3 persons job.

Apart from that, my boss has anger issue, and it's making me incredibly uneasy and anxious at work. I was never this afraid of making a mistake. 

I got scolded on my second day of working in front of two colleagues and about 10 interviewees because the toilet hasn't been cleaned. I get that I should be more proactive but he should direct the anger towards the two admins who didn't clean the toilet the night before because it's a part of our task during closing, not opening.

I‚Äôm finding it really hard to work in this environment, especially because his temper seems to be a big reason why people resign so quickly from this job. It makes me constantly anxious, and I‚Äôm scared of making mistakes because I fear another outburst.

I‚Äôm feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about how to handle this. Should I stick it out, or is it time to consider resigning?

1j0nlwm,Am I being gaslit by my managers?,"I just joined a small start up a month back. My position is a generalist role where nothing is fixed as far as my responsibilities are concerned but I do shadow the co founders and eventually, according to them ‚Äútake over the time consuming meetings and run them‚Äù. At the moment I‚Äôve been given all the tasks that are on their plate which takes up too much of their time or is not on their list of priorities. I‚Äôve done everything across team management, trying to set up organised systems and routines in place for the team to function better. Here are some things I‚Äôve observed in the month. 

1. I suggest solutions to various operational and team management struggles. I‚Äôm met with ‚Äúyou have freedom to do anything. Implement it‚Äù. But when I begin implementation I‚Äôm met with a lot of resistance. It is my observation that they seem stuck up in their routine that has taken years to develop and refuse to let go of ad-hoc methods when they clearly asked me to help change it. And they eventually say no and ask me to focus on other tasks. Other times I‚Äôm met with an immediate ‚Äúno‚Äù with the reasoning being ‚Äúit‚Äôs too complex to explain‚Äù. 

2. They want perfection and results, and I‚Äôm someone who naturally leans towards getting things done right even if I take extra time out to finish it. I was recently told that I‚Äôm trying to perfect it all and they‚Äôd like things to run in the background but not have me pay too much attention to it. 

3. I also feel like they haven‚Äôt fully accepted me into the team and do not consider me as part of the team because they have verbatim said ‚Äúshe helps out in this‚Äù. My position doesn‚Äôt say assistant nor did the JD, but I‚Äôm being treated like an assistant who they expect to take on all their dirty jobs. Because they have previously used ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dumping all my not so important tasks on your plate as I cannot be bothered with it‚Äù. I have taken over multiple tasks which no one else cared about but is essential and they still call it ‚Äúhelping us out‚Äù. At a recent event I was added in at the last moment and during the presentation that was given the team picture that was added was an older one which had everyone on the team but me (this is despite having a group picture with me in it). 

4. Also, the team doesn‚Äôt really converse with me. They keep to themselves. 

I‚Äôd be grateful to have all your advice on these signs. Am I overthinking this or are there signs I‚Äôm missing? 

Also, is it too early to begin looking for another job? I‚Äôm not happy here. I don‚Äôt see any upward progression here, especially if I don‚Äôt have a supportive team.

1j0mqwh,Keep comfortable hybrid job or take a risk on remote?,"I‚Äôve worked for a university in the same marketing position for 3 years. My job is low paying (50k), but offers really great job security and benefits. 

I just got an offer for a fully remote job paying 20k more that would involve doing marketing for a small org that offers professional development training to workers in a somewhat niche industry. The company is pretty small and doesn‚Äôt have any Glassdoor reviews, so I‚Äôm basically going in blind here, but I didn‚Äôt pick up any bad vibes during the interviews and the team seemed kind and excited to extend me an offer. The benefits aren‚Äôt as great either and I‚Äôd be taking a major PTO reduction, but I realize that‚Äôs the tradeoff of moving from the education sector to corporate.

I‚Äôve been casually job searching for over a year, and since I‚Äôve had the freedom to be picky since I‚Äôm currently employed, I‚Äôve been exclusively looking for remote roles. I made it to a few final round interviews but kept getting beat out at the last minute, so it feels crazy to finally have an offer for the thing I‚Äôve been wanting so badly, but now I‚Äôm getting cold feet.

The job market is obviously a mess right now, so part of me wonders if I‚Äôm making a mistake by leaving my current job for this new one. I worry about the prospect of getting laid off, or joining the company only to find a few months later that they‚Äôve totally misrepresented themselves and are actually toxic. Part of me feels like something MUST be wrong with this job for them to have offered it to me, especially since most remote positions are so competitive.

What would you do in my situation? I live in a LCOL area so I‚Äôm able to get by comfortably on what I‚Äôm making now, but obviously being fully remote and increasing my salary by such a large amount would be a huge upside.
