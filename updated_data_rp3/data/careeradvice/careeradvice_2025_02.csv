1j0m68e,Asking for a promotion for the first time,"My employer requires that we all record our yearly goals in Workday, and I couldn't think of any and asked HR for job descriptions of the positions between mine and my boss' so I could find something to upskill.

Well, it turns out that aside from one responsibility, I am already working the position two places above mine. I understand that a job description isn't fully reflective of someone's entire responsibilities, but I think I am already doing most of that job very well.

I assume that when my boss reviews the goals and has our goal meeting in the next couple of weeks that she might bring up that these are the tasks of the higher position. And if she doesn't, I want to bring it up specifically to ask for a promotion.

I have never asked for a promotion or a raise in my my life, and I'm middle aged. What do I need to keep in mind, and how do I realistically go about doing this without making my boss think I am going to leave the company if I don't get it (I have been job hunting for a year, so a new job isn't likely soon) and without making my boss think I am trying to jump positions? My current role is labeled as entry level, but I came here with 10 years of experience in a very similar branch of this field.

My boss also likes to point out that I am not perfect. He told me to keep working on things that have beeny pain points since I started, which was 2023, but I only mess up on those about 5 times a year, so I chalk that up to being a human. I don't want him to say that since I still make the odd error here and there that I am not a good candidate for promotion because of that, so I need some kind of smart comeback for if he brings this up.

There is no one on our team who I would be replacing it I were promoted. It would just be at the company's expense. I would be taking some responsibilities from my boss as I assume he is doing the one thing in this job description I haven't learned yet.",NoAdministration8006,1,1.0,1,1740787194,2025-02-28 23:59:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0m68e/asking_for_a_promotion_for_the_first_time/,2,2025

1j0m2us,Am I overreacting at being upset for this?,"I’ve been working in industry for 3 years under the same boss for most of that time. Through this position I’ve had one promotion and multiple raises, and have been recommended for multiple promotions as well, I’m the only individual in my team to do so. I’ve wanted to go back to academia for awhile and decided to apply to grad programs this past cycle. I had a good relationship with my boss here at this job and reached out to her about my future goals and to see if she would write a letter of rec for me, and the conversation was very positive with her saying she would write one.

A few months later, I end up being shifted to another manager and my previous boss becomes my skip level boss. I had a difficult time adjusting to my new boss’s management style as it was less organized and I was not given as much work, especially in the things I expressed interest in. Regardless, I stayed busy with other work but found it difficult working with this new manager as he was not communicative about priorities or scheduling even after expressing that I work best under those conditions. I unfortunately didn’t bring this up to my old skip-level manager which in hindsight was a mistake. 

Through this time, I was regularly checking in with my previous manager about the LOR to give reminders and see if I can help out with these. Cut to a few days before it’s due, and she schedules an impromptu meeting to discuss my performance. Here, she expressed dissatisfied with my work lately and that she’ll have to address this in the LOR to write an honest letter. This really throws me off guard as I wasn’t aware she felt this way. I felt the need to defent myself that I expressed discontent with my new manager’s leadership and that I was not given opportunities to help with work, and that I still continued to find work regardless of this. Ultimately my skip-level didn’t budge and I needed their LOR since I previously thought they would write a very positive one instead of a mediocre one.

Ultimately this has soured my relationship with her for me and I am looking for confirmation that this was an unexpected and slightly unprofessional thing to do. It really took me by surprise and came across as lacking understanding and support and has been an overall bummer for this job. Coming from academia, it seems like I generally hear that people only agree to write a LOR if they are going to write a very positive one, so this really caught me off guard and has made me consider staying at this position if I don’t pivot to academia. I’m mostly venting and looking to see if I am overreacting to this, or if this was an unprofessional move on her part.",Impressive_Syrup_738,2,1.0,0,1740786922,2025-02-28 23:55:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0m2us/am_i_overreacting_at_being_upset_for_this/,2,2025
1j0m1ee,Recent Grad trying to land first role,"To keep it simple I’ve been looking for entry-level roles in financial services, tech, marketing, or business-related fields. I graduated this past May from a well-regarded public college in NYC with a BBA in International Marketing and dual minors in Economics and Data Analytics. While I sometimes think I should have chosen a more finance-focused degree, I’ve worked hard to gain relevant experience, maintain a strong GPA (3.5), earn multiple honors, and complete certifications. Since August, I’ve applied to over 700 jobs—entry-level roles, programs, internships, and apprenticeships—but I can count on two hands how many interviews I’ve received.

I’ve done everything I can think of—tailoring my resume and cover letters, securing recommendation letters, practicing for interviews, and even paying for LinkedIn Premium—yet it feels nearly impossible just to land an initial screening. I apply everywhere, not just to top firms or big banks, but also to smaller companies, boutiques, and lesser-known firms, and still, I rarely hear back. At this point, I’m completely lost on what else I can do besides continuing to sit in front of my laptop and apply to whatever new listing pops up.

I’ve even started considering going back to school for a finance degree, though I hesitate to take on more debt, even if my former college is relatively affordable. I’ve tried networking, cold messaging recruiters, and having coffee chats, but those often feel pointless when it comes to actually landing a role. The entire process is exhausting, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m missing something critical or if there’s another approach I should be taking.

For those who have been in this position or work in hiring, do you have any advice? Is there something else I should be doing to break through? I just want to work—I’m eager, qualified, and willing to put in the effort. Any guidance would be truly appreciated.",Poland_Spring101,1,1.0,2,1740786802,2025-02-28 23:53:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0m1ee/recent_grad_trying_to_land_first_role/,2,2025
1j0ltve,Need advice from MIS graduates and other IT professionals. What roles should i apply to as a new grad?,"So i recently graduated with an MIS degree in December and have been applying to jobs for a couple of months and have had 4 interviews with Capital one, EY and Deloitte and another small consulting company (Business Analyst, the rest tech consulting). I've honestly felt the job search process very difficult and stressful since I don't really hear back from many companies. In my free time I have been looking into certifications to help boost my resume. I was wondering if anyone could recommend any certifications for me. Would the comptia A+ cert be useful? I was also looking into the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or the AWS certified solutions architect, but I have seen on other reddit posts saying that it wouldn't really help if i had no prior professional experience. I wanted to see what you guys thought about that and if there are any other certifications that my time would be better of spent with and what other roles I should be applying to since I am mainly applying to IT Business Analyst and Data analyst roles. For background the classes that I enjoyed the most were my database management class where we learned how to use sql and create a database and my big data class where i learned to use tableau and SPSS. I also have a minor in CS and Business Analytics. Any advice is appreciated.

1j0lg3t,Should I Take a Short-Term Job with Financial Risks?,"I recently had an interview for a trainee position at a company, and I was told the decision process would take 2-4 weeks. However, I got an offer just three days later, which caught me off guard. The position is only for three months, and while it’s great to get an offer, I’m struggling to decide if I should accept it.

The biggest issue is that the job is in Helsinki, but I currently live elsewhere. Renting an apartment in Helsinki typically requires a six-month lease, and short-term options are limited and expensive. If I take this job, I might be stuck with a lease that outlasts the position, putting me in a tough financial spot if I don’t find another job immediately afterward.

On the other hand, I’ve been job hunting for a while, applying to over 650 positions this year, and this is the first real offer I’ve received. I don’t want to pass up an opportunity, but I also don’t want to make a risky financial move.

Would you take the short-term job in my position, or would you hold out for something more stable?

1j0kt66,"I’m Giving My All, but She’s Telling Me to Step Back—Plus, I’m Stuck in Life. What Should I Do?","I got into a relationship after coming back from Canada. Before this, I had a terrible relationship in India that left me with emotional scars. While I had many hookups in Canada, I never had a serious relationship there.

When I met my current girlfriend, she was amazing at first. As men, we initially treat women how we want to be treated, but over time, we treat them how they treat us. From the start, I put in a lot—emotionally and financially. I wrote long messages, bought her flowers and gifts, and genuinely tried to make her feel special. But I realized she wasn’t reciprocating at the same level.

She’s had multiple past relationships, while I’ve only had one. Maybe that’s why she doesn’t respond to affection the way I expect. But recently, we fought because I told her I’m frustrated—I give so much, but I’m not getting the same back. Her response? She said she feels like she owes me something and told me to step down my efforts. That hit me hard.

Now, when I’ve started pulling back, she says I don’t give her attention anymore and that she’s losing interest. But I’m exhausted from always apologizing and trying to make things work alone. She still calls me after fights and doesn’t want to leave, but I feel like I’m the only one truly trying.

On top of this, I have huge pressure on my head. As a Canada returnee, I wasn’t able to get permanent residence and ended up wasting 25 lakh rupees. I started a digital marketing company here in India, which worked but didn’t work for me. Now, I want to take my dad’s business online and do so much more, but I feel stuck in this relationship. My attention is always on her, and I don’t know what to do.

1j0jzvb,28 years old. Trying to figure out what to do next...,"I'm struggling with deciding what to do next. Got laid off from last role as an AE at a software company when the company was acquired. Was getting tired of sales anyways but had a new AE role I was interviewing for that had a *big* pay bump. Thought I had the job in the bag. Figured I'd do it another 1-2 years and see if I still wanted to continue. At the one yard line, they changed directions, and they won't be moving forward with me.

Now I have a month left of severance and don't know what to do. Maybe it's time to get out of sales. Before I did sales I did operations at a few reputable names like JPMorgan, PepsiCo and Goldman Sachs. I graduated with a finance degree but don't really use it.

The funny thing is I'm considered highly gifted at reading and writing. I write novels and short stories in my freetime and want to do that full-time, but that's a ways off. If I could do things over, I kind of wish I would have just gotten an English or philosophy degree and stuck to my interests and talents all this time instead of following career paths that I thought would be higher paying. Now I realize I hate them even though I was able to learn new skills I wouldn't have otherwise.

I know this subreddit probably gets a million posts like this one and there's nothing terribly unique about my situation, but I just need help. Nothing outside of writing really strikes me as meaningful. Maybe I just work jobs to support myself while I build a bibliography. Maybe there's a career path that can use my talents that I would actually enjoy.

1j0jwtk,Coworker can't meet deadlines and it affects my responsibilities,"The company I (remotely) work for hired overseas junior workers to do some of the smaller tasks to help the team focus on our bigger deliverables. Two of these team members are great! Some are meh. Two are *bad*, but for one of them I've managed to move things around enough to keep them from causing too much damage. I have not managed to do that with the other.

One of my responsibilities is making sure all of task X (a repeating monthly task with defined deadlines) is completed, accurate, and delivered on time. I have changed processes around to give everyone the max amount of time to complete their parts. I have tried to survey the team on areas that need improvement, things they feel like they need more info on, etc., and this coworker will not engage. They will not engage 9/10 of the times I send them deadline reminders, they will never engage when I ask if there's anything they need, and they do not respond to praise, thank yous, or anything polite. They ghost me routinely, especially if we are past a deadline and their work for task X is not turned in.

We have defined, reasonable deadlines for each part, with a buffer so that if we don't complete on time (a few days before month end), then we should at least complete by the last day of the month and still technically be on time. We are within the last hour of the last day of the month and they will not respond to me. I have sent them multiple reminders throughout the week. The task they have left is so small, and could be passed to someone else. But they won't pass it on and they won't acknowledge my requests to complete the work. I can see that they have viewed my messages, but they won't respond.

I'm tearing my hair out over here. They do this every month and no amount of extra time I give them is enough. And I don't know what the issue is because they won't respond to me! I've talked to the director about this and their response was, ""oh yeah, I know about them. Usually you just have to really push that person and they'll do their work."" Which means my director is no help--they know this person causes issues on a regular basis and their only recommendation was to kindly give them regular reminders (I already do! They're ignored!). 

This is the only person not finishing their work on time/typically before the original deadline. Since we aren't delivering on time, I get questioned. I don't assign the work or have any authority, I'm only allowed to remind everyone to do their work, so this person doesn't exactly see any reason to listen to me. But if we don't deliver on time, then it's, ""OP, why didn't we have this ready by the deadline? And then not at all within the month? You need to remind them of the deadlines."" 

What can I even do? What encourages someone like this to do their role? How can I make my manager actually listen to the issue?",orkutsk,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1740780991,2025-02-28 22:16:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0jwtk/coworker_cant_meet_deadlines_and_it_affects_my/,2,2025
1j0ja3j,Reputable psychic for career advice?,Can anyone recommend a psychic for career advice?,InfiniteScribe,1,1.0,0,1740779289,2025-02-28 21:48:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0ja3j/reputable_psychic_for_career_advice/,2,2025
1j0j4zt,Some job search tips to help you guys!!!,"1. First try [Hiring.Cafe](http://hiring.cafe/) i have seen many promising testimonials from that site where people are getting call backs. The Gimmick is that it always takes you directly to the Company's website where they posted the job, which you should be doing anyway. But you can also call companies directly, sometimes you typically have a higher chance of success for a call back cause your differentiating yourself from the sea of applicants that just spam apply, just make sure you already applied & can communicate intelligibly your skills & work experince. (Not guaranteed but still useful....)
2. For other 3rd party site's, remember that there are parameters that you can use in their URL's to que in the most recent job posting to increase you odds of getting you application pulled, first come first served type of scenario| For LinkedIn its  f\_TPR=r604800 (604800 seconds = 1 week + add it to the end of the URL if you don't already see it) decrease the seconds to a 1 day or 2 & you should get jobs with less applicants. Each job site is different so you will have to search around or just use chat gpt to figure out what the parameter is. | (Most jobs don't go through 3,000 job applications once they posted a position, they go through the first 20 if that\* & if they don't workout they go to the next 10 so keep that in mind).
3. Copy & Paste your Job application to an ATS tracking system & test it against the job posting your aiming for; this is the main one most people use but it doesn't matter its all the same sh\*t = [jobscan.co](http://jobscan.co/) \+ just make sure you get a percentage score out of it so you know where you stand. FYI anything below 80% is basically garbage & no one looks at it, this is the world we live in now & if you don't prepare for this no one will see your job application & you will be in unemployment limbo for awhile if you cant get pass this + it will help you save money before you get the hair brain idea to pay someone to make your resume in an age where there is a literal AI that can do it all for you or you could literally comb through [r/resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resume/) to see where you might have went wrong with you CV Structure....Just an idea.
4. Recruiters.....if you have the patience for it; Some of them are good & some of them are pretty bad.......usually Indian recruiters so my advice stick with American ones. (\*I AM NOT XENAPHOBIC IM JUST POINTING OUT A TREND THAT MOST PEOPLE ALREADY KEEP POINTING OUT DONT F\*CKING LYNCH ME). On a serious note though just look around for high quality ones with good testimonials & reviews (Keep an eye out for independent ones that get paid commission by companies, they are pretty much incentivized to look for good candidates that matches a company's criteria & if you fit the bill then thats just good news for you!). As for the ones that work for staffing agencies (The ones you have to pay for) I leave that up to your judgement as there is just to much mixed information going either way on the internet & I don't know if you think the juice is worth the squeeze so that is up to you. Also knowing how to use them plays a big part in all of it but you can see that for you self, here is a link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1ixhzyb/a\_tip\_on\_how\_to\_use\_recruiters/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearchhacks/comments/1ixhzyb/a_tip_on_how_to_use_recruiters/) Here is a Rec if you interested: [http://oeboosters.com/](http://oeboosters.com/)
5. Networking & Nepotism| Say it with me now ""It's not about what you know but who you know"", get in volve in different communities, discord channels & slack communities ideally those closely related to the industry your interested in. If you have a focus in Healthcare or Biotechnology or Big Tech get active in those communities & participate in talk's & event's if they hosting one; summits, conventions you name them if you can get involved you get active in those places & get your name out there. A lot of recruiters like to hover around those places if it seem like you know what you doing & you communicate the work you have been doing intelligibly that can really increase you odds. But the greatest form of networking in my opinion is literally being related to some who already has a higher position in a company. Do you have a Cousin, Father, Mother, Uncle, Aunt, Brother/Sister that already works at a company & has a high enough position to slip your application into HR. Then what the H\*ll are you doing sending 1000's of applications out into the ether. Its about time to start calling in some favors & see if they can get you job at their spot, because that's literally what family is there for, your success is their success, helping each other when in need.......Unless you hate their guts of course.

1j0ivyu,Interview HELP - Multiple Offers At Diff Times,"
I am actively interviewing and have 4 companies actively engaged.

*Company A final interview on Wednesday
*Company B final interview was today
*Company C final interview Monday/Tuesday
*Company D I was waiting on scheduling final interviews, and hadn’t heard in almost 2 weeks - I assumed I did not get it.

I really want Company B, followed by Company A. I am top candidates for both and the HR guy at each has already said words like “when” you come onboard. Barring any unforeseen craziness, I am confident I will receive an offer from each.

Company C and D were past colleague referrals. Company D randomly called me today and left me a voicemail, very positive asking for a call back “anytime” even over the weekend to “discuss something” with me. I have a strong suspicion it’s an offer; when I called back it went to voicemail and I couldn’t leave a voicemail.

What do I do here? I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity, nor do I want to burn bridges. Just call back D again on Monday?

1j0iuu6,25yo male who has been asked to relocate for work,"For context, I am a 25 year old male living in SoCal who has just graduated college with a Bachelor’s in finance during the spring of ‘23. Immediately out of college, I accepted a full time job offer and have been working at this same employer for 1 year and 7 months. Major expenses include my rent + car payment which total to roughly $1,700/mo. I have just signed a year long lease 3 months ago, moving in with some buddies and moving out of my parent’s house for the first time in my life. My debt is pretty minimal, as I went to a community college then transferring to a 4 yr (roughly $2k in student loans.) My base salary totals to roughly $75k/year with my commissions from work being an additional (conservative est.) of $35k for 2025. My savings are very solid - I am living comfortably and continuing to set money aside with every paycheck.

Throughout my time with my employer, I have excelled in my role with leadership taking notice. As a result, they want to move me to our NorCal location, being in the same role, but just a different setting. It is seeming very likely that they will be extending me an offer pretty shortly here which will include the following: A salary increase of 15-20%, all moving expenses covered, and the $$$ required to buy me out of my lease.

As someone who has lived in the same place for the entirety of my life, only barely moving out of my parents house 3 months ago, this is an extremely dramatic change for me. I have not done too much research on the differences in costs of living between Norcal (San Jose area) and where I currently live. Is it foolish for me to turn this offer down?  I would be starting over from scratch, packing up my entire life, leaving my family and friends to start over in a place that I am not familiar with.

The company we work for will sometimes require people in assembly lines to work 7 day weeks. I myself have worked 21 days straight once. My friend has a major problem with the mandatory 2 week span of a 7 day work week. The company uses a point system for determining whether you are too unreliable for working there.

1j0i32d,I can’t sleep cause I am stressed about my job.,"I (24F) work at a small company in an office environment. Recently, there’s been a lot of turnover, and I’ve ended up becoming one of the more senior team members. My manager recently approached me about a process we’ve been following, and I gave an honest response about how it was being done. Unfortunately, it turns out we’ve been doing it incorrectly, and I should have questioned why it was being done that way in the first place. I’ve been told that since I’m “smart,” I should have known better than to follow the process as I was instructed. Now, I’ve been asked to create a completely new process, even though I’m no longer the one doing the task, and explain why things weren’t done properly (even though two senior colleagues at the time were overseeing the process). To make matters worse, my manager has essentially shut me out, and a coworker I considered a friend has been joining in on the criticism, making me feel terrible. I haven’t been able to sleep for days, and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s causing me so much stress and anxiety.

Since then, the workload has exploded because there simply aren’t enough people to cover everything.

I get that more responsibility comes with the promotion, but this level of overload isn't sustainable. It feels like they promoted me just to offload all this work onto me.

They gave me a raise, but at this point, it’s not about the money,I feel like I’m nearing burnout.

1j0hca1,How to Ask for just bit more time to decide on the offer,"so after last summer's (2024) internship, i did extension through my fall school semester which ended in early December. then my manager asked if i was interested in coming back next summer but i told him i wasn't sure my next summer's plan was as i'm int'l student and summer plans are always uncertain. so i asked him if he could give me until January to think about.

but then, during the winter break, i got into interview process for multiple companies that i really wanted  so i wasn't sure if i could come up with an answer by January. we meet in person in Jan. as I needed to give back my company badge and laptop and during that meal i told him i was on a process for different companies so told him if i could get back to him by end of February.

My interview for a really good role went well yesterday, and now today i'm supposed to talk about if i want to return or not to my manager's company next summer.

How do i tell him to give me one more extension of time without telling him that i'm waiting on other offers? I really feel bad keep making him wait. or is this a normal thing? should i be upfront about it?

the last text message we had before scheduling td's call was:

Manager: ""You can also just tell me if you want to come back this summer.  If yes I can talk to HR and put in a request for a req.  if you found something else no prob. ""

Me: ""Oh so to kinda summarize so i do have a verbal offer from \[\_\_\] and one interview left for finance firm but if I’m being super honest I don’t know if i really like the culture and people at \[\_\_\], at least when i interviewed all people seemed really douchy and toxic 😅😅 and I loved \[return offer\] office’s people and culture thus if i could work on projects related to data/ML/numerical modeling i really wanted to return and i wanted to talk about that""

Im stuck on what to do next in my career and would love some advice from you all who are in healthcare. 

I got my bachelors in biology and chemistry and worked as an EMT, medical assistant, patient advocate, and most recently a manager in healthcare. I do want another degree and I’m thinking ABSN over entry level masters of nursing since it’s cheaper and quicker. However, I wouldn’t be able to start until 2026 due to when apps and term starts are. I’m not looking to work bedside right now, but I think it would be good for me to have in the future. 

Additionally, I’m thinking of working and going to a school like wgu to get my mba in healthcare but I worry it’s not competitive enough. Ideally, I would like to do that as soon as possible then get my ABSN next year. 

In all I want to get another degree right now that would be worth it for my time and money. Anyone have any helpful tips for me? Especially since I’m in my 30s and not looking to waste anymore time.

Im really conflicted with choosing a Masters degree and continue as a career. 
Im a Business Administration graduate with a major in Accounting and Finance. 
Ive been told fintech and data analytics is a great option to pursue as a career (even though i dont really have much experience in it) also alot of my family and teachers recommended to go for fintech

However, i kind of pictured myself as a diplomat or be in foreign service, and although i know there are special exams to give (civil services) but i wont be giving that due to the extreme competition and thus thought of getting a masters in international law to pursue that path. Additionally, i do have interest in international relations and ive done some research work and tend to engage in Model United Nations (MUNs) debate sessions and as such. 

Yet i still dont know what to go for.

1j0ef0v,Am I Making the Right Call Here?,"I'm in healthcare currently. I work as a nurse in substance abuse, and needless to say, it can be a very complex job. I can have patients that are high as a kite or completely hammered upon admission. Not only that, the emotional trauma of these people losing their home, spouses, kids, jobs and telling you their whole life story of them being raped or abused isn't fun either. It's not physically demanding, but this job rips apart your soul.

I'm returning to school now to get my FNP and plan to specialize in dermatology. I'm trying to specialize in something straight to the point, cut and dry, and without emotional baggage. No high acuity + low chances of death, so, this seems like a good idea, right?

I don't have any passion or fire for dermatology, and I lack push or motivation. I don't want to see patients anymore, but I don't want some healthcare insurance/admin job. I don't want health informatics either.  It just seems like the safest route. I like it because it offers very high stability, good pay, and the ability to live in most major cities, among other things. It seems somewhat interesting, but I'm not very interested. 

It feels so depressing. I've searched for anything to transition into, and so many fields are absolute dumpster fires—tech, business, finance, etc. I want to put everything into something I care about, but I don't want to transition into something I've been working for five years, and then get randomly laid off.

1j0dm4s,Currently a Field Service Engineer. How do I transfer out of a dead end technical career path to something more lucrative and versatile?,"Throwaway account here.

Here's a brief synopsis on my career as it's a very ""non-traditional career"" with lots of twists and turns.

* I am in my early 30s and graduated with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2014.
* I got my first ""real job"" out of college for a large oil and gas contractor which lasted about a year before getting laid off due to massive downsizing (all hires with less than 2 years experience were cut)
* After getting laid off, I had a bit of a quarter life crisis that involved traveling all over the world for 2015-2017 and living in Australia and NZ for a year working part-time construction jobs (obviously did very little to help my career but was some very cool experiences to have in my 20s)
* After returning to the US in 2017, I still did not want a 8-5 corporate job, so I got a job as a deckhand on charter yachts in Florida. I spent 2017-2023 in this career working my way all the way up from a lowly deckhand to a Chief Engineer position in the marine industry. This was one of the most hands on and multidisciplinary careers anyone could work. I did everything from maintaining a boat's complex systems, repairing equipment onboard, fixing hotel services for charter guests, to managing groups of contractors in large and expensive shipyard projects.
* I wanted to settle down so I stopped working at sea in 2023 and changed careers again to be a field service engineer for a medical equipment company. I primarily repair autoclaves and washers for an OEM vendor in a hospital's sterile processing department. I have been in this career for a year

While I like working as a Field Service Engineer and enjoy the freedom and flexibility of the job, I find the career to be a pretty ""dead end career path."" Many of my colleagues seem to have been doing this for 15-20 years with no real promotions, opportunities for advancement, or raises other than yearly cost of living raises. Many are very good at what they do but this is all they know, so there isn't much else for them, which I find common with many technical jobs in every industry I have worked in. They pigeon hole you into a highly specialized 70-90k a year job and that's all you'll ever do and you're doomed to be stuck in the middle class forever.

Long term, I am hoping to transition out of a ""hands on technical role"" to something that has a little more versatility and less specialization. Ideally, I'd like to move into something that involves B2B sales or project management since those careers have way more upside, are more lucrative, and have way more versatility and transferrable skills than a technical engineering type career would have.

So, for those that transferred to a more administrative and business oriented role from a technical role, how did you do it? My plan is to do this field service engineer job for 2ish years before looking for something else.",One-Group-3575,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1740764759,2025-02-28 17:45:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0dm4s/currently_a_field_service_engineer_how_do_i/,2,2025

First is cyber security. With my current tech experience and some new certifications I should be qualified to get an entry level position at least from what I've been told.

The second is project management. I have a lot of project and people management experience and would obtain certifications in this area as well. This seems like it may be the faster/easier transition to make.

1j0czqx,"Layoff at 28, with a twist","As mentioned in the title, I’m at a crossroads in my career. I am still an active employee at my company, with employment ending at the end of March. After that, I will be receiving one year of my salary and COBRA premiums due to things I cannot legally discuss. I have about 8 years of experience in my field, and have worked at Fortune 500 companies for all of my career and have an MBA.  

With that said, my family and I (wife and young son) are already financially sound with 401k, real estate, small side business, and brokerage accounts. We’ve discussed that if I don’t find the right fit by the end of the summer, we may rent our house out for a year and move abroad to Mexico City. We are both Mexican and American citizens, and my wife was not going to work starting in August anyways to care for our son. 

I guess the guidance I’m looking for is, does it make sense to accept the first comparable job given the situation?  Or should I just fill the 12-14 month resume gap with a consulting gig/side business remotely in Mexico City, and return to the States after the year and find a comparable job?

Obviously it may be a risk returning an explaining the gap and an unpredictable job market, but it’s a happiness/quality of life play. We’ve been planning to retire early and live in Mexico/U.S., but the severance opens that door now. 

So logically, it could hurt my career. But it would also allow my wife and I to raise our son in our home country for a year, with a high quality of life in a world class city.

1j0czc4,This goes out to all German Eventmanager,"I have a question, for all employed eventmanager in germany. 

I would like to briefly 
outline my carrer and the working conditions in my company first before asking, so that it is mabey easier to get where i am coming from.   

I work in a family held business for a long time now, it started as a side job in the gastronomie while school and studying and ended with me working there, because i realized that college was at that point in life not for me and i rather make a Vocational training at the business i am at. The 3 years working full time there in the gastronomie were brutal to say the least. From having constantly to fill in for colleagues who didnt show up, to 16-18 hour days, to working 2-3 weeks straight without a day off,to our chef beeing kind of an asshole, but at least a lovely asshole, it was hell. I could and can not be really mad at him because even though he was my boss, we get along really well in private and we have talked about our mental problems a lot, while he was my instructor. He supported me, even though he also was the one beeing kind of partly responsible for all that shit. After my exams i told everyone that i could not work like this anymore and i would leave. They were understanding and offered me to stay until i got something new, but another department,our Eventmanagement,who i worked with closely while catering the events,saw me and offered me a position. I am to this day very thankful to the head of the departement, she is a wonderful women and knows her job really well. And she teaches me a lot. So now i am in the office and i really got to see, how much is wrong in the upper office level. Thats antoher reason i can not be mad at my old chef, we were chronicaly underemployed because he was not allowed to hire new people, because saving money is more important then the health of such exchangeable workers. At least that has changed since the new HR guy was hired,he was now allowed to hire but after coroni, it is not as easy as it was before,so now he struggles with that. 

What else is important, is that i love my workplace, i love the people i have worked with, i love the feeling of beeing a family and that after so many years,i know like almost everyone and get along with almost all of them, and that says something because we are around 450 employees. 

Since we are a family business, there is also the family involved, i wont get too much into that, in case someone knows them, but they have a lot of firms and they dont ""work"" anymore, they just decide what they want, tell us employees that and it does not matter what it cost or how it is done (or if it is even possible) they just want us to do it.
Sometimes these ideas are genius, i will not argue that, but in a lot of cases, they just make the work for us really bad. 
They have a lot of money and gain even more, so they dont really have a connection to normal life. And hell, i dont know if i would have that, if i were in their positions. 

But what bothers me, and here comes my question, they always expect you to be there when they want something. Like its Monday, they come in and want you to organize a 50 People event for the weekend, where i normaly dont have to work, except it is an event. It does not bother me to organize the event, to have to hustle, it bothers me that i am expected to cancel my private life, in such a short notice, just that they can entertain their friends. (Thats a bit rude, they also make connection for the businesses but hell).

So my question is: 
Is it just the eventmanagement per se? Is it normal in your firm, that you have such short notices for your personal plans? That it is expected to prioritize your work over your personal life ? 

I get that a lot of eventmanager 'live for the job' because it is quite fullfilling, but for me after those years where i literally had no time for my friends, had to tell them 'no' so often or even worse cancel because somebody did not come to work and i had to fill in or other shit,i dont know if i should keep going on like that.

I mean the position i am holding now is still heaven compared to the time in the gastronomie. But are there companys out there where you can plan your life, at least two weeks in advance while working as eventmanager? 
And that, if something does come up, they respect it when you tell them you have private plans? 
Are there better options or should i just live with it, because i love my workplace in all these other aspects and should be happy i got that? 
Should i just move on to a new direction, because it seems that eventmanagement is not right job for me ?

1j0crx0,In new role for 7 months. Job is not what I was expecting. What are my options?,"Hi all. 

I took a promotion about six months ago. Partly because I could have used the money, but also because it is supposed to be a more senior position. I feel like I have taken a step back in terms of responsibility. 

From the get go, it was explained to me I would be in charge of X and she would be in charge if Y with some crossover here and there. That hasn’t been the case. She’s been doing pretty big projects on C stuff as well as her own. For some reason, that bothers me. Maybe because in my previous role, I was the go to guy for my stuff. 

She is the go to person for everything. My stuff and hers. She’s doesn’t really direct anyone back to me for what’s supposed to be mine. The projects that I thought were supposed to be mine she has been leading and working on. 

As far as how she is, she seems like a nice woman and to genuinely care about her employees. I’ve tried to kind of talk to her in different ways about this, but haven’t really had much success. Things I’ve tried include volunteering to take things off her plate and volunteering for my own tasks or even just trying to get clarification on who is leading something. She kind of just reiterates we’re all a team yada yada. The feedback I have received has been positive and I’ve been doing a good job. 

The one thing I think that bothers me about all this is that we both agree that one should own their own career and not rely on the manager, how can I make myself stand out and capture accomplishments if she is just doing those things? For example, there is a big initiative with tariff reduction and she is the one working with our vendors and negotiating no matter who technically is supposed to own X or Y. 

The only thing changing is I am getting a new boss but she is becoming his boss.  I guess I feel undervalued and underutilized.

Company A is expecting me to make a decision soon, probably by Monday. I would like to ask them for more time so I can see if I get offers from Company B or Company C as well.

What’s the best way to ask for an extension without risking the offer? Should I mention that I’m still interviewing elsewhere, or is there a better way to phrase it?

1j0bs12,Did I gave up too quick?,"



hi, I was approached some time ago to work in the special education. I am a speech therapist and normally I work 1 on 1 with a client. However, within this school I was assigned a class of 5 kids. So I would be working in a classroom setting, along with a teaching assistant. The goal was to encourage speech and language skills and communication. The children are non verbal and very autistic, ages 4-6. When I started it suddenly turned out to be 7 children instead of 5 (I had not been told this). There were no toys in the class even though the class had started a month earlier. There was no onboarding, no one knew what the intention was and I had to figure everything out on my own.The assistant couldn't tell me much either, she just returned after a burnout. I had no access to children's files (only after 4 days).Parents had been told that I was on vacation for a month and therefore did not attend earlier (I was still working at my former employer, why say I was on vacation???).

After 2 days the assistant got sick, apparently she had just started again after a burnout, but again she was not doing well. Then a teacher came into the classroom, this was nice because for the first time I saw how it worked in a classroom. The next day another assistant was put with me, but she had started the same day as me..we were both new and didn't know much yet. The next day I was all alone in a group of 7 children. Totally irresponsible and not okay towards the parents and children.I had to entertain these children without toys.

I indicated that I have no experience with a class, since you normally work 1 on 1, and that I do need something of help/help. I also indicated that I was surviving and did not experience the first week as positive. My supervisor was quite light-hearted about this.She indicated that this is normal and everyone feels this way the first 6 weeks.Then I was asked how I wanted to work towards the goals of this class, I indicated that treatment materials should be provided first.“Oh, we may have to order that...indeed there are no toys,” was her reply. Then she said “maybe we should sit down next week to discuss things”.

Colleagues were not okay with me not receiving guidance and said there should be a teacher in front of the group instead of a speech therapist (and on reflection, I agreed).I have no experience in a classroom setting and much more was covered than just language development, speech and communication. Behavioral problems etc., personal care (1 day I was just wiping butts). There were many employees with burnout, a lot of employee turnover.Not much seemed right about the organization.The supervisor said “you don't really need to do anything with the kids”.

After my first week, I immediately quit and left. The lack of treatment materials/toys, no supervision, onboarding, lack of communication. It all didn't feel right and thats where my decision was based on. Now looking back, I'm thinking: should I gave it more time? Maybe I would have get used to it. I don't know.

1j0aoel,Other developer keeps lying,"I work with another developer who is 66 years old, I am half his age, and I was hired as a senior developer while he doesn't have a ""senior"" title but is a senior. He must have felt pretty angry when I was hired, because since day one he has been making up lies about my code. The problem is, that I am the only other developer so I try to tell the manager about the lies, and he just wants to keep the peace and doesn't want this other developer to leave because he is afraid that his functional knowledge is needed and that his old processes and whatnot will somehow break and cause a disaster.

He could be right, but the problem is that now this guy gets away with anything he wants to do. He always presents things with a false bravado and is a major narcissist wanting to control everything. He flat out refused to add me as an admin for 2 years to contact customer support for the ERP I work with (I am the main specialist on it) while he was willing to add others, even though the manager told him to add me 2 years ago. He also would blame issues in his code on me because ""I touched it"" even though they weren't from my portion of the code. The manager would believe him since he has seniority, despite me telling him that was not the case. He also tries to make me look bad on meetings with these lies, so even if I catch them later it's hard to bring up without being awkward.

I am now having health issues because he keeps attacking me in really malicious ways on our calls and I suddenly started having panic attacks when he comes up to speak and says something like ""I fixed script ABC and it had a major inefficiency"" which was actually a script of his that was crashing due to out of memory issues that I fixed, then when I asked him what he was fixing since I added a batching mechanism to handle his erroneous code, he says ""it's a very high priority issue of inefficiency"" which was with how own original code but yet he claims ""your update was just a quick fix"" then he eventually realized that my fix was in fact needed, and added it back to his own new script. Repackaging my work as his.

He walks away sometimes when I talk on meetings, or will rub his head like he has a horrible headache whenever I speak. He wiped my code out of the dev environment many times with work in progress so the manager eventually separated us and doesn't have us work together, but he still manages to make every meeting miserable for me by always being on the attack. One time I didn't talk, and on that meeting he said ""You mean we can't just be creeps and lurk?!"" when a coworker asked him a question.

He has lied and claimed to be the lead programmer on client calls when I first started, which I told the manager about and he said ""he's just trying to understand where he fits in"". He has about 50% as much code as me yet has worked here 6-7 years and I've been here 2 years, so the code output is very low. Not to mention his code is a nightmare to work with since it has commented out junk all over, misspellings, logs that sometimes log millions of lines, no error handling, etc...yet he claims to have been VP of development for a very large company which will remain unnamed (he actually just was developing a small app for them). I tried to introduce coding standards and my manager said ""no I don't want to do that"" in fear of getting the guy upset. I want to leave the job at this point, but I have major health issues (hoping for remission this year) that I am concerned about flaring up as this job does have a relatively low workload and pay is decent, but the stress is starting to make me wonder. In an ideal world my manager would actually not let him keep saying out of line stuff, but he comes from a culture where they always respect their elders, no matter how horrible they are.",Loose_Size4354,2,0.7599999904632568,15,1740757559,2025-02-28 15:45:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1j0aoel/other_developer_keeps_lying/,2,2025
1j0ak5v,feeling down - missed opportunities,"I'm really struggling with some feelings about my career trajectory and could use some perspective from others who might have gone through something similar.

I went to school for fine art and completed several social media and marketing-related internships during my time there. After graduating, I tried really hard to get an entry-level marketing role, but they're extremely limited where I'm located. When you search for ""marketing entry level jobs"" here, all that comes up are random low-paying retail or merchandising positions, or worse - MLMs and door-to-door sales disguised as marketing.

There's one job in particular that I still feel sad about not getting. The hiring manager and I connected really well - we met for coffee before my formal interview and talked about my goals and the company. I felt like we were on the same page, and I was excited about the possibility. During my second interview, there was one additional member from the leadership team who I just feel like didn't click with me. That interview was tough.

When I found out I didn't get the role, I was devastated. What made it harder was seeing they hired someone who had way less relevant experience than me. Part of me wishes they'd hired someone who was objectively more qualified, because now I can't help wondering if racial bias played a role in their decision.

I'm in a support/admin role now, which is fine - I needed a job urgently after graduation and couldn't wait around for another ideal marketing opportunity. The pay is decent, and my direct manager is respectful. But I sometimes feel sad thinking about all the statistics for African Americans in marketing jobs compared to how many of us are in lower-paying admin/support roles.

All the anti-DEI rhetoric lately makes me especially sad because I never see it play out the way critics claim, where supposedly unqualified Black people get jobs they shouldn't have. If anything, I see overqualified Black candidates getting overlooked for roles they're perfectly suited for.

I think about how different my career trajectory might be if I had the time and support system to wait for the perfect job. My current position is pretty good, and I feel compensated well, but it just feels less respected than the marketing roles I saw myself in before.

Has anyone else dealt with similar disappointments or have advice for moving forward?

I currently travel for work Monday through Friday and drive home every weekend which is 5 hours one way. I make 25 an hour with overtime. Plus I take home 400 per diem since I sleep on a couch. So take home is around 6k it’s not the best kind of living I get home super late but it’s an easy stress free job. I get weekends off guaranteed and no stress juts no time during week. I do get Christmas and thanksgiving off like the whole week tho.

There’s a local job hiring 20 an hour starting I’ll probably take home around 2600 to 3000 on a good day. But 8-5pm and I’m home.

I do currently have roommates so that gives me a 1k surplus. But roommates are flaky.

Should I take the local job? The local job will be a tad bit more stressful with cameras in truck and more micromanagement but I’m home every day tho so social life may be better.

1j05hj0,Paid Sabbatical at 28,"
As the title notes, I am currently dealing with an upcoming paid sabbatical at the end of next month. Long story short, I was given a year’s severance plus COBRA premiums from my employer. I have a strong resume and have worked at large Fortune 500 companies in my career. 

I’m thinking that if I don’t find a job by the end of the summer, I may take a year of living in Mexico City with my wife and son and starting a consulting gig for my profession, or continuing my side gig remotely of buying/selling cars in my family business. Our mortgage payment is less than our area’s rental comps, and it would be cool to watch my son grow up in a world-class city in his ancestral country. Our quality of life is good in the States, but we live in a very suburban and isolating community in the States. Our quality of life would go up dramatically if we pulled this off for a year. We are both Mexican and American citizens so residency isn’t an issue. 

The plan would be to come back after a year to start the corporate grind again, I think the key would be to fill the resume gap with consulting or certifications. I’m thinking August 2025-2026. It’s a unique position to be in, and we’re already in a strong financial position without the severance. So it’s a happiness and quality of life play.

I’ve been burnt out from handling students, training staff, admin work, meetings, and client care—often staying late and skipping lunch due to a lack of support. I am not the only one to do this, staff members on another team would do the same if needed and it’s almost as if we are expected to do so to meet client needs.

Since my departure will leave them with no team, I’m unsure how much notice to give.

I’m also considering returning as a per diem employee as I want to take a small break from full time healthcare but still make some income with a more flexible schedule which per diem provides. Their standard per diem rate is good but it’s fixed, but if they expect me to train new full-time hires, I want to negotiate a higher rate for that.

1j001c2,I don't know what career to choose even after a gap year.,"TL;DR- I took a gap year to pick a career but I'm even more lost now than before. I'm not really passionate about anything. I like human biology, business/entrepreneurship, dance. I value money but also work-life balance. I'd really appreciate any advice on picking a career. 

  
Okay so, I'm 18 years old and I graduated from high school last year. I decided to take a gap year because I couldn't pick a career. Almost a year later I feel even more lost.    
Firstly, about the gap year. Last year my main options were becoming a Psychologist, or going to med school (to become a Psychiatrist or a Dermatologist). I couldn't choose between the two and I was forced to take a gap year (because I ran out of time to make a proper decision). Now after having done some research (mainly google, chatgpt, reddit), I feel like both aren't good options. With Psychology, post grad is absolutely necessary, and I don't mind that. But competition is really high right now and it seems to be difficult to get into post grad programs. It is possible to go into a different field with a Bachelor's in Psychology (like wealth management, data science, something related to AI, HFE, Law, roles with an MBA etc) but honestly there is just too much uncertainty with the entire field. When it comes to medicine, it seems like a great option but the only issue is that I kind of hate studying. I really don't know if I can handle the amount of course work.   
Over the past few months I have looked into literally every single field/industry out there and I have found nothing that seems interesting. I even got a career guidance counsellor but I couldn't find anything. I am currently just keeping my options open- I've applied to colleges for psychology courses, I also plan on writing NEET and IMAT. I'm currently also looking into biotech as a possible option. In general I have truly wasted this gap year. I haven't done anything productive, haven't even left the house much really. It was a really amazing opportunity to try new stuff, but I couldn't bring myself to focus on anything (not even my hobbies) because of the stress of having to choose a career. I've basically just been rotting away in bed everyday. Now it feels like I've run out of time. I feel like I'm falling behind, especially when I see all my classmates having everything figured out, enjoying college. I really feel like a failure.   
About the actual career stuff, I've realised that I have no real passion towards anything. I kind of just want a stable job which gives me the time and money to invest into my hobbies and interests. I think I value work life balance more than a high salary.   
For some more background, in school I liked Biology(mainly human biology). I think I like Psychology but I didn't enjoy studying it formally in school. I'm not really good at other subjects and I don't have any skills that I'm naturally good at. I actually don't like the idea doing therapy and also direct patient care (like in nursing or primary care). My main hobby is dance and it is something I want to pursue professionally. I also like the idea of entrepreneurship/business but right now I just feel really stupid- I don't actually know anything, and I think in my head it's like ""become a millionaire and escape the matrix 😈"" lmao. I want to learn more but I cannot imagine doing either without a proper career as a safety net. Honestly there are even more layers to it, like I'm very self conscious and I don't know if any interest that I have in something is actually just about impressing others or looking cool. But anyways.   
Just feeling confident in picking some degree and having some sense of direction would be like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions because I don't know what to do anymore.

1izzxo6,High school geography teacher or traffic management?,"I am at a crossroads at the moment in my career. I am 25 years old with a background in traffic management, tourism, operations and retail. I love travelling and learning about the world. I am looking to pursue a career as a high school geography teacher, but I have no experience as a teacher or teaching geography and to be honest I find it quite daunting standing in front of a classroom. Whilst I like this career there is a significant amount of investment that I have to make and historically teacher make very little pay for the work and time they put in.

This job also pay incredibly well in Australia and New Zealand where I currently live and there is lots of career progression into STMS roles, leadership, management and traffic planning, and also the ability to travel and work on different sites.

1izwvp6,Interviewer wants to collaborate on unpaid project before hiring decision,"
I'm a scientist in one area, but am currently working in an entirely different area (so different I'm sure there are not many people with my combination of experience). I'm currently looking for a new job that takes me a little closer to what I was doing.

I just had an interview for a position I'm really excited about. I'm not sure if I have exactly the experience they're looking for, but it was pleasant and we had good conversation. The interviewer mentioned that however it goes for the role I was interviewing for, they're interested in working with me to develop a research project that combines my two divergent areas of experience.

If I had the job, I would love to work on this project. But as it is, I'm pretty consumed with the job hunt and have my own projects going neglected. 

I just got an email from the interviewer inquiring about my interest in developing the project and I'm not really sure how to handle this interaction. It'll be more than a month before I hear back about the hiring decision. Of course, I want to increase my chances of a job offer and it'd be good to have this professional contact, but I'm not in a place to be doing much unpaid work right now.

What should I do? Say that I can't? Try and make it work? Is there some middle ground?

I'm also not sure why they'd bring this up when they did? Why not wait until after the hiring decision?

I’m in my last year of my electrical engineering degree, and for the past 1.5 years, I’ve been interning at a large multinational company (e.g., Hitachi, GE Vernova, Siemens, Schneider...), assisting the engineering team with substation construction tasks. At this point, I’ve gained a lot of knowledge and can handle more complex tasks.

1izsnvx,How to navigate damage to my reputation that is unfair / not rooted in facts?,"TL;DR: I'd love to set the record straight about perceived errors that have led to me being strictly reprimanded, but it feels at this point in the process like a battle I can't win. I'm concerned about the damage done to my reputation, especially with my **manager** (since I no longer have to work with the other person who is upset with me, the **Project Manager**\---at least for the next 6 months or so). I'm also a little bit concerned that this could lead to being fired, but I should be able to turn things around on the next project. I've been successful on many such projects in the past.

I'm neurodivergent and would really appreciate the wisdom of the crowd on this situation---it feels incredibly tricky to me.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. If I'm missing context or detail, please ask me for it!

\- I am a seasoned consultant doing project-based work.

\- I either had a weird personality/work-style clash OR broke one or more unspoken rules and lost the trust of my Project Manager. It's unclear to me what I did that was SO offensive, but this bullet is for context and I'm not looking for advice on this piece. I'm working through it.

\- After that, it started to feel like I could do nothing right, and I started getting harshly worded emails accusing me of fuck ups that I did not do. I felt scolded like a child. And I was never asked to weigh in on the alleged fuck ups. Assumptions everywhere.

\- I went to my *manager* who advised me to go to HR. I also requested to be moved to another project.

\- The request to be moved to a new project was honored by the company, however, my manager sent me a strongly worded email shortly thereafter about my need to improve my performance. The inaccuracies that I *thought* I had set the record straight on *were still a part of my official documentation (this strongly worded email).* Yet again, I am left feeling unheard and unseen. Just a persona non grata.

At this point I'm not sure how to navigate this situation and the options I've identified all seem icky for different reasons. 

I'm happy with being moved to another project, but very unhappy with how my manager *seemed* to listen to me, then proceeded to perpetuate the assumptions and other bullshit that triggered my original complaint. 

Should I try talking this out with him? It feels so tedious at this point. We've already gone through all of the points I would need to rehash.

Should I go to HR about him too? (What will *that* do to my reputation? I don't want to seem defensive. My manager has framed all of this as ""feedback"" and I've been encouraged to be open to that feedback.)

Should I just reply to his email and state my case, for the record (with evidence, which I have that show some of the alleged fuck ups were not my fuck ups -- but not all)? I could state that I want to put this all behind us but just wanted my POV on the record.

**Bonus info! My manager's POV:**  He says that whether the accusations against me are true or false doesn't matter. What matters is my colleagues' perceptions of me. My response to that is: why can't we set the record straight with any colleagues that have got the wrong end of the stick? (Example: I was lambasted for not using the right template, but I used the ***only*** *template I was given* by my PM. It was later decided that the template would need to be changed. A new person came on to the team who wasn't privy to this decision. When she saw that I had used an old template, she assumed it was in error, and cited this when my manager pulled 360 feedback from her.)

Thank you!!

1izrs0m,I was told I’d be the team lead… I’m not,"I recently transferred within my organization, and my new role is not at all as advertised. About a month ago, I had an informal interview with both my new manager and director about my role on their team. I have a lot of experience in my field, so they both told me that they wanted me transferred immediately so I could be the team lead of their new project. I was transferred pretty much immediately, and I am not the team lead. I actually don’t even have a definitive role on the project. 

I was told that they’re looking for another person with experience to be the lead of the project and one of our current team members will be the co-lead. I guess that’s fine, but the current team member who is going to be “co-lead” is very inexperienced and does not know what she’s doing. She’s super nice, so I want to be a good team player, but I am also extremely confused why she’s in the role over me, especially if I’m going to be doing all the work because she doesn’t know how to. I probably should have a conversation with my manager and director. But I also don’t want to be whining and make a bad first impression.

1izrrzb,Salary Negotiation,"Hi everyone,

I recently was extended an offer for an entry-level Environmental Scientist position at a consulting firm.

I graduated with my B.A. Environmental Studies May '24, and will be graduating with M.S. Engineering Sustainability May '25.
The salary is around 60k annually (I believe the job posting range was up to 80k). I've been interning with the firm that offered me the full time position since June ‘24 - so it'll be a year with the company by the time I start the full-time gig.

I've negotiated salary before, but for a summer internship so stakes weren't as high. Based on my education and current experience with the company, do we think I could push the upper end of the range? I'm going to do company/region/education specific research as well before contacting HR, I just wanted some real-life opinions. I don’t have many early-career friends IRL that aren’t at my company already…

1izqwan,Should I (24M) quit my job after 1 year?,"Some background context: I'm relatively new in my career, with 2-3 years of work experience after my bachelor's. I studied in a foreign country and ended up sticking around after university, which made it harder to find jobs. After graduating, I also wasn't sure which direction to take my life, so I ended up working in Communications due to my passion for writing and the fact that it was easier to find a job in this area. I intend to do a master's degree in the future to pivot towards my ""true passion"", and my rough plan before then was to take this period to gain work experience and try to figure out my life.

My current position is a full-time junior role (1-year contract) in a rather traditional industry and corporate environment. I worked more in tech/startup remote roles before this, so acclimating to corporate office life was definitely an adjustment. The work itself is enjoyable enough, pay is ok, and there are nice benefits (gym membership, free lunch, etc.). Objectively speaking, I'm lucky to have landed this position, but I'm miserable. I don't think I'm a good culture fit for this company, and I just don't seem to click with my team members/manager (it's a small team with little leadership experience, and it shows). While I have periods where the job seems okay, I keep coming back to this baseline of misery. I'm always tired, and it feels like I have no time outside of work. I dread waking up in the morning and stay up late every night procrastinating sleep. It's not so bad that I'm sure I want to leave but also not good enough to make me want to stay.

I am now coming up to the 9-month mark, when they will tell me if they want to renew/upgrade my contract. I expect they will offer me another 1-year contract, and I had initially planned to take it. Over the next year, there will be big growth opportunities due to business developments, and I would like to shed the ""junior"" from my job title before leaving. However, the prospect of working another year at this company sort of fills me with dread. I would like to keep growing here, and leaving would put my team in a tough position, but I know I don't want to be in this industry/position long-term. I do have enough money saved up to survive for a decent amount of time afterwards (maybe 6 months).

Ultimately, it seems I have three main options:

1. Stick it out and continue climbing the corporate ladder for at least another year.
2. Look for a new job (most likely in comms), ideally having one lined up but not essential.
3. Apply to my master's now to pivot towards what I really want to be doing (I have a few solid ideas but still not certain).

While I know I want to leave, I worry that 1 year may be too little time at this job. I'm also in sort of a down period, emotionally speaking, so things aren't always this bad. Would love to hear advice from others further along in their career.

TL;DR - Miserable at my job; it's not so bad I need to leave but also not good enough to make me want to stay.

1izqov8,I was fired from a previous job while I was quitting—how do I explain this in interviews/on background check forms?,"A few years ago, I briefly worked at a law firm (literally for only 3 weeks) before realizing that firm was not a good fit for me and was extremely toxic. I told the COO and managing partner that I was quitting, and they responded that they were letting me go because it “wasn’t working out.” I kind of just looked at them and said “ok?” before being escorted out. I had already cleaned out my desk the day before because I knew I was coming in that day to quit and go home, and the COO and partner looked very confused that I didn’t have anything to take with me besides my purse and asked if I had everything, to which I replied “yes” and walked out of the office with them. They paid me for the rest of the week and even emailed me a letter of recommendation.  
  
Anyway, how do I explain this in interviews or on job background check forms when it asks if you’ve ever been fired from a job before? I obviously never put this job on my resume because it was such a brief stint, and it isn’t worth the questions it raises, but I don’t want to straight up lie on a background check form or to a potential employer and risk getting caught. However, I don’t know if I was technically fired since I told them I was quitting, but I know if they were ever contacted, they would say they fired me.

1izq8pq,Looking for advice on where to go from here,"Hello,

I would like some career advice and some ideas on how to go from here.

So, i have a master degree in math (focused on optimization, analysis and numerics) as well as another one in mechanical engineering (focused on automotive engineering and robotics). These are the two degrees felt accomplishing to me. 

While studying, i worked as a working student in machine learning/data science/frontend/backend/simulation and embedded system. I however ended up staying in the last company i was working in, hence why i worked 2 years long as a embedded system developer at a mid-sized company. 

Problems: 

1. Work never felt like work. It felt the whole time like i was playing around and not doing what i should be doing. I was voted the best developer in the company despite the fact that i never actually programmed anything complicated.
2. My good performance at work started to generate jealousy. I didn't care when my colleges would attack me, but once my team lead kept bullying me, putting me down and gaslighting me, i left the company.
3. I thought while leaving, that a master degree in maths, and another one in mechanical engineering, and 6 years of experience (4 of which were as a working student) in professional software development, and knowledge in electrical engineering, should make me get any job in no time. Well, it has been 3 months and i have only gotten one interview.
4. I passed the interview, but ended up refusing the offer as the work was going to take place 4 hours away in a village around nowhere. I though maybe i could keep searching. 
5. I am really quite confused, maybe the recruiters think i am overqualified? Maybe they believe i am trolling because of my low salary expectation: 60k Euro? Maybe it lies in the fact that i am a black person in Germany (i get more attention when i don't add my picture onto my CV)? I don't know.
6. I have been trying to get into Datascience and Machine Learning with my master degree in math and my experience as a working student but it has gone anywhere. I plan on keeping grinding Kaggle projects and leetcode, but still apply to what everything i can do.

What do you think i should do

P.S.: i am 28 years old.

1izomy0,"Should I swap my relaxed, flexible role for a high-pressure growth opportunity?","
TL;DR:
I'm a software engineer who wants backend experience but has been stuck on frontend work. After a reorg, I'm managing projects that don't align with my growth goals, and my manager hasn't supported my backend ambitions. I recently had a chance to join a promising new team with leadership opportunities, but that team is high-pressure with fixed hours, unlike my current flexible team that supports more family time. I'm torn between comfort and growth.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—I've only been in the corporate world for two years.

Context:

I work as a software engineer at a company. I got promoted last year; the work was satisfactory, and I got to work on multi-quarter projects. However, during a reorganization, our projects were transferred to other teams, and my entire team was assigned to a project from the USA—except for me.

I have worked exclusively on the frontend throughout my career and have always wanted to work on the backend as well. Luckily, I had the opportunity to work on a backend project, but it only lasted for one quarter.

Then there was another UI project, which led to a team member leaving due to strict deadlines and high pressure. The project had been delayed multiple times, and eventually, she resigned. My manager then told me to take over the project and drive it to completion. I became overwhelmed because, firstly, the project did not help me gain new knowledge as it was similar to my previous work, and secondly, it was such a critical project that it would be easy to pin any failure on me if I missed the deadline.

I feel that my manager neglects me—she never really asks what kinds of projects I would like to work on. I have told her multiple times that I want to work on backend projects, and she says she will keep that in mind, but nothing ever happens.

Because of this, I considered switching teams. Since I was promoted recently, I thought I might move to a team with similar or lower work pressure. I matched with a team whose product I really liked, and the manager seemed good, even mentioning that I would get to lead projects. However, the catch is that the work pressure there is very high, and the team has a startup-like culture.

Another factor is that my current team is very flexible regarding office days and work hours, while the new team has fixed days and working hours. I also tend to feel homesick quite often; my current team allows me to visit my family frequently (about six times a year, for 2–3 weeks each time), whereas the new team would likely allow only three visits per year, each lasting between one week and ten days.

After matching with the new team, I rushed and asked the manager to proceed with my application. Now, however, I am hesitant and unable to decide.

Should I stay on my current team—with a manager who doesn’t really care about my career growth, but who offers a relaxed environment and manageable workload—or should I switch to a team with better manager who actively supports my professional development and offers leadership opportunities, even though it comes with a high-pressure, less flexible work environment?
Or should I stay in the current team and wait for a better opportunity?",Just-Breadfruit5742,1,1.0,0,1740685655,2025-02-27 19:47:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1izomy0/should_i_swap_my_relaxed_flexible_role_for_a/,2,2025

1iznjz2,Should I leave my current job for a temporary position?,"I've been working full-time hours under the part-time title for almost five years now. I was hired for the weekends and holidays, which I like because the environment is less chaotic, and there are no supervisors to micro-manage every little thing you do. But there was always a surplus of work during the week, and I'd always have hours.

But recently, they've cut my hours to where I ONLY work the weekends now, and I'm off for weeks at a time, unpaid. The reason being could be one of two things.

One, a co-worker of mine (who was also hired for weekends) found a loophole in the system and got to keep the weekends, plus guaranteed days during the week (which my supervisors said was impossible to do), which apparently caused a shakeup in the payroll, and my hours got slashed as a result so I wouldn't attempt the same maneuver. 

Two, I'm pretty sure one of the supervisors has a problem with me. I'm not too fond of him either, but it seems like he'd rather keep me at home and overwork his current staff. 

I applied for a different position within the same company, but the hiring manager told me it's only temporary because the person I'd be filling in for is on a leave of absence for an undisclosed amount of time. Could be less, could be longer. I'm not exactly sure, but I know once that person comes back, I'd be out, and I wouldn't be bounced back to my old department. I'd have to call HR for help to put me somewhere that's available.

after i accepted this offer, i got sent an invite for another interview somewhere else - its a state job that starts at $21.25 an hour, and has overtime available, but its not really something i want to be doing. it would be admin work/customer service for legislation and politicians, and proofreading paperwork. i don’t really care about politics, and i don’t like the idea of working for politicians honestly. but then i wouldn’t have to be working a second job to make ends meet if i was offered this position. also, municipal benefits are amazing overall.

Hi everyone! I’m posting this for my significant other! He’s really not sure what to do in this situation, and I’m honestly not sure of what advice I can really give, so I figured some of you might have input! He also really does love this job and his boss is a great guy! 


Need some salary advice. I recently had my annual review. For context, I have been with the company for 2 years now. Everything went very well, lots of praise. At the end of my review, I was told I would be receiving a raise to $33 an hour (currently making $29). Beyond excited that I was worth that much of an increase to the company. A few hours go by and my boss pulls me aside. He apparently made a mistake and wanted to give me a $2 raise, so I would be at $31. Obviously very disappointed. On one hand, I understand mistakes happen and we are human. On the other hand, there wasn't an issue with paying me $33 an hour until the error was realized. Do I move on and be grateful, or do I approach my boss and ask him to reconsider or meet me in the middle?

1izmkul,Should I ask this job to reconsider my application?,"A little over a month ago, I applied to this entry level position at a law firm. It's sort of a hard position to find–it's only on their website and only recently got advertised on indeed. The way to apply was to email them your resume and a cover letter. After my initial application, I waited around two weeks for a response, before I sent a follow-up email. Then, I wanted another two weeks and still heard nothing. A month or so has passed. I decided to give the place a call, and despite my many attempts, no one picked up the phone. Lastly, I got the idea to call a different location under the same law firm, and the nicest lady picked up, took my information, and said she would pass it on to someone at the firm.

I want to note that the position calls for someone with no prior experience at all and states that they're willing to train, and arguably I have some transferable experience. Again, it is entry level.

Within two hours or so, I got a rejection email. However, the email was vague, and it seemed like the person who sent it did not review my application truly. I mean I could be wrong, but they used vague language. They said that given their current needs, they cannot offer me a position and cannot extend an employment offer, but I never even interviewed there. They also emailed me from a different email that's advertised for applying, but it is still under the same email thread. It makes me wonder if they were even able to see my resume and cover letter. Plus, they're also a new hire at the firm. 

I'm just bummed because I've been job searching for so long, and this position is remote, which is great for me because I'm chronically ill and it's extremely difficult for me to keep an in person job anymore honestly. My body just can't do it, and I have no life outside of work if I work in person because the other half of my day I'm just recovering. I feel as if I wasn't given a fair chance with this job at all. I'm just tired of having to job hunt for remote or hybrid positions I could do, since it narrows down my options, and getting even a call back is hard these days.

The question is, should I call the job and ask for reconsideration? I was thinking of calling the location that does pick up and explain that while I understand if they moved forward with other candidates, but if not, I would love to be reconsidered as I believe I could be a great asset to their esteemed team and emphasize that I find their work admirable (which I truly do, it's a part of why I want this job so bad). I don't wanna look back in a month or so and regret not attempting again. Worst thing is that they say no again. Best thing, I get an interview.

1izmbfd,Resigning Gracefully from a Job You Always Knew You Would Leave,"Looking for advice in an uncomfortable situation. Last August, I resigned from a senior director level position I'd been in for 5+ years without another job lined up. I was contemplating going to law school, so I spent that time studying for/taking the LSAT while looking for a new job - which proved more difficult than I'd (perhaps foolishly) anticipated. After a couple of unsuccessful months of searching/interviews, I started to apply for positions several steps below my experience level as employment became an immediate financial necessity. 

I ended up starting a job in January 2025 several steps below my experience level at an organization I feel really good about. While their work isn't squarely within my issue area/passion, they exist in the same ecosystem I will end up in after law school. 

Though I didn't outright lie in the interview process, I certainly did not tell them that I was planning to go to law school full time in the fall (though at that point I had not been admitted to any schools, so there was always a chance that things wouldn't shake out). The reality was that I desperately needed money coming in, and being transparent about the fact I only planned to hold this job for eight months would have killed me out of the gate. It was a risk I couldn't take.

Every day I go to work I feel immense guilt. I tell myself that surely they must know that given how many steps down in seniority this job was, I'm not planning to be here for long (might make me sound like an asshole, but it's what I say to make myself feel better). Part of me wants to tell them sooner rather than later, but I also can't risk them transitioning me out too early, as I'm going to need that paycheck right up until I start school.

  
TLDR; I did not disclose my law school plans in the hiring process for my current role, fearing it would cost me the opportunity. I feel guilty about the lack of transparency, but can't afford to lose the income before school starts by telling them too early.

As things have picked up, it is becoming abundantly clear that everyone I work with is doing twice the amount of work (the same duties for both brands). There have been no moves to help alleviate the workload, and it’s clear to me that leadership didn’t feel like paying a whole second team to work on the new brand.

1izklst,Should I make a change? I’ve been back and forth in my head.,"I currently have a WFH role in a billing department making 55k. I had no previous experience in this line of work and have learned a ton when it comes to understanding project contracts and agreements to the software used to bill clients, as well as features on Excel. 

However, I don’t spend much time actually working. I have a lot of free time and have enjoyed being able to get things done around the house, make my meals, and avoiding a commute. Sometimes I’ll play video games, go on long walks, take a nap, go to the gym. I love the freedom of being able to meet my mom for lunch or spend time at my grandma’s house, or even get a head start to the weekend by taking my laptop with me wherever I go. 

I’ve just recently started to look for a new job because I’m coming up on 3 years and I don’t see much growth in this department, unless I want to wait it out. Of course I’ll gain more experience and learn more analytics as I wait it out… so I keep convincing myself there isn’t a need to give up what I currently have because I do feel really lucky to have such an opportunity.

But I don’t find my work fulfilling, I’d like a little more money and my previous experience is in customer service, management, investigative case writing and compliance. I’m just not sure where to start looking, or if I’d be desirable with my recent experience in billing.

1izh3v3,Two weeks notice up tomorrow,"I work in a warehouse. In the past 8 weeks we have been subject to overtime everyday. 

A little backstory. Originally the shift is 11am-7:30. We have not gotten out at 7:30 in months. Regularly it’s become 9-10 hour days. Not only that we are controlled by an algorithm, and supervisors are always on our case for efficiency and never working fast enough. The management solution to avoid so much overtime is to work harder. This comes when there is record turnover and we can’t keep people. 

Two weeks ago I could not take it, I put in my two weeks and that comes to pass with tomorrow being my last day. 

I want to quit so bad. It’s the same old story, where I don’t mind the work, I really like many of my coworkers, but the higher ups have killed any joy the job ever brought me. 

I currently don’t have a plan, I’m in my 50’s. I fully plan on looking for other work, but will not be looking for warehouse work again. 

My original plan was to, “Go where the wind takes me”. I just need a job with benefits, but no longer want a job this physical again. 

Many employees and one manager have been trying ti get me to stay. 

On a personal note there is so much I want to do, more than just working all this overtime. It’s really just to keep benefits. It’s not even about the money, it’s specifically about the overtime and not wanting 50 hours a week. I’m more than fine with the 40 hours. 

Should I stay or should I go. ",stonecoldmark,7,0.8299999833106995,1,1740666751,2025-02-27 14:32:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1izh3v3/two_weeks_notice_up_tomorrow/,2,2025

1izezqk,Feel like I was passed over without a proper reason. Any advise?,"Long post and possible 
I was hired in my current company 2 years back as a lead when they were building a team in India. The current team was completely based in US and I was the first hire here. This meant that there was little to no support available locally. The manager who I reported to handles a totally different function of dev team and does not really have experience in what i do, so he wanted to hire a lead who could transition work here and build a team around it. So while I reported to the manager here technically, my work came from the US team. Over the 2 years I worked hard and transitioned a lot of responsibilities to here. I also grew the team to 4 full timers and 4 interns. We started supporting more work and the folks in US and my manager here are very happy with my and my teams work. My manager here also pushed me to lead the team by including me in all the decisions around the team, like hiring and planning. It felt like he wanted me to grow towards managing this team at a point. 
But recently there was an org restructuring at executive level and my team was moved directly under the same VP as the US team. And since there was no manager here a position was opened. My manager did try to fight this by trying to convince that he could manage it with my support, but the decision was above his pay grade. I applied for this role but was rejected stating that I did not have enough experience. I have a total work ex of 9 years but i have always performed above that level. Even in my current company i am at the same grade as folks with 15 YOE and my next grade is that of a manager. But since I didn't have official management experience, I though wasn't happy, had partly accepted the decision. However now I saw that the person who they hired for this role has a total of 15 years and as a manager of 6 months in his previous organisation. I now feel down because of it and haven't been able to focus on work.
Anyone has any advise on this? Should I consider switching or do you think there is a reason I'm not seeing? Or am I simply being too greedy.",scar1494,0,0.5,2,1740660645,2025-02-27 12:50:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1izezqk/feel_like_i_was_passed_over_without_a_proper/,2,2025

1izbd9l,Dilemma Between Corporate Life and the actual life,"Dilemma Between Corporate Life and Returning Home

I am 23 years old and about to start my corporate journey, most likely as a System Engineer at TCS. However, I feel anxious because I don’t have financial stability yet. While I do have family property—about 20 acres of land—I desperately want to live there for my entire life. I was born and brought up in my hometown, and after experiencing cities like Delhi and Bangalore, I know I dislike the rush and chaos of big cities.

That said, I understand that humans are adaptable. If I stay in a metropolitan city, I will likely adjust over time. But my biggest fear is that if I settle in a place like Delhi, my future children will lose their roots and grow up disconnected from the life I value. I don’t want to live a life where home is just a holiday destination. Instead, I dream of leaving the corporate world to start a business—maybe a café in my town, along with a few small ventures based on my farm.

However, I don’t have the courage to make such a big decision right now. I also worry about how society perceives this lifestyle. Settling in my hometown with a non-traditional career might make it difficult to find a life partner who shares my vision.

A Possible Path Forward

The most practical solution seems to be working in the corporate sector for 5 to 10 years, saving money, and setting up a stable business before quitting and returning home. This way, I can build financial security and ensure my family’s future.

However, even with this plan, my children might still grow up disconnected from the upbringing I want for them. Additionally, switching careers could create instability, which might affect my personal life, including marriage.

Uncertainty and Fear of Regret

I don’t know if I’m overthinking or if this is just a delusion. Should I simply accept my fate, embrace corporate life, and stay away from home and loved ones permanently? Or is there a way to balance both dreams?

I failed in 3rd year, and that’s when I realized I needed to change my F life. I quit all distractions and became extremely disciplined. Now, I can focus, study, and learn anything.

While exploring career options, I got interested in AI and learned Python. But I heard getting a job in AI without relevant experience is tough for a mechanical engineering student.

1izamt9,How to Figure Out My Career Choice as an 8th Sem CS Student Doing an Internship in the Embedded Industry?,"I am a computer UG in my 8th Sem of engineering in tier 2 college and I got an internship of 6 months and the role was software automation in which i was told i will be automating repeated tasks and improving and optimizing the existing scripts, so i accepted this as to me having something in my hands was important as i was really struggling with my mental health and relationship dynamics in my personal life and having people around and having something to keep my mind of the things and loneliness this was the right thing and also somewhat aligned with my degree. But during intern I was mostly allotted tasks that were like studying documenting the existing project and it's workflow, documenting the working of scripts and some project related setup on new system. I rarely worked on more than 1 or 2 automation scripts, which makes me feel like i did learn but not as much technically.

Now they have asked me if i want to extend the internship and the main thing here is this would be unit testing role, I said i have no idea about it, you will learn I was told. Problem is Brief background: the industry i got internship is in electronics manufacturer of a few products, they mostly work on embedded so that also means testing thing will also be in embedded thing and I will get certificate with similar description.

I'm really confused, this is not a industry a CS grad would be working in, Makes me feel like won't help me in future at all even if industry exp of a year, but the thing that also goes on in my mind is I'm not technically strong, there is not much as a CS grad I know, just basics of coding, takes me quite some time to solve  easy level que of LEETCODE. there is not much tech stack i can put in my CV except Frontend tech like HTML CSS and JS, JS also i am no  better than beginner.

Now If I say no to extension here means I will have to study and sit for companies through campus which I will but considering my skills close to none and placement scenario which is pretty bad as well, and competition of 600+ peers for one position in campus, and I haven't done any coding as such in last 6 months. all these things are going on in my mind along with the fear of being alone in preparation and feeling so lonely and depressed, I don't want to feel like that again.  
so just feels like GO WITH THE FLOW AND LET THINGS BE but the fact that this won't help me in future and am choosing comfort makes me so confused.

I would be really grateful for any kind of advice, guidance and help in making decision. Thankyou.",octoviva,0,0.5,1,1740642680,2025-02-27 07:51:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1izamt9/how_to_figure_out_my_career_choice_as_an_8th_sem/,2,2025

1iz8wpz,"I need to make a rather immediate & significant jump in my income/freedom, and I need advice explaining ways that I can do it.","I am a 26(M) and I’m currently a project supervisor in the underground fiber construction industry. I’m currently making 75k salary, and I am in line to be promoted soon. The promotion is a Project Manager position that would bump my salary 20k, and I’d be tasked with opening up a whole new office for my company. I am confident that I have the skills to get the job done, but I’m aiming higher. I’ve only been in the industry for a year, and I started as an on-site field supervisor. I was promoted after 2 months, and by my 6 month review I had received 10k in raises and the promise of an upper management position upon one opening up. 

However, I’ve had a goal to find a job that allows me to make near 6 figures while also allowing me to work remotely so that I can travel. My girlfriend is a travel nurse, and we both share the same dream of traveling from state to state and experiencing the beauty of the country. I feel like I’m falling behind and time is running out for me to see this dream come true. We both want to have children in our early 30’s, and stability will be very important then, so I really only have the next 5 years to be able to pull this off. She has already been living out the dream for the last 1.5 years, and she’s been loving it. It’s been very difficult for me to watch from the sidelines while she lives out our dreams alone. She constantly talks about how she can’t wait for me to be able to participate, and it breaks my heart every day that passes where I’m stuck here barely making it.

So, with that being said, I need to figure out how I’m going to make this leap, and how to make it fast. I have extensive management experience. I was a foreman in the telecom industry for 3 years, and I’ve been managing our entire project at this company in with currently for the last year. I have made a very good reputation for myself, and I’ve gone above and beyond to prove that I am capable of handling much larger responsibilities. I also have 1.5 years of sales experience, 2 years experience in the food service industry, and 5+ years of customer service experience. 

My initial plan has been to land a project management position, and then utilize that experience to land a remote PM position at a different company. However, it will be a couple years before I can even attempt to get my PMP, and I have no college degree. The process is working, but it’s working far too slow. At this rate it’ll be 3 years before I can land a remote position. 

I’m willing to change careers if I need to. I’m willing to learn a new skill. If thought about teaching myself Python and seeking out a programming job. I’m not sure what to do. Any advice or insight would help. Any jobs that I may not know about that align with my current experience. I’m ambitious, determined, and I work my ass off.

1iz8tz6,Struggling with My New Role and Considering a Job Coach,"
Hi everyone,

I recently made a significant career move after spending 13 years with my previous company. After a lot of deliberation, I decided to leave for a new opportunity that came with an increase in salary. I asked for $100k However, the negotiation process led to me accepting a $93k increase instead, and looking back, I realize I should have aimed even higher.

The first year at my new job has been challenging. They prorated my salary increase, giving me only 2.5% instead of the 5% I anticipated, which was supposed to help me reach that original income goal. I've come to find out that my boss misrepresented my salary situation to save the company some money, and to make matters worse, my workload has been incredibly overwhelming.

Despite receiving compliments about my performance and the quality of my work, I feel undervalued in terms of compensation. They’ve mentioned a potential $10,000 bonus, but given that there are no clear metrics for my performance, I’m hesitant to count on that. I work over 12 hours a day consistently, and it feels like I’m doing a lot of the administrative work while being left out of critical decision-making processes, especially regarding sales strategies.

I'm at a crossroads and am seriously considering working with a job coach to help navigate this situation and set a clearer path for my career moving forward. If anyone has suggestions for reputable job coaches or advice on how to better handle my current position, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I’m looking forward to your insights and support!

1iz8gte,[Student] Professional Advice - SWE Intern,"Senior at a CS @ state school — graduating in December 

I am currently doing an offseason SWE internship at a company in Austin. So far I like it and it seems like the company has full intention of hiring their interns full time (so do most companies). 

Before this opportunity, I left my Summer/Fall 2024 internship for this role and it has been a good change of scenery. Fortunately, I was able to secure two offers in November last year, One for this company in the spring(now) and for Dell(summer).

I accepted my offer at Dell because the name will be great on my resume and the compensation was significantly better. Housing, bonus stipend, higher hourly pay. This is all great and I am in no way complaining. I feel a bit guilty that I did this internship knowing I had plans to leave even if they extended me an offer to continue. 

I felt I had to do this given the state of the entry level job market. 

How should I got about telling my current boss that I will be leaving in the summer? Is it right to tell him now or wait until I am about to start my new role in the summer. I get anxious about my work environment becoming something different than it is now, especially if my boss gets offended or feels like he is wasting time and money on me. 

How would you approach this as an intern? I really want to get the most out of my current role and I do not want to close any doors for the future.

Currently: 
I am a manager at a hospital and one of my new hires (32F) started a few months ago. After a few months of her working with us I became close to her (my mistake). She vented about her relationship and how she was having issues with her fiance. At the time I was also have relationship issues so we bonded over that. She asked me if I ever dating someone at work and I mistakenly told her I dated that co worker a while ago but that we are cordial. I didn’t think much of it at the time. 2 months later I noticed she was talking about him a lot and I would see them calling each other and texting. She started asking me questions about the extent of our relationship and if he still contacts me. I admittedly told her that he was weird and that I would have never worked out because he was a playboy. She didn’t say anything and more time passed however she kept asking about him and talking to him. Recently she has been telling all my co workers that I am a bad boss and that I am mean to her and don’t care about her. It is making people at work uncomfortable and I’m not sure how to handle this. It got to my boss and she confronted me about. My boss asked me if I knew what was going on with her and the guy and that she is concerned on how it is impacting her job. She also told me that the same co workers said that I am bad boss and am turning the team against each other. Not sure how to handle this situation. Looking for advice as Ive worked so hard

1iz5bdt,Need Advice on Career Path (Mechanical Engineering Final Year),"I’m in my final year of mechanical engineering with a 1-year drop. I initially took this course because my friends did and for the first three years, I barely studied—just partied, skipped classes, and played games.

Then, I failed in 3rd year and had to take a drop year. That was a wake-up call. I realized I was completely messing up my life, so I decided to change everything. I quit partying, gaming, and all distractions, and I started grinding..

While researching different career options, I came across AI, which caught my interest. I started learning Python and have built a solid foundation in it. However, people told me that as a mechanical engineering student, I wouldn’t get a direct job in AI without experience in a related field first

The problem is, I don’t know what to do next. I’m not sure what my real interest is or what career path to take. Any advice on how to move forward would be greatly appreciated.",Cheap_Ad_9195,1,1.0,1,1740623448,2025-02-27 02:30:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iz5bdt/need_advice_on_career_path_mechanical_engineering/,2,2025
1iz5b2u,False accusations,"For context, I work in a larger corporate animal hospital.

Recently, I received an email from my manager accusing me of various major infractions. Authorizing prescriptions, speaking ill of doctors, providing medical advice etc.

The more procedural concerns came down to lack of training in those areas, which they accepted responsibility, as they failed to provide me adequate training. However, my main concern were the more egregious accusations that had consequences for my employment with the hospital. I managed to demonstrate that they were false, and mischaracterizations of things that I had said and done. 

Overall, I wasn't pleased with my manager leading with accusations, instead of checking in to address those concerns with the accusing parties being present. Instead, I was blamed when I asked why they didn't approach me if they had doubts  etc. Overall, while I am happy to have cleared my name, I don't think that the meeting ended on a conciliatory note. 

I ended up reducing my hours at the hospital as a result. I took a financial hit in the process, but I'd rather have less to do with the department, especially their recent operations concerns. People's hours are being cut left and right.

Today I learned of a vacancy in another depart that I am qualified for, but I fear that I'd only be setting myself up for more internal hospital politics, and it's better to get out while I am ahead.",jr9386,1,1.0,4,1740623423,2025-02-27 02:30:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iz5b2u/false_accusations/,2,2025
1iz4lte,5 Things helped me recover from burnout while working remotely,"I still love my remote job, no commute, no uncomfortable office clothes, and I can sit like a goblin while answering emails. But after months of WFH, my motivation hit rock bottom. I’d stare at my laptop for hours, feeling drained but unable to start anything. My ADHD made it worse and I would got distracted from my phone. No structure? No accountability? My brain was on permanent vacation. I loved WFH, but sometimes I felt useless.

After months of struggle (and way too much self-loathing), I took this to my therapist. Here’s what actually helped:

\- Your brain craves novelty, so change your work environment often. Even if it’s just moving from your desk to the couch.

\- Fake a “commute” by walking around the block before work. Your brain needs a transition.

\- Gamify boring tasks. Set a 5-minute timer and try to beat it. Your brain thrives on urgency. If you can’t focus, switch tasks instead of forcing yourself to power through. Momentum > perfection.

\- Eat before work. Low blood sugar = no dopamine = staring blankly at the screen.

\- Take real breaks. Scrolling TikTok doesn’t count. Walk, stretch, or stare at a tree for five minutes.

My therapist also threw a bunch of book recs at me. If you’re feeling the same way as I did, here are five books that may really help:

\- Your focus is being stolen - “[Stolen Focus](https://www.befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari)” by Johann Hari. 

If you think your attention span is shrinking, it’s not just you - it’s by design. Social media, remote work, and modern life are literally rewiring our brains. This book exposes why and how to fight back. Eye-opening.

\- Dopamine is everything - [Dopamine Nation](https://www.befreed.ai/book/dopamine-nation-by-anna-lembke) by Dr. Anna Lembke.

If you ever wonder why you can’t stop doomscrolling or why remote work feels so meh, this book explains it. Our brains are addicted to instant dopamine, and this book shows how to reset your reward system. Mind-blowing.

\- Your brain isn’t broken - Driven to Distraction by Dr. Edward Hallowell & Dr. John Ratey.

If you have ADHD (or suspect you do), this book will make you feel so seen. It’s written by two experts who also have ADHD, and it explains why we struggle with focus, motivation, and time management. Life-changing.

Work smarter, not harder - [The Now Habit](https://www.befreed.ai/book/the-now-habit-by-neil-fiore) by Neil Fiore. This book destroys the idea that procrastination = laziness. Spoiler: it’s actually your brain trying to protect you from stress. It teaches you how to break the cycle without guilt-tripping yourself. One of the best books on productivity I’ve ever read.

\- Small tweaks = big results - “Tiny Habits” by BJ Fogg. 

Most productivity books fail because they assume you have willpower. This one doesn’t. Instead, it teaches you how to make tiny, effortless changes that snowball into big improvements. No shame, no pressure, just science.

If you’re struggling with remote work and ADHD, know this: you’re not broken, and you’re not alone. It takes trial and error to find what works, but small changes can make a huge difference. If you don't have much time, just start with a book and read only 15-mins a day. It will help.",Both-Monitor4387,67,0.9599999785423279,5,1740621254,2025-02-27 01:54:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iz4lte/5_things_helped_me_recover_from_burnout_while/,2,2025
1iz4ffv,"With the hellish state of the job market regardless of field at present, I'd like to use my own story as one of hope.","I graduated from the university of my choice without a cent of debt to my name in 2023, but no real idea as to what I wanted to do afterwards. I was approached for an engineering position at Lockheed-Martin near the end of my college days, but I refused because I knew that I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I accepted the role.

I always had a passion for mechanical objects. Firsly for cars, thanks to a '62 Studebaker GT Hawk that entered my life, but then towards watches. It seemed to me to be a world unto itself. There was no obfuscation of the sort that usually occurs in the real world. Each component had a clear and direct purpose, all for the ultimate goal of telling the time. Time itself is about the most unifying concept among humans, for we are all subject to it. Therefore, I view watches and the development of time-keeping devices broadly as both a celebration of mankind’s ingenuity as well as a collective homage to the one thing which binds all of us.

As such, after ten months of working an internship at a 3D printing studio back home, I moved to Dallas to attend the North American Institute of Swiss Watchmaking. I only lasted six months in there, both for personal dissatisfaction with the program as well as the structure of the corporation the NAIOSW was tied to, but it provided me a firm foundation to build my watchmaking skills upon.

Ever since Janurary of this year, after working a couple months at a gas station convenience store just to pay the bills, I've been working at a small vintage-only shop as a combination watchmaker and content creator. I love it there! I feel like I'm actually a whole person there, not just a number. I get to work on the types of watches I actually care about. I personally know the owner of the shop and by all accounts he makes for a reasonable boss and a solid dude. The benefits package is decent, I get a lovely sun-filled view of the streetscape in front, and the company even sponsors lunch every Friday at a restaruant of the employee's choice. The literal only downside is the comparatively low salary for my position ($43k), but its enough to pay the bills with some left over. Lots of room to grow though, so its not like I'll be stuck at that wage for the whole rest of my time here.

The point of this is to show that, even in this unbearably difficult job market, getting a statisfying career going isn't impossible. Its also to show that the amount of money isn't the most critical element. Beyond having enough to live on, making sure that your job is something that brings you meaning, something that makes you actually glad to be there most days, is more important. 

Anyway, thanks for listening to my TEDtalk lol! Sorry if I seem like a braggart, its just for the sake of the story.

1iz3w1i,How do I ask for a raise under tough circumstances?,"The company I work for is separating from the main branch in the next 3 months. This was somewhat planned, but also rushed... and while I work in an industry that can be extremely profitable, especially for company owners that I work directly with, there's been a lot of comments about us having to make as much money as possible and save as much as possible for this move.

That being said, I'm definitely underpaid. I was hired for a specific position but because the company is shifting, I'm actually doing two other separate jobs as well. About 6 months ago I pushed for a raise and, because we were still part of the parent company, was given the standard. However, it's about 20K under the average salary for the most senior position I'm actually doing. They have agreed that this senior position is my actual job title now and it appears on paperwork. I also have the experience prior to this job that lines me up perfectly for this higher position, so it's not like I'm brand new and stepping into the role fresh.

I need to ask for a raise to the appropriate salary. I just don't know how to go about it with such a big focus on the company cutting costs/saving money for this move. My boss, one of the owners, is a nice guy and non-confrontational, but he's also the biggest moaner and groaner when it comes to the need to save money. He also makes the most, unsurprisingly, and unfortunately has involved a family member in the business who is very vocal. I worry that the family member will push back if/when I ask for a raise and insist I make a sacrifice for the greater good of the company (in reality, their family).  

I genuinely love this job and my team. It's fulfilling and I want to stay here. In the past I've never had an issue asking for a raise, but the companies I've worked for have always been stable and not in the middle of a big move. Is it better for me to wait for the dust to settle? Or do I need to jump on this now? And if so, how?

Assume boss is intimidating and also petty. Assume they also don't like getting no as answer and told me verbatim ""no one has left the team on their own will"".

I have tons of experience and getting a job won't be difficult as I have referrals from relationships I've made. Just need help with TIMING and HOW you'd do it (annoying to your toxic boss that you're leaving). 


Sorry if obvious but assume he might retaliate by not giving you a good reference or/and by offering you money so that you stay. That is why the HOW is vital.

I’ve completed online courses in Node.js, React, blockchain, Havard cs50, and more, and for the past three years, I’ve worked as a full-stack developer, mainly with the MERN stack (TypeScript, Next.js), plus some Python and Solidity. So I might say I'm a full-stack developer.  
  
But most of my tech projects have been personal, to personal usage or failed startups that I tried, but fully operational tools, with login and database integration, etc, I worked with teams internationally 3 times but those were just short-term freelance gigs that friends invited me.

I'm in a pickle and really need some advise. I was offered a job with a different company (let's call it company 2) that would be a lateral move with a 6% raise (I haven't attempted to negotiate yet.)

Additionally, I recently interviewed for a promotion to a supervisor role at my current company (let's call it company 1.) I should get an answer on Friday if I got it, which would entail a 15%-31% raise.

In addition to that, I applied to a different company (call it company 3) for a supervisor role that would have a 4%-39% raise based on the job posting. The workload would be lighter at company 3 opposed to the supervisor role I applied for at my current employer (company 1.) Company 3 wants to interview me next week. I don't expect the interview process with company 3 to take a long time.

The pickle I am in is that company 2 wants an answer asap. I know I don't want to stay in my current role. I ultimately want the job with company 3 the most, but there is no guarantee that I'll get it. I don't want to jeopardize the offer with company 2 because I was holding out for a potential promotion with company 1 or 3. What would you do?

1iz1chn,Explaining a gap due to mental health issues.,"Previous job was VERY high stress and involved working with the public without any back up, leading to a lot of shit from the public when someone else dropped the ball. I crashed and burned. I was an alcoholic and part of quitting alcohol was quitting my full time position so that I wouldn't relapse. 

 I'm studying, but it's a course many people undertake while working full time and the field I'm getting into often has people working long hours while studying on top of it (accounting, though I'm more aiming for bookkeeping specifically) so I think in this field studying full time might actually be a red flag. 

I'm still working one day a week, but that's probably considered just as bad as a gap. 

Not comfortable with saying I'm caring for a relative bc I'm pretty sure everyone and their dog knows that one by now.

Internet says don't use health issues because they'll assume you're a human being who'll get sick again, like other human beings do. I did recently have surgery for a chronic condition that resolved it tho. It was endometriosis but they don't need to know that.

1iz08jb,Need help with job offer situation,"I started at Tesla some time ago as a SWE. A few weeks later, I recieved an offer from Amazon. The offer from Amazon is not as competitive as I'd thought. I've detailed the offers below. The recruiter was made aware they were offering lower than Tesla. Both offers involved me relocating to the same city. Tesla offered relocation, but Amazon gives a monthly sign-on cash bonus.

**The only reason I'm even considering this offer is because I'm worried about Tesla's sales and how that may impact their bottom line and whether or not I'm employed.**

Both companies had layoffs in 2024Q1.

Offer details:

Tesla:  
Base: 170K (before taxes)  
Bonus: 100K (per year; cash only; before taxes; **awarded EoY**)  
Relocation: $10K (after taxes)  
Stock movement: down 31% since my offer was given.

   Total: Yr 1 @ **270K** (before taxes) + $**10K** (after taxes)  
Yr 2 @ **270K** (before taxes)

Amazon:  
Base: **175K** (before taxes)  
Bonus:  
Cash: Yr 1 @ 75K (before taxes), Yr 2 @ 50K (before taxes); **awarded monthly**  
Stock: 750 units with a 5; 15; 40; 40 vest schedule  
Stock movement: stagnant since offer

Yr 2 @ 225K (before taxes) + 32K (estimated stock value; before taxes)

1iyzv7z,Does my company credit card use warrant my company’s reactions?,"I work for a small ish contractor. 30 field guys 15 office staff. 

I had a company card since I first started since I am in the field a lot and also run parts of the business where I will need to do list minute things like buy special PPE, tools etc, 

So this past week we had a project where I was stepping in as a foreman. Long story short we needed more dumpsters, I called my manager and he told me, do what you have to do, so I did and called a dumpster company and paid them cc and that’s the only way they would prioritize me that day. So I did and the job went fine. So I get a call getting reamed at by the owner for doing this and not checking in beforehand. I told him I was told to do what I had to do and he still was not happy but let it go.

I got a call about 20 minutes later getting grilled about other purchases. Some like autozone for misc parts, Home Depot purchases( all things $25 and less). Then he was mad and had now took out of my check 3-4 times I bought coffee and donuts for the crew on crappy days or days where I felt we needed a moral boost when I knew a job would be hard. 

One of the largest argument was I bought two plan tickets for guy to go to a job in the other state, he was accusing me of buying tickets for myself, I then proved him wrong looping in another manager who told me to do it. 

Long story short he basically said he is taking away my card , and all future purchases I need to go to my manager for approval and for billing, I personally feel this is outrageous because it’s not like I’m buying $500 things at Best Buy on a Saturday. 

It’s very frustrating because even tho I proved him wrong, he still wants to talk about it in person next week when he is back and even if I’m able to prove him wrong, it’s always a lingering thing. He has now gone through the whole company’s personal cards. Since this event.

1iyzmrj,I have always been rated 'high performer' or 'top performer' and got my first 'valued contributor' in nearly a decade at the company...is this a warning sign?,"I was taken completely aback, my actual review went same as always, I wasn't told I was being deficienct in any capacity. I specifically asked what this was about as I have only ever been in the top 2 categories and was confused where this is coming from as I have never seen this before. There has been no change in work product, if anything I have taken in more and achieved highly in the new activities.

I was told that higher management is tightening down on levels in performance reviews and my performance has not actually changed. Now I need to figure out if this is lip service and everyone truly is just moved down a rung from what they expect, or is this a warning sign? 

We just did a round of layoffs and there are rumors of another coming. I am worried that I am on the higher end of the pay scale and this is them creating reason to add me to the next round of layoffs.

Anyone in HR or management seem this as a tactic, being told to rate your teams lower than they have in the past? Maybe it's just a way to lower the amount that raises will cost across the board?

1iyyndd,Denied a Promotion I Deserve … now what,"Age old tale of getting denied a promotion I deserve. Everyone thought I would get it my manager even made me a “promotion plan” approved by leadership and I achieved every single thing on that plan and more. Got large public praise from every department that is documented for the entire company to see on multiple occasions. They made the plan after I got another offer and they wanted to convince me to stay. When I joined on they did tell me the pay was a little low for my area but I just needed a job. In two years my role has expanded and they hired to additional people to expand the team both of whom I helped train and mentor and go to me for advice. At the same time was told promotions only happen end of year but during that time they had to replace our team lead so no one could get promoted until then. Now we have one and I brought up the conversation and they said I’d have to wait until the end of this year now but I’ve set the bar so high of accomplishing all those original firsts I don’t know if I can even beat that… I am drowning in projects with so much to do and still not making enough to survive. All I got was $1000 raise and my regular bonus when I had walked away from 25k at the other job. It was also because this is more stable and people stay here for decades the other was a start up with high churn and because my company basically told me if I stayed I’d be awarded with a promotion. I’m also fairly young and usually would leave my last start ups after a year this time I was like I’d actually stay and build out this program from scratch. 

Now we acquired another company and one of the people brought onto my team was given a “senior” title … I’m genuinely upset because they keep saying he’s not above me it’s just with the acquisition thing it was confusing and since he was previously a manager they gave him this title. This person didn’t even manage anyone .. we graduated the same exact year and I have more experience in this field bc I have worked in this exact role at multiple companies. The difference is he’s a white man and I’m a woman of color lol maybe he had pushed for it but I also did and for more pay and they told me there were plenty of chances to grow. I’m hesitant to leave because I love the work I do and I’m comfortable and know everything and the economy is awful but I’m making 75k while living in NYC in TECH. I can barely survive with student loans and rent even though I live with two roommates. I’m so disappointed but I’m like should I keep this job and use my additional time to work on a passion project like my novel? Or leave and likely go to a more stressful job with less of a work life balance but more money? I’m not sure. My manager even said she pushed for a 100k and so did her boss and they shut her down. I should’ve never taken 75 it was such a pay if to begin with I was just desperate to leave my toxic start up. 

This whole situation has left such a bad taste in my mouth and I feel so demotivated and underappreciated I worked so hard for nothing. ",ojkas,0,0.5,41,1740604868,2025-02-26 21:21:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyyndd/denied_a_promotion_i_deserve_now_what/,2,2025

1iyyelv,Feeling miserable in a job I like,"Sorry for the long post, I needed to vent…

I am having mixed feelings… I am always very proactive at work, I like things done well and I get the best results for the team, we are always number one in the area and are known for being a big-fees asset. We work on a team of 4, the boss (attorney), two paralegals and one assistant (me). One of the paralegals and myself have been on the team for 3 years now, while the other paralegal just started 6 months ago. 
The misery enters when we were informed that the team had been approved for a third person, the initial thought was that I was going to be promoted to the paralegal position and the new person would take my place; well… the new person was hired as a paralegal and they kept me in the same spot. Don’t get me wrong, she does a great job, even better than the other paralegal, she is hands-on and handles things accordingly. 
I had told my boss a year ago that I was getting my certification so when the time for a third person came I was going to be ready, but he totally forgot about it and didn’t recommend me when he was told about the approval. 
I feel disrespected, miserable and frustrated. I have been in silence all these months to not create a bad environment for us, but last week I went to HR and told her everything, they asked me if I wanted the position then I should apply but it would be on a different team. 
My attorney is very eager so he closes lots of cases and I work on them so we can get quarterly bonuses, making probably $20k over our salary just with the bonuses. 
My feeling is that the old paralegal is very lazy, always gives some of her things to me with stupid excuses, and I just do them because she tells the attorney so ok now I’m being told by the boss. But she is getting these bonuses as well and for doing nothing! 

I just feel like I want to quit and not stress about it anymore. Then I stop and keep working because of the bonus structure, I’m not sure if I will get the same with another team. Also I’d like to get the position title so it is convenient for me in my resume, also a higher salary. And if I end up leaving one day then I’ll leave as paralegal and it would be easier to find a job, than just applying as an assistant.

1iyy57z,Pay dilemma,"TL;DR: two different ways in which I'm feeling underpaid, asking for advice on how to resolve both issues (could be same solution).  

~

Hello all. Just looking for some advice on my work situation, and figured this was the place to ask for that. I'm truly sorry for the length; I'm trying to be minimally wordy, but I felt the context is needed. REALLY appreciate the advice of anyone willing to read it and respond. 🙏

~

I'm a (sub)contracted lighting tech working events at a school. I get paid a four-hour minimum, which is great (I have a long-ish commute). I like my job, like the people (including my boss, on a personal level), I'm hard-working, competent and well-liked. 

But for as long as I've worked here (going on 11 years), my boss's (contractor; doesn't work directly for the school) policy has been: if a gig goes shorter than I was booked for but past the four-hour minimum, I don't get paid for that. So, if I'm booked for eight hours, but the gig goes six and a half, I get seven hours, even though I've blocked out the full eight hours in my schedule. This happens maybe once every week or two. I make enough per hour that this isn't devastating or anything, but on principle, kinda crappy. 

Thing is, I've talked to people at the school who I'm close to and I know he's still getting eight hours (in the above example) from the school (either they pay him directly, or if it's an outside client, the client pays the school, who pays him). So, it's just what would've been my additional pay that he's putting in his pocket. And I've always been very grateful for my job here so it hasn't bothered me until relatively recently, but I've started thinking about how I actually don't like this policy of his. He's marking me up to the school as it is; does he really need my pay, too? 

Add to that the fact that the newest guy here (with whom I feel comfortable talking money stuff), who's been working here about a year but has done similar (sub-contractor) work elsewhere (more than I have), has been invoicing in such a way that he hasn't been getting 'shorted' like I have, and this hasn't been corrected by our boss. He just invoices for the full time he's been booked for, regardless of the actual event time. So, he's always getting full pay for the hours he's booked, and I (and another worker) have been getting 'shorted' since I'm (we're) following that policy and he isn't. Even though he's only been here a year and I've been here almost 11 years. 

Since I've been here this long, I've become 'the guy' and I do the vast majority of lighting work here. I've become pretty pivotal here, so I'm more comfortable and confident in my role here and how important I've become. That could be part of why it's taken until now to really think about this; I didn't wanna rock the boat when I felt less secure in my position and knowledge. 

That's the first thing. The second thing is that I don't love that I'm only getting paid a few more dollars more per hour than the next guy after me. We do the same job (lighting tech for events), though I'm definitely the #1 go-to, but I'm significantly more competent, qualified and have a more appropriate demeanor (almost like a service worker) for the job. The AV people who work with us both have told me that he never puts anything but the bare minimum into the job (they tell me they've never seen him on the ladder to focus lights (there's no way the focus is perfect every time he comes in), despite his working here 6+ years), and sometimes not even that (he's fallen asleep before, missed light cues, etc). 

I'm cool if one solution solves both issues. Like, maybe I should ask for another raise (which might seem weird to my boss since he gave all of us a raise last year when he renewed his contract with the school–though, to be fair, I'm quite sure I was a significant factor in said contract renewal, because the aforementioned AV people told me they vouched for *me* during those negotiations rather than him and he's just kinda lucky I work for him because he's actually strongly disliked by some important people here) but not worry about the missing hours here and there. (Asking for a raise could even be under the pretense that the country is just getting more expensive and I've gotta get a raise or find another job where I'd earn more.) *Or* maybe I should just invoice for the full time I was booked for next time like my coworker does (rather than the shorter event time) and see what my boss says? Or maybe I should do something else I haven't considered? 

Side note: I have recently been feeling like I won't be here forever, and have feeling strongly about getting involved with a completely different field that has the potential to become my new job, and I have some money (and I'm frugal to begin with), so while I'm 95% happy and satisfied with this job, I still don't feel like it's where my long-term future is and could live without it if need be while I either get another job in this field or move towards that other field. Though, again, I feel very secure and needed here at this point. 

I know that was a lot, so again, I *really* appreciate those who made it here and can give me some advice. I'm at a bit of a crossroads and I'm an overthinker who struggles with self-doubt, so any help would be truly amazing. Thank you again. 🙏🙏🙏",CoolTony429,1,1.0,2,1740603633,2025-02-26 21:00:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyy57z/pay_dilemma/,2,2025

I am 28, M living in North Texas area. I have been selling cars since I was 22 years old, and have been pretty successful at it. It’s now just past the 5 year mark of me selling cars, I’ve worked at a few different dealerships during this time. I’ve sold at least three different brands in that time span. 

To put it frankly, I am either bored of it or I’m burned out. The constant grind is very tiring sometimes, along with the other BS that comes along with selling cars. Fighting management, customers treating you poorly a lot of the time, etc. on top of the long hours. I have found myself creeping into pretty deep depression over this, and am at a lost on where I could go next. 

I currently do not have any degree, just a high school diploma. I’ve only ever worked sales jobs, starting with mattresses before I sold cars. Before that, I worked typical retail customer service jobs. 

I am completely down to stay in sales, as I do enjoy talking with other people. But more than anything, I’d like to possibly get into something different. A different environment, different role, something. I’ve slowly started to lose my mind and it isn’t good for my mental health.

1iyw737,Was given verbal job offer which I accepted but was called back day later that the salary was a “mistake”.,"They are now offering 10k less (they said there was a “typo” on the paperwork that wasn’t caught) which would only be 8k more than I make now. I can potentially negotiate up another 5k but I feel off about all this. 

I knew during the interview process the amount offered was the “max budgeted” they didn’t give me a range just a max then proceeded to offer that max. HR stated twice it was going to be that salary so I said yes I will take it. 

I was waiting on the official offer when they called and said there was a typo and they meant 10k less. I told them it was too low and I was looking for at least the 5-10k range higher. HR said they could potentially meet the 5k above. 

The role is going to be what seems like a decent amount more more work than I do now and I don’t have the exact experience with the software they use which will require training so I can be understanding not to get max budgeted for experience - it just feels a bit disappointing and a little dirty that they did it this way instead of honoring their “mistake”. 

I do also believe I am a secondary candidate as well since it took them over two weeks post final interview to contact me and my application in the portal went from active to inactive/not selected now it’s pending offer.. 

With the 5k above new offer it would put me at 13k more than I make now. 

I only started looking for positions as there was rumbling my current role may be part of a layoff. Unsure how to move forward or if I should bother with this new company. 

If it helps the numbers are as follows:

Current: 67k
Offer: 75k

1iyw6d2,Help,"I’m new here. I’m at an all time loss. Maybe because the job market isn’t great right now. I went from a fulfilling, but low paying job, but it was very stressful. I switched to sales to make more money.  I knew it would be a grind. I’ve done great and have definitely made more money than my previous job, but I have hit a point where cold calling makes me want to cry. I’ve been here for over 2 years and I’m really struggling with finding motivation and I don’t feel like this is sustainable. I feel like it’s impacting my week and I just look forward to the weekends for them to not be long enough. Did anyone else feel this way in sales? Is this a rut?

1iyvpmh,I have no idea what to do with my life and really need help,"Hi reddit -

I am currently writing this in the middle of a mental breakdown so sorry if its a bit hard to follow. I recently graduated from the university of michigan with a BA in psychology. I thought for a long time that I was going to go into a DPT. I started taking the prereqs for the program and am doing those now. I have 1500 hours of observation. I have worked as a tech, too. I don't know if its worth taking on so much deby (6 figures) to do this career or not. So I started exploring other areas like PTA and all of the programs require more prereq classes too. It feels like I'm constantly taking classes that qualify for one program and then not for another and I'm in a loop of wasting so much time and money taking classes that lead to nowhere. I have no idea what else I can even do with a BA in psych because I don't want to go into psychology. Where do I go from here? I feel so directionless and lost. I don't want to end up in some bullshit HR job that sucks my soul and pays me like shit. Any advice is welcome.

1iyv46y,"Fiber Tech 1, not sure where to go from here","Hello all, I got my degree in Computer Information Systems in march of 2024, and struggled to find employment. I eventually got hired by a recruiting agency in October for a 6 month position working for a communications company at a data center in VA, and the contract just switched over to full time. I was making 19/h on contract and now 20/h, but I tend to work very hard and enjoy leadership, so I’m taking on responsibilities of a crew lead (without the pay) and feel very under appreciated. This company doesn’t really treat its workers like “people” and has no problem working us for 70-80 hours a week mandatory. I want to move into a different role, but not sure what/how. I didn’t get any internships through college (bad idea, I know) and this is my only tech-related job. I just want to be able to make 25-30/h and develop important skills that eventually get me paid more. Id like to do something along the lines of networking/engineering for data centers as I find the work to be interesting. I am also open to going into other networking roles, but as most know, the IT field is tough to break into at this time. Any thoughts or recommendations?

1iyv0pq,Should I go back to school?,"I (25 F) graduated several years ago with my bachelor’s degree in criminal justice with hopes to be legal advocate at a woman’s shelter. I was really passionate about my path until my senior year when I did an internship and realized it was not for me. By that point I was super close to graduation and decided to just finish my degree. Since graduation I have worked as a legal assistant and now currently at a bank as a lender assistant in which I mostly work on loans. 

I don’t mind my current job. It’s similar to my previous job as a legal assistant but the pay and benefits are better and since I’ve been in this role for a couple of years it’s become an easy job for me, however I am struggling with what I truly want from a career and what I truly want for my life. 

I currently have no children and no debt other than my student loans and a house payment. 

When I was in high school I shadowed at a hospital under several nurses and at an imaging center and did rotations between Rad, CT & MRI techs for a couple of months and really enjoyed it. At 18 I thought maybe nursing would be a better degree for me so I applied to a large university instead to get the “college experience” that I am paying for now. After my freshman year I struggled with the adjustment and my GPA dropped and I lost my scholarship so I later changed my major to criminal justice after several elective classes I took. 

For the last year or so I’ve heavily considered going back for an associate’s degree in radiologic technology, but I’m scared of more debt and I’m horrified to fail. I loved shadowing in high school and I know it wouldn’t be the same as working the actual job but I kick myself for not going that route at a community college to begin with. 

I graduated with around $60k in debt and have paid it down to $47k since graduation. I’m scared to get into more debt. Thankfully if I decide to take the pre-requisite classes, I believe I can take them part time and hopefully work full time still until (and if) I were to get accepted into the program. I worked a full time job while attending college full time so I am not worried about that aspect. I am just worried about (possibly) getting into the program and not being about to work a job to help my husband out financially at that point. 

I also am worried about failure. As mentioned above, I struggled my first year and finished freshman year with a 2.9 GPA. I worked hard on my academics after freshman year and graduated with a 3.6 GPA. I am just worried because it’s been several years since I’ve been in school. I know it would take a lot of discipline. 

I come here to ask if I should go back to school or just stay at the job I am currently in? 

Thank you in advance! ",justalittleladybug,1,1.0,1,1740595859,2025-02-26 18:50:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyv0pq/should_i_go_back_to_school/,2,2025
1iyugqp,Internal Offer to Switch Departments,"Alright so here is the skinny.  I am comfortable with my job on all fronts for the first time in my life, pay is decent, I like all my colleagues, we work and collaborate well together, and I seldomly feel overwhelmed.  I feel a little stagnant, and a little pigeonholed but it’s not bothering me enough to even consider looking for other work. 

Last Friday however I am approached by a different department head with an offer to work with them, it’s enticing due to the change of environment, new learning opportunities, and a nice 14% increase of salary.  However, I once again won’t have room for much growth from the new position,  department seems really disorganized, with frustrated people in the department already and a couple of my co-workers that work in tandem with the department have been getting emails from the person I’d be replacing but they are written in a way that it seems they are actually from the manager even though the signature and email address says different. 

Just don’t know if I feel like the stress+risk is worth the reward. 

Also, just random coincidence every 3ish years for the past 15 I have made a major career change due to me needing a change for one reason or another.  This is the first time I’ve not felt that way, but also the first time an offer has been significantly higher.

They now sent me a few papers they wrote so that I could get acclimated to their work. And I'm just realizing how good they actually are. They write the equivalent of dozens of thesis per year (100+ pages documents).

1iytj17,Should I Ask for a Raise Now or Wait? How Much Should I Ask For?,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for advice on negotiating a salary increase. I work as a Senior Consultant Software Developer for a consultancy in Canada. I’ve been with my employer since 2019, with a six-month break in 2022 when I went to work at another consultancy, and I’ve been working with my current client since October 2022.

Before my break in 2022, I was making around $65K as an Intermediate Developer at the same employer. When I was re-hired in October 2022 for my current project, my salary was $90,000, and about six months later, it was increased to $94,500 based on merit. However, I haven’t had a raise since, despite strong performance. My employer experienced a big boom in consulting contracts during COVID, but in the last year or two the market has been tighter, and my employer has paused scheduled pay increases for everyone.

My situation:

 - My client has renewed my contract multiple times, even when other developers weren’t retained as the work for my team has been winding down. The project has two specific scopes divided into two teams. I am the only developer from my original team remaining on this project, so I was merged into the other team and I support activities from both scopes.


 - I recently spoke with my client about renewal, and she confirmed she plans to keep me on, even though the work is winding down, because she values my perspective in decision-making.
She specifically referenced a problem I solved that her team’s architects and developers had told her was not feasible for years.

 
 - I’ve consistently received excellent feedback from my client.
 - Over the past two years, I have been asked multiple times to assist other teams on other projects when they require specific expertise to solve a problem, or when they have urgent issues that need resolved very quickly. I am always happy to help, even on short notice and when long hours are required.

 - My employer is currently looking for my next project, and I’ve been placed on a bid for a new project with the same client, but it hasn’t been awarded yet.

What I need advice on:

 - Should I ask for a raise now, before the next project is awarded, or wait until it’s confirmed?

 - Is $115K a reasonable request, or should I ask for more (e.g., $120K–$125K) to leave room for negotiation?

 - How often should I ask for raises in a consulting role like this?

 - Any advice on how to approach this conversation with my employer?

I also suspect that my employer is billing my client at a much higher rate than my salary. Would it be inappropriate to ask my client what they’re paying for my time?

Any insights or experiences would be really helpful. Thanks in advance!",AbleStudent,1,1.0,0,1740592220,2025-02-26 17:50:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iytj17/should_i_ask_for_a_raise_now_or_wait_how_much/,2,2025

1iysih7,Career path help?,"I (25 F) am really struggling to find some direction in my career. I’ve been unemployed for the last year while I completed my Dialectical behavioural therapy, as I struggle/d badly with my mental health. I never gave my career much thought growing up (so I have a useless degree (criminology)) as I didn’t think I’d really make it to adulthood, and now that I’m feeling a little bit more healthy minded upon recently completing my therapy, I’m realising that a career could really be something that I could throw myself into. But I just have absolutely no clue where to start or what to do. I’m very fortunate as I live with my parents and they are insistent on me not paying any rent/bills, so if needed I could do a very low/no payed internship/apprenticeship/training and work my way up if necessary. Willing to start from the bottom even, I just want something that suits me. 

A bit about my disposition: I like focusing/zoning into tasks, very very organised as it makes me feel put together, I’m super active, I’m strong (for a woman) as I weight lift 4-5x a week, I get 12,000 steps a day, train flexibility for fun discipline, I really love learning and I do free online courses just for fun (e.g human nutrition diploma, microbiology lab assistant diploma, they don’t really mean anything but I enjoyed completing them), I’m trying to learn another language but I’m slow at that. I’m really friendly and good with people when my MH isn’t playing up but on bad days I really struggle with people, so a customer facing career/job is less preferable. From scrolling on countless job apps I love the look of lab work or that sort of setting; busy, task oriented work - but haven’t a clue how I’d go that direction without experience/stem so I don’t even know whether that was worth mentioning. 

Where do I go from here? I’m actually signed off from work by the gov for my mental health, but that’s just not good enough, I refuse to give up and make excuses and would really like a career now.

Ashamed to say it was mostly goofing around with a mix of half assed job applications and trying some online business ideas that didn't prove to be fruitful. 

I really enjoyed studying math and my original dream was to become a professor. I realized quickly I'm decently smart but definitely not of the genius caliber it takes to produce original research. Furthermore, the abstract nature of the subject makes it such that anything past 2nd year is virtually useless in the real world, which leaves me with almost no skills and what is basically a glorified philosophy degree.

I am not picky and would genuinely be happy with anything over $50k.

Really I'm just looking for ideas of which jobs to direct my focus towards and which ones I shouldn't waste my time with. For example, I am very aware that I am competing with extremely bright CS grads for most tech jobs which does leave me at a huge advantage.

Prime broker (30 years of experience) brought in 5 million and other broker (10 years of experience) brought in 4 Million.

I asked for a raise to $88K, and they offered $90K. However, the new targets feel completely unrealistic: they expect me to bring in $15 million, open 3x the accounts I did last year, and double revenue again. It feels like I'm being hit with performance punishment rather than being rewarded. I just think it's absurd to bring in 15 mil by myself when we brought in 16 mil collectively as a firm last year.

Little bit of background information: went to prestigious university in the south, struggled with mental health during college so only had one internship, and this is my first post grad position in the “real world”. 

Posting in here for the first time because I truly have nowhere else to turn. I graduated in December of ‘23 and was desperate to find my first post grad position. Started working for a small marketing company in January of ‘24. All was well for about 3 months then I realized why this position’s turnover rate is so high. 

1. Micromanagement is next level. Screen recorded through a software that screenshots our screen every single minute and each task is timed down to the the minute. I completely understand making sure your employees are working and not online shopping etc. but is there not a better way to go about it? Especially if you are always hitting your deadlines? We are supposed to spend a certain amount of time on a client’s social accounts each week. If we spend more than 2 minutes of allotted time on a client’s accounts my manager asks if we are okay? Stays on our case about it and hounds us with questions. If you work in digital marketing you KNOW sometimes you cannot be as creative as you need to be when you are worried about not spending too much time on a client. 

2. To be quite frank the pay is SHIT! I was lied to about a raise after 6 months. Boss gaslit me and told me she never said anything about a raise when I was offered the job. She said this verbally and looking back I should’ve asked for it in writing. Fast forward to being here for a year I finally have the courage to ask for a raise and I get told they cannot afford to give me one. (I am making an unlivable wage and cannot even afford an apartment on my own so I’m stuck living at my parent’s house)! 

3. Clients are DROPPING like flies. My bosses are a lot older than me and to be completely honest don’t know a fucking thing about social media and digital marketing. They are stuck in their ways and we use stock images to advertise services that our clients provide. The work we produce looks like shit so no wonder our clientele doesn’t care for the work we do when there are so many other companies that KNOW what they need to do to produce phenomenal marketing tactics and campaigns. We get little to none engagement on our posts so my job feels fucking pointless. No relationship with clients. No photoshoots or content creation WITH the clients. NOTHING!

Currently I am posted in a tier 5 city/village  and don't have that much expenses. My monthly gross salary is nearly 100000 and with net being around 80000, and I save nearly 50 to 55000 from it per month.

Right now I'm posted 350 km away from home chances of transfer is also somewhat possible in near future. But the posting will be mostly in rural or semiurban areas. There also chances of my marriage in nearly 2 years.

My current plan is to prepare for rbi grade b and similar regulatory body exams like sebi, lic aao etc. and also feeling stuck in that preparation because feeling like I can't do it or so less chances to secure a seat.

Also I crave home, I want to live with my family and not want to live faraway from home, in rbi there will be chances that I will be posted in mostly capital cities and with that salary living standards will also increase and savings will decrease accordingly.

But even that job will not take me close to my home. Also I even feel like sometimes doing job is not even worth it I had to take permission for leave I also want some independence but on a scale of 1 to 10, this priority stands on 4. And being home stands on 8. And also priority of living in a city place is 8.

Now after all this information suggest me some strongs points and suggestions in detail.

1iyq8fl,Stick with the stable backoffice role or dive into the wild frontier?,"I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on choosing the right career path.

I’m about to receive a job offer(yay!) and need to make a decision quickly—the company wants an answer by the end of the month, so the clock is ticking.

A little about me: I’m 43 years old and currently working as a Backoffice Sales Executive at a large company (4,000+ employees worldwide). The job involves some commuting, but overall, it’s quite comfortable. My colleagues are great, the pay is decent, and I get to travel occasionally (India, France, Turkey) without much pressure to perform.

I have three kids (9, 11, and 15) and share custody 50/50 with my ex. It’s an arrangement I’m really happy with—it gives me quality time as a father while also allowing for personal time to ski, kayak, mountain bike, hang out with friends, and build a business. My background is in mechanical engineering, and I’ve spent years working as a Sales Manager across different industries.

Now, onto the decision at hand. I’ve passed all interview rounds for a new role at a much smaller company (30 employees) specializing in energy-saving technologies for the manufacturing industry. The role would involve business development and sales engineering—essentially building a new market segment through direct customer engagement: cold calling, knocking on doors, booking meetings, and traveling. The salary has the potential to be higher but will likely be more incentive-based.

I’m torn between staying in my current role and taking this new opportunity. It’s a fortunate position to be in, but I’m struggling to determine the best path forward. I’ve only been at my current company for about a year, and they’ve given me a lot of confidence. They seem happy with my work, and the job itself is stable. However, it can feel uninspiring at times—I have no real ""skin in the game,"" and my role could easily be done by someone else.

The new position offers a chance to shape the role and influence the company’s future, but it also carries significant risk. The market is untested, and if I don’t perform, my time there could be short-lived. The first 2–3 years, especially, would be critical. Pay will most likely be much more ""performance based"", so this could affect my financial situation as well.

What draws me to the new role is the excitement of being out in the field, building relationships with customers, feeling the pressure, creating value, having meaningful discussions, and finding solutions. That’s why I applied in the first place. I realize that many would see my current job as ideal—comfortable, stable, with good benefits and minimal risk—but that’s just not who I am. I thrive on taking risks, meeting new people, and building something from the ground up.

Given all this, what would you do in my position? I'd appreciate any insights or personal experiences you can share.

Thanks!",SquarePeg_O,1,1.0,1,1740584080,2025-02-26 15:34:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyq8fl/stick_with_the_stable_backoffice_role_or_dive/,2,2025
1iypxrw,How to stop being decisive and pick a career?,"I have a few years old music degree mainly in history and theory which has sadly proven extremely useless in the real world of work. I haven’t gotten a job remotely related to my field and get rejected for jobs that are entry level minimum wage vaguely in arts / music. I eventually got lost in an unrelated career field I’m no longer passionate about. 

I feel so lost. I have no ideal job I’d like. I try to apply to some artsy jobs still but I still get rejected which fuels a mild depression each time. I apply to some unrelated hospitality roles and I still get rejected. I went on LinkedIn and all my fellow peers from studies are years deep into their music careers it hurts and I feel like such a failure. I feel indecisive and I feel like I need to pick a skill and learn it and go into that kind of field. I have no interest in tech / online work. Lately I have been studying a real estate course to try out this. 

How do you find your path in life and force yourself commit to it? I have no clue! Im so indecisive but also the universe fails to be decisive for me too. A masters in musicology / creative arts feels very futile employment wise but maybe it’d be good for me? When is it time to turn your back on your passion / degree dreams and cultivate a new career skill?

I made the decision to relocate to a different state in part due to my health, in part due to my husbands job.

I am pretty upset because I feel like I am only valued as a seat in an office not as someone who has worked really hard for them and is now prioritizing myself and my family and is being given the boot. I say this for context because my manager who is forcing me to resign basically told me I could figure out a timeline for off boarding and submitting my notice myself.

1iyo4o2,Anybody know any good tech career coaches (in Canada)?,"\[sorry y'all\~ removed previous post and created new one cause I forgot the ? in the Title\]

Hey all, I need some advice (or at least a point in direction) to where I should look.

This post is similar to what another user posted on this subreddit [here ](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/14gl6s9/how_to_find_tech_career_coaches/)2 years ago but I come with a different set of circumstances that does not exactly fit what I was looking for in other post.

I feel stuck in a career rut and currently not happy in my current company. I'm located in **Toronto, Canada** if that helps in finding a career coach locally.

**\[skip the next two story-filled paragraphs for a condensed but ""context-less"" TLDR\]**

I was a full stack, software developer with 2 years of experience (2021-2023) graduated from a bootcamp, but was laid off like a lot of people were during this period. I've been job hunting for the past 21 months (on and off due to my current full time job I had to take on exactly one year ago this month to pay the bills: **more on that next paragraph**) and still doing that now looking for similar roles (including BE or FE specific roles). I've also taken on a lot of volunteer work on open-source projects and (unpaid roles in pre-Alpha,) early-stage startups to keep my skills in check. But as my two year job hunting anniversary approaches, I'm feeling that ""rut"" depression after only getting a handful of interviews (\~10) reaching final stages, but no offers have materialized. My recent prospective after passing all the hoops (interviews + technical assessment) fell apart yesterday morning when I got the email that they've chosen someone else for the role. My CV/resume and skill level seems to be solid as I'm able to pass the first interview stages and technical assessments with little issue, but it's always the final stages where I get bumped off somehow.

For the current company, I started in this role one year ago this month and it's not a tech role (warehouse labour). It's a job referred by an ""acquaintance of an acquaintance"" and the pay is okay, just barely enough to pay for my bills but not enough to save, and hard to move up the career ladder there\^. But recent rise in groceries/transportation this year put that at risk and thus the urgent need to pivot or ramp up my aforementioned job search. I have asked for a salary/job performance review earlier this month, but no answer yet from management on that request. Currently it's not that bad because of bad culture or toxicity, at least on the local level with my coworkers and immediate supervisors which I get some support. But I have issues with the upper level (head office type) management\^ whom I get no support from. I recently suffered a workplace accident that dislocated my shoulder and required brief hospitalization (which meant difficulties using keyboards). I was forced to take a two-week unpaid medical leave, partially compensated by cashing in my company's vacation accurals (and ruining my planned personal day-offs for upcoming job interviews in the process). My absence during this leave also pretty much ruined any argument in favour of me proceeding with a job performance/salary review with the upper management team\^. But physically I just recovered enough to continue job searches and do technical assessments for prospective developer roles, but now unsure if I can continue on like this. I've been recently reprimanded by the company's upper management because I've reported the cause of my injuries to a nurse at the hospital, who in turn filled out a workplace accident form\*\* for me to submit to work or the labour board. I have support from my lower-level management to keep them from firing me, but dunno for how long they can stave that off.

**TLDR: Laid off from full stack developer position 21 months ago, still job searching. Took on a job to pay bills at warehouse, but suffered workplace accident that impaired my ability to use computers short-term. Willing to consider career coaches for re-calibrating job searches AND/OR career change since I've had no offers so far, only close calls.**

So my ask is: I am in a position where I feel like I should hire a career coach to 1) refine my current job search approach in CV/resume re-alignment and interview prep OR 2) consider a different career (or a related role) and/or quitting current job to pursue schooling (if said career change requires it). My close friends feel like career coach is an overkill, but given it's almost 2 years now, I'm considering giving it a chance.



Footnotes:  
\^I don't want to get political, but much of the company's upper management are straight up old-school, with a certain set of work ethic and values. They also prefer to hire their upper ranks (including our middle management supervisors) from a certain racial/cultural group, which I will not be mentioning. **The company's upper management head office is located in California, USA**.

1iyo3z5,Worried if I'm jumping ship too soon,"Currently I have a job with a small company that is fully remote, has half day Fridays and has historically been a pretty easy workload. My salary here is 87k but the benefits are pretty expensive. The biggest downside has always been having to travel periodically through the year (maybe 4-5 times) which I abhor doing. However, recently my job put a freeze across the board on all raises due to a severe decrease in business. This has also lead to an influx of busy work in helping sales bring in more business which I've also been very unhappy with. So as a result I've been applying for jobs since December.

  
I was just offered a job at a much bigger corporate company doing similar work for 90k with a 5% year end bonus and while the culture seems to be a good fit (though obviously a shift from small company to big company) it is a hybrid schedule with 2 days in the office. The commute is a mere 5 miles away so it's very close and this new company also has half day Fridays. Between the small salary jump but realized savings in benefits I'd be getting what would essentially be a 8% raise with a 5% bonus.

While I’m lucky I found this job right after graduating, I come into the office 2 times a month, I enjoy the people, I wonder if I should also seek some higher paying jobs now that I’m getting more experience. The reason I think this is since I always hear people who job hop after a few years end up making more money in the long run versus people who stay at the same job. I was thinking of waiting to get my salary review after a year and if it’s not that worth it I’ll look at other options. My parents say with how commute is if another job is 2k more it’s not gonna be worth it if I’m in office daily, that I’m lucky to have such a relaxed job. My job is okay like I don’t love sales or completely understand most of it. I studied HR initially so maybe I can try looking for jobs in that. Or even marketing intrigued me.

I recently suffered a workplace accident that dislocated my shoulder and required brief hospitalization (which meant difficulties using keyboards). I was forced to take a two-week unpaid medical leave, partially compensated by cashing in my company's vacation accurals (and ruining my planned personal day-offs for upcoming job interviews in the process). My absence during this leave also pretty much ruined any argument in favour of me proceeding with a job performance/salary review with the upper management team\^. But physically I just recovered enough to continue job searches and do technical assessments for prospective developer roles, but now unsure if I can continue on like this.

So my ask is: I am in a position where I feel like I should hire a career coach to 1) refine my current job search approach in CV/resume re-alignment and interview prep OR 2) consider a different career (or a related role) and/or quitting current job to pursue schooling (if said career change requires it). My close friends feel like career coach is an overkill, but given it's almost 2 years now, I'm considering giving it a chance as they've helped me once before in getting me an offer. But that career coach has left the occupation so I'm willing to consider options and would love suggestions and your rationale for them.

I'm located in **Toronto, Canada** for additional context (some coaches refuse Canadian clients or anyone not physically located in the US I've noticed).

Footnotes:  
\^I don't want to get political, but much of the company's upper management are straight up old-school, with a certain set of work ethic and values. They also prefer to hire their upper ranks (including our middle management supervisors) from a certain racial/cultural group, which I will not be mentioning.",blackjack-bits,1,1.0,0,1740574856,2025-02-26 13:00:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iymyuo/advice_needed_career_coaches_with_tech_focus/,2,2025

Landed a job as a medical receptionist, but it’s not ‘the glimpse and the glams’ that I thought this job would have. It has been tough and hard to understand the new software, and all. This is my 2nd day on the job, so we’ll see where it takes me. It’s so confusing, a bit overwhelming.

In my 2nd year, I had the opportunity to work in a public hospital and tbh hated my placement time. I’m really grateful for the opportunity tho. Just the toxic work environment and the moving/rapid in and out of patients + the patient behaviour and reduced mobility was very difficult + gossip. 
I then wanted to move to computer science , however was overwhelmed and moved back into radiography after a week of it in uni. It was just hard to learn as everything and everyone already knew some level of coding already + many layoffs were happening and I got a bit scared. My parents hated the idea of me being in computer science as my dad has a job in it and my mum tried it but didn’t quite understand it so dropped out of it and not pursuing it.

I was told by my parents to go back and finish my radiography degree. I managed to do my 3rd year of radiography after dropping out of computer science one week in.

In my 3rd year of placement last year, I failed due to many factors which related to how I handle criticism and referred to me as defensive and self-justifying. My supervisors also said I likely would pass, but I can’t argue what they say after my feedback. I was completely wrecked by these comments, as I had a good time on placement and everyone seemed so nice. I asked for feedback after each of my examinations and wanted to get to know the staff better. I was confident in my abilities and was good at it. Fast and quick paced. I was pretty good at positioning patients and all. But I burned out, lost passion. I was waking up at 5:30am and the place was far away. I was putting in 110% effort for a total of 9weeks last year and that fail really hit hard. Made me reconsider what to do with my life.

1iyihqn,"Doing the role above, to get promoted into the role above - how long to tolerate?","Hi all,

I was wondering at what point it’s reasonable to push back on your managers in ‘demonstrating’ you’re ready to be promoted into the next role. 

For context, in talks about performance review, management actively encourage and stipulate ‘showing’ that you’re ready for the next role. 

The time that I’ve spent doing 95% of the role above me (as per the responsibilities outlined in the formal job description) is pushing six months. I work with someone in said title above me (no conflict on my getting promoted; different projects) and frankly I’m working to the same if not better standard of work. 

I understand that demonstrating that you’re already taking on the responsibilities is a pretty commonplace tactic for getting promoted. At what point though does push come to shove? I don’t want to spend much longer working to a higher level and workload without the adequate remuneration and title.

1iyhnu2,Feeling trapped and exhausted: Recent grad struggling to find fulfillment in the workforce,"
Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm reaching out because I'm feeling stuck and unsure about my career path. I graduated from university and dove straight into the workforce(started work even before I graduated) 
I've had two jobs since then, and while they've provided valuable experience, I'm starting to feel like I'm just going through the motions.

Here are some issues I'm facing:

- I hate working for someone else. The constant micromanaging, lack of autonomy etc are taking a toll on my mental health.

- I get bored with my job ridiculously quickly. Within 3-4 months, I've learned the ropes and mastered my responsibilities, but then I'm stuck with nothing new to learn or challenges to overcome. (It’s a two man office so no growth, no hopes of moving to a different department or anything like that, no hopes of promotion either and no incentives)

- My current job is a well…... I'm working in a two-man office with an insane workload (100+ clients plus accounts, front office duties, compliance, maintenance etc). Our directors refuse to hire more staff despite having the resources, and we're expected to take on even more work with a new system. (My manager tried to get them to get a new person and they cut her salary )

As a result, I'm constantly exhausted, overworked, and fatigued. I've had to sacrifice my hobbies, social life, and even basic self-care (exercise, cooking, etc.). It feels like my life is passing me by, and I'm desperate for a change.

# Questions

- Has anyone else experienced similar struggles in their early career?
- How did you cope with the transition from university to the workforce?
- Are there any strategies or resources that can help me find more fulfillment in my career?

Thanks in advance for your advice.",teenytinyziny,1,1.0,2,1740553095,2025-02-26 06:58:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyhnu2/feeling_trapped_and_exhausted_recent_grad/,2,2025

The reason I want to change careers is that I want to explore and better understand myself. I know I’m still young to be thinking this way, but I feel a lot of pressure from all different directions.

I’m a 24-year-old former English teacher (17 months) and have been unemployed for the past three months. The main reason is that I’ve been considering switching careers into corporate or office work.

However, in my job search, I’ve found that most positions require at least a related Bachelor’s degree or relevant experience, which has kept me from finding employment.

I also applied for roles like Virtual Assistant, Data Encoder, Admin Assistant, Proofreader, and Administration Officer/Assistant, but none of them have worked out due to my lack of relevant experience.

Now, I’m wondering if I should just give up on the career change and stick with teaching.

Recently, I applied for a courseware developer or instructional material developer role at a school, and I was told they would contact me after receiving my COE since it’s a required document. However, there’s no guarantee, so I’m uncertain.

1iyeqa1,What should I do? Need guidance,"Hi everyone!

I'm going through a tough time and feel very lost. I'm in my 20s and a female and cannot decide on a career. I've spent quite a bit of time trying to find a connection with a potential career but nothing works. I finished a degree in healthcare but in Aus it doesn't have a lot of job prospects, forcing you to do another degree or postgrad. I can seem to make up my mind. I'm stressed about making a decision and even more stressed about making the wrong decision.

Secondly, I want a high paying job because my parents are struggling financially and my brother has a slight learning disability so I'm worried how we are all going to survive in the future.

BUT what I'm really struggling with the most is feeling a sense of helplessness. Growing up, my childhood wasnt good, my parents weren't good role models, it just felt like I got the short hand of the stick. But I still had hope that things would get better, but it got worse and I felt like a failure.

I was smart growing up and I just feel like nothing in my life is working out. I always try to remind myself that there are a lot more people that are worse off then me and that I need to be grateful of everything I have. But on other days I'm surrounded by successful people and families. I see people my age have so much money before of their rich parents and I feel a sense of envy looking at their huge houses and the way they can go do med at private universities, which are easier to get into for people that can afford it.

I'm envious and I know there are people that would be envious of my life but I can't help feeling that I always received the short end of the stick. Had to go through a toxic, violent childhood, had a mildly disabled mother and brother, became poor, uneducated dad, small house, mid looks, a medical illness that isn't life threatening but effects my day to day life and may effect my future marriage prospect.

I can't help comparing myself to my peers or old classmates. Even though they weren't amazing at studying in school they've managed to settle down and have now started earning adult salaries and then there's me that still has to study another degree.

Growing up I've never had an interest in one particular career and I'm stupid for not investigating my options earlier. My mindset was whatever and where ever the degree will take, I'll do just that. I feel like every year I keep making more and more mistakes, never really learning from them.

I just feel so very lost. Like I don't belong in this world but then I feel guilty of victimising myself because I'm the one making these mistakes.

1iyenar,American Abroad in Canada,"Hi, I’m an American who has been living in Canada for the past year. Unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with ongoing harassment from a coworker who constantly gives me a hard time for being American.

It started when he asked me who I supported during the election. I told him that was private and I didn’t want to share that information considering we don’t have to disclose that. For context, I did vote third party this time around. Despite this, the harassment continued. I’ve asked him twice now not to discuss politics with me, but he refuses to respect that boundary.

With the recent discussions about potential tariffs, the bullying has only gotten worse. He reminds me daily that “we all made a mistake and I’m fucking everyone over” and insists I should have voted Democrat, even though I never disclosed who I voted for. He only does this when nobody is around and I just ignore him and walk away. I believe he assumes I’m a Trump supporter simply because I prefer not to discuss politics at work.

I just want to be left alone to do my job. I’m not being paid extra to deal with bullies or the additional stress that leaves me dreading going to work or even getting out of bed in the morning.

While I respect Canadians and understand their frustrations, I don’t believe anyone should be treated poorly based on their nationality or political beliefs. I certainly wouldn’t treat others that way. Any advice? I’m not trying to get anyone fired. I just want to go to work without the worry of psychological abuse.

I hear about trade school a lot on social media and my dad and brother do HVAC earn very nice money.
They told me how It wasn’t hard to enter and they spent no money Community College.

If I start HVAC this upcoming summer, by winter of 2026 I’m able to start my career earning full time. I can expect to make 60-80k a year. While compsci, 4 years in college, maybe 80k, most likely 60k.",EugeneFromDiscord,2,1.0,3,1740541782,2025-02-26 03:49:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iyeiwl/thinking_of_getting_into_trade_school_instead_of/,2,2025
1iyefjy,Should I negotiate salary?,"Last year I made around $67500 (including bonus) while working as a licensed banker.

Now, I'm applying for a job which salary ranges from $67500 - $95000 according to the job description

I would need to get an additional license if hired and was told that the yearly bonus is around 13% (min $8775).

Even if I have no prior experience with this position I feel I bring a lot to the table, given that it's a bilingual position (my native language) and have about 9 years of experience  with successful customer service and sales.

Given that this new position would be a remote position, how much would you think would be the lowest I should accept?

Thanks!!

1iyd23j,Early educator with impressive career background but no college degree attempting a career shift…?,"I’m an Early Childhood Educator of 15 years. I’ve held various positions from Professional Nanny, Infant & Toddler Specialist, Parent Consultant, and Reggio Teacher-Researcher at a private school. I keep up with my professional development hours, and I have more than a handful of specialty certifications and trainings. By most accounts, my resume is outstanding. I am highly sought after in my field and rarely have trouble finding a job.

That said, I do not have a college degree. I have a significant number of credits towards an AA in Early Childhood Education, but that was unfortunately put on hold for life reasons and I haven’t finished it. I plan to, but that isn’t feasible until I have at least a year’s worth of tuition saved up. I’m about 25% there.

I love my career, but I am getting older and my body physically can’t do it anymore. I need to set myself up for something where I am not 100% physically-emotionally-spiritually engaged for 10 hours straight every weekday.

What are some common pathways for people in similar circumstances? Are there any former educators here who have successfully transitioned to a remote industry? I’d love to hear any perspectives or suggestions.

1iyclzz,What do I do? Where do I go,"Background: I’m 28M, I joined the Air Force two days after high school. I was a firefighter/911 dispatcher. Love the job, but I was diagnosed with asthma. I was offered another job within the Air Force, however that would’ve meant relocating to another base. I loved the location I was/still am at. Met my wife here, started my family. When I got out I took a job installing Fire Alarms, and I thought I had it made. Damn good pay, pretty easy job. But winter time rolled around and I was averaging 15-25hrs. With my wife being 7 months pregnant, I switched up and hit the road, took a job installing Fire the Drilling/Mining industry, and within 5 months my body suffered more injuries than I couldn’t count. Decided to take a job I thought I’d love and started climbing cell towers doing maintenance and repairs. Now I’m doing fiber optic cable management for a local company. Two years, 4 jobs. I feel like I can’t discover who I am. I have a Secret clearance and would like to utilize that, I wouldn’t mind hitting the road again to make some decent money. (I work with travelers making $10/hr more than I do, and they earn it) So I ask…where can I go? What can I do? I want to keep supporting my incredible SAHM, but I feel like I don’t have the experience for anything. 911 dispatching is a passion but doesn’t pay well too well (that I know of), I really don’t want to go back to drilling/oilfield work, even though that’s a quick bag.

In the last month, our company laid off a small portion of the entire workforce, resulting in a few people being laid off on my team specifically. Furthermore, even more people this month alone have put in their notice for better opportunities. We are now down to 12 people in less than 2 months. All of us have had to take on additional work, and there were no raises/compensation adjustments.

My team is structured in 3 tiers. I am the lowest of the three, however the industries I tend to are the highest grossing/most intensive work out of the pool. Everyone has acknowledged the work I do (including my manager, who is now gone) and that I should in fact be promoted. With one of the most important people vouching for me gone, I feel stuck.

1iy9y8f,Career Dilemma: Choosing between two offers,"Hey everyone,

I’m struggling to decide between two job offers in the UK, both with similar pay but different risks and career trajectories. I’d really appreciate some advice on which option might be the better move long-term.

Option A: Head of Data Science (AdTech Startup)

Small company (~50 people).

Went through layoffs recently, and Glassdoor reviews suggest employees were unhappy about them. The company addressed this in the interview, saying they have a new CEO and fresh investment, and things are now stable.

Salary: ~£120k, no bonus in the contract

Hybrid: 2 days in the office, with some flexibility to work abroad sometimes (which is important to me).

Concerns: 6-month probation with only a 1-week notice period during probation. If things don’t work out, I could be let go quickly, and I’m not sure how a 4-5 month stint as Head of DS would look on my CV.


Option B: Principal AI Engineer (Fintech, Large Company)

Individual contributor role (no people management), but with tech leadership responsibilities.

Large, well-established fintech (Top 250 UK, thousands of employees).

1-year contract (with potential to become permanent).

Salary: £117k (+15% discretionary performance bonus).

Hybrid: 3 days in the office.

Concerns: While more stable, Principal AI Engineer is a step below Head of DS in terms of career progression. I worry that staying in another IC role could make it harder to transition into leadership later.


My Dilemma

I want to move into leadership, so Option A is appealing, but the recent layoffs and long probation with short notice period worry me. If they let me go early, how bad would that look on my CV? Would it hurt my ability to land another leadership role?

On the other hand, Option B is safer, but I'm concerned about getting stuck in another IC role and missing the chance to transition into leadership.

Would love to hear your thoughts, what would you do in my position?

Thanks in advance!

1iy9u5z,What I wish someone would have told me (or what I would have listened to) as a part time real estate agent,"This past year I have gone to school, taken the state and national test, and signed with a brokerage hoping to make some extra money outside of my 9-5. There are SO many things I wish someone would have told me. 

Please do your own research but I thought I’d share in case it helps someone else that tries to take the same path as me…

- It’s going to be really hard (nearly impossible) to have any work life balance and be able to do 
what you need to do as an agent with a 9-5 that isn’t super flexible… I read the threads on reddit and did my research to see if it was possible. Everyone said no it’s a full time job and I told myself I would be the one to beat the odds… it is 100% a full time job, probably more than that honestly
- This was ignorance on my part, but nobody tells you how expensive it is to be an agent and be a part of your local realtor association… with that, broker fees, and license fees, doing real estate part time isn’t always worth it in the end
- Finding a brokerage with a team and support and training is so important, but also adds so much pressure and unrealistic expectations. It doesn’t matter how many times you tell people you are a dual career agent… they will still want you to join a meeting in the middle of the day. You might tell them up front that you are dual career and they are okay with it but make sure to ask extra questions to make sure it is a right fit. People always say make sure you have training but sometimes there is too much involvement and expectation for a role you want to have part time.

Not sure if anyone relates or is experiencing the same thing, but I hope this helps someone!!  ",Impressive-Air93,1,1.0,0,1740527859,2025-02-25 23:57:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iy9u5z/what_i_wish_someone_would_have_told_me_or_what_i/,2,2025
1iy9tpa,What would you do?,"I have been a Cath Lab Tech for over 5 years now. I have my RCIS and have worked for the same hospital these 5+ years. I have done a travel assignment and had a PRN job while on this job. This job requires 4/10hour day shifts, plus being required to stay late (past 5:30pm) and be on call (evening/overnight have to report when called within 30 minutes anytime of night), weekends and holidays. Yes, I knew what I was getting into and I love my job. I don’t like where I work and what I do is very specialized and it’s a small world. 

I am having a hard time deciding if I don’t want to work being on call anymore, don’t want to work weekends and holidays, or if I just want to work somewhere else. 

My workplace is toxic is management/leadership. The company doesn’t pay enough. Yet they are the busiest hospital in the area especially in my department. So we’re definitely overworked and underpaid. I enjoy most of my coworkers. But I have always wanted growth, and coming across a leadership position in this field is few and far between. Also, this company doesn’t pay well for that either. 

I want to be home with my daughter more. I want to have more time with my husband. My job consumes the majority of my life. I also want to pay down our debt quicker. I want to have time and energy to work out and take care of my health, but any other job I’d be qualified for on paper pays about $30K less per year than I make now. 

Going back to school to get my RN or other degree to have more career options isn’t an option at this time. I have an associate degree in science in cardiovascular technology. 

Currently there aren’t any full-time positions open near me (30 minutes) and there aren’t any clinics hiring within 1 hour of me where I wouldn’t have to take call, work weekends or holidays. I have an 11mo baby girl with my amazing husband who works from home. I have the higher salary by a lot. We aren’t in a terrible financial position but we do have two cars we are paying for, a house, water softener, solar panels, and medical bills from having my daughter. 

I haven’t been really happy with the place I work at. I love what I do, helping doctors fix patients hearts, but the schedule, and the leadership, make me very depressed and unmotivated to work there. I know the grass isn’t greener on the other side, every place has their issues. But I just don’t know if putting us in a tight financial spot is worth it for me to have my weekends, evenings, holidays, back. Even if it means a lot less money until I’d be able to go back to school or climb up into a higher position. 

Is it worth it to struggle for a bit and take a front desk job somewhere nearby that is Monday through Friday no evenings, weekends, holidays, no on call until I find another full time cath lab job that I may like the pace better and pay? Should I try to go back to school eventually? I do have customer service, secretarial, and computer experience as well as my medical experience.

I'm currently a director of compliance at an investment fund management firm in Canada and am in the final stages of recruitment for a chief compliance officer (CCO) role at another firm in the same industry. **The position offers a 30% salary increase, is fully remote, and comes with significant flexibility**. During the interview, it seemed like a great opportunity and a major career and financial advancement.

However, after conducting further research, I discovered that the firm is currently under court-appointed provisional administration due to suspected fraud, embezzlement, and other compliance violations. One of the regulator’s key action plans is to restructure the organization, which includes removing the current CCO and hiring an independent replacement—me. The current CCO has a financial stake in the company, presenting a clear conflict of interest.

Since this information is public, my appointment would likely be highly visible, placing immense pressure on me to enforce the compliance recommendations set by the external consultant.

My concern:  
If I accept the role and, in a year or two, the regulator decides to suspend the firm’s operations, making me unemployed, will this negatively impact my career and reputation?

1iy8ka1,Climb the ladder they say,"Hello all, 

I am not exactly sure how to start or finish this. All I know is from a young age it was taught that climbing the ladder within your company is the goal to advance your career. Now I fully agree with this statement to a point, at the same time I know changing positions or jobs every few years (3-5) has proven track records to increase pay and salary. My current dilemma right now seems to be a bit of suffering from success and a bit of inexperience and ignorance. I am a chemical engineer by degree. Immediately out of school I was blessed enough to land a position at one of my co-op placements at a mine. This was a 1 year contract to be an assistant project manager for the biggest project they have undertook in 50 years. Long story short, the engineer or project manager had found another job near the end of this project. I was lucky enough to be positioned to be offered his position directly with less than a year experience under my belt. I took it because the pay was fantastic and I was fresh out of school, enthusiastic, with nothing but energy (I was 23).

Two months pass, the project completes and our plant manager get promoted to a larger mine due to the success of our plant. Again, less than one year of experience and they had asked if I would become the interm plant manager. They had no options for a quick replacement and convinced me to take it. My work schedule was a standard 40 hour work week 7-4 roughly. With no overtime. With the promotion, they were unable to replace my current position as maintenance supervisor and project manager so for that time I had done all three. I was working roughly 14 hours a day, 6 days a week only getting paid for 40 hours a week. Keep in mind I was on salary which was well in the 6 figures so pay wasn’t the biggest issue. What ended up happening is I had become burnt out. They were unable to replace my previous position after 2 months. I could not do these hours anymore so I began to search for a new job. 

I found a new job as a project manager for a drilling company. The salary was semi remote and an increase to even my current positions. I took it hoping it would give me a better work/life balance as my current company offered to match the salary to keep me etc. 

My problem is. Again within a year, I have had 4 seperate promotions in my new company. (Hindsight shows me I should really consider these more). But long story short here I am, as the COO who currently manages all operations across Canada. My problem again is the work life balance. I love my company, job, and workers. My problem is I cannot seem to find any good help, and thus am working over 100 hours a week. I currently work 7 days a week 12 hours a day for the most part. It is killing me inside. I am well compensated, for the time. But at this point I’ve now realized I’m sick of the instant and immense responsibility of running these company’s. I don’t know what direction I need to take now and am looking for any advice at all good or bad. I love my job but have no life. And I do not love it to the point I will forgo my family and responsibilities. But adding the two togeather I’m always exhausted and burnt out. 

Your truly,

A man who’s becoming overwhelming depressed. With no idea what to do as I seem to not be able to talk to anyone about it because they think I should be happy, and grateful that I am doing so well financially.

1iy84gk,Boss basically told me I've been doing my job wrong for past two years. Is this my fault or hers?,"Long story sorry. 

I(F29) have been working in administration for a large company for over two years. I am pretty well respected by my colleagues and peers and have proven that I am very dedicated to being the best I can possibly be at my job. I am also a trusted specialist in many areas of business.  

I made one mistake in a report a few weeks ago due to serious issues happening in my home life and me being very stressed. I owned that mistake and apologized etc. (Mistakes happen all the time around here and we always have a mantra of were not saving lives so it's usually never a big deal. This mistake was not massive and didn't cause any major issues). 

Generally in our company people make mistakes all the time. But my manager now is coming down on me hard, treating me like a child as if it's my first day and is digging for issues with any piece of work I've ever completed. She's demanded that all my work is filtered through her before sending to anyone else and is talking to me as if I have never worked a day in my life. 

I have stated that I'm confused about how I've been doing this work as per process for my entire time in this role with no issues, but suddenly it seems that everything I've ever done has been incorrect. 

Before I have a further conversation I'd like some opinions. I believe that if everything I've been doing has been incorrect for this long, should that responsibility not fall on my manager? Who by the way her entire role is to train and manage my administration team which is now just me. 

Every other person in the company raves about my quality and speed of work, I have had real results with great feedback from clients. I am consistently applauded by everyone throughout the company for my dedication to my role, enthusiasm and care for producing high quality work. I cannot understand how suddenly all of this is wrong. 

Now my confidence is at rock bottom and I'm feeling like I should just quit instead of being taken back to square one after putting my heart and soul into this job for over 2 years. I just want to know if I have a leg to stand on here and how I can best approach this with my manager.

1iy6yy6,Thinking of changing jobs again..,"Working in healthcare sector and changed to a new role in October. I didn’t leave my last job because I didn’t like it but I wanted a change and a new challenge and also some days working from home which is unheard of in the area of work I’m in. My gut instinct told me not to move but I did anyway.
Since I’ve started I’ve moved between being really shaky and unsure of making the right decision to having ok days. The new role isn’t clearly defined and the line management structure isn’t what I’m used to as I’m being managed by a person not in the same profession as myself. 
All in all the benefits seem positive from a working from home and managing life and kids side. Does the work inspire me.. absolutely no.. I really can’t say that I’m driven or passionate about the area of work. I loved the complexity of the client group I worked with in my last job. I feel like I didn’t give my last job a good enough stint either as it was an internal transfer to a new department and I was annoyed that I was transferred.
Anyway with all of the above in mind I’ve been offered a new job which will be much more complex work. More challenging and I’ll be onsite full time (but manage my own diary) and won’t be working from home. In saying that I could make this job work for me and I would have contact with lots of colleagues I already know. 
I have a kid with special needs so this makes it all the more difficult to decide what to do.
All of these jobs are the exact same pay.
Do I stick with my current new role which has pitfalls (more time with some outspoken and difficult “bitchy” characters) or move into a new more challenging and demanding job but more suited to my core values with a reportedly great team.
I would be loosing 2 days a week working from home. 
It’s tough to be a full time working parent to special needs child and also fulfill myself in terms of my profession.

1iy6p4b,Advice needed,"Needing advice on resigning from a decent job.

In a large city in the Praries (middle Canada) at a government job. Moved from Toronto to work at this job 8 months ago.

The job (Engineer) I am currently in pays a little under average 95k for my level of experience and role, I took it because I wanted to move to the city. I thought the role would be something else based on the job description but it seems more boring and less impactful than I thought and I had to start over in a new industry after 5 years of experince in my previous industry. My team and managers are great and due to my experience in the previous industry which overlaps with the new one i'm in i'm given autonomy and freedom. They also give me all work related to my previous industry in order to keep me engaged.

Got an offer after 8 months related to my previous industry in a semi-public sector job (pension but not as much job security) for 10k more plus 5 to 10% bonus based on performance. The reputation of the new company is unclear, I have heard negative things (layoffs, toxic culture etc.) from previous employees and there are some negative reviews on Glassdoor/Indeed.

My current employer is a large employer in this City and I am worried about leaving a role in 8 months. As I liked the team, I will give 1 month notice. It would be nice to have this place as a fallback even in a different dept somewhere down the road.

Although I like my team and some of the perks, I find my current work not very interesting and the pay to be slightly under average. The new role is in a sector I have worked in and have a bit of interest in but the reputation of the company might be an issue.

1iy417v,Should I get an MSW in the States and then move to Europe?,"(any advice is greatly appreciated!)

Hi there,

I have been having a very tough time deciding what to do about my master's recently. I graduated with a BS in Psychology and finally decided on getting my MSW, as the degree is holistic and broad, while also satisfying my plan to work in mental health.

I moved to Europe six months ago, (I am an EU citizen ), and have been loving living here. I am currently only applying to online MSW programs in hopes of staying.

The problem is, the more I look into it, the more it looks like I will have to go back to the States even if the program is online. If not for the internship during the program, I think I may have to go back for the supvised clinical hours (which take about 2 years) before I can get licensed.

I honestly feel devastated because I finally decided what program I want to do and put so much work into applications, but don't want to be bound to the States for years before I can come back. I want to start building my life here but this would postpone it by years.

I have looked into psych programs in Europe because they would most likely be free or cheaper, but I would then have to get fluent in the country's language to be able to practice, which I don't think is very realistic, especially because I am not even settled on a specific country.

I know therapists with an MSW who work remotely abroad, so I definitely could do it in years time, but I really do not want to sacrifice my twenties back in the States.

What would you do in my situation? Should I invest the time to work in the field I want or just do a business psychology degree here or something similar?",Nervous_Bluebird8299,1,1.0,1,1740513091,2025-02-25 19:51:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iy417v/should_i_get_an_msw_in_the_states_and_then_move/,2,2025

Other than that I was a TA (Embedded Tutor) for a math class which is essentially an intro to proofs class, I am a tutor for intro to programming, object oriented programming, calc 1-3, internet programming etc. I did an internship for software development but the internship was in my university.

1iy2wm9,Uncertainty of Federal Contract Work & Potential Career Transition?,"Hi all, I (37M) am seeking advice regarding a potential career shift or at least identifying potentially more secure employment opportunities. My current employment is unlikely to continue throughout the entirety of 2025 so I would like to get ahead of the curve in figuring out what might be a reasonable route forward.

For background, I am a former academic (associate professor in a social science field) that shifted out of the position due to complexities at that institution (e.g., stressful working environment, minimal merit/COLA raises, perpetually understaffed). I knew that I was burned out from an imbalance in professional responsibilities (a proportionally heavy teaching  and service load, minimal time for research) and wanted to make a shift out of higher education.

After applying to a number of different jobs I was fortunate enough to land a remote position at a NGO to assist with research on a federal contract. This transition was a breath of fresh air, including a better work-life balance and the chance to conduct research on an important project that could produce a positive impact for hundreds of individuals. As rewarding as the job has been, the downside is that based upon rapidly evolving federal (U.S.) decisions there is a moderate-to-high chance the contract is eliminated based upon the type of work being completed, likely from not being renewed for FY26. While it is not certain, signs are increasingly pointing in that direction. 

I realize the odds of securing another remote research position are not impossible, but highly unlikely as more individuals similar to myself are reentering the job market. Leaning on my background in quantitative analysis, with some experience in spatial and qualitative analysis, I feel like there are more applicable opportunities within the private sector that I am potentially missing from predominately using well known employment websites.

All of this said, I feel like I am at a crossroads and curious the thoughts of others on this sub, especially those with backgrounds in higher education. One route would involve refinement of my current skill set and hopefully being able to find a remote position as local options are unlikely based upon my geographic location. The other route is retraining in hopes of transitioning to a different career entirely.",BelleroFloyd,1,1.0,0,1740510292,2025-02-25 19:04:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iy2wm9/uncertainty_of_federal_contract_work_potential/,2,2025

Consequently, I’m now exploring remote opportunities in the healthcare sector, as they seem to offer more flexibility. I’ve observed that some companies have shifts starting as early as 6 AM and ending around 2 or 3 PM, which would suit my schedule perfectly.

Currently, I’m interested in roles such as remote healthcare claims specialist, work-from-home pharmacy technician, physician assistant, and insurance verification specialist.

1iy2ib8,Transitioning from Mainframe Development: Should I Go for Higher Studies or Switch Career?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working as a mainframe developer at a large MNC bank for the past two years. I got into mainframe development because, honestly, that was the only job opportunity available when I graduated college. However, things have taken a turn recently as the company is moving away from mainframe technology and is laying off mainframe developers in favor of hiring Java developers.

Now, I’m at a crossroads and need some guidance. My options are:

1. **Pursue Higher Studies**: I’m considering going for an MS, but I don’t think I’m bright enough to get into IITs or NITs for an M.Tech. If I do go for an MS, which country should I consider? I’d love to hear about any personal experiences or advice on making this decision.

2. **Switch Career**: Alternatively, I’m thinking of changing my career path altogether. I already have 2 years of experience, but if I switch, I’ll likely have to start fresh in a new field with a significantly lower salary. Does anyone have experience with making such a transition? How should I approach this? Should I try leveraging my existing skills, or is it better to completely pivot to something new? 

I really don’t know which direction to go, so any help, advice, or guidance from those who have been in similar situations would be immensely appreciated!

For my mental health, I know I have to leave this job. I have plans to go back to college this fall, and hopefully work part time until then.

But the thought of quitting my job, having to go in and collect my things, hand back keys, and just face them, makes me actually sick to my stomach.

1iy1xqv,"Should I stick to my current ""job"" that's not really a job or leave it and start searching for something that would pay better instantly?","Currently I'm ""working"" at my uncle's company where they work on SAP, which is a profitable job, but the problem is my ""work"" is basically me learning, thus they pay me a little bit more than half of the minimal wage in my country. I thought that after the first 3 months, if I decide to work there and they decide that I'm suitable for the job, they'd start paying me a little bit more e.g. twice as much (which is still not even close to what people working with SAP earn from what I've learned).

What is the problem is that I am 24 next month, have last semester of university ahead of me and my biggest dream and something that I've been trying to do is to move out of my country or at least out of my town (for now). I can't do that if I don't make money. For the whole period of me being a student I've been working here and there having some menial jobs for short periods.

Sending out resumes isn't fruitful unfortunately. Few months ago I finally got an interview, got to the last step of it and they basically told me to get lost by sending me some generic email without any reason as to why they won't hire me. It's exhausting, I'm tired of being blocked by some random recruiter woman who hasn't even read my resume. I'm not asking to be some director or CEO, I just want something stable for at least a year that pays - even minimal wage, I don't have a lot of expenses so I can save up a lot in a year.

And if I'm being honest - I feel they won't keep me here. There's another guy that learns with me and he very often figures ""cases"" we get, while I manage to figure them out in 80%, very often something is missing and if ""everything about SAP'S \[insert a product\] is online"" then I have no idea where. I use computers my whole life, I did learn Blender a little bit and that's a software for which I can say a ton of information is online. SAP Analytics (Cloud software that they want me to learn currently) is an illogical disaster to me that I have no idea how became popular. Basically, charts, tables and all that Excel-esque stuff bores me and it just doesn't seem to click in my head,

1iy0lm9,Possible job with a religious organization as a Pastafarian,"Hi, I want to preface this by saying I do not want to start a religious debate with this post. I am genuinely seeking career advice.

This is in the USA

I am doing well so far with interviews for a position that, career wise, is an absolutely perfect fit for me. It is a nice step up but nothing overwhelming. This is in the print industry. I'm well qualified for the job and think I have a good chance at getting it. 

However, this job is with a company that is very Christian and has Jesus and Christian values all over their website. They provide support to Christian nonprofits. I have absolutely nothing against Christianity or Christians in general and think a lot of the organizations they support do real good in the world. I also agree with many Christian values.

The problem is I am absolutely not Christian. I am a Pastafarian. I have a colander on my head in my drivers license photo and the flying spaghetti monster adorns my car. This is a remote job so I don't think that will be a big issue, but I am pretty firmly not Christian and will not budge on this stance.

I know I will disagree with some of the things I produce at this job, but that will happen no matter where I work in print and is something I am used to dealing with.

I am wondering if anyone has any experience working for a religiously aligned company as someone not of that faith. Should I be wary?

I don’t want the perception to be that I’m “quitting” the other team or noncommittal.

1ixxcf8,I need guidance I am stuck,"I was in this competitive leadership program at work where over 3 years I was rotated into different functions (2 total and my landing spot is now in a new plant, think going from clinical to commercial various stages of the process).  I led high visibility profile projects (and was told so by my bosses), received excellent reviews and I have VP level mentors who have talked me up apparently.  Our current site head at this plant I am at apparently “sees stars” when I implement my “strategies” and I have been “noticed” for how I have driven up OEE and output.  But I am failing and I don’t know what to do.  I have tried twice for the Dir role and each time I have come second in choice with two current directors moving laterally instead. I have been told it was neck and neck with me and am well respected with the leadership team but I can’t catch a break or have someone take a chance on me.   I can’t keep doing this anymore.  I am the only one in my leadership program cohort to not be a director.  I am falling behind.  I made wrong career choices, I should have stayed in my original swim lane like these others and maybe I could have been promoted faster. I stupidly went to new disciplines to learn different parts of the business in operations and it turns out that was a liability rather than an asset no matter the output of my work. I am reaching 40 and am a loser.  Failed to launch.  I am an embarrassment and I have so much shame.  How can I go back to these mentors and sponsors and tell them I failed again?  And I am afraid I am viewed as a fixer or workforce but not a leader.  I don’t come from a traditional ops background and I don’t want to be overlooked or dismissed as a blonde bimbo or someone they can rely on but never lead.

And I am not so conceited to think I deserve it or am entitled to it, but I look at my body of work and theirs, I look at my reviews and feedback from supervisors from mentors, and I just don’t know what I am doing wrong.  I am not getting actionable feedback anymore.  I know it might be time to start looking outside the company but my husband says no.  We moved here for me in this new plant location, we can’t uproot the family right now who just settled in, and I can’t even start looking till August or risk having to pay back the relo money they provided -even then we would be moving in less than two years, and this job allows me a good work life in terms of vacation and flexible work as needed for family time he keeps saying.  I would risk a new employment and not having time for the kids and having to start from scratch basically.  We don’t have the money for me to get a second Masters right now that would be more related to this line of work. He says have faith, they put me in the program for a reason.  But I am the only one not to get anywhere in my career and no one is giving me any actionable feedback.  Just keep doing what your doing, trust the process.  But I am the only failure in the cohort.  I am the embarrassment of the program.    I have approached some functions for a stretch assignment to expand my skills even more but when is enough?  When am I good enough and why do they have me leading these major initiatives if I am not good enough?

Thing is i have been supplying this report to my manager for the past 6 months and never did he express any negative feedback about my report is not meeting his expectation. Not once we had an one on one coaching session to discuss my objective performance in between mid year and year end review.

I brought this up with him and he only told me i need to be more pro active about seeking feedback. Granted, i was too nuch in my own bubble thinking the if my manager doesnt like what i have been doing. He would let me know.

I know the solution to my problem is an extreme easy fix. Get my manager to sit down and ask him what he really needs from my report and get his feedback until he says. Yes this is what i need and replicate the same template going forward.

I honestly feels like i lost trust at him being a manager. I feel like i dont want to work with him anymore and starting looking for another job. Am i acting too drastic?

1ixvwb8,Do I change jobs?,"Right now I don't know where to start however I'll try and put in as much information as possible but essentially I am about to go into a new career/industry however my current(old) employer has just given me an offer and I am now stuck on what to do so I just want some advice.


I currently work for a transport company and within this company at the moment I am an onsite manager(OSM) for an amazon delivery service partner.

I have been looking into a long term sustainable career for a while and I decided I wanted to go down the route of being an electrician. I enrolled onto a home study course in Aug 2024 whilst working as a driver for my current company. 

In December 2024 I reluctantly was asked to go from being a driver to being an OSM(on site manager) in the office to which I agreed.
 I really have enjoyed the position however my problem has always been with how the company is run and also the hours that I end up working.

This year I was keeping a look out for electrical training positions as I had a worry that I would complete my course but struggle for employment due to not having any practical experience. 

I was offered an electrical training position with a gas company starting on £34k salary.
The course will get me an NVQ in Electrical Engineering. 
Whereas the course that I am doing on home studies does domestic installations, it then includes, commercial/industrial certification, AM2(qualified electrician) AND then solar panels/EV chargers.(so by the end of the home study course I'll be a qualified electrician with a gold card).

Now... after telling my current employer I am leaving as I have secured a training post he has put in an offer that he will give me 50k per year(self employed) currently sitting on around £30-35k(performance dependant) and promote me to an operational director.

When I told the director that he has offered me more to start with I explained that I understand I'm going to be on £34k in my new job however once qualified I'll be earning a lot more PLUS I'll have the practical experience, once I've completed both qualifications I'll also be dual qualified so as an electrician I'll hopefully be able to work my way up to the £60-£70k mark over the next 5 years.

Now I understand no one would be ablebto answer for me but I'm reaching out for advise on what others would do in my situation? 

My options would be:

1) Take the 50k and continue with the home study course (would mean no real practical experience as an electrician and no engineering qualification, I get a much higher salary in the near future however hours may be more, don't get any PAYE benefits however at that salary I would most likely benefit from being SE for the tax benefits)

2) Leave the company I am with, follow through with both courses, Electrical engineering AND Electrical installation courses(I get practical experience, more job security and the PAYE benefits[holiday pay, sick pay, good pension etc] and when completed both courses I will most likely have A LOT of open doors)

Please ask any questions that will help me paint the picture to you guys and please I would like to just see what other people would do in my situation no right or wrongs just to help me to make a decision (I have 2 days to get back to my director :) )

Thank you

1ixveff,Which healthcare degree offers the best ability and salary growth for my career goals?,"I currently work in healthcare and want to take advantage of my employer’s tuition assistance program to earn a degree that leads to a stable, well-paying career without having to pay out of pocket. My main goal is to increase my salary while ensuring long-term job security.

I’m 31 years old, and while I know it’s never too late to make a career change, the time investment needed for a degree is a little daunting. I want to make sure I’m choosing the right path before committing to years of study and work.

What I’m Looking for in a Career:

	•	Stable & Growth-Oriented: I want a job that starts at $50K+ with potential to grow to $80K+ over time.

	•	Structured & Predictable: I work best with clear, step-by-step processes rather than constantly shifting responsibilities.

	•	Minimal Bedside Care: I don’t mind working with patients, but I don’t want to be responsible for direct hygiene or personal care.

	•	Small Team or Independent Work: I prefer working alone or in a small team rather than managing large groups.

	•	Tech-Friendly (But Not IT-Heavy): I’m comfortable with technology and data but don’t want to go into software development or engineering.

	•	No Constant Certifications: I’m open to getting certifications to advance, but I don’t want a career where I need to keep earning new ones just to stay employable.

Financial & Educational Priorities:

	•	I Can’t Afford a Pay Cut: The career path I choose must allow me to transition without dropping to an entry-level salary.

	•	Tuition Assistance is a Must: The degree must be covered by my employer’s tuition assistance program so I don’t have to pay out of pocket.

	•	Online or Hybrid Programs Preferred: Flexibility is important since I’ll be working full-time while studying.

Degree Options I’m Considering:

After doing some research, I’ve found a few options that seem like a good fit, but I’d love some insight from people in these fields:

	1.	Health Information Management (HIM) – Strong job security, good salary growth, mostly admin/tech-focused. Requires a bachelor’s degree and possibly an RHIA certification.

	2.	Medical Coding & Billing – Faster entry, structured work, good remote opportunities. Requires an associate’s or bachelor’s degree and certification (CPC, CCS).

	3.	Healthcare Administration – Higher long-term earning potential but may involve more team management.

	4.	Radiologic Technology – Hands-on but structured, pays well, and has strong demand. Requires an associate’s or bachelor’s degree with ARRT certification.

Questions for Those in These Fields:

	•	Which of these careers would be the best fit based on my preferences?

	•	Are there any downsides I should be aware of before committing?

	•	Are there other degrees or certifications I should consider that align with my goals?

I appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks in advance!",KingArrancar,1,1.0,3,1740491316,2025-02-25 13:48:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixveff/which_healthcare_degree_offers_the_best_ability/,2,2025
1ixvaz7,Should I quit?,"So I’ve had this job for about 7 months now. I don’t mind it, like the office and all, good management, but it’s so boring and tedious, the same stuff over and over, just with little variations. Also it’s a bit different to the job description but it’s a new role and I said I was flexible, which I am. 

But lately I want to quit. I’ve had this feeling since the start of the year. Currently I’m not learning any new skills, which is the most important, the pay is okay but I can get more elsewhere, and I don’t get much respect in the office despite being smarter than almost all of them. 

I like my chances of making more elsewhere, maybe a more fulfilling role, but this one is comfortable and supposedly a good company. I was going to stay for a year at least but I genuinely think I’m wasting time and could get better experience elsewhere. I’d mention it to my boss, maybe do some selling like I’m supposed to instead of just data, but I doubt that’s going to happen. At the last company I managed the retail sales for the entire company, got paid less but had more status. Now I get paid more and get treated like the lowest in the office, which I am. 

Should I just start applying and looking for other roles, or stick with it a bit longer, mention I want to do more, and see how it goes?",Ancient-Tangerine445,2,1.0,2,1740491039,2025-02-25 13:43:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixvaz7/should_i_quit/,2,2025

1ixucfj,Anyone else feel like this in a new job?,"For context, I’ve started a new job and on paper it’s perfect (salary, pension, hybrid) etc… I left my previous job back in November as I was told by my manager last September there is a lack of workload and that they’re worried about the longevity of my role which made me panic and search for a new job immediately. However, if you were to ask me this time last year would I leave my old position I would of saying never in a million years. I started a new job in November which I absolutely hated and left after 6 weeks. In my original role, the salary wasn’t great but the people are what made it for me. I was the Recruitment Team Lead so I basically got to hire whoever I wanted in the office. Infact, I became best friends with most of them even outside work and we hangout regularly and chat almost everyday through messaging/phone calls. I’m still quite young and early in my careers but the laugh and banter we had was second to none. It never felt like going to work, it felt like just hanging out with your mates and being paid for it whilst obviously working aswell. Our hours were 9-5 and the company allowed us finish at 4 PM and still be paid the full amount. The team and office was very small so everyone got to know eachother and we were quite loud to be fair. Whereas now I’m in a more corporate role which seems a lot more serious and I just don’t know if I’ll ever experience something like that again which is getting me down as I would love to gel in this new role.

1ixu57a,Tricky decision - risk or security?,"So I’ve been offered a new job. It’s permanent and at a higher grade but same wage than the contract job I’m currently on. So a promotion but with no financial gain. Current job’s contract ends 30 June and might be extended but not guaranteed. And if it is extended it may be for 6-12 months max. And there is a chance that the current job is moved to a different company which could mean I move with it or am let go. I’d most likely be retained but there is no guarantee. So a lot of unknowns at this stage as it depends on whether new funding is found to keep the project going and me employed. 

New job is an office job with set duties and routine responsibilities and there are opportunities to make quality improvements which could be interesting. And with permanency I can keep applying for promotions. But yeah not an exciting job, not high profile and no potential to accelerate my career quickly and into a high influence role. 

Current job is amazingly diverse and puts me in meetings and events with high profile high level people who make important decisions, and while I’m low level low power in comparison, I’ve made a strong reputation as a hard worker who gets things done and can communicate with influence. It’s got potential to one day soon make me one of those high level CEO type people because I’m networking with those types and matching their energy, but it’s not guaranteed and I could stay a worker bee and have a new manager hired above me if that’s what the powers that be decide is best for the company. But that’s ok - I love this job and I could see it progressing my career and pay level quickly if things go right, but right now it offers no security and no promise that I’d be fast tracked. It’s the risky choice - could offer great rewards - or unemployment! 

And for context I’m 50 f and have three kids to support. My heart says stay in the cool job it could land me a CEO role and i deserve it, and my head says go with security, keep working hard and live to fight another day. So do I stay in the job I love which is potentially high reward but high risk and I could be unemployed in as soon as 4 month unless new money is found, or go to a routine job which I’m likely to be bored in and forgotten because it’s permanent and secure?

1ixtx1w,Pathways to Success: Why Students Choose Career-Connected Education,"In a rapidly changing job landscape, students are increasingly drawn to learning experiences that connect classroom knowledge to real-world careers. Career-Connected Learning offers a practical solution, equipping students with hands-on opportunities that bridge academic knowledge with essential workplace skills. Students are eager for more career-focused experiences that align with their unique interests, helping them gain insights into various professions and build critical soft skills. Furthermore, having mentors in these programs has shown to significantly enhance students' engagement and confidence, providing them with guidance as they navigate potential career paths.

Despite its advantages, access to career-connected learning remains limited, particularly for students from underserved backgrounds. Research indicates that many high school students still lack exposure to careers that interest them, leaving them underprepared for workforce expectations. Broadening access to these experiences through partnerships with community organizations and expanding mentorship networks could help close this gap. By embedding diverse career-oriented activities into education, schools can empower students to make informed choices, equipping them with the skills, networks, and confidence they need to transition successfully from school to career in an ever-evolving job market.

1ixttk4,Did I make a mistake rescinding my job offer acceptance?,"I currently work for a company that pays me $35 an hour and is an hour commute from my house. It’s a contract position with no benefits, but the job is easy, I get to listen to podcasts or music all day and the schedule is only Monday-Thursday. 

I was recently offered a job position with a new company that offers $28 an hour and is a 25 minute commute from my house. It comes with benefits like 96 hours of PTO, 80 hours of sick time, yearly 10% bonus and a lot of paid holidays. The schedule is also Monday-Thursday. However, they require mandatory overtime and according to a friend that works there it’s pretty much every single weekend. Fridays for 8 hours and Saturdays for 8 hours as well depending on how much needs to be done. Plus they don’t allow any sort of headphones in the workplace. 

Both jobs are manual assembly so they can be tedious over time and over the many years I’ve been doing this line of work I’ve always looked forward to working because it’s my chance to be able to listen to stories and really focus. I feel like without them work will just seem that much more tedious and time consuming. That combined with the excessive amount of mandatory overtime has made me think it may not be a good fit. I don’t mind voluntary overtime because I’m always ok with more money, but I’ve never worked for a company that had mandatory overtime that frequently and don’t know how it works if things are planned in advance. It seems as though I’ll never be able to plan out anything because I’ll hardly have any notice on whether I’ll need to work on a day I’d normally have off. 

I had originally accepted the new job offer and recently spoke to the recruiter politely stating that I was rescinding my acceptance and that I wasn’t sure this was a good fit at this time but thanks for the opportunity, etc. 

Did I make a big mistake turning it down? I overthink so I’m not sure whether the loss of time off, lower pay, and missing out on the one thing that makes me enjoy working (headphones are a privilege I know) are worth the benefits and much shorter commute. My partner is also on his third round of interviews with this company and has a really good shot at getting in as well as two of my friends. Being able to take one car to work in the morning and see friends may have made up for some of this and I think that’s why I’m having regrets in hindsight. 


I posted asking about taking a pay cut for this job before I found out about the excessive mandatory overtime and headphone policy etc. which is why I originally accepted.

I have a bachelors in International Relations, i graduated with a reqlly good cgpa, and I want to get a masters and I'm having trouble making a decision on the program I should go for.

Previously, I was focused on getting a masters in IR but I did my research and weighed my options: I want to study abroad for my masters. I'm Nigerian and I read that getting IR jobs as an international is quite difficult (e.g in the US, they'd rather hire nationals for those roles), I want to get a masters that would be relevant in the job market, as well as having open opportunities to hire international students. 

This is why I want to pivot. I've been thinking of getting an MBA (If you have university recommendations, that would be nice), I've also been thinking of international business, I also recently found a tech interest and I'm taking a Data analytics course, and I am interested in Artificial Intelligence too. 

Do you think it's worth it to pivot? Looking at the job market, prospects of getting a job after graduation, better opportunities for me as an international student?

Also if you know any schools, programs, fields or countries you think would be a nice fit and I should check out, I'd really like to know.

1ixrv3j,Pivoting from Freelance Marketing to Full-Time Work—What Options do i have?,"I'm trying to keep this as short as possible—honestly, I'd just be happy if anyone reads it and can offer valuable insight.

# Background

I grew up in Austria in a household that didn’t believe in education. Instead of getting a high school diploma, I had to do an apprenticeship, which I successfully completed in interior design.

After that, I served in the military (mandatory in Austria). But due to my lack of formal education and only having experience from my apprenticeship, I was stuck in sales jobs—until I got an unexpected opportunity to help someone with their YouTube channel, which had around 120K subscribers at the time.

# The Social Media Chapter

From that point on, I dedicated every waking hour to supporting that channel. I earned enough to not worry about finding other employment, and at the same time, I attended evening school to make up for my lack of education.

Fast forward nine years:

* I completed evening school and earned a **bachelor’s degree in Media & Communication Science** (which, at the time, felt like a great decision, haha).
* The channel grew **to over 2.5 million subscribers**, with reach exceeding similar-sized channels.
* I also worked on **SEO, SEA, and general marketing** for smaller businesses.

# The Problem Now

Unfortunately, my biggest client retired, and the marketing work I’ve been doing just **isn’t enough to sustain me**.

I struggle **with networking—not because I lack communication skills** (I was in sales for years), but the thought of reaching out to people—especially cold calling—feels like a nightmare. I also never bothered to create a website, probably because **I don’t want to be a freelancer anymore**.

For the past few months, I’ve been applying to **marketing jobs in Vienna**, but:

* **Salaries are insanely low** (€2.2K–€2.7K before tax), especially considering relocation costs.
* **Competition is brutal**, with hundreds of applicants per position.
* Even though I feel **qualified**, I haven’t gotten any interviews yet (it’s only been a week of intense applications, so maybe too soon to judge).

# What I’m Looking For

Marketing doesn’t seem like the best field right now, my degree isn’t super useful on its own, and I **don’t want to freelance anymore**.

What I *do* want:

* **A stable job**
* **A chance to relocate to a major city**
* **A place to just grind, learn, and build skills while earning money**

Right now, my best bet seems to be **breaking into performance marketing**, since my skill set already overlaps with it and there are solid remote opportunities in the field. The challenge, though, is figuring out how to **network my way in**—which is something I’ve always struggled with.

1ixqagt,Attending Company events as a student,"Hi, I’m a student that’s looking for a job and there’s a company event that’s happening near me that I’m signed up for. However, it isn’t a hiring event, it’s an event primarily for clients and future clients of the company’s product. It is mainly a tech company, the CEO is there but I think it is geared towards sales.

I’m wondering if it’s a good idea to attend these to be noticed by the company’s employers / employees, or I’m just wasting my time?

Would employees see myself in a negative way for coming to a client oriented event looking for a job?

1ixpuct,"I’m terrified I’m about to lose my job, but don’t know if what I’m reading into is real.","There have been a few things I’ve noticed at this job since I joined 6 months ago:

1. I miss a deadline on an internal annual report for myself (the thing where you grade yourself and set objectives for the coming year). Boss sends me what reads as this long CYA note telling me how disappointed she is that I wasn’t prepared for our review together. She copies her boss. I reply point by point, acknowledging error, and outlining what I’ll do to make up for it. No response to the email, but we have our scheduled review the next week and it goes well. She seems genuinely interested in helping me outline goals for myself for the year.

2. A recent team member I manage had to be let go, and I’m not spooked that it was on my watch (she had been struggling before me), it’s the way the agency I work at went about it. They stalled for all sorts of reasons (account manager on vacation, holidays coming up, it’s her birthday) and after two months of me, her direct manager, needing to pretend she wasn’t getting canned for so long, I’m paranoid they’re doing the same with me.

3. This agency I work at has a need to drive new business, and while they took pains to not say I work in sales (because I suspect they can’t afford to / choose not to pay commission), part of my job description is to “convert” new business. My colleagues barely make their quarterly targets and I’ve closed on two, with help from other teams. I’ve witnessed a colleague get fired for lack of bringing in new business.

4. Here’s the biggest kicker that keeps me up right now: a few weeks back I was in a meeting where the founder said I should fly down to this other town where my other regional team (I manage two teams) is, to try and drum up new business meetings there too. I price out a few estimates and send them to my boss and her boss on an email. I follow up today, and she says “let’s discuss in our 1:1” and then in our 1:1 she tells me that request is now with the founder and to not worry about going anytime soon.

I’m not sure why I didn’t ask her for a reason, but she had this air of (or so I think) “oh yeah that’s a non-starter now” and I was feeling nervous about asking why.

Finally, there was this date on my calendar for presenting a brand new social strategy for the company, and in my last 1:1 my boss said to send the deck over, “whatever state it’s in,” to determine whether we want to push the presentation back a week. I took this as an opening (and needed the extra time) and sent it through saying it’s not ready for presenting just yet, and with one more week it will be. She cancels the presentation meeting and then during our team monthly the founder says how disappointed he is that the strategy wasn’t ready to talk through.

So, there it is. I can give every excuse for my missed deadlines and lack of new business, but as it stands my results just aren’t great, and this job has taken a lot of my time simply managing people. I know where I stand to improve and outlined it with my boss.

But now I fear I’m too late, and it’s a matter of time before they let me go.

What do you think? This doesn’t look good, right? I should devote my time towards looking for a new job, right?

I’m stressing and can’t sleep because of that request to fly to a town where my team is, one the founder had floated the idea for, and now seems to have denied.

Thanks for listening.

Here’s what I’m looking for in a college:

✔ Great social life – A campus where students actually enjoy, not just study.

I have another exam of the same type coming in 4 months and am thinking of attempting one last time), the problem now is that I have a sort of dreaded feel in me about whether I would crack it or not.

But recently I came across some YouTube videos on career options for math graduates. That was were I found out about Operations Analyst/Supply Chain Analytics. I would like to know more about it because I found the YouTube videos to be kind of motivational and like everyone could crack in 3-6 months which I found to be incredulous.

1ixoott,Step Backward?,"Hi All,
First off, after being let go from my job in December, I’m happy to report that I got an offer yesterday (pending background check)! I’m feeling grateful for the opportunity, and I really like the company, however, I was applying for a “Senior Specialist” position and, was offered a “Specialist” position instead. 

The question is less of “should I accept the offer”, and more of, how do you think this will look in terms of career progression (on paper)? I’ve gone from a Manager, to Senior Specialist, and now to Specialist within the last five years? It feels like progress—getting to learn from more and more competent people every time—but I’m in the running for two manager positions, and I wonder if I should jump to one of those if I get an offer (since the pay will be comparable, and I like the companies equally) just so that I doesn’t look like I’m regressing. 

What do you all think?

P.S. Context is also that I’ve struggled to find my place over the last four years. Never been promoted; constantly hostile environments. This place feels like I have a real chance to grow with the company. I’m not being superficial, but I’ve been comfortable with the manager assessments, so I wonder if I’m selling myself short.

1ixnn08,Looking at other jobs despite looking flaky after 3 jobs in this scientifically strapped environment?,"I'm a researcher with an MS in biomedical engineering. I'm now at my current position in the Seattle region after two previous positions, the first of which I got right before COVID-19 and the next which was in a city that simply didn't work for me. 

While I do enjoy the area here and the team I work with, it's now really starting to hit me that I haven't really progressed in my overall standing professionally and have only taken serious blows to my pay. Despite having gained skills that many of my team members don't have such as Python/R programming for data science and having learned new lab techniques, I've gone from an initial salary of $70K at my first job to my now current salary of $45K since getting hired last March. In fact, I'm not even breaking above the median level for my pay grade.

I've gently brought up the idea to my boss that I would appreciate a promotion considering my stalled professional standing and great annual reviews. After all, she just hired someone two levels above me for a job which turns out I'm perfectly suited for based on its listed requirements. However, she basically brushed it aside, suggesting I was still an ""early level"" researcher despite having over 4 years of experience.

Unfortunately, my current place is a non-profit hospital, and about half of our funding is NIH-based. Needless to say, this will likely put a major damper on my hopes of getting a major raise any time soon. I'm also afraid that looking for a job for a 4th time will also make me look awfully flaky to future employers. On the other hand, I simply can't live with this awful pay in an area as expensive as Seattle.

1ixmjw4,"Going to Stuck in a High-Workload, Low-Learning Project—Need Career Advice!","Hey everyone,

I have 2.5+ years of experience as a Data Analyst, but I initially joined as a fresher and spent my first 10 months on the bench. After that, I was placed in an internal accelerator project using Python and SQL. Later, I moved into an analyst role where I worked with BRDs (Business Requirement Documents) to create reporting layer views in Snowflake, applying joins and transformations based on business and visualization needs.

Later, I transitioned to an ETL-related project, focusing on transformation and load (not extraction) in Snowflake. Currently, I’m working on a similar ETL project in Microsoft Fabric, handling data pipelines, notebooks (minimal), lakehouse, data warehouse, and deployment pipelines. However, this project is ending in the next 10 days, and there’s a high chance I’ll be assigned to a BI tool migration project—like Tableau to Power BI or WebFocus to QuickSight.

The problem is, I don’t see much learning in that kind of project. While some may say learning new things is always beneficial, I feel that at this stage of my career, I need to build depth in a specific tech stack rather than constantly switching. I don’t mean limiting myself to just Snowflake or Databricks, but I want to focus on Data Engineering for a few more years to gain a solid foundation.

I’m more interested in AI and data analysis with coding, not BI. If I get assigned to this BI migration project, I won’t have time to upskill because the working hours are insane—people on that project are working 15 to 17 hours daily. That kind of workload would leave me with no energy or time to focus on my learning and career growth.

If I tell them I don’t want to work on this project, they might ask me to resign, which puts me in a tough spot because I still need time to upskill before switching jobs. But if I accept it, I’ll be stuck in a high-stress, low-learning role, making it even harder to transition later.

I’m really stuck on what to do next. Should I take the risk and reject the project to focus on upskilling and job hunting? Or should I accept it despite the challenges?

1ixjozb,Are there any high paying jobs in the Uk for an English literature graduate,"I’m currently a first year university student at a good university studying English literature. I kinda think I made a mistake with my degree as I wanted to go to university but didn’t know what to do with my life so I just picked what I enjoyed which was English literature but I’m increasingly regretting my choice after looking into job prospects. There’s some careers I’ve thought about such as teaching (but that’s not too appealing to me)social work, journalism or attempting to get onto a speech and language therapy masters but I’m scared of being in more debt. Social work is definitely something I would consider but I would also have to do the masters in which would mean 5 years of student debt for a job that is overworked and underpaid. 
Does anyone have any further advice in these fields or know about the application of conversion courses after my BA to a field that will lead to a comfortable wage and isn’t rly stressful but from what it seems I don’t think that is worth the debt either.

1ixjo8d,What career paths would be lucrative for my wife?,"I have been helping my girl with her next career steps, and want to hear some feedback on options I may not have considered. I think she has an absolute ton of potential and want her to succeed in her work. I think she would kill it doing sales, marketing, event planning, etc. what are your thoughts.

The good:

* She is a people person, with people skills I have never seen before. Everyone loves her, she’s a ray of sunshine and can get a conversation out of even the grumpiest people.
* she loves helping people, will go above and beyond for people.
* she’s cute, pretty blue eyes, nice smile.
* She is former Army with a bachelors in criminal justice
* she takes her work very seriously, no matter what it is, she works very hard and takes pride in being good at her job.
* she loves cars and motorcycles, it’s what brought us together and it’s something she is passionate about.

The “bad”

* her degree doesn’t really line up with what I think her natural gifts are.
* she’s not the brightest. I’m no Einstein either, but she’s not a very critical thinking analytical person. Intellectual careers probably wouldn’t be a great fit.
* she’s currently a barista, not necessarily a bad thing, but just the situation where her current job doesn’t really give her any insight on what she wants to do next.",rnolan20,0,0.3799999952316284,15,1740448825,2025-02-25 02:00:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixjo8d/what_career_paths_would_be_lucrative_for_my_wife/,2,2025
1ixjlwx,Should I quit my job and work for my dad?,"Hi all, recent college graduate seeking advice. I know I am very lucky to even have these decisions to make! But I'm still very young and looking for advice from older professionals. No need to read this whole post. So, here's the situation:

* I graduated college less than a year ago and currently hold a different job. It's not quite the dream job I pictured and I'm actively searching for a new position (I've turned down 2 offers and am continuing to interview, I think I might have something in place soon).
* My dad owns a small company in the finance sector. He's looking to retire probably within the next 5 years. I have no real experience in his field, although I believe I would enjoy it and have been trying for similar jobs.

Here are the factors that I've been considering:

* Pro: I'd make great money (probably the most available to me at my current level) and would learn a lot about the field. I also would be positioned pretty well for a leadership position. In the next 5-10 years, I'd say I have a good chance of making a lot of money and potentially taking over the company.
* Con: The job is in a town where I don't know many people my own age (didn't go to school here), and it's pretty small. Not a lot of young people to my knowledge, and the office isn't in the greatest area. There isn't a big city nearby either. It is a lower cost of living area, which at least is one positive.
* The other positions I am considering are in a larger city where I have some friends and family, and what seems to be many more opportunities to make friends. I really want to try living in a semi-big city in my 20s and I'm worried I will regret not taking the chance.
* I don't have any debt and I have a pretty good savings account.
* If I don't take the opportunity to work for my Dad now, there is a very good chance that he will sell the company and my window of opportunity will close.

Here are my main concerns with not taking the job at my Dad's:

1. Not making as much money as I could have and wasting this opportunity
2. Missing out on the opportunity to fast-track my career and learn as much as possible.
3. It feels irresponsible not to take an advantage of an opportunity that most people would dream of.

Here are my main concerns with taking the job at my Dad's:

1. Being considered ""the boss's daughter"" and never being taken seriously, especially as a 22 year old in an office of 40+ year olds (if my Dad retires in 5 years, I'd only be 27)
2. I'm worried that I'd never develop the same social circle that I used to have in college - I'm having a hard time making friends here, most of the people that I used to know here have moved to bigger cities.
3. I really, really want to live in the city. I don't know if I'm being immature and it's time to ""grow up"" and think practically, but I'm worried I'm going to regret staying in this town.

I wish my Dad had another 20 years left and I could get experience at a different, larger company and then join him if the opportunity presented itself, but I just don't have that much time. I'm hoping someone with more maturity and professional experience might have some advice!",Chocolate_chip954,12,1.0,33,1740448640,2025-02-25 01:57:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixjlwx/should_i_quit_my_job_and_work_for_my_dad/,2,2025

1ixilht,Where to go from here?,"I’ve hit a bit of a crossroads in my career concerning the usual balance of work/life/money. 

I started my career out of high school in the oilfield in a field engineering role. The schedule was 2 weeks in 2 weeks off and the money was fantastic. By the time I finally left I was clearing $250k/yr. The issue was, I had become so obsessed with money that I was working over a bunch and it ended up tearing my family apart. 

I eventually ended up leaving that role and transferring to the downstream (refinery) side. It paid less but gave me a better work/life balance. A couple years into that role Covid hit and my entire department was closed down. So I returned to the oilfield side once again. By this time I was dating my now wife. Once we discovered she was pregnant, we discussed me attempting to return to the refinery side to be home more.

I found a local role with my former company in a different product line and applied. I was called and interviewed the next day and offered the position. The job description was mainly travel to job site on Monday, work Tuesday, travel home Wednesday and wfh Thursday and Friday. No weekend work. The money isn’t nearly as much as the drilling side but still pays decent money, around $140K with bonuses. 

The issue now is, the directive from corporate is we need to work more directly on revenue producing jobs. They want to eliminate as much of the wfh Th/F as possible and have started quoting jobs working over weekends which we have never had to do. We are also now expected to do our administrative work (the former Th/F work) on weekends if we’re not scheduled on a client site. Also now, if you are unscheduled you’re expected to be able to be at the airport and on a flight within 4 hours. That’s nearly impossible with having to arrange childcare at the last second. 

It has come to a point that it’s not really worth it for the salary considering I could go back upstream and make $100K+/yr more while working less. But overall, I just want to be home more and not be gone as much. Taking a sub 6 figure job isn’t really an option with my mortgage. We’ve been throwing around the idea of going back again but I’m in my 40’s now and don’t want to live that life anymore. 

I don’t really know where I can go from here. Everything in industry in the area is heavily union and I’m not a member. So my ability to walk into a plant and get a job based on my experience is pretty well zero. And, even though I have over 20 years of experience in this area, they pretty well all require degrees now. I’m just kind of at a loss at the moment and don’t really know what I can do.

1ixhcgj,"Didn't read the job description recruiter sent me because I assumed it was the same as the one I applied for, is it my own fault if they underpay me?","Long story short, I applied for a position at a senior level that paid upwards of $50 an hour. It asked for 7 years of experience. 

Got a call that same day about the position from the recruiter. they described the job and the responsibilities were the same.   
  
They then sent over the job description. Told them I reviewed the job description when I applied and that they should already have my resume.   
  
Did 2 rounds of interviews and they are interested in me, and even said I seemed ""overqualified."" which was strange.  
  
So I went back and read what she sent me, and what the recruiter sent me changed the ""Senior"" title down to ""Associate."" and lowered the required experience down from 7 years to 5 years, and they omitted the rate.   
  
Everything else about the job matched EXACTLY the one I applied to. They even left the original abbreviation for the position in the job description (They left it as S for senior vs an A for associate) meaning the recruiter went in and changed out the title but missed the abbreviation.

I then found the job description for the less senior role and it pays, $35 an hour. $15 an hour less than what I originally applied for. And in THAT job description the abbreviation IS correct (it lists the A) meaning it wasn't copy pasted, it means they literally went in and manually changed it. 

I can also see that I have a notification saying I clearly applied for the senior role, and the Associate role doesn't show any indication that I applied to it. 

However, because I didn't actually look at what they sent over and only looked at the original job post I applied to I'm wondering if it's actually MY fault since I technically agreed to the job and said I read the job description (even though I meant the one I applied to, not the one they sent me).

Which makes me wonder if I even have any leg to stand on to negotiate my salary if they come back with the $35 offer vs the $50 offer. 

So is it my fault for not checking what the recruiter sent over? Or is it sneaky for the company to do that knowing full well a candite applied for a role and then changed it to a different one that what they applied to to try and justify offering lower pay.

1ixgf0s,Considering leaving trades for white collar,"So my whole life it's been put on me that trades are the escape, your golden ticket. I turned 19 and became and electrician. In the 1 year I've been an apprentice I've seen so many people come and go. I've seen people who are 15 year journeymen working for the same company be let go, and I've seen people who've barely been employed a week let go. So all this has me wondering what's so good about trades if there's little to no job security? If it's widely known you'll be laid off eventually, where does your job security come from? I have no issues with the physical labor aspect or the long hours, I find the time usually flies by. But my biggest thing is job security. I'd like to not have to worry about being laid off in large batches. For example the company I work for recently laid off \~850 workers, and most of them I had worked with before and they put in more production than me. 

**So this has me wondering what white collar jobs could I do? I'm 20 with nothing beyond a high school diploma, soft skills and decent knowledge of Microsoft Office from a high school business class. I'm not opposed to online courses for certifications or to qualify myself. I know nothing about programming but I'm always open to learn anything. If going to a 2-4 year college is inevitable for any white collar position with actual career growth, I'm realizing I might have to just suck it up and deal with it. I'm open to doing courses and working my current job as well. The only thing I really am opposed to is being in a call center or constantly on the phone. And preferably it would match or better my current pay of $19hr. I know this is really long but I feel really lost about this whole career thing, and don't really have anyone in my life to ask for guidance or help.** ",Otherwise-Tension232,1,1.0,2,1740439701,2025-02-24 23:28:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixgf0s/considering_leaving_trades_for_white_collar/,2,2025
1ixg5rx,Applied for a job. Got contacted to interview. Then the job description they sent over is slightly different. What do I do?,"So I applied for a position where it was a Senior level and asked for 7 years of experience with a pay rate of $50 an hour. I applied for the job and got contacted by the recruiter and did a first-round interview. They then scheduled a second round which I just finished today.

Then they ""resent"" the job description. Only now, they omitted the salary, changed the ""Senior"" title down to ""Associate"" and lowered the required experience down from 7 years to 5. 

Everything else about the job is exactly the same. And I don't mean ""similar"" I mean the job description they sent me is copy pasted from the one I applied to, minus the years of experience being different and the title being different. 

They even left an abbreviation for the job that matches the original title and not the new one (left in the S for senior instead of replacing it with A for associate).

There is no indication that I will be reporting to anyone, I would be handling the job myself and I'm expected to do all the same duties that is listed on the ""Senior"" role. 

The original role for the senior position is also still listed, although they are no longer taking applications, and I can't find any role that's listed at the associate level. 

I'm worried they are going to low ball me now and just say it's ""my fault"" for not reviewing the job description properly, even though I shouldn't have to when I can already see the job I applied to and it should be the same. 

If I get low balled, what should I do to counteract this?

I was a part time (\~28h/week) manager at a medium sized city community center for a year in 2022 and did quite well in that position and got a lot of experience with customer service, computer administration software, and processing sales information. I'm hoping that I can turn this experience plus my college degree into a career, but I am not sure what I would be suited for. 

I quit my job in 2023 to focus on racing road and mountain bikes and have not had any notable work experience since then. I've had a student leadership position as treasurer for a relatively large student organization, but I'm not sure if this is something that would go on a resume or not. Additionally, I also was an Eagle Scout with Scouts BSA, but I'm not sure if this bears mentioning. In the past people told me that it could help me get a job, but I'm not really sure if this holds any water.

I also have Linux skills from computer stuff being my hobby, but I cannot code much at all and I don't have a certificate so I'm not sure if I can do anything with this.

I'm open to any and all careers, but I am hoping that I can make 30,000 euros per year or more.

1ixfa0c,For those who accepted their current company's counter offer; How's it going?,"I am entering the final round of interviewing for a position that will be starting at nearly 50% higher than my current salary. It's really more of a formality, the explanation I was given today by the Director of the department is that the CPO usually agrees with his hiring decisions and expects me to be one of them. However, I absolutely love my company and management so I would consider a counter offer from them if they are able to get close to this number. 

I have read horror stories about people that have stayed and then were mistreated by their current company or fired shortly thereafter once they have found a replacement etc. I don't think my company would do that, but I still feel that if I stayed it would be at least somewhat awkward and borderline frustrating considering it takes an offer in order to drastically increase pay instead of the annual few percent companies give nowadays. 

So for those that have accepted a counter within their current company, how are things?",Bojangled8,5,0.8600000143051147,32,1740436769,2025-02-24 22:39:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixfa0c/for_those_who_accepted_their_current_companys/,2,2025
1ixerav,Annoying work situation – WWYD?,"So I've gotten myself into this really annoying work situation, and not sure what I should do.

I'm an editor and proofreader – changed career a few years ago from technical writing, and always wanted to work freelance. Started doing that in 2020, and was pretty good at finding new clients, and built that up. One of my best clients was a comms company that has a lot of multinational and government clients, and I was getting fairly regular work from them alongside my publishing and academic clients. The government work comes through sporadically, but pays really well – like, close to twice as much as the average publisher will pay, and maybe 1.5x as much as the industry average. But generally it will only be a few weeks' work at a time. It sort of works to subsidise quiet patches, and averaged out to a fairly decent yearly income.

About a year ago, this comms company got in touch with me and asked if I'd like to come in-house. I was sort of flattered to be asked but annoyed at the same time, because I really liked being freelance, but as this was one of my best clients, I was worried that if I said no, I would get less work from them. I now realise, knowing more, that this probably wouldn't have been the case. But I said yes. I didn't want to lose my other clients, and I wasn't convinced they had enough work year-round to pay me full-time, so we agreed to me working 3 days a week at an hourly rate that was about the average of what publishers would pay – so way less than government pay, and maybe 20% less than they had been paying me on other projects up until then, but the idea was that the work would be every week, and even if there was no work on a particular week, I'd get paid for those hours anyway. So I thought it would even out through the year.

But the company has had poor cash flow for the last few months, so that last part of the agreement went out of the window. It's a zero hours contract, which I was fine with, because it allows the hours to flex – so I can choose to do, say, full-time one week and then take the next week off, based on the work available. But obviously that means they don't have to keep to what they agreed. It's mostly levelled out, but only because I've done extra hours where I shouldn't have, and burnt the midnight oil on working on other projects in tandem with theirs. The job was also useless when I was looking into getting a mortgage. I thought that having a salaried in-house job would be a sensible choice in that sense, but in terms of the mortgage companies, it put me in a worse position than I would've been self-employed, as I have to wait until I've been there for a year to be able to apply. It'll be a year in April.

The issue I have coming up, which is really making me want out, is that they have around four months of solid government work coming up – they said if possible, can I work on it full-time, and not do any work alongside it. I would've been over the moon about that two years ago, because the hourly rate is so good. But now I'll just be working really hard alongside a team of people who are all earning the hourly pay I was previously earning, while I know I can't earn more than the pay stipulated in my contract. They will be earning 1.6x as much as me for exactly the same work. Also, because I am only part-time, I still have a tax bill to pay for my self-employed earnings – and this job pays my tax to the state as I earn. So that will be four months of much less pay than previously, but also a chunk of tax taken out at source – making it really hard to set aside anything for my next tax bill in January during that period.  I just know that I'm going to be resentful about being in that position for that length of time – but I love the work, so I also wouldn't want to be taken off the job. And it isn't *terrible* money, just a lot less than before.

I'm really tempted to hand in my notice before the government work starts, but I know it could go one of three ways:

1. The boss takes offence, esp. as the company's financial position is often precarious, and no doubt they are banking on taking the huge margin they'll make on the work I'm doing to help rectify the situation for the coming year. Me and the boss are the only two in-house people who can edit. The rest are admin staff. So she could decide to take on the job and cancel my involvement in it completely. So I go from earning 1.6x less than my peers to earning nothing at all and having to figure out what else to do.

2. They could keep me on (there are only a few people cleared to work on the government stuff, so they don't have loads of people to choose between), but reduce my hours.

3. Best case scenario. I could keep the same hours and go back to my previous earnings, and be quids in. I think this is probably the least likely, but the Editorial Lead, who is freelance, divvies up the roles, and I know she thinks I'm in a pretty crappy position and she was surprised when I said yes in the first place.

Just wishing I'd never said yes. I have always done best when looking out for myself, and I just feel like I was given a real poisoned chalice here. The rest of the team carry on at their high rates regardless, and I might lose the whole project if I say something, but it just seems so unfair to be doing the same work for so much less. I don't even feel the job offers very much security, given that it's zero hours, etc.

Sigh – would be great to get some thoughts on this.",KSF2,1,1.0,0,1740435469,2025-02-24 22:17:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixerav/annoying_work_situation_wwyd/,2,2025

1ixdfc5,Performance Bonus Timing,"Hi all,

Hoping to get some advice/opinions on what has been weighing on my mind for the past couple of days. 

I’ve recently accepted an offer to start with a new company later next month. I’m really excited about the opportunity and also still have a good relationship with my current employer. 

What’s tricky is we are due for our performance bonus for last year within the next week or so. This is going to be a very sizable bonus and the money would be great to have. My dilemma is the timing of letting my current employer know I’ve accepted an offer at a different company. Do I notify them as soon as the bonus drops? Is there a respectful amount of time that can pass after the bonus drops to notifying them?

In a perfect world I let them know ahead of time, but I’m worried about the jeopardizing the bonus payout. Am I being silly for even worrying about how the timing plays out? I can’t help but feel bad about the optics of the situation.  

Anyways, appreciate the advice.

It's had the highest turnover rate where clients were usually unhappy.

My previous predecessors had 8 months (longest survivor), 6 months, 4 months, and then 2 months. I'm at 13 months now. I thought I'd at least get 5% considering the factors... Previously, I have always gave my employees a real raise meaning their raise was above inflation unless corporate took over because I personally believe that any raise not beating inflation is essentially a pay cut. Here the raise did not meet inflation. The manager justified that it was because I negotiated really well when I started. I do admit I am paid well when I started for my industry.

1ixcgmn,Got skipped over on a promotion and now my promotion is being pushed off to a later date,"TLDR: I was supposed to be promoted to a level two engineer on March 1st and found out my coworker with 1 year less of experience got promoted over me without doing anything more meanwhile I had to do way more tasks and new responsibilities. Was told the promotion could be moved up if I took on some of the responsibilities my supervisor does which isn’t my job at all, which I did, and now he doesn’t know when I’m supposed to be promoted. 

I’ve been in my career field for over 3.5 years and just hit 3 years at my current company almost two months ago. I’m currently at a level one engineer position and previously my company had job descriptions for a level two in my area of work which had said 2+ years of experience. After I had over 2 years total experience I had a one-on-one with my supervisor and asked what I needed to do to be able to be promoted to a level two since my job duties at the time aligned more with a level two than what I was currently doing as a level one since a level one is more entry level. A month passes and my monthly one-on-one gets canceled and pushed to the next month. At this time I noticed the job description for engineer 2 was changed and now says 3+ years of experience and when I finally had my one on one my supervisor said he thought about it and I would have to take on certain responsibilities and go out of state for certain trainings that we need experience in for our company and that since I only had a little over two years experience at that time, they want 3+ years for the role so my promotion wouldn’t happen for several months. 
I have another coworker that is in the exact same position as I am, same team, same supervisor, same duties, same everything. This coworker started here several month after graduating college with no prior work experience and he started 6 months after I started here so I have about a years worth more of experience in this position. This coworker also was interested in being promoted to a level two engineer and a few months after I had asked about it and was given certain responsibilities to work towards a promotion, he asked our supervisor since he now had around 1.5 years of experience. My supervisor gave him no new responsibilities and he didn’t have to go do trainings to be more qualified which didn’t make any sense. He was just supposed to carry on the way he currently is. 
One year passes and it is now December 2024, I have a one on one with my supervisor in which he tells me my promotion is scheduled for March 1st of 2025 so when that happens I’ll have over 3.5 years in this role by the time I get promoted but whatever I guess. Then he tells me my coworker was promoted December 1st. I ask him why he got promoted before I did and he just says that’s the way it worked out and he gives me no explanation. I ask if I’m doing anything wrong and he says no and that I’m doing a great job. I’m visibly upset and mention how I asked about this promotion well over a year ago and how I was told it would happen in the fall of 2024 but because of the fiscal year budget it had to be worked into fiscal year 2025 and how I have a years more of experience over my coworker when we do the same job but now I have more responsibilities within the team and have done trainings to help with our duties and my coworker didn’t have to do anything and he gets promoted. I get no answers and my supervisor just seems confused about my reactions. A couple days pass and we have another one on one in which he explains that he can move my promotion up and I will get it sooner if I do ‘x’ and ‘y’ and ‘z’. Just more responsibilities essentially and most of it is what he is supposed to be doing so it seems he’s offloading his work load onto me which is not what my job duties entail at all. I’ve been doing what he said I need to do to be promoted so I ask about the promotion and he mentions he’s not sure when it’s scheduled and thought it was scheduled for April or maybe May. I mention how he told me March 1st (I looked back through my text messages since I vented to my fiance about my coworker getting promoted over me and sure enough he said March 1st) and his response was he’ll have to check with HR and get back to me. I asked again last week if he had any update and he told me he hasn’t heard back from HR yet and since March 1st is less than a week away there’s no chance that’s when I’m being promoted so I was lied about the date and then I was given supervisor responsibilities as a level one engineer in order to move the promotion up but instead it got pushed out. Don’t even know what to do anymore but I’m done getting pushed around but at the same time I don’t want to cause issues and get fired since I don’t have another job lined up yet. Need advice on how to manage this situation and maybe what I should’ve done previously to prevent this from happening (someone I know mentioned I should’ve gotten this all in writing or an email which I agree with)",zgallus25,2,1.0,3,1740429871,2025-02-24 20:44:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ixcgmn/got_skipped_over_on_a_promotion_and_now_my/,2,2025
1ixc3yr,Getting Ghosted By New Employer Before Even Starting Said Job,"Hello everyone, the title pretty much sums up my situation for TLDR. 

Basically, I got offered a part-time sales position at Best Buy recently after applying for full-time and being told that I simply didn’t have enough availability for full-time per their policy. At the end of the conversation, I asked the typical will I hear back whether or not I get the job and the hiring manager said he would like to offer me a position on the spot. He said he was just about to have the application released for part-time applicants however he wanted me to get to it first and let me know around the time it would be released. As soon as I re-applied, I texted the employee phone (which is like a communal iPhone of the Best Buy store that is used to communicate with incoming employees) which I had been told gets looked at at least once every hour in terms of messages and calls. I had been answered within two hours and told great, I will let *insert Hiring Manager name here*  know. I never received a follow up email letting me know that they were moving forward with my application like they had with my other one, so I sent a text to the same phone asking if there was anything else I might have forgotten to do while waiting to hear back or is it OK for me to just come in and sign my W-9s or if I should wait? You know, something simple to give them a reason to answer me. Not only did my message not get read within the entire first 24 hours, but my message got read the following morning before the store was even open and I still haven’t heard back. 

I’m about to make a phone call to the store and ask if there’s anything wrong because I have a feeling this might have to do with reaching out with my former employer who genuinely had it out for me and would definitely take any opportunity to trash me; assuming anyone hiring actually still calls former employers. I don’t know whether to get my hopes up and doubt he reached out to her particularly or to just accept that he likely did and this is the end for me right now. 

Before I make this call, are there any tips to give, questions I should ask, or things I should do prior to or during the call? Although recording without second party consent is illegal in my state, I fully plan to document the conversation just for my own personal comfort and not use it against them without reason or levy. also one last question; when you look up the Best Buy, their primary store phone number is different from the one that was texting me, should I call this employee-communication phone or the store phone?

1ixc1jq,I’m getting blamed on all sides for a training issue that I’ve continuously tried to resolve—how do I move forward?,"TLDR: no one in my department knows how to do my job. I’ve asked another department who used to do my job how I should do things, but all of them do the job a different way and think that the other person is incorrect. No one wants to put anything in writing, and I’m now getting push back and blame from others because of it. 

Hello!

I work for a company that has great benefits and pay, along with quite a few perks: free lunch, open kitchens, wellness rooms, gym, etc. The list could truly go on. 

On paper, this sounds like a great company to work for; however, I’m running into an issue where I end up getting blamed on all sides for a training issue that I’ve tried to resolve on multiple occasions. 

As soon as I started my job, I was told that “everyone does things a different way—just take what you’re told and make it your own.” This was already confusing given the fact that I was new and I wanted to have something concrete to follow until I got my foot in the door, but it got worse when I learned that the role that I was taking on for my department was one that no one else in my department knew how to do, and that they weren’t entirely sure if I was doing it correctly. 

There were instructions written up, but when I followed those instructions, I’d get push back from others in our company about the way I handled things, and my manager was of no help. 

I tried talking to another department  who used to handle my job before I did, however, I got a lot of round about answers (ex: they’d say that the way I was taught was technically correct, but that’s not how they’d do it, but it was still okay). Everyone has a different way of doing the same job in that department, but no one was willing to put anything in writing. 

This is another issue that I’m running into with my company. No one is willing to put anything in writing, and they ignore emails if sent out unless you verbally ask them or they’re (presumably) confident about answering the question posed. 

I know this is a red flag…I have a coworker who’s been here for over 20 years who champions for me and shields me from a lot of the things people try to throw at me because she understands that it’s a training issue as well. Apparently, this is how the company operates in that they won’t set clear standards or won’t standardize things, leading to discontent. Apparently this is common among most departments here.  

I’ve tried asking my manager to set up a couple meetings with the other department that used to do my job so that I could learn from them—I’ve been asking since last year—but nothing has come from it. And every time I feel like I get a grasp on what I’m doing, someone tells me I’m wrong. 

I’ve never had a job like this; in fact, it’s my first real corporate job, and Im thankful that I have it. But should I leave? Or should I stick it out and keep pushing for better training?

I’m getting worried that I’m going to continue to get blamed for a lot of things, when I’m truly trying to make sure I’m taking the correct steps at every point. It’s beginning to stress me out.

1ixbs0g,Feeling Betrayed and Stuck—Need Advice on Career Move,"I’m losing my mind over this and could use some advice. I feel betrayed, frustrated, and exhausted.

I’m really good at my job—like, really good. I got this role last year, and within months, changes were being made because of my impact. Internal and external partners constantly praise my work, which makes my managers and directors look great. You get the idea—I perform, and they benefit.

A director from another team approached me with what seemed like a promotion. She offered me the role on a Monday, but by Wednesday, it suddenly became a lateral move—same level, just a 5% increase, and way more work. A manager friend told me that when roles are posted, the budget is already set, meaning my current manager likely blocked the promotion, so the director downgraded the offer. My manager knew I wouldn’t take double the work for just 5%, so I stayed in my role. That’s when my trust in him evaporated.

I kept my head down and kept working. Then, a friend told me about a role in another team that I’d be perfect for. I applied and have interviews next week. When I told my manager, he panicked. Turns out, there’s an upcoming project that requires a bilingual employee (I'm trilingual —my colleagues only speak one language), and they wanted me to lead it. He escalated it to the director and VP, who basically begged me to stay, saying I was perfect for it.

I asked for more money. They said there was none. Now I see them scrambling, and I can’t lie—part of me enjoys it.

My partner thinks I shouldn’t take the new role because our pay 5% increase come in July, and the new job is similar to my current one, is lateral and with a 5% increase. She thinks I should wait for a real promotion elsewhere within the company since my manager can block internal moves. Lateral is only 5% increase meanwhile a promotion is between 10k to 20k.

1ix9e1r,Tired of my 9-6 attorney life,"Hi everyone, I (m, 30 y.o.) need advice. I work full time as an attorney and I decent money (around 120k) a year living in NYC. I also run a successful tutoring side gig. The office I work at is net-positive. My coworkers are great and my supervising partners are also kind and responsive and understanding. Regardless, however, I am miserable and find myself having a two-fold issue. The legal job I have now is extremely pedantic. I feel like I'm doing a lot of the procedural nonsense at times. At other times, it's extremely combative, and I feel like I'm constantly engaging in pissing matches with other attorneys for stupid nonsense. I'm always stressed out and feel no fulfillment or joy from going to work. I force myself to get up and feel like I'm back in high school, forcing myself to function. On Sundays, I get minorly depressed because the idea of coming into work depletes my mood. I am only excited on Fridays because the weekend is coming up. I work all weekend and weekday nights as a tutor and absolutely love it. 

  
At this point in my life, I want to leave the legal job completely. I've worked in quite a few firms and have pretty much hated working in all of them. I became an attorney because it seemed like a nice default, and it was my mom and dad's dream for me to become one. Again, I absolutely hate it. I, on the other hand, love working with students. I never get tired of it!

1ix8lqu,"25 years old, undecided whether to quit work for college","Hi everyone,

I'm an Italian guy, 25 years old, currently working as a frontend developer in Milan, earning around €33k per year (plus meal vouchers and bonuses). Since I was young, I've had a huge passion for programming and web development. After finishing my technical high school (ITIS), I jumped straight into the workforce, convinced I was on the right path… or so I thought.

Over the past few months, however, I've started seriously rethinking my career. I've been self-studying various topics—databases, backend development with Node.js, data structures, and algorithms—and I've realized that, despite my efforts, I still lack some fundamental knowledge. Not having started a university course right after high school sometimes leaves me feeling inadequate, almost with a sense of inferiority.

I'd love to get back to school to fill in these gaps and fully immerse myself in studying, particularly in more specialized areas like AI development and research. Yet, I'm torn: on one hand, there's the traditional university route (a bachelor's plus master's, roughly 5 years full-time), and on the other, an online program. I've looked into Italian options like UniMarconi and UniNettuno, but they didn't quite convince me, while some international programs seem to come with pretty high costs.

I still live with my parents, which gives me some financial security, but that doesn't erase the anxiety and uncertainty of leaving a stable job to embark on such a huge challenge. I'm caught between the desire to reignite that spark for learning and the fear of diving into a path that demands years of sacrifice without guaranteed outcomes.

I'm reaching out to ask if anyone has faced a similar dilemma:

* What have been the pros and cons of leaving a job to return to study?
* For those who've chosen either the traditional or online path, what factors—such as teaching quality, networking opportunities, costs, etc.—were most decisive for you?
* How did you approach the cost/benefit analysis of such a big decision?

I'm genuinely looking for honest advice and insights because every experience could help me make the right choice.

1ix81cp,Company got sold to private equity - what to do as an employee?,"I've been working as a technician for over 10 years for a small business (in the trades). We're well-known within the local community and have good customer relationships. I've also got a great relationship with the owner. Things have been good at work the past few years.

This morning, the owner sat us all down to let us know that he had formally sold the company to a private equity group. We had a feeling that this would be coming over the course of the last few years. He's been getting older, and retirement was on the horizon. Thinking back, it seemed like we started to follow new processes and made more of an effort to track things like timesheets more accurately. So I guess it wasn't totally out of the blue.

After he told us that he'd sold the company, the new owners talked to us. They assured us that nothing was going to change and that they owned a bunch of other businesses like ours across the country, so the business is going to stay in good hands.

I've heard some bad things about private equity groups buying businesses like ours and then firing everyone or making a ton of changes.

He had called my placement cell back then also. Then i wrote a mail to him and attached all the medical documents.

I have not reached out to them yet and they have not reached out to me, but they made it very clear that if I had any questions from last Tuesday to this coming Tuesday I could reach out through call or email.

This morning, I got a notification from ZipRecruiter that they had put a thumbs up on my application, which (YAY) and I clicked on the notification, and saw the position was closed. My heart sank a bit, as they haven’t even met with me for my second round yet. To clarify there are only two rounds of interviews, and this is a smaller company with a small staff, so they haven’t been taking in a whole lot of interviews for this particular position.

I don’t know if anyone has had experience with this, but I’m quite confused as to whether I got the job or not, and if I go in for my second round tomorrow am I wasting my time? Has the position already been filled? Should I reach out with questions or to ask if the position has already been filled? Should I have already reached out? Did they automatically choose me? 

I may be overthinking this. But I almost feel desperate for this job, as I’m looking to get out of my current job ASAP and this new opportunity is exactly what I’ve been looking for. Let me know if you’ve seen this before and how you navigated it, or if you have any ideas as to what a “thumbs-up-position-closed” situation could mean.",lean_cloud,1,1.0,2,1740415079,2025-02-24 16:37:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ix6bun/thumbs_up_on_ziprecruiter_but_position_closed/,2,2025

1ix5zxw,How to handle one person at work?,"I have been at my job for almost 5 months now. The company is great, coworkers are all super nice and treat me well. The owners are awesome too. 
My one and only caveat is the customer service rep I work with a lot. She trained me and knows the ins and outs of the job as she’s been here for years. 
Her criticism when I make a mistake isn’t always constructive. Sometimes has an attitude. Ex once she said“ you’ve been here forever you shouldn’t be making these mistakes” (4-5 months is NOT forever)
She was off for about a week and I covered for her. I found myself a lot more confident while she was away. I could do my work and not worry about what she’s gonna say next. She is not a superior, my manager is very constructive when he points out things I can do better.

I knew this would be overwhelming when I joined, but I *underestimated* just how much. Right now, I feel completely lost. I feel so intimidated by those around me. I don’t know what to focus on or where to start. I really don’t want to fail, but I just have no idea what my next steps should be.

1ix5aiu,Feel overextended and burned out in my current role.,"About 1.5 years ago after working in my department for 5 years; I was switched to a new position to help support different projects. Then I was promoted to a senior position. At first it was very engaging, challenging, and fun.

But now the schedule for each of our projects is getting shorter and very demanding. I have to manage a team of 5 contractors too. It just seems like there’s no respite. I’ve been struggling to grow and get better at managing all of the open items properly. But it seems like every time I try to make a plan or implement a new strategy it all comes apart. 

Either because I can’t meet the schedule, or I have infinite distractions with other areas that require my support, or just in general the quality of my work isn’t that great because I feel like I’m needing to focus on too many things. 

I don’t see myself growing any more in my current role, but I don’t want to quit because I still like the work and have very good job security. Should I consider trying to switch departments to find a role that allows me to be more focused on fewer things?

1ix54wu,Do I quit or persevere on ?,"As someone in about 10 years of working experience, I changed different company every 2 years for various reasons but mostly due to me feeling either there’s no good career progression, or my values not aligning with the management. Recently I joined this new company and from the first week I’ve already felt uneasy with the workplace. The teammates were lukewarm on my first day; my boss emailed me asking to draft my own welcome note (something about myself) so she can forward to the department, and I did not have proper orientation. My boss did not schedule one on one with me or check-in unless she needed something from me. She vaguely told me what she’s expected of me; so I’ve been trying to find things to review and improve on. I was also surprised to know I needed to do things that I has zero knowledge on. Day by day I noticed more things that I dislike about the system and culture. I found out that my team has 4 resignations within the last 1-2 years; and even more outside my own team. Perhaps that explains the lukewarm reception?

My boss snapped at me one day when I told her I felt there’s something amiss with the way we work, and told me I should understand why we do the way we do instead of jumping into the conclusion. Recently I was tasked to take up a delayed presentation deck and supposed to just get approval from the Board. As the predecessors had left even before I joined and the assurance was that everything has completed; my colleagues told me I’ll just need to just present and follow up. When I got questioned by the management I had to go back and find out more on my own for a deck that was supposed to be completed 2-3 months ago. My perhaps well-meaning team tried to help me to navigate through the complexity but I felt stressed at the same time over her harping on me on so many things that made me feel the tasks are way more difficult than they are. When I sought for my boss’ opinion; she gave me conflicting advice. I went to her in the morning asking the same thing; when my colleague told me to clarify further with my boss, she told me a different one (in front of my colleague), and commented to them that I went to her for something these trivial without first trying to solve things on my own. 

I’ve never been so stressful in my work before, and if so never been for these environment. I don’t know if this can be considered as toxic environment. I ended up snapping to my colleague, which I hate so much because I don’t think I ever behaved like that throughout my career. I tried to think positively; I try to think this could be my hard lesson to learn how to deal with difficult people at work. But I felt unsupported and directionless. Every start of a new day I “hype” myself to think positively, but by the end of the day I was googling for new job openings. 

In the past, I had good colleagues and understanding bosses, although I realised that I was probably shielded from these and that of my junior position. Now that I’m a “manager”, I felt that I somehow lack people management skills, and so I thought if I quit this job now, I’ll never develop the skills, let alone grow further in my career. However I’ve also never been this miserable so I wonder even if I stay on this path will I grow resilience or become resentful. 

I hope for some kind insights or advice from someone who walked this similar path. I’m barely two months to this job and I cried 4 times after work.

     Thing is I would really like to work in the afternoon and when I got hired they said I would, but, filling in for someone on morning shift turned into an apparent permanent position. I’ve asked twice and each time my boss said he’d think about it. It sounds cut and dry, but, recently my coworker (shift leader) said they’d be unavailable soon. So my boss told me he would have me replace them and actually be promoted. (Haven’t seen any evidence since then but it’s been about 2 weeks)

1ix4js0,"Need out of retail management. I love numbers, people and creative sectors.","As many others have posted on here, and I’ve read most of them, I need to get out of retail management. 
The thing is, I love the company I work for, I love the brand and the product. I feel like I’m paid OK. I bonus typically, so I expect that in my paychecks. Great benefits and PTO.  I just feel like I’m not learning anything that’s really giving me drive. I also don’t want to manage the personalities. I feel like retail brings some PERSONALITIES. I don’t want to be the bad guy. My store does great, I love meeting goals and crushing contests. I just don’t love the push back from some, I’m not going to dive into it…but if you know, you know. I also have a 1 year old, and I’ve cried endless nights about how I don’t get to see him due to retail hours. Anyways enough of the whys…

Here’s my problem, I have no idea what to look for/google. I’ve typed in so many buzzwords and keywords and feel just insanely overwhelmed. I don’t exactly want a sit down office job as I love to be able to move my body, or at least WFH or a space that’s a bit more shared.   

I also…and this may sound entitled (I don’t know)…want something a bit more creative or where I get to learn and/or teach consistently. I do love the training aspect, yet I feel like I never have time for it with the quick paced sink or swim nature of retail. 
I have a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts from a prestigious school, but what do you do with an art degree? 🙃 I love where product design and sales collide. I often look at some of visual sent from corporate and just giggle because…who did they hire?! Why wasn’t it me? Oh right because I didn’t apply because I didn’t know that was a real position to search for.
My dream job would be a creative director, now how do I get there? (Yes this is semi a joke but, I’m also 100% serious) 
OR
I want something so easy and redundant I can do it with my eyes closed (preferable WFH). I enjoy numbers and math, analyzing sales and data. And I’m quite good with math, I can write well, I’m analytical and descriptive. (Please don’t base your opinions on my reddit post) 

Honestly, I’m fairly smart, I’m confident I learn quick, I love problem solving and finding solutions. I’m great with customers and have a high emotional intelligence, though I don’t want to be 100% sales. I’d love to lead teams in the right direction, but alongside others who are also leading. 
And I’d love to be in a creative sector whether the company be creative or the actual role be creative. IF that’s a long shot, less stress, less time so I can be creative with my free time. 

Sorry I try and edit and just write more. 

TLDR:
Need to get out of retail management. 
Want my time back, dreaming of something creative or working with creatives.

1ix3w62,NGO job expects me to work without a contract. I'm not sure when to put my foot down?,"I'd really appreciate any advice. I'm in a bit of a weird situation that I will try to explain fully. I work as part of a very small team for an NGO. I know this kind of job can be predatory, expecting a lot 'for the good of the cause' - and I'm on an independent consultant contract though I basically work full time or more - but I trust the people I work with, they have my back, and they are relying on me.

The problem is that I am almost at the second month in a row of not being paid. I have a problem with not putting my foot down. Because there is so much going on at work - projects in progress, consultants that need to be paid - if I just stopped working there would be a lot of knock on effects. I want to keep working here but the admin set up is just unsustainable. They have the money to give me another contract but due to complex admin requirements it can't be set up until mid march - at least.

I have been advocating for myself to have a contract set up through another funding source (with less admin requirements). It still hasn't been set up. It bothers me that they are still going on as if everything is normal. I have made it clear to my boss that it's unsustainable for me to keep going on in this way.

I really need help with communicating confidently and effectively with my bosses. I'm not even sure what I want. Maybe to stop working immediately until they have another contract for me guaranteed? But that feels unreasonable due to all the responsibilities that I have that simply won't get done if I leave. But i am building up resentment and have been feeling burnt out in the role since last year.

Ultimately I want to reduce my hours here - and get a higher hourly rate. I want to be able to switch off. But I'm finding it hard to think all this through.

I hope I've given enough details. Any advice about what I should be asking for, and how to have that conversation would be really appreciated.

I have found while googling that there are certain possibilities which seem interesting to me, and maybe some of you can give me some insights and tips (or even were in the same position and transitioned from a developer job to something manufacturing related)

My goal is definitely not to go full CAD and get a drawer or CAD Engineer ... I think this is just a waste of skills I have learned in the field of comp. science and I think this isn't also valuable for any company in this case

The following positions pop up if I search for jobs in the manufacturing field which include some work with CAD, but I have actually no idea if they are even approachable for a computer science graduate and have a relation to IT and slight software development:

\- Systems Engineer for CAD (Pipelining work for cad Designers / Drawers, description varies by company)   
\- PLM/CM Engineers with a focus for slight development (automation ...)

\- CAD Simulation Engineer 

\- CAD Add-On Engineer (very rare in Europe?)

Does anybody know what would be the best for my interests and have any experiences in those fields and maybe even the same background as I have ?

Hey all, need some advice on a situation I am in. 25M in a cool area in FL, I work in the office in construction and do not make a whole lot of money at this point in my career. Recently I have been speaking with a recruiter who has a job that fits my current job description to a T, and is urgently looking for someone to fill it. The role itself pays over double what I am making right now (well over 6 figures), which I haven’t found any other roles close to this much money around the area. The problem is I would have to move to pretty much an impoverished area in Virginia for a few years. I am not the type who needs constant interaction with people, however, this area seems extremely quiet and lacks life. It looks like a very small ghost town. Would love to hear some suggestions, advice or whatever else. To give a bit more context, my family is spread out, parents out of state but sister and her fiance live in my city. Additionally, the place in VA is about 1.5 hours from any “large” city.

1ix2jvc,I don’t have a “voice” at work,"I work in Payroll & Benefits for a large Financial Management Company. One thing I like about Payroll is it’s generally a “back office” department where you get mostly left alone to do your work. This suits me as I’m a pretty introverted person by nature, and also don’t have much passion for the work I do - it pays the bills but I never thought of choosing it as a career, I just kind of fell into it. 

However at my currently company there is a very outspoken, collaborative culture that focuses on discussion and idea sharing to improve processes. We have a LOT of meetings/calls and generally I am quiet as I just don’t feel I have much value to contribute. 

At my last performance review, my manager said that the thing hindering me in my position is I don’t share my opinions on things or speak up much in meetings. This is 100% true. The thing is, I feel like the majority of these discussions are just wasting time. A lot of this so called “brainstorming” seems fake, people talk on how they care about improving processes or streamlining the workload but really it seems to me like they are just saying what management wants to hear, to justify their importance to the company, and I can’t bring myself to do that, it feels super awkward. 

I just want to complete the work assigned to me, log off and go home, not having to think about work until the next day. I don’t really seek out ways to improve/change things because honestly I’d rather just get through it the way I know how - I do understand that this probably means I’m not suited to a high level management position in the future. 

Is just doing the work ever enough? Do you have to be a “thought leader” or an innovator just to have a stable career now?

1ix23ek,At a crossroad: take the risk or postpone it?,"Hi all,

I (m27) am a working student from the Netherlands, currently facing a crossroad. I could really use your advice and insights.

I will try to keep it short: 

I am about to start my master thesis for a socio-technical degree related to energy systems and economics. 
Currently I work a 16h/wk corporate job, in which I already started a career but in a different industry and more related to my bachelors than my masters. At this job I get a decent salary, a very secure contract, and enjoy having been put in a special corporate talent program. Thus: a good outlook.
However, I am more interested to continue my career in the energy industry, and have been offered an internship at a good consultancy firm, where I could write my thesis.

I cannot do both, and there’s a bunch of pro’s and con’s to either option, as follows:
* pros of staying in my company: a steady paycheck now and after my studies. 
* cons: possibly losing the opportunity to break into energy consultancy, a lower paycheck on the long run, and harder to manage my time between my thesis and work. 
* pros of doing the internship: networking, getting the experience, and getting the chance to break into the industry.
* cons: probably a (much) lower paycheck now, having to pay about 5k€ back to my current employer as they paid for my studies, and taking the risk of “trading the devil I know”. 

To make things more complicated: I am getting married this summer. And if that was not enough, we are considering moving abroad next year as well…

I feel like the consultancy path is facing the direction I want to grow in, but at the cost of high risk in a very busy time of my life. 

I do not yet know what they will offer for an internship, but I can only imagine my current salary + 5k to pay my current employer will be a rather tough sell. For now I am considering to apply and have the conversation anyways, but I feel very conflicted.

1ix19sh,I can NOT speak English well and it's affecting my professional life,"I wanted to share with you something that really helped me with a challenge I faced for a long time, which is: Speaking English.

Like many of you, I'm not a native English speaker and I've mastered grammar, reading and writing, but when it came time to speaking, I'd freeze up. It was weird because I know the words, I know what I want to say, and I know exactly how to say it, but for some reason it refuses to come out of my mouth. I always felt like I'm losing opportunities -personally and professionally because I couldn't communicate as smoothly as I wanted. It was frustrating. Social interactions were not great at all; my thick accent always gets in the way. And business zoom meetings were literal disasters for me. We would be talking about a problem that I know exactly how to fix and the required steps to do so --but when it's time to pitch my thoughts, I tend to speak fast or very slow sometimes, then I mumble, and I get nervous ... I'm sure you can imagine the rest. But when it came time to texting or writing a business plan .. boy! oh boy! I was too freaking good. And only recently I've realized how big of a problem that really was, ***because people tend to perceive you based on how good you communicate and present your self***.

>""Your communication is your reputation, both personally and professionally"".  
\-Michael Hyatt

I think one of the biggest challenges was not practicing consistently. I started looking for ways to make it easier to practice on my own and getting feedback without constantly bothering the people around me. It wasn't just about pronouncing the words correctly, but also about getting comfortable with speaking confidently, without stumbling. **You'll be surprised at how much of a difference just a little practice can make in your confidence**.

So to solve that specific problem, I've developed a mobile application designed to help people practice speaking every single day and for as long as they like. Maybe I'm a little bit biased (because I did build the app) but honestly, just using it for two months did make a huge difference in my personal and professional lives and impacted the way I speak positively. And to be clear, you don't exactly need an app to improve your communication skills. All you need is practice, practice, and some more practice. The difference will not be obvious overnight, but over time you'd be surprised about the amount of opportunities good communication can unlock for you.

It's mind-blowing to me how valuable communication skills really are in today's world. They will help you express your ideas and be perceived as far more than what you really are; if you can articulate yourself very well, people will automatically think you're smart and trust worthy 😂 (yeah! people are super weird). And oddly enough, with good communication skills, you'll be able to build stronger relationships and connect more with your friends and family, even though, you haven't really changed, it's the same you as it has always been. But the only difference is that now you can communicate more clearly. And in the professional realm, it can open doors to career advancements, leadership roles, and new opportunities that weren't possible before, even though, your skillset hasn't really changed and the only difference is that you can speak more clearly now.

So I encourage you to focus more on developing your communication skills and master your own voice rather than spending your time on just grammar. I'm not saying to ditch it entirely, ***but after a certain point, learning more will not impact your life as much as speaking more***.

If you want to use my app, just let me know and I'll send you the link. If not, you can practice by speaking with ChatGPT or your friends. But the most important thing that I want to know is: practice everyday and eventually you'll get better.",First-Reference3924,0,0.17000000178813934,0,1740401424,2025-02-24 12:50:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ix19sh/i_can_not_speak_english_well_and_its_affecting_my/,2,2025
1ix0t7z,Career Crossroads: Seeking Advice on Whether to Stay or Go Back Home?,"Hi all,

I moved to Dubai from the UK about 18 months ago and i hold a Master's in Mechanical Engineering from a top university(2021). I started my career at an engineering consultancy in the UK but came to Dubai for an opportunity that didn't quite work out. I wanted to stay for selfish reasons and since then, I've job-hopped quite a bit due to companies shutting down or short-term contracts, and unfortunately, I haven't found stability.

My CV now looks like a mess of varying roles, which isn't great, and I'm at an odd stage in my career — no longer a recent graduate, but not quite at the mid-level stage either. It’s disheartening seeing my peers in senior/manager roles while I feel stuck. The job market here in the Middle East is saturated, and opportunities are scarce.

Currently, I’m in a role that doesn’t offer much learning or growth, and I understand that at my stage, experience and knowledge are what I should be chasing. I’m now considering returning to the UK and focusing on securing a role back in engineering consultancy.

My rent is due next month, and I have two options:

1) Go home for a reset and position myself for opportunities in the UK.

2) Stay in this current position (which isn’t great) to avoid a gap in my CV and at least i would have some income. I would continue to apply for jobs on the side.

I’ve reached out to recruiters, but I’m not getting any replies.

As i am approaching 26, I’d really appreciate any advice on what might be the best approach at this point in my career.

1ix0osh,Escape From Retail,"I’m in need of a fresh perspective as I have no idea where or how to start.  I want out of retail.  

I’m turning 30 this year.  I got my first job in retail when I was 17 years old and worked with that company until I was 19.  That particular company had rubbed me the wrong way in terms of the way they viewed their entry level team members.  I found an opportunity at a large home improvement retailer and heard great things about their advancement opportunities, so I jumped ship.  The opportunities were, indeed, fruitful and I moved up rather quickly.  I’ve been a General Manager for 5 years.  

I’m immensely grateful to this company for providing me the opportunities that I’ve been given over the last 10 years.  My salary is usually right around $100,000.  I work one weekend a month.  I work a rotating schedule of early morning shifts and late night shifts.  I get 20 vacation days annually.  I have medical and dental benefits, although those are modest, at best.  My job, on paper, is a dream.

Here’s the deal, though.  I’m done.  I’m burnt out and it’s impacting my everyday life outside of work.  I cannot stand working with the general public.  I cannot stand the Big Brother corporate intimidation routine. Retail is all I’ve ever known and all I can think about is how badly I want to escape from it.  I don’t have a college degree or any experience doing literally anything other than managing and developing people in retail.  I do have a passion for developing and training people — that is by far my favorite part about what I‘ve done in my career thus far. 

Has anyone here made a major career shift away from a lifetime of retail?  If so, how did you do it?

1ix04wj,Unpaid Intern Work.,"Hi guys, first post here so I hope this is okay. I found this job posting on LinkedIn (linked at the bottom of the post) and decided to sign up for it as I thought any experience is good. Having been onboarded and introduced a little to the workflow, it seems like I am going to be doing a lot of manual data scraping and entry of different websites (AI data collection). I wouldn't mind this but the fact that it is unpaid makes me slightly uneasy, despite being assured that I would 'move on to the model development phase before the end of 3 months'. However some of the employees listed on LinkedIn have seemingly reached a level where they are using and developing transferrable skills so I am kind of torn between just getting on with some boring unpaid work with the hope of getting some good experience soon or just politely telling them that I value my time too much to do data entry for 15hrs a week...

What do people think of this?

Disney job question

Hey everyone, I’m hoping someone can give me some insight on my current situation.

I currently work the Marriott company, I’ve been with them for about eight months now. I’ve always wanted to work for Disney and have managed to get placed on the bench for a couple of roles: call center, and club level buffet. 

My question is, is it a smart move to get into the Disney company now and work my way up, or keep working at Marriott to build experience? My chances of landing a managerial job with Marriott are higher, plus I could cross-train with HR in a few months. 

I do really want to work at the Disney company, but don’t want to get stuck in an entry level position that I am overqualified for. How are the opportunities for advancement? I already have education and experience that I’m hoping would set me apart from other employees. I’m anxious to work at Disney but am scared that I will regret my decision. Any advice is appreciated.

1iwzolq,Need motivation from people who started over after their late 30s - Looking for a career transition,"I started my career in e-commerce but ended up specialising in post-sales onboarding & implementation for e-commerce marketplaces. When it worked, it was amazing! But the problem is there are only a handful of marketplaces. Onboarding is now all merged into customer success that involves account management and retention etc etc., so I don't get selected for those jobs either. Everytime I tried looking for a job, I had to wait years to find a similar role. 

Even though I have highlighted transferable skills, Australia is a very hidden job market and people tend to be boxed into their current role.

I'm in my late 30s and looking to transition into careers that are generalised and have a demand so I'm never out of job for too long as long as I'm doing my bit  - I tried sales and I don't feel cut out for it. I feel marketing is too saturated already and I prefer the non creative, structured side like SEO or programmatic maybe. I thought I'll start in project management at and entry level as I managed a lot of enterprise implementations and integrations but they need a IT degree and experience.

I'm seriously considering HR as I have a Masters from a long time ago ha ha and I like things that are structured, have a process for the most part and truly value equality at workplace, and coaching managers to treat teams better by informing them about policies and laws that protect employees rights. I'm also trained in mindfulness and wellbeing and love creating safe workplaces for people. 

I don't know what to do and which way to go :( I'm agonizing over my long term career decision and it's affecting me to be so indecisive. The age pressure doesn't help either.

I’m currently working an admin job in healthcare, I don’t really like admin, it’s not hard but it kills my brain and I don’t like doing all the chasing up and booking etc. I have a bachelors in medical science, but there was no majors in my degree. My past experience includes working in admin and pathology (support staff role).

Anytime I look for new jobs I just don’t know what to apply for, the pay for so many of these jobs is low and not sustainable. I have looked into switching careers and maybe trying out data analyst or cyber security, project management or one of those other career swaps you see on social media but it seems like you need some background in those industries to get your foot in the door. 

Not only are the courses expensive, there’s no guarantee that you’ll get a job after completing them, you’d really need to know how to sell yourself, which I kind of suck at. 

My other option is to do a masters in healthcare but again, don’t know what do it in. I attempted post grad medical imaging but didn’t finish it due to some personal reasons. Idk if I have the capacity to do a post grad atm. 

All I know is I just cannot keep working the same low paying jobs for the rest of my life. I really want to up-skill and learn a skill that will make me employable, and get WFH jobs (heavyyyy on the WFH cause transport is a waste of money) that will pay more with the potential move up in the role. 

I understand it takes time to level up, but I honestly don’t see any progress from where I am right now, and I would really like a clear path for moving forward and getting better roles.

Right now my goal is to learn in a good environment, understand what I like and gain experience in development!

I am very undecided, because in one hand I believe the consultant will be a good experience where I will be able to learn a lot of different things, on the other hand, I want to go to the product company because it is not a consultant and I really enjoyed all the people I had interviews with, however it is remote : ( Since it is my first job, I believe being remote is a big inconvenience because I will not be able to develop “social” skills and get to know people (networking).

What do you guys think? I am afraid that by going to the consultant, I will be ""underestimated"" because almost everyone with basic knowledge of CS can easily enter a consultant, and I am also afraid I am throwing in the trash a great opportunity of starting in a Product Company.

Which option will open me more doors? Is the 1st job very important for the path of our career? Which one is better to have on the CV as a Graduate/Junior: consultant or product company? I'm an extreme overthinker, so that is why I am having this dilemma.

I have pushed to this side to focus on providing for my young family and completing this certificate 4 wich could see me earning 40k more a year, albeit with significantly more responsibilities and more hours away from my family which breaks my heart but it’s all for them. 

My dilemma comes as I am soon to lease a house with a large workshop and an opportunity to focus on this furniture dream. I know it won’t happen overnight I am prepared to dedicate every spare hour to it. Has anyone else here transitioned into a creative industry? Do I follow the natural progression of my career and hate my life providing for my family or do I say fuck turn and pivot into a creative niche take that risk and hopefully be available to provide more for my family. 

Also give me your creative industry start up story’s wins or losses please and thank you xo. ",Ok-Investigator9565,1,1.0,0,1740381730,2025-02-24 07:22:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iwwenu/follow_a_dream_or_natural_career_progression/,2,2025
1iww8m7,not sure if I want to do med,"I want to be a doctor. And it’s the idea of being a doctor that excites me—the thought of being the person people refer to when they say, *“Let’s go to the doctor to check everything,”* because they trust that the doctor will fix them. It’s hard to explain, but that’s what drives me.

The thing is, I’m not sure if I 100% **love** biology. I’m currently taking bio in school, and honestly, I zone out so much in class. Maybe it’s the teacher—but I don’t want to blame her because, ultimately, **you** should have an interest in science yourself. It’s not that I don’t enjoy it—I love researching diseases and medical topics for hours; it’s fascinating to learn about them. But in class, I just don’t feel that same excitement.

And the thing is, I know when I **love** a subject. I **love** math. I love it so, so much. And honestly, it’s because of the teachers. I’ve been so lucky with the math teachers I’ve had—they’re my favorite teachers ever. And it’s not just because I do well; it’s because they actually teach, and it’s never boring. It’s *so* fun to be in a class with people who are just as passionate and smart, who love math like I do. It’s so fun to teach others math, to learn, to problem-solve. Maybe next year I’ll feel differently, but right now, I just love it (except when we take tests—those I hate).

I’m currently in the highest math course my school offers, and the only reason I’m continuing is because I **genuinely love it**. I also *really, really, really* want to meet the next-level math teacher—people say she’s amazing. I know math isn’t relevant to medicine, but I love it so much that I just want to keep going.

And that’s what’s making me question things. I don’t love science like I love math.

So I need advice—should I continue on this path to becoming a doctor, or should I explore other fields?",Pristine_Act_1747,1,1.0,1,1740381058,2025-02-24 07:10:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iww8m7/not_sure_if_i_want_to_do_med/,2,2025

For background I'm a young single male in my 20s. My work schedule depends some weeks I'm working normal 5 days a week, and sometimes 3-4 days a week. 

The longer commute option is in a much more lively area, closer to things I would want to do in my freetime, and overall a more enjoyable area for me. 

The shorter commute is a nice area, but just very quiet and not much to do in my freetime. I would find myself spending alot of my freetime, at least on the weekends, in the first area. 

They both cost about the same, however the cost of gas will be more or course. I just am having trouble deciding which to sacrifice/take.

Amazon delivery is actually a pretty enjoyable job for me, but there's not a lot of room for advancement.

I inherited some money that would help pay for school, but I don't have any strong feelings about what field to pursue. Something in tech that would let me take a job anywhere and work from home would be great, but I'd also be happy with a trade that I can do with my hands. I just know I wouldn't do well in a job that relies mainly on social skills, like sales.

1iwtwej,Choosing between stability and passion,"Hi all,

I (27M) am facing some big career decisions and could use some advice.

I recently earned a Master's degree in creative writing and love writing in general. My original goal was to find a job related to my degree, and I've seen some openings in publishing as a copyeditor. I think I’d enjoy that work, but I worry that spending all day on other people’s books might make it harder for me to focus on writing my own in my free time. Plus it's a very competitive job market.

At the same time, I currently have a job where I ride in a semi and help unload trailers three days a week. My company might have an opening where if I sign a two-year contract, they would pay for my CDL so I would start driving the truck. The downside is that the shifts are long (overnights, typically 14 hours), but the pay would provide a lot of financial stability.

I’m torn between pursuing something more aligned with my degree or taking the CDL route for the stability it offers. Does anyone have experience balancing a creative career with a job that offers better financial security?

The good news is I still have time to decide.",Chemical_Wonder_3726,1,1.0,1,1740372153,2025-02-24 04:42:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iwtwej/choosing_between_stability_and_passion/,2,2025

Need a guidance on this. To put it nicely I am currently working in a company where it's not feasible to my career advancement needs. Which now led me to more of stress and demotivated and also burnout from it. 2 Months in, I am still confused what I have to do basically. Which never would have happened before in my career life. I got in this company because my previous company has a bad management (not toxic but more like not so structured which led to frustration).

But basically I have decided to quit my current job (regardless I will) and find a new place where I know I could ace more which right now I haven't lodged the notice yet. But issue here is I have one potential job on the line that is still under assessment process which next would be another stage for 'cultural fit' if I pass the assessment. I would say I am very confident that I'll pass the assessment however. I also have another job interview tonight where I wouldn't know if I ever gets it but it suits my needs in my career.

Long story short, I just feel like I want to quit my current job right now at this moment even with uncertainty of my upcoming career/job offer.

I wish I got to take a gap year to truly discover my path, but that would have affected my scholarships (which I need lol) so I was unable to do that. I never truly had a passion for one particular career/field, I've had numerous phases where I wanted to be different things, so settling down for one seems a little scary to me, because I am afraid of wasting time and money for something I will regret, that I neither like nor have any interest in.

1iwsa4g,[20F] Marketing Career: Where to go next?,"Marketing: Not sure what direction to go?

Hello everyone! I’m posting after lurking for a bit, just looking for a bit of career advice or thoughts on what’s next.

I am 20F and up until a couple months ago, been working full time in a Social media marketing role for a small company, for just over a year. 

I worked in office, and travelled to work every day, worked primarily on Facebook and LinkedIn, TikTok and more. I was the only person in the ‘marketing department’ (the company was tiny and didn’t really have one) so I undertook everything graphically. 

I designed signs, promotional car wraps, promotional posts, leaflets, etc etc. 

I fell into the job because someone I knew already worked there, and being the youngest employee, fell into the social media role. I have no actual qualifications, but did go to college for graphic design. 

Anyway, I left this company a couple months ago- it was out of my control on their part.

So, what now? I’ve been wondering if I should get into University (in in the UK) for Social Media Marketing, and get qualified officially. 

Or, should I just look for a job in the same industry with my year of knowledge? 

I feel capable and not capable at the same time. The job was good for developing and learning about the role, but I never got feedback from my peers or other staff. I’m left a little confused about my next steps. 

Any advice? I’ll happily answer questions, but I don’t feel comfortable to disclose the name of the company.

1iwqeld,Should I take the offer to be a contractor at Google?,"I'm not too experienced in that, so I would be glad to hear your thoughts.

I have an FTE IT position right now. It's easy to keep, not too hard, but unfortunately it's completely out of the field that I want to work in. I want Android; this is front-end. Additionally, there aren't many ways to practice English at work because a lot of my coworkers are from my native country. I don't have a mentor and nobody cares about the quality of my code.

Because of that, I started practicing my Android skills to change jobs. As a result, my first offer is a request to be a Google contractor through a vendor—a position called ""Android Developer,"" but the Google engineer who interviewed me told me that it's not the same ""Android."" It's more about coding something from time to time, manual testing, and something else. (I do not clearly remember actually, because I've never believed at the interview point that I could get the role.)

But then the issues appeared: the vendor chain is (vendor1 <- vendor2 <- Google). I thought it would be just one vendor between me and Google.

The first vendor, who initially hired me, provided the terrible offer with ridiculous points in the contract. Then vendor2 contacted me and asked about talking to another vendor. We already agreed with the second vendor on the same benefits package as I have right now in my FTE and about a couple of dollars more wage than I have right now (their ""max,"" by their words).

I asked vendor2 about increasing my rate (just a try) and I'm expecting the answer tomorrow.

I've never had experience with a contract role before; I'm worried about taking the contract and being fired after a couple of months. But the ""Google"" thing left me with doubts. I've been told about an option to take PTO for a couple of weeks and take the contract for that time, and make a decision after.

I have nobody here to advise me, so I'd be glad for anything.

I have some exams (5-6) which I have to re-do, but will probably re-do them just fine, in the next possible period. The thing is, I don’t do anything beside doing the university right now. I feel like I’m wasting my days, without learning anything. I have this feel that I only study for the exam session and then after finishing with that specific exam and it’s topics, I just forget everything, remembering only a few small details about each of the topic, or maybe even completely everything. I know I could try to learn some programming, which I already do in the university but I feel like I kinda suck at it, and the competition in programming around the world right + the AI, I feel like there’s no point in me even trying…I was thinking to try to find anything that could help me in my sphere, in the engineering, but I couldn’t find anything online, like the programming courses that you may find, because that’s what I was kinda searching for. I feel that I am not organised, with what I am doing, and that applies to basically everything…university, life style etc, and I notice this affecting me, my parents, my family. I sometimes compare myself to someone who didn’t go to university, who went straight up to work, built their CV history, doing way more stuff and being overall more successful then me, because I don’t have my shit together.

1iwoixa,Should I leave my job now or wait a year,"I'm currently working in a role in an industry completely different to what I am studying. I have been working full-time for the past 3 years as one of the key team members in a small business.

I work full-time whilst managing part-time university studies on the side in a completely different field and industry, and have one year left on my degree. Recently, I've been having thoughts about getting into that industry sooner rather than waiting to finish my degree as I initially thought I would. There's a few factors at work that are driving me to consider moving sooner, the main one being having more experience in the field before I graduate.

It would be a salary pay cut to move fields into a lower role but I already knew this'd be the case. The trade-off being a lower salary now with the potential for more salary growth in the future, whereas I feel like I've hit my ceiling here.

Any insights or advice into a similar situation would be much appreciated.

A guy in my team just got promoted from graduate to engineer, he's got about 2.5 years industry experience. He told me what his pay was and how much it's gone up, (he got close to a 20% increase). The grads here get paid well so a 20% increase is much bigger than I'd have expected but apparently that is standard.

What I found interesting was that now I'm only earning about 10% more than him. I have 7.5 years more experience (4 times his experience) but only make 10% more. My pay is within a reasonable range for what I'd expect with my experience, but definitely on the lower end. However, all my colleagues always talk about how the pay here is well above average. I'm always hearing how well I'm doing and unlike my colleagues, I don't seem to receive any negative feedback from my bosses. My concern isn't how much I'm paid exactly, but more at the value the company puts on me. Does this sound like something I should be concerned about?

1iwn1w1,Working after midnight for free?,"I work in the accounting field at a company that is partially owned by an Asian company.  
Due to the time zone difference, during the end of the month (when closing the accounting books), we are expected to work late hours to accommodate the Asian company's timeline. By late hours, I mean sometimes past midnight—not to mention working weekends in certain months.

All of this is uncompensated since we, as accountants, are salaried employees.

Recently, the Asian company decided that not only do we have to work late during closing, but we also must be physically in the office until everything is done—no more working from home during late hours.

I'm a 23 year old from the UK that's made many stupid mistakes in my life but is ready to make the correct move. Due to my horrendous indecisiveness, I'm struggling to find a career that will be meaningful for me yet also not a waste of time and actually give me genuine skills I can use anywhere. 

My interests lies in Cars (by far my highest passion and most knowledgable area), I enjoy long nature walk, exploring, exercise. Massively into my electronic music and am currently learning how to create music. I enjoy photography, have an interest in videography and general digital creative endeavours. Big into my fashion also.

  
Now regarding work experience. I've worked on building sites (never again). Worked in admin roles (okay but not exciting enough), Ive also worked in marketing as an intern which I actually really enjoyed. I like the idea of getting into videography, photography, graphic design and becoming a general digital design creative. I'm also interested in becoming a UX/UI designer. Maybe try and get into a marketing role? Due to the job marketing, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find employers to take someone on without experience so if I'm going to find a carer path for me, my all will be going into it. So I want to make it count. I have thought about going to uni to study as It will provide me with a higher likelihood of landing as most jobs I want require a degree and/or years work experience plus a heavy portfolio. 

  
My dream one day is to have my own business that will in some way help or provide value to people.

  
I need an outsiders perspective on this as my adhd riddled brain wont allow me to pick one avenue, then I end up doing nothing.

1iwm57s,Should I leave my intermittent fed job before I get mass fired (US)?,"For about 3 years now I’ve had an episodic, intermittent position with the US National Disaster Medical System where I go to help if there’s a disaster with massive loss of life in the US where the local agencies don’t have the capacity to handle the number of deaths (this is a throwaway account). 

I mostly took this position to help, it really only pays enough to make sure you get something from workers comp if your injured on deployment, and it only pays while you’re actively deployed or doing training (so no benefits or federal retirement or anything, I think I made like $182 from this job in 2024). This job is also a bit of a resume booster for my field, and I was hoping to use it to help get a more specific title that could help me with future opportunities. 

Now that federal workers are getting axed somewhat indiscriminately, idk if I should resign before they have the chance to fire me. I’ve only worked in public service type jobs and they always ask if you’ve been fired before. I’m sure they’d understand the circumstances but what if they just screen out anybody who’s ever been fired automatically? 

This job isn’t my main income at all so it wouldn’t be a big deal financially to resign, but it’s necessary and something I believe in. I still want to be able to use my skills to help people after disasters. This admin has already halted the hiring process for new people in my position that they managed to get approved in the fall, and I can only imagine that they dgaf about staffing up for disasters what with the current president saying fema stuff should be states responsibility (we’re not a part of fema, but it’s the same principal. The whole point of a national system is to have people not currently experiencing a disaster come help, since it’s kinda hard to deal with things when you’re usual resources are underwater or burned or whatever, but that’s besides the point)

I want to hold the line and stay since I don’t think my position would be filled if I left, but I also don’t want it to be a black mark on my employment history. I’d appreciate any advice.

1iwltkl,"Should I take the loss and move on, or have the competition audited?","Should I take the loss and move on? Or audit the competition?

Hoping for some opinions:

I work for a large organization that primarily does its hiring via a competition process based on a strict merit criteria. There was a job I was essentially doing, and when the competition was posted, I and three other people who know how to do the job were screened out of the interview (as in not even allowed to interview) by what I believe to be a unfair process, the person hired is the hiring managers friend, and is terrible at the job, even months later.  

The next option I have is to have the competition audited, if the audit uncovers an unfair process then there is a chance the competition will have to be redone. I’m fairly confident that I will “win” the audit, but I’m a people pleaser so this is hard for me.

1: would I look like a complainer? Should I just take the loss and move on? Life isn’t fair, etc.

2: I have built a good reputation within the organization and something better may come
along anyways, I just really would have loved this job and would have been good at it, it’s what I was working for, and the person hired (although bad at the job) will likely be there until they retire in 10+ years. 

3: I feel bad for the person hired, they will be caught in the middle of my “battle” so to speak and is a nice person, but really is bad at the job, and imo didn’t earn it anyways.

4: there is always a chance that the auditor could side with the hiring manager and then I would feel stupid. 

5: I still work for the organization but took a lateral roll in another department because I was essentially still doing the job, I just needed to get away because I felt terrible about doing a job I was screened out of. I do miss my old department (and co workers) a lot. It helps a marginalized population and I don’t feel the same sense of purpose in my new department.

1iwlr09,Time to let it go,"Bear with me, this is long. I just want to let it out.

I’ve been an SFA for 3.5 years at my F500 company, the only one working remotely from Calgary while the rest of the team (me, an associate manager, our manager, and three contractors) is in Toronto. It’s been a revolving door—constant turnover. We’re part of a bigger commercial finance team under the finance director.

When I first joined, the associate manager had been there for just two months before getting promoted. They replaced him with an internal hire, but after three months, she went on a six-month leave to care for her sick father. She never came back, so they hired an external replacement. Two months later, our first manager got promoted. The new manager was an internal hire. Around the same time, the externally hired associate manager resigned for a manager role elsewhere. That position stayed vacant for four months until they hired another external candidate.

Then, two months later, our second manager went on a one-year leave to take care of her sick husband and never returned. They immediately appointed an internal hire as the new finance manager—my third manager in 2.5 years. Luckily, he was the best one I’d had. Down-to-earth, no ego, and we bonded over figuring things out together.

Since my first manager left, I had become the team’s backbone—answering all the questions, being the go-to for process knowledge and stakeholders. Toward the end of my third year, the finance director kept pushing me to apply for internal roles, speaking highly of me. I went for two U.S. BU roles but didn’t get them, even though I felt qualified.

Then, November 2024 hit, and things took a turn. My manager went on an unexpected three-month leave. While he was gone, I led the November close, year-end close, and took over 80% of his responsibilities during planning, while the associate manager covered maybe 20%. Then, I got a meeting invite from the finance director. I assumed it was a check-in since my manager was away. Nope—I was being let go. Org restructuring, position eliminated.

With my manager on leave, I had no one to talk to. I was supposed to leave at the end of February, but since he wasn’t returning until early February, they asked me to stay another month to keep filling in for him. Meanwhile, leadership, including the CFO, kept saying they were “trying to find something” for me, but nothing happened.

When my manager finally came back, we had a real talk. Turns out, he had no say in this—he was in the hospital taking care of his mom when they informed him. He also told me he had given me an “Exceeds Expectations” year-end rating, but while he was on leave, the director downgraded it to “Achieved Expectations.” He was completely out of the loop.

Then, last week, my manager resigned—his mom’s condition worsened, and he needed to be with her. After his resignation was announced, I got a meeting invite titled “Next Career Steps” with him, the old director, and the new director. My manager and I both thought this was it—they’d ask me to stay since I was the only one holding the team together.

Nope. Instead, they told me they’re still “trying their best” to find something and that I should start transitioning my work. My manager and I were both stunned. Meanwhile, they have two open associate manager roles and an SFA role, all being hired externally. The disrespect is unreal.

I have a strong hunch the new director had the most say in pushing me out—we’ve never worked together, but he and the associate manager are close. At the same time, I feel like the old director—who I worked with for 3.5 years—didn’t fight for me. Maybe he never really saw my value, despite always speaking highly of me.

I’m so done. Three weeks left, and I’m taking the last two as leave. I will never look back.",Working_Strength2816,2,1.0,1,1740347859,2025-02-23 21:57:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iwlr09/time_to_let_it_go/,2,2025

1iwkemd,Disclosing Severance Policies,"As more and more companies normalize mass layoffs, it seems like getting laid off is more of a “when” not an “if.” That being said, I am wondering if anyone’s ever asked a recruiter or hiring manager what their company’s severance policy is before signing an offer. 

We disclose salary and benefits, but we never talk about severance. Why? I’d like to know what I’m dealing with if the company lays me off.

I know it might come off as pessimistic and something you don’t want to think about when starting a new job, but it would give me peace of mind knowing if they make stupid decisions leading to my role being eliminated, I’ll have a little money coming in. 

I probably wouldn’t do this but I’m wondering if anyone else has?

1iwk8er,I just want to come home,"I moved across the US to get a new grad job (took about a year after graduating) and I hate it. I am so lonely here. There’s nobody to talk to. I’m the only one even remotely close to my age (early 20s), and everybody else easily is 2-3x that (50s and 60s). To make matters worse, it’s very toxic. I get yelled at a lot and can’t do anything about it since they are sort of in these positions of power (more experience in the field than I’ve been alive). I’m very scared of messing up.

I have been trying my best to find friends here but to no avail. I hate it here. It’s the middle of nowhere. I’m in a very specialized field, so it’s gonna take so much to transition to another one, especially in today’s job market. I’m doing my best to teach myself some things, but my depression is stopping me.

1iwj4da,References? What to do when previous supervisors/higher ups are MIA,"I left my last work place after almost 8 years with increasing responsibility and title changes. While I had a lot of opportunity at my workplace, I ended up becoming a sort of jack of all trades which led to serious burnout and then I plateaued on available opportunities to move up (there just weren’t any, roles were full). I was saved from a large reduction in force/restructure in my department due to “organizational and content knowledge” and a role was created for me. However I still ended up helping to onboard and guide people moving into similar versions of two of my old roles for about a year and a half before I had a last straw moment and politely tendered my resignation via email. I offered 2 weeks, they asked if I could wrap it up in a week and I left with 144 hours of PTO. If that explains kind of how things had been going. 

Anyway. Left, took a breather for a while and moved into a role that set me back on my hopeful career trajectory. Unfortunately, due to some financial stability (and current government admin) concerns, I have concerns about my longevity here for more than a year or two (just hit month 8). 

I’m planning to and would like to stay but have had a few “can’t miss” opportunities to interview and will likely be keeping an eye out to leave depending on what happens with government funding as it greatly impacts my field. 

My main concerns are my 8 month gap between jobs and short time here (both smaller?) and the fact that it may be very difficult to get references from my two former supervisors or department head. All three left the org either two years before I did or within 6 months of me leaving. Two promised references when I left including the department head, who was the person who directly saved my job when my team was eliminated, and someone who was my supervisor for about two years when I first started.

Of the three, one moved to Florida and I have not been able to stay in touch with her, one just left for what I’m gathering were personal reasons (she didn’t move to another org, she was a VP and my department head), and the third scheduled coffee with me, had to reschedule, then followed up close to the day of and effectively never rescheduled with me. I’m aware she had a family loss, but even now a couple months later she never responded.

How bad is this? I feel like a lot of people are leaving and I’ve tried to maintain relationships, but right now the best I could do for interviews are my old direct report, someone who dotted line managed me, someone I dotted line managed on some projects, a former client I am still friends with, and MAYBE a director and manager from another department who were both let go in the restructure. All of these people are now 1-3 years removed from being at my last job. I’m starting a volunteer job next week as well, but this is really my network for references right now.

Is this common? I’ve noticed some workplaces asking for people who have managed you so I squeaked by at my current job with my former client and dotted line manager.

1iwis00,Leave job because of false promises?,"In August of 2024 I applied for a new job. It was a new step in my career and it meant going back to school for 2 years. It was a new company about to open later that year, and since the 2 year study would start in March this year, we agreed I would start in January in a lower position until it would start. So, from August they knew someone would start with the new position and study in March.

Fast forward to last week. I came to sign some last needed papers. We talked, I was véry excited and they were positive. No signs of any issues.

Well... Two days later, and just one week before I would start, they told me they aren't ready to train someone for that position yet. They came up with a bunch of things to sugarcoat it and finished off with a ""well yeah, sorry. We can see how things are later this year"". 

I am livid, and very sad. I was so ready for this next step, and I was looking forward to it for months. It seems they think very lightly of it and expect me to be fine with staying in this current position I didn't apply for and to just wait until they are ready. Also I feel kinda gaslit, as if I'm crazy for being so upset about this, since it seems to be a non issue to them. 

This is not what I signed for. This is not what they signed for. If I wanted this (what was supposed to be temporary) position, that's what I would've applied for. The whole story and especially the way this is handled just doesn't make sense to me. I have heard there's someone who applied for the same position, and already has the right qualifications, but they didn't say much more about it and neither did I because I was convinced i'd start next week. I have no proof for this feeling I have and maybe it's my emotions speaking. 

They let ME call the university to ""see what I can do"", while they were the ones supposed to pay for the training. They keep it all very vague about ""later this year"" and I felt that if I would tell this university to cancel, they would throw this 9k bill on my plate. Luckily those people were very understanding and they cancelled it for free. It's a huge relief because now I don't have this 9k problem too and I am free to do what I want from here.

And what I want? I want to fcking quit. I don't want to work with these people anymore and no, I do not want to wait until ""later this year"". Yes, maybe they had the intention and just made a mistake, and maybe by then they are ready and I'll be missing out, but I can already feel it's not going to happen by the way they talk about it and then I'm waisting time I could use for finding another place for this position or another job. Or just get a freaking plane and travel for some weeks instead of staying and be miserable. I just don't want to keep working in this position. I was already done with that plus it's very convenient for them to have someone in this position while that wasn't what we agreed on. I refuse to let them use me and them to string me along until ""they are ready"". 

I can afford it to quit and to start from there. That's not an issue, and I am aware it's a privilege. But at the same time I'm a bit scared of their reaction, but I feel like they screwed me. 

I don't know. I just needed to get this off my chest.

1iwdxx3,"I’m 23, Stuck at a Crossroads, and Feel Like I’m Running Out of Time—What Would You Do in My Shoes?","Since I was a kid, music has been my everything. I can’t explain why, but it’s always felt like a calling—like something I was meant to do. And yet… I’ve never fully gone for it. Every day, I ask myself why. Do I not want it enough? Am I just scared? Have life and mental blocks held me back?

Now I’m 23, and I feel like I’ve already missed my shot. I keep thinking, if I was really meant to do this, shouldn’t I have “made it” by now? That thought haunts me.

After high school, I studied nursing but dropped out in my second year. Then I studied marketing & communication and actually finished it. After that, I took three gap years—this is my last one. During that time, I tried teaching myself singing and dancing, failing more times than I can count. I didn’t get as far as I wanted, and now I feel completely lost.

Here’s my problem: the deadlines for enrolling in school are coming up, and I have NO idea what to do. The pressure is eating me alive. I know I can’t sit at home for another year feeling like I’m wasting my life, but I also don’t know what my next step should be.

Right now, I’m considering two options:

1. Enrolling in a study program—something I like but isn’t too time-consuming, so I can still train properly, take singing/dancing lessons, and maybe attend bootcamps abroad.

2.  Going all in on music—fully dedicating myself, taking classes, training nonstop, and not playing it safe.

I overthink this every night, and it’s making it hard to sleep. I’m scared of making the wrong choice. I don’t want to regret playing it safe, but I also don’t want to end up broke and lost.

If you were in my position, what would you do? If anyone has been through something similar, I’d love to hear your advice. I genuinely feel like I’m at a life-or-death decision point, and I don’t know what to do.

I started a new job 3 weeks ago and all I’ve wanted to since is cry at frustration. 

I am the only member of my team as it’s a startup company. 

The management is really really tough on me. 

But the salary I received is huge. I’m meaning I’m earning double my previous salary for the same role. 

But the pressure of being the only member of this team is hard. 

So I say again… how long should I tough it out before saying sorry bro, this ain’t for me.

1iwd0ke,Should I quit?,"So, I currently am working as a software development related role at a big company that hires people without prior knowledge and trains them for the role. It's a well respected company in my area and a lot of companies do search to hire people who leave this company, as they have a good reputation.
How it works is that you basically commit to a few years of really low pay, 1 year of a more reasonable pay (but still low), and then you can decide if you want to stay or leave. The pay is still way lower then the avg. pay on the market (for my role, it's around 3 times less, meaning if I quit I could land a job that pays me 3 times my current pay.)

I was ok with this, and I have 6 months left from my original term to do. During the time I worked here, I got an offer from the company to fund my studies and started a 4 year engineering bachelor degree, and I'm currently at my 3rd year. The degree is fully funded by my company, and I promised to stay for another 2 years, which ends 1 year after I'm supposed to finish my degree.

But, as I discovered, due to bureaucracy reasons, no one in charge of my degree's funding can enforce prolonging my contract

I promised to stay and signed a document that says I would prolonge my stay, so personally leaving earlier would feel like I broke my promise, but looking back I realized the document I signed ment that the one making the decisions in the end are my direct managers, which are very nice and wouldn't mind letting me go earlier. There is also a possibility of not being able to prolonge it due to other fuctors out of my control, but I was told it's not supposed to be a problem.

So I have a decision to make - when should I leave my current employment place.
I can leave in half a year, having 2 semester left that I would have to cover for myself, I can leave in 1.5 years, right after my degree ends, or I can leave as planned 2.5 years from now.

For reference,  1 semester costs me around 3 of my current paychecks (including living costs). I do have savings that could probably last me the entire remaining degree, but I'll end up pennyless lol.

I know that finding a new place to work won't necessarily will be a walk in the park, but friends with similar backgrounds to me found jobs after 1-2 months, which seems relatively quick to me so I'm not really worried about resiging and not finding a new job.

The main reason that I want to leave earlier is the low pay... I want to be able to adopt a dog and save for a future house, which is not possible with my current pay.

Another factor is the fact that my degree is killing me lol. I work 4 days a week and take 4-5 courses per semester (around 15-20 weekly hours), which is... challenging. It's manageable but I don't really have time for anything besides work and study. It also means I have a limited time to invest in my studies so my grades are suffering (I managed to keep them around avg, but I don't think its enough for continuing to a masters degree, not that it's currently a priority of mine. I definitely could perform better if I put my whole focus on it, but I'm not sure I even have patience to do that. I'm kinda all over the place and the stress is a big motivator). 
If I resign before finishing my degree, I might delay starting to work again and finish my degree first.

On the other hand, I'm currently working with my boyfriend which is a huge help for synchronizing our time (we are not working directly together but under the same department,  we met in the degree program)
My work is not necessary difficult and it's comfortable staying there. I don't mind the people (some of them are real sweethearts) and the conditions aren't necessarily bad.

I also should mention that I'm relatively young and living with my lovely mom so it's a bit easier (she didn't kick me out yet >:) hehe)

1iwc99m,What do I do?,"I’ve been with the same company for about 5 years now. I love the job I do, it’s fast faced, keeps my mind empty and makes the day go fast. I get great benefits, have the union and get decent paychecks when the hours are there. There’s room to grow and rank up in the company which is exactly what I want in a job and why I wanna stay with this company. But this is where I come to a crossroads. 1.) Paychecks are more often than not screwed up. I’m talking about hours missing from paychecks often, not getting paid at all saying we didn’t even clock in for the day at all… for me it’s not the end of the world, I always get it resolved, but I shouldn’t have to keep going up to my manager in a billion dollar company to keep asking him to fix my paychecks because someone can’t do their job. 2.) The supervisors/management are sub or below level for their job requirements. Taking people off the street and throwing them in a management position, no idea how to run things, most employees who aren’t even managers could run the shift better than management half the time! They never communicate with each other nor the employees. For example we had to give our vacation bids by mid February…. Guess when I found out about that? THE FUCKING DAY THE VACATION BIDS WERE DUE and then THEY TOLD ME IT WAS MY FAULT FOR NOT KNOWING.. I have two weeks of vacation this year and since I didn’t know anything about it, thanks to management they decided to pick my vacation for me in the middle of April, what the hell am I gonna do in April still covered in snow where I am…. And last but not least, my coworkers/employees. Out of about 20 coworkers in my area, we maybe have 5 including myself that actually show up everyday ready to work. The other 15, come in late, no call no show, or show up and half ass the work making the good employees do 2x the work. The best part? They never get punished. So what does that say to all the hard working coworkers who bust their ass everyday, don’t get rewarded ever but still show up and try their best. So my question after all of this. 
    I love the work I do and want to do it till I retire but the environment is so mood/energy draining from coworkers to management.

1iw8qcb,Should I quit my job,"I work in retail, so the short answer is probably yes but let me explain. I work 4-12 hours a week, not a lot, and only earn around £400 a month due to being underpaid (I earn around £8.60 hourly) because of my age (19F). I have some mental health issues which have caused a sick day before, and currently, it’s becoming worse.

My manager does not like me, obviously she has to pretend to for certain eyes and for her to actually be respected as a manager, but she does not like me. She makes off-hand comments about my work, how good I am, what I wear, how I act. She’s caused me to burst into tears before after she shouted at me in-front of customers because I was sick at the time and needed to throw up, and according to her I should’ve ‘had a conversation with her’ beforehand. As if, y’know, I can hold back the puke.

Each day she is there, and not my other manager, I am anxious, I can’t work properly, and honestly I end up chain smoking before getting to work and biting my nails the entire shift.

It’s causing issues in my personal life because even 5 days before my shift, if that manager is there, i’ll already be anxious about it. I can feel myself becoming robotic and it’s just sad. My partner has said he can cover my rent, and whatever I already pay for but it will leave us tight and struggling a bit with less freedom, and I don’t want to feel guilty about that either.

Like I said, I work very short hours, so I feel pathetic saying I don’t want to be there and it’s stressing me out, I feel like I should just go through with it, but I can’t.

I'm 28, male and single, I quit my previous job as a sales and logistics agent with a great salary to work with someone in the kitchen, doors and windows industry, but it turns out to be a mess and the yearly salary is not as promising as before.

I'm considering two options now and would love your opinions on them:
*First one to go back to the previous job or a similar one, not sure whether I can get my position back but the odds are high, it pays well as I mentioned but it's a bit boring and there's much to help me improve in the long run, it's mainly the same tasks everyday.

*The second option is to sit with this new business owner and set my terms, I'll ask for a better offer and more tasks and basically take responsibility for the whole business to try and make it successful and build a better brand.

The reason why I'm not sure about is that I want to get married before turning 30, I've worked since I was in highschool but I never saved up and want to do that now, so I don't know if I should take the risk and stay in my current job or opt for a safer option.

1iw4vwt,I have no clarity in my life & career ?,"After graduating in 2024, I took some time to relax and traveled to another state to visit my paternal grandparents, where I stayed for four months. During that time, I attempted to apply for an internship, but the long working hours and distance made it impractical.

Around December, six months after my graduation, I started preparing for the AFCAT exam, as my father encouraged me to give it a try. During that period, I finally felt like I had a direction in life. However, yesterday, after taking the exam, I found myself feeling empty again.

Today, my father called and asked me what my next step would be. He advised me not to remain idle while waiting for the results but to start preparing for the UPSC exam instead. The moment I heard that, a wave of fear and anxiety washed over me—the pressure of not clearing it on the first attempt and the overwhelming reality that UPSC is one of the toughest exams in India.

In response, I mentioned that I had been considering preparing for CS (Company Secretary), though, in reality, I have little knowledge about the field apart from the advantage of being eligible for the CS Executive level due to my graduation with a 60%+ grade. The truth is, I feel lost about what to do in life. I keep moving forward, but I stumble along the way.

Despite my uncertainties, my father reassured me with one thing—he will support me in whichever career path I choose, as long as I don't look back with regret later and say I wished I had chosen differently.

1iw4km1,To MBA or not to MBA...,"So, I'm faced with a challenge at this moment. I've been working in my current role for about one year, and it's killing me. Mentally, physically, spiritually.

I'm looking to pursue an MBA solely to open up new job opportunities and find a higher paying, lower stress job, in an industry that I can stand. I know a LOT of people on here are from more prestigious backgrounds and are pursuing MBAs for much different reasons - so please disregard this post if you don't agree with my reasonings or if you are offended by my background.

Here's how I got into this situation:

This is my first full-time position out of college. It is an absolute horrid corporate job - not at all what I was expecting. The training/onboarding promised so much .. and turns out it is basically a call center with an onslaught of departmental, operations issues.. Seriously, my department is painfully mismanaged/disorganized. The level of unprofessionalism from my boss and some of my colleagues is appalling. I do not feel like I am able to apply my skills/talents whatsoever to this role. I prefer a slower paced, detail oriented, problem solving approach that this role discourages on all levels. I know I'm worth so much much more than this.

That given, my undergrad degree was pretty useless, BA Film & Television. I did community college (Associates in Communication) for 2 years then transferred to DePaul for film for my last 2. I loved it, but decided it wasn't for me career-wise. It was hard to find something out of college - so I took this role. Stark contrast from my background, but I just wanted to start my career.

I came from a serving job, so that's how I got this role. It's very customer-facing. Which I do NOT like. I am looking to get out of customer service ... hence why I took this role. It was promised to me that it would not be a call center, and we would be servicing professional clients. BOTH lies (of so so many).

Anyways, I just need some advice. This job has severely deteriorated my mental and physical health. It has honestly traumatized me, to the point where I fear that any job I get in the future might be this dysfunctional. I'd like to give specifics, but I'm trying to stay as anonymous as possible. I wake up for work and can feel stress pressure in my head and chest. I stay up very late at night, because I am dreading the next day so badly. I personally don't know if I can stick it out another year here.

I do think that, if I start applying, I could possible land a better role, but still relatively low-level, being that I only have 1 yr experience.

Thus, I've considered getting my MBA instead. I want out of this job and out of this industry. Only problem is, I would HAVE to quit this job. Mentally, I would not have the bandwith to work here and do school - given my circumstances.

I'm pretty worried that I might regret pursuing my MBA full-time and not working. I would 100% look for internships while attending school and part-time corporate work.. but, what if I don't find something?

I was considering DePaul's full-time MBA program, being that I'd get an automatic 25% tuition discount (and the full-time program is overall cheaper), but honestly have been seeing some pretty negative reviews on reddit... like you can't choose your professors?!

So, I could consider other MBA programs, but where to start? I don't have enough money to move out, so I'd have to find a fully online MBA program, or find something local (Chicagoland). I don't want to be in school for another 2 years, I'd rather do a 1yr program. I'd prefer online, but every iMBA program I research looks so sketchy. I don't have the undergrad background/professional program to get into a prestigious program.

DePaul seemed like a good program to met because they would likely accept my application being an alumni, and they seem to offer a great network for professionals in the city. But after reading a few threads about how horrid the full-time program is, now I'm considering other places. Don't even know where to begin with that.

I'm absolutely paralyzed at this point by all the ""what ifs"". I need advice, please. Chat GPT can only help so much right now, lol.

As a reminder, I'm looking for an MBA just to get a better corporate job and make a bit more money. I'm not a seasoned professional yet, I'm in my early 20s. Looking into operations/supply chain/consulting/account management roles.

I'm struggling to decide whether to look for a new job, stay in my role, or quit and pursue an MBA. I know I want to get an MBA regardless, and I'd rather do it sooner than later, honestly.

1iw35cf,In a tough spot,"Hey all,

Context: I’m a canadian. Wife is a teacher in ontario canada. 

Last july i took a job with a previous employer of mine down in the US as part of an expansion. It started in houston and then recently I’ve moved to Dallas (my wife is back home, i fly home every 4-5 weeks). During this time I was given 6K/month for housing+food via company credit card, making 75k cdn + commissions (half of salary). The commissions didn’t kick in until Jan and since then my responsibilities have changed and I’ll have no chance hitting any of them due to that (although what I’m doing is more important for the company now). They are being adjusted supposedly so hopefully they can be hit, but time will tell. 

My wife can take a year leave without pay from her school board, but the decision has to come before march 1st. I decided to let my boss know I need to be compensated higher, but my dumb ass didn’t have a number in mind and I’ve never been through this process (most of my jobs have been 60-70k and I’ve just crushed commissions to double it). They came back to me with a 90k base cdn. 

We are going to have our visa’s soon which see’s me change over to USD. I don’t think it’ll be 90k USD and I believe it’ll be probably in the range of 65-70k after conversion, but not 100% sure. 

We both feel like dropping to one income is tough. If the company can continue to cover our living and food then it’s probably manageable, though. What I’m wondering is what are the best things to negotiate after theyve given me a number? Guaranteed living+food? Commissions? More money (she told me that i am the highest paid sales guy at that number)? 

I can’t do another school year away from my wife and dogs - which you think would answer all of this, but my wife made a point that I’ll get a job back home and get sick of it like I often do, which makes me question doing that. 

Sorry for ramble/rant or confusion. Ask any questions needed. Thank you!

1ivys0p,Got a job!,"I was suddenly and unexpectedly laid off from my job on Jan 7th but luckily landed a new job after 6 weeks. After hearing how the job search can sometimes take months, I feel extremely fortunate that I landed a new role fairly quickly so I wanted to share some things that I believe really helped me. 
First, fortunately for me, I'm pretty active on LinkedIn. I try to post frequently regarding my industry and am always connecting and interacting with others. So after the shock and crying the first day I found out I lost my job, I woke up the next morning and immediately updated my Linkedin profile to show that I was ""Open to Work"". Almost right away I had colleagues reaching out to let me know of openings and asking me to apply. Remember the old saying of ""It's not what you know, it's WHO you know"". That is SO true. If you don't have a LinkedIn account, I suggest setting that up and be active daily. 
Of course, I also immediately updated my resume. ChatGPT was actually a great resource to help me tailor my resume to the specific roles I was applying for as well as my Cover Letters. That took a lot of pressure off and probably saved me hours while applying. 
No exaggeration, by the 2nd week and on I was having 2 to 4 interviews per week. I created a document for myself to fill out for each company's interviews including the name of the company, the interviewer's name, and title of position that I was interviewing for. Then below all of that I had about 20 questions that I asked them and would write down their answer below each question. That way I could reference and compare each company and keep them all straight. I also wanted to make sure that they were a good fit for me as well as me being a good fit for them. Some of my questions included: what does success in this role look like, what does training and onboarding look like, describe company culture, what challenges could I face, etc. 
Finally, I always followed up my interviews with a thank you email and let them know I was looking forward to hearing back regarding the next steps. It may be old school, but I believe it helped show them that I was interested and invested. 
Interviewing is a long and drawn out process and you can usually expect no less than 3 interviews before you will get an offer. I'd say I averaged 4 interviews per position. 
So, hang in there. I feel like if I can land a job in these crazy times, anyone can. I'm no one special, nor did I really do anything unique, it was just the luck of connecting to the right people through networking, staying organized, and consistent.
Good luck!

I have now had an offer from the other company for a technician role however, the salary is 25% higher. I originally chose the Engineer title as it was a step up from my previous role of 6+ years.   
My question is: Do I stick with the job title and live with the lower salary or do I take the opportunity to earn more now but with less future progression?  
To earn 25% more, it will take years of pay rises therefore, I see the other role as a quick way to boost my earnings. The higher salary, technician, role interests me more however, in the long term the Engineer role will be physically easier on my body.

1ivyfyq,Personal Trainer -> project management,"Hello everybody,
I graduated college with a bachelors in exercise science and a minor in business administration. I have been a personal trainer for seven years and have been an assistant manager of a corporate gym for the last year. 

I am planning on having kids soon. 

The fitness industry does not provide Great benefits, remote work, or a competitive salary (i really want that 6 figure income)

I work for a great company, and there is upwards mobility. (I could get ascended  to a manager soon, (60k) and in many years, if I prove my management skills I could be district manager (80k)) 
however this company is very small and growth doesn’t happen quickly. 
Also, the salary is great, but not as competitive as it could be in bigger fitness centers. 

Right now I am making about 55K: that is combining my salary, all of my personal training, and the online training that I do on the side (for the past year, I have been growing my social media and gathering clients this way.)

I have a type A personality. I am very good with deadlines, with numbers, with presentations and other useful skills that I see are needed in the project management field. 

What advice would you guys have for me? 
How long can I expect the career change to take? 
I have seen some people say that you definitely need a certificate while others say that starting at an entry-level PMP job can then land you a higher salary and a “real” PMP job

1ivy3r1,Torn between two job offers. They are polar opposites.,"Hi for context this is my first job out of grad besides my internship that didn’t end up hiring me. (I worked at an ad agency previously) 

I recently got a job offer from a fashion focused full service production house and I was ecstatic!! It perfectly aligned with my career goals and the reason why I studied art direction. I always wanted to be part of a fashion campaign and be the creative mind behind fashion shoots in magazines, outdoor, etc. They are an incredibly small team works with mostly freelancers and I was very drawn to that as working in a global ad agency gave me the experience of being “just a number.” I wanted to wear more hats or just be able to see/ be a part of everything. This company you will be on a shoot 3-5 days a month, so it’s exciting! 
Since they are a small company though, their benefits are not great, the pay is not great at all and I’m not going to be protected by the big company hr rules if something happens.

The second offer which was unexpected was for a global tech company that everyone knows. The name value is great but I would be doing mundane work everyday. I will be a video editor making the same type of content every single day. However it is hard to ignore how great of a company it is and how they would support future career changes or future relocations. They are big on work life balance as well so there would be minimal take home work. 

You might be reading this thinking this is a no brainer, the first company is totally up my alley… well yes my heart is with them but …

The second company(tech) pays close to double the first company (fashion production) .  

This is the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. If I can get any guidance it would be amazing! 


Another thing that crossed my mind was throughout my experience in applying to jobs, fashion seemed like the hardest industry to “get in” without job experience (more than just personal passion experience)
You can always go from fashion advertising to an agency but the opposite looks very hard (sorry bad example) 
But if i have no money what am I gonna do LOL

2. There were no defects or bugs in the systems I was using.
3. This really boils down to manual and oversight done by… yours truly.

Obviously there’s going to have to be more controls and safeguards in place, kinda surprised I managed to break something again that I had already attempted to safeguard…

I love learning about psychology, spirituality, and manifestation, but I also enjoy the energy of partying and nightlife. I’d appreciate any advice on career paths, online opportunities, or even suggestions on places to move where I can thrive.

1ivu19d,"I have written 1000’s of cover letters, people were touched, empathized with me and thought I was a great fit all from a single page","I have written 1000's of Cover letters, people often ask me for feedback on their cover letters.

1 time me and a friend talked about *LinkedIn* *Easy Apply .* She mentioned that she had applied to around 50 jobs but hadn’t heard back from most of them, not even a single interview invitation. I asked, did you attach a cover letter to the resume? Curious, I asked, “Did you attach a cover letter with your resume?”

She looked surprised. “Wait, am I supposed to do that?”

I explained how I had faced similar struggles—personal challenges, a lack of experience, and the overwhelming competition in the job market. So I tried to stand out and put much effort in my cover letters. I got invited to interviews and people would tell me they were touched by my cover letters, empathized with me, thought I was a perfect fit for the team, all from a single page.

**Generic Cover Letter Advice:**

**0. Attach your cover letter to your resume when using** ***LinkedIn EasyApply***

**1.  Rule: The bulk of your coverletter should describe your experience and how that makes you a good candidate for the role.**

Sample Job description snippet:

**What You’ll Bring**

* Experience with Python and Django
* Familiarity with AWS and cloud-based development or at least some professional exposure
* Proficiency with HTML 5, JavaScript and TypeScript or at least some professional exposure
* Knowledge of data engineering tools and technologies such as MySQL, Snowflake, Pyspark, Pandas and data warehouses / data lakes.
* Understanding of software design principles and best practices
* Strong problem-solving and analytical skills
* Excellent communication and teamwork skills

Sample body:

I worked at CloudWave Solutions and used Python, Django, AWS, HTML5, JavaScript, and TypeScript to build a comprehensive financial dashboard for investment portfolio management. Using Django for the backend, I developed secure RESTful APIs to handle real-time market data and user transactions. On the frontend, I combined HTML5, JavaScript, and TypeScript with React to create an interactive interface where users could track portfolio performance, analyze trends, and receive real-time alerts. The platform was deployed on AWS, utilizing EC2, S3, and RDS for scalability and high availability, while ensuring data security and compliance with financial regulations.

Sample body if no work experience:

I got a Bachelor's degree att **\[Your University Name\]**, I worked on a personal hobby project where I used Python, Django, HTML5, JavaScript, and TypeScript to develop a budget tracking web application aimed at helping students manage their finances more effectively. I built the backend with Django, creating RESTful APIs to handle user accounts, transactions, and budgeting categories. On the frontend, I used HTML5, JavaScript, and TypeScript with React to design an intuitive interface that allowed users to input expenses, visualize spending patterns through interactive charts, and set monthly savings goals.

**2. Header section without adress, zipcode section, make it as personal as possible avoid names like Hiring manager, instead mention the company name or if you know who will read it there name.**

3. **When someone wants to hire you they need to know if you fit the team, add a section about how you fit the team.**

This is a snippet from a job description mentioning what they look for in a team mate:

Requirements:

* 5+ years experience in software engineering, ideally covering a range of technologies.
* Proven experience as a Javascript/typescript engineer with a strong command of Node.js and React.
* Working knowledge of AWS services and experience in deploying and managing cloud-based applications.
* Proficiency in designing and implementing automation solutions to drive operational efficiency.
* Experience integrating with third-party applications and RESTful APIs.
* Experience creating applications with a MongoDB data layer.
* **Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in a cross-functional team environment.**
* **Strong problem-solving abilities and a proactive mindset towards addressing technical challenges.**

Ignore the technical requirements, they mention certain soft skills like communication and collaboration skills. Here's two ways to incorporate this in your letter:



In the left piece we can see a long elaborate section praising the company describing their entire history, but a company already knows their own history no need for you to mention it. In the section on the right, the candidate mentions 1 or sentences what excites them about the company and then how their experience relates to that and makes them a good fit!

**Conclusion**

1ivsup4,How to gracefully withdraw after stressful interview (I cried/low salary) with a different division within my current employer (acquaintance is the hiring manager)?,"I'm in a doozy of a situation and am looking for advice. I currently work for a large organization and my current work environment is bad news (poor leadership and accountability, sexism, lack of respect, my managers ghost me at meetings I ask for, never apologize, etc.). Its a split position and I have several managers. I'm looking for a different role at my same employer (golden handcuffs situation).

I recently had a pretty rigorous 2nd round interview with a different division; half day, multiple sessions with various stakeholders. I'm actually acquaintances with the hiring manager (would-be direct supervisor) and another person on the team. They are wonderful. During one of my interview sessions I met with the would-be boss's boss and it did not go well. Their style was too direct; they questioned -twice - why I would want to leave my current position (on paper my current role looks like a good fit), brought up the salary range (which is too low for my needs and didn't seem to indicate flexibility), and then asked about reference evaluations which were completed by my two better managers who know my situation. My employer uses a rating tool, and I received a less than perfect (9/10) rating on developing effective relationships with managers. I started to tear up because I was already triggered from their previous questions and genuinely hurt by that evaluation because I try so hard to make the most of my current situation and problematic managers. I was visibly upset and teary for the rest of the interview sessions. In a wrap-up session with the hiring manager, I explained myself and they seemed understanding. I tried to recover and wrote nice thank you emails to everyone I met with.

Now having some time to think further, I don't think I want to move forward. I can tell they won't meet my current salary, and after my experience interviewing, I don't want to take a pay cut for the type of work the division does. I was told there would be another interview round for the finalist. How do I explain my reason for withdrawing, try not to burn bridges and preserve a good reputation with a team that has good people? Especially after I wrote positive thank you emails?

Thanks for your advice!",c_from_pa,3,1.0,2,1740257770,2025-02-22 20:56:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivsup4/how_to_gracefully_withdraw_after_stressful/,2,2025
1ivsu5w,20k pay raise or go back to old job?,"Started a new job that I really don’t think is a good fit culture wise. They require 5 days in office with little to no flexibility in our working hours and on top of that, track my productivity time using laptop tracking software daily. The office environment is barren as almost no one even works in the office as the return to office mandate is only effective for new hires. Anyone that I even works and collaborate with needs to be through online video calls anyways so I don’t even understand the in office requirement. 

My old job was super flexible and had a hybrid model that was hardly enforced. My manager was great as well, never micromanaged and trusted me to get my job done every time. I left simply because being offered such a salary bump was too good to pass up especially with the current state of the economy, however, I was/am not in a position to NEED the pay bump in order to live as I don’t have a family or anyone to really support beside myself (although it would definitely offer more comfort). I’m considering going back to the old role but want some others opinions.

1ivs7o7,"Hated first ‘career’ job, so now what?","Hello all, 

I am 28 F and I’ve been working in corporate intelligence for about ten months, recently got put onto a management support plan (a pip basically) and I realised I never really liked the job (constant deadlines, changing lanes constantly, niche, high level work and low pay).  This job has knocked my confidence and self esteem as I feel utterly incapable and worried I won’t be able to cope in like a ‘career job’. 

So, I’ve decided to quit before I get disciplined or fired, and to protect my mental health, as I’ve been so stressed I struggle to eat, sleep and even enjoy anything without thinking of my job. I don’t have a back up except work in hospitality (which I have done for ten years). I cannot stay at my job longer than another month or two because I think it could possibly kill me (I’m not even exaggerating, I am struggling to cope with the stress).   

Many of my friends are supportive but some think this is career suicide, saying it looks odd that I’d quit and go back to waitressing (just in the mean time whilst I have a think). 

I have an undergrad and a masters degree (intelligence and security) and specialised in immigration policy and counter terrorism. The corporate intelligence thing isn’t for me, but I am now panicking that I will not be good at what I studied in and feel like I’m having to go back to the drawing board. 

I’m feeling like such a screw up that my first job wasn’t for me. I am hard working and smart but prone to stress (have longstanding MH issues). 

I was considering policy writing, or maybe academia, and in the mean time trying to waitress in high end places for more money (where I live is high cost).  I love people, I like talking to people and like to really know a subject, I enjoy reading and talking about geopolitics, human rights, psychology, politics etc. I am also thinking of volunteering at a local refugee centre. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on what are good lines of work for someone like me? Is it possible to have a career in what I’m interested with my mental health issues?  I am also looking for reassurance of bouncing without a plan is as disastrous as some say, and also any recommendations of what I could do with my education.

Any advice and stories of a career start over in late 20’s would be so helpful. I know I have a lot to give but feel really lost.

I currently have a undergraduate degree in graphic design and have quite a bit of experience in large agencies (no digital work) working with global brands, however the work I have been doing has led me to complete burnout and a move from London to Newcastle has left me with little job opportunities.

I don’t want to move into digital design or digital marketing, which is where all the work is, and I’ve tried incredibly hard to move into another role however not even apprenticeships and minimum wage roles will take me.

I’m not sure what I would like to do in the future, I’m just looking for a way to open doors and so I’m looking at online postgraduate degrees while I work.

I have 10k to spend (not wanting to use student finance) and my two options currently are a marketing PG diploma at Glasgow university or a MSc in business and management at Northumbria university.

Glasgow is the most obvious choice for its prestige and course quality.. but I can’t afford the masters. Northumbria however I can afford the full masters but is a less regarded university.

As someone who just wants a degree to help open doors, which one would you advise?

I'm currently in a top 10 firm working in Deal Advisory, earning around £75k + ~10% bonus. I've received an offer from a top 20 firm for ~£80k, but bonuses range from £30k to £80k (I've verified this). On paper, this seems like the right move—the commute is significantly better (45 mins vs. 1hr30), it's a promotion, the culture is far healthier (my current firm is quite toxic), and they’ve mapped out a clear path for me to director. At my current firm, I don’t see a realistic path to director in the next 10 years.

My only hesitation is whether I’ll regret leaving a top 10 firm for a smaller one. If I ever wanted to return to a top 10, do you think that would be difficult? Have any of you made a similar move, and if so, how did it affect your career progression?

1ivpxa2,Seeking Advice: Should I Take the Leap to a New Job?,"Hi everyone,  

I’ve been at my current company for three years, and it’s been a rollercoaster. In my second year, my boss—who has a reputation for being extremely temperamental—decided he didn’t like me and made my life miserable. For 11 months, I endured severe workplace bullying during a time when I was financially strapped and unable to leave. My attempts to find another job back then didn’t pan out, so I stayed on unwillingly.  

Fast forward to now, that same boss—who once spread false rumors, discredited my work, and repeatedly insulted my character and intelligence—has started treating me “decently.” He even called me “mature” for not resisting the unfair treatment he and HR dished out. This remark felt incredibly insulting because my silence wasn’t maturity—it was survival. I stayed because I had no other options at the time.  

What’s even more frustrating is that, despite winning awards for my projects, my promotion has been withheld for the last two years due to the discrediting actions of this boss. My manager is now advising me to stay on, as there’s a good chance I’ll be promoted next year.  

Currently, my direct manager and colleagues are great, and we work well together. However, the toxic boss is still around, though the company is trying to fire him (he’s clinging on with the help of a lawyer). I’m comfortable in my role now, but I’m not particularly motivated. I’ve managed to stabilize myself financially by working two jobs (my current role and a part-time gig).  

Recently, I’ve been headhunted for a new job. The caveat is that it doesn’t offer good bonuses, which could mean earning less, and I’d likely have to work much harder than I do now. I’m torn about whether to take the leap.  

**Pros of Staying:**  
- Financial stability (current job + part-time gig).  
- Good relationship with direct manager and colleagues.  
- Comfortable workload.  
- Potential promotion next year (as advised by my manager).  

**Cons of Staying:**  
- Toxic boss still lingering, though restrained.  
- Lack of motivation and growth.  
- Promotion withheld for two years despite achievements.  

**Pros of New Job:**  
- Fresh start, away from the toxic environment.  
- Potential for growth and renewed motivation.  

**Cons of New Job:**  
- Potentially lower earnings (fewer bonuses).  
- Likely heavier workload.  

I’d really appreciate any advice or insights from those who’ve been in similar situations. Should I take the leap for a healthier work environment, even if it means earning less and working harder? Or should I stay put, hoping for the promotion next year, and wait for a better opportunity?  

Thank you in advance for your thoughts!

1ivpr9a,Need guidance with navigating bosses,"Hello! I’m seeking advice on my situation:

I work at a small company (less than 20 people). I manage a team and am middle management. You can make all the stereotypical assumptions. It’s your typical disorganized start up, no structure, no HR, emotional decision making, lack of transparency, mom and pop etc. 

I used to report to the CEO but now I report to my current boss and he is the only in our organization that reports to the CEO. This changed happened in January.

Here are the facts:

1. I’m pregnant disclosed in email. No responses from my bosses except some in person conversations. 

2. Ever since then the CEO has become increasingly hostile towards me. Firstly I have had significantly reduced communications with him since disclosing my pregnancy. I’ve reported to him almost my entire tenure at this company. Almost all interactions have been increasingly negative pointed towards me or backhanded comments. I brought up the limited communications to my current boss and he kind of wrote it off…”that’s just how he is”

3. The CEO speaks to my direct reports one on one and does not communicate with me. He also does not include me in decisions regarding my team. I’ve mostly let it go because it’s hasn’t been a battle worth fighting. 

I have requested an up to date performance review and I am documenting anything I feel I relevant to my experience. I will also add that I do above average,if not, exemplary work. I’m extremely proactive and involved with pretty much every member of our company. I also have volunteered myself to take on projects or initiatives that no one else is willing to take on. 

My question is- what do I do? How do I cover myself in case of retaliatory action? I cannot leave because I am pregnant. 

Should I bring it up with my direct supervisor as a form of documentation and not mention any further actions? ",Stunning-Egg3945,1,1.0,0,1740249697,2025-02-22 18:41:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivpr9a/need_guidance_with_navigating_bosses/,2,2025

1ivpbuv,One more day to decide between flight attendant or contract role in my field,"I’m really struggling with this decision especially after being unemployed for over 6 months (UI just ended) I got two jobs in the same day. After being brutalized in tech for the last 20 years and PTSD for layoffs and buyouts and having to cash out my retirement - again - I started looking elsewhere and worked hard to get hired as a flight attendant. I know the money is poor but it made me smile and after another bankruptcy I don’t have a lot of bills (except some I owe to my elderly mom who is on SS which I take very seriously) 

Before I could buckle up and celebrate the training offer from United I finished an interview I was recruited for based on my experience and resume - hard to pass up as contract to hire making more in 6 months than I would in two years with the airline. I instantly took the contract it’s fully remote but I’ve gotten some minor to major red flags from the contract company and yellow flags from the main company but it may be my PTSD, it is hard for me to gather enthusiasm based on my past with companies like this after what I’ve been through. I had about 12k in savings before I said “yes” thinking it was for the better and am already down to 8k upon the realization I’ve needed to rent a very decent place so I can work remote and some travel to get back to where I need to be and some other unrelated things but also I know how it goes when making more you tend to spend more anyway neither here nor there but I have just enough saved left to make it theough training with United until I start getting paid and will still be able to pay my mom back though I’m payments slowly over time vs large payments with the contract gig. Training for United starts in one and half weeks and I have just enough time to make it and get ready. 

I love aviation but have a natural human fear if flying sometimes even though I’m used to it from years of business travel. I like the idea of seeing customers just once or twice then forgetting about them vs getting stuck with difficult clients and competitive gnarly tech people. My lifestyle is such that going where an airline tells me now is easy peasy and much less up front investment ca needing a nice rental for remote work eating into my earnings - I’m in a great space to be at an airlines will basically! 

Risks 

People do fail training and probation for airlines so there’s no guarantee I make it. I have total confidence in my ability but sometimes it just happens - that said the contract company has already given me a hard time about some things and I have no doubt they’d toss me before six months if it wasn’t working for them for any reason. United is a career if I make it and low pay is temporary (ultra low pay anyway) and flexibility is unmatched in the long term - they don’t care where I live vs remote work which is never really as flexible as stated (finding this where they don’t look kindly upon being a digital nomad even in the US only and even when trying to find a permanent place and I have important family and relationships on both coasts I want freedom to visit and check on as they age) 

I know it’s impossible to see into the future but I’m having serious anxiety about renting a place for another week much less month when I could just turn my car around and go home now and get ready for United training 

Initially I figured I need the money from the contract and could be a FA later. But I’m in my late 40s already and still quite fit for the slog new FAs need to go through. Not sure how it will be in 5 years or even 6 months but in 6 months to a year there’s no guarantee I’ll get hired as an FA again especially by United if I turn this down now. The interview process is very competitive and United was my first FA offer after several other tries with airlines. They are also my first choice airline for their amazing route network. 

Thanks for reading - been over this in my mind a million times and started contract job already - but I haven’t gotten enough of a feel for it to know for sure and was hoping I’d be sure right now.

1ivp30h,Recently lost my job post-COVID,"For reference, I live in the States and I had worked in a hospital laboratory. I left for a vacation (my first one in several years) and after a few days I came back with my first positive COVID test. This was in August 2024. In December I was diagnosed with LC. I had doctor’s notes that kept extending my leave. The last one had me off until February 1, 2025. HR called me on January 14th to let me know I was being terminated due to “exhaustion of leave”. They said I could go through the re-hiring process when I am well again if I choose to. I DO understand their position. I felt horrible not being able to work and my co-workers having to be stuck filling in my 10 hour second shifts…for months. I also knew the only way they could get relief is if they could hire someone else for my job. I, selfishly, didn’t want to quit my job because I liked my job and the ppl I worked with. 

I don’t know. I think I just feel somehow disheartened and don’t know what to do now. Do I file unemployment? Is unemployment even an option when you can’t technically look for work (other than remotely) because you are still working through a mountain of referrals? I have no idea what I am supposed to do or even have the option to do at this time. It’s hard to focus on dealing with this when I feel I am worrying all the time and yes, I know I should take this time away and focus on getting better, but still. I’m just wondering if this is even possible atm.

I’m sorry for my rant, it’s just been on my mind for a while and I haven’t come to a resolution that offers any peace for me right now.",COVID_Blows,1,1.0,0,1740247986,2025-02-22 18:13:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivp30h/recently_lost_my_job_postcovid/,2,2025

Im asking the community because i know other guy in my company that we co-work together much and most of the time he remembers things that are hard for me to remember although we would have learnt it together.
Is it an issue with me? Or he is a guy with a good memory? And does happen with you guys or not?

1ivlm99,Seeking career advice on what steps to take next.,"Hi everyone,

I’m I’ve been working as a **Project Associate at Consulting base start-up since August 2019**, where I primarily handle procurement, vendor management, and risk mitigation. Before that, I worked in **Airlines** as Ground Staff .

# My Situation:

* I joined my current working Company **during COVID**, thinking it would be a good opportunity. However, since then, I’ve been **stuck** due to limited job-switching opportunities.
* My role is stable, but I feel like I’ve hit a ceiling in terms of growth and salary.
* I have an **MBA in Retail Management (2022) and a Bachelor's in Engineering (2014)**.
* My expertise lies in **procurement, supplier relations, risk management, and operations**.

# My Concerns:

1. **How do I transition out of this startup role?** Big companies seem to prefer candidates from well-known firms.
2. **Should I shift industries?** My background is a mix of procurement, security, and operations. Would a new domain (like supply chain, logistics, or retail operations) make sense?
3. **Certifications?** Would any additional certifications (e.g., Six Sigma, PMP, or supply chain-related) help me stand out?
4. **Job search strategy?** Given my background, what kind of companies and roles should I target?

I’d love to hear insights from people who have made similar career shifts or hiring managers in procurement and operations. Any advice would be appreciated",Single_Grape_5934,0,0.5,0,1740239279,2025-02-22 15:47:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivlm99/seeking_career_advice_on_what_steps_to_take_next/,2,2025
1ivl6us,got a sales job after 1 year unemployed but really not feeling it,"so, i got a job offer after a year of unemployment as an SDR and i was initially really excited. it's a remote job so i of course took it. now, i'm deeper into the training and i'm really not feeling it or the product, it's scammy. to put it frankly, i'm not the type of person who can put aside my morals / values and sell a product i don't believe in myself. i wasn't put on this planet to do this type of work. i hate sales in general and i went in with a pessimistic view of the SDR role already so it was hard for me to have a good attitude. now i show up to everyday miserable and it's only a week in.

* it's a boys club and i'm the only female salesperson, company is still startup culture
* the account executives are all brand new themselves and so half the team is brand new and training with me
* it's remote first (which is amazing) but i find myself very unhappy with the product and i would not purchase it myself. in fact i've worked in the industry we are selling to and i would never recommend someone be forced to implement this to their own clients. if i had to use this i would literally leave the agreement. it makes me angry
* i am unable physically, mentally and spiritually to make 75-100 calls a day trying to scam people to meet with AE's for a product i do not believe in myself
* the dudes i'm working with are all very into their jobs, amped up, able to spit out the corporate jargon 24/7 365 and live and breathe the bullshit. i find myself unable to live and breathe the bullshit, i can't even fake it.
* if they were to sit me down and fire me, i'd say: ""listen, i have a problem with what you're selling to people, you're a useless middle man scamming for profit and i am unable to compromise my own values to help you sell this.""

i was going to hold onto this job as long as i could, but i really am firm that sales is not for me, not for my personality, and this company is not one i want to stay at long term. in fact i cannot fake my disdain for this position no matter how much i try (they notice on the zooms that i look miserable, even though i fake smile) and i really foresee myself getting fired swiftly if i don't quit myself and tell them the truth.

what do i do?

TLDR: female 3 years out of college (business major), have been unable to get a basic customer service/communications/operations/Hr assistant job out of college. got an SDR job and feel like i am going to get fired i hate it so much. im also going through serious health issues and a cancer scare now, awaiting biopsy.",atravelingmuse,6,1.0,40,1740238129,2025-02-22 15:28:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivl6us/got_a_sales_job_after_1_year_unemployed_but/,2,2025
1ivkvyi,Looking for some advice,"So I'm looking for some advice as I've come to an impass in my career. I've been working as a maintenance planner for a metal packaging manufacturer for about three years. I've been doing a lot outside of my job description and recently earned a promotion as a maintenance supervisor. This promotion came with a significant increase in compensation as well as an increased bonus structure. I'm currently in a really good position to become the engineering manager or even assistant plant manager if those positions ever become vacant in the next few years. The company I currently work for is a multi billion dollar publically traded organization. My goal is to climb the corporate ladder to higher positions.

I was approached by a recruiter about a plant/shop manager position at a local repair shop that recently got bought out by a family organization. This shop is familiar to me because of my previous career was in the same industry as this prospective company. I worked in the previous industry for 10 years before moving on to new exciting things. The industry is completely unrelated to what I'm doing now. The company is pretty small, with an annual revenue of about $5 million a year. It's also family owned so there's not a lot of corporate oversight like my current company.

I guess I'm worrying if I should even entertain the idea of jumping back into an industry I left years ago for the opportunity to run my own plant/shop. Or should I continue on my path at my current company and climb the corporate ladder. The compensation jump to the plant manager position would be about a 10% raise. But I might have more opportunities for better growth at my current company by getting promotions and raises. I could eventually be running my department in a few years or even better.

But I'm starting to notice that I'm getting too involved with my work, to the point where I fall asleep thinking about what I need to do to solve X issue or whatever, and waking up thinking about it once again.

I also find myself working when no one notices, outside working hours. I view this as a way to enrich my knowledge and to get tasks done, but the truth is this is occupying a more personal space, and I can't seem to get away from this situation. It feels like I'm stuck at a situation where I'm deeply personally entangled. At the same time, because of this, if something goes wrong, I've seen myself getting emotionally devastated. It truly feels like the lines between my professional and personal life are non existent right now - especially since these are companies that don't necessarily care about us that much. It is an inequal relationship. I'm not sure what to do.

1ivk5mv,Transitioning from Java Backend to Tech Lead MDM (STEP by Stibo) – Is it a good move?," Hi everyone,

I’m currently a Java backend developer (Spring Boot) with 7 years of experience, and I’ve recently received an opportunity to work as a Tech Lead in Master Data Management (MDM) using STEP by Stibo.

This would be my first experience in MDM, and while I have a solid background in backend development, I’m curious about the market demand, growth opportunities, and required skills in this field.

Here are my questions:
Is Tech Lead MDM (STEP by Stibo) a promising career path?
How does MDM compare to traditional backend development in terms of challenges and long-term opportunities?
Are MDM specialists in high demand, and does it open doors to better roles in data governance and architecture?
What key skills should I focus on to succeed in this transition?
If anyone here has experience in MDM, STEP by Stibo, or has made a similar transition, I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice!

1ivhr6u,Do I have future in a company/team where I don’t speak the language as a native?,"I started working for this company 1 year ago in the development team. When I started the company was leaning more towards being international (it’s a German company). Also being in the development team, other members didn’t speak German so the team language is English. That was fine by me. However development isn’t what I like to do. (The job market is rough so.. I had to get a job).

Recently in Jan 2025 I started in a new team - pre-sales. (I know the change is random but I worked tech sales and pre sales before and is where I feel the best). The management saw that I have strong skills in the customer/sales department and I did the move. 

However this team for obvious reasons is German language only. Everyone is German and the language for everything (meetings, customers, emails) is German. My german is a B1 level. I understand more than I speak. Also is Bayern German (if you know what I mean). 

I’m now doubting if this has any future. I try my best to “roll with the punches” but I feel like a wallpaper in the meetings and in any interaction. I have had this role before but in English and I have done a good job, but now I’m just trying to catch up.

During meetings I’m trying hard to focus on what’s going on which I get around 85% of what is being said but for communication speaking  I feel just not confident in the language to really express my opinions or contribute in a meaningful way (a lot of the times I’m afraid I didn’t get exactly what the topics are and will comment some out of context). I’m taking extra German classes on the side but my schedule are crazy busy between projects/ kids/ fam etc. it’s also a remote job so I’m not living in Germany.

I had a very positive attitude at the start but now wondering if this has any future… 
Obviously I can’t contribute as much as my co-workers when it comes to German workshops, customer presentations, etc. so I end up
Working on slides on the background and being the “assistant”. I’m hoping my German will improve but I’m feeling defeated at the moment. 

Also afraid the company will cut me off since I’m not really bring as much as the others to the table. 

The company also doesn’t want to go international anymore, and rather concentrate in the DACH region.

1ivg785,I need Advice. Is this considered REDA? (retaliatory employment discrimination act),"okay so please try to stay with me. I have been at this company for four years this March. Since I have been here I have seen the worst side of a company that I never thought I would ever see from anyone let alone a company. I have four bosses, I guess you could say. It's a family owned business and you have the Mother and Father and the Son and his wife who all take a seat at the Owners table. There use to be four females that worked in the office and one of the females walked out one night at 4 am during a third shift and never came back. I don't blame her anymore. The bosses talk about all of us to each other and about each other . For instance, this past week, it snowed a lot and I was suppose to come in for Thursday night shift. I got in touch with one of the owners and the daytime mgmt and got the day switch approved. The second shift lady worked for me because she was already staying at this location and it was easier for her to walk three to five steps to get to work rather than me trying to drive in what was a state of emergency that was made earlier that day from the government. In return I would work for her shift on Saturday night and as far as I thought everything was fine. I was wrong. I got to work tonight and I was told by the same lady that worked for me thursday that one of the bosses come into the office and made a comment that I was starting to act just like T (the lady that walked out and quit) and by the way no one really liked T because she was very rude at times to all of us in the office and she would talk about us to the bosses and she also got to take off days without telling or getting them approved as well as she was given a raise and I was here longer then her and I still have yet to see a raise in the four years I have worked for this company. Now I was promised a raise two years ago and I was never given one, infact the bosses called a group meeting in the office and in front of the day time manager they let me know the reason I was not getting a raise that I was promised was because the manager was ""Capped off"" at $12.00 an hour which has nothing to do with me or my position but Im assuming they used it as a scape goat to not have to give me what was promised. Either way I never got my raise and they discussed pay in front of two employees that I don't belive was right or even legal to do but it was done as most things are done probably illegally at this business. Back to T the lady who quit. I am assuming they thought it was going to be an insult to say I was being like T but to me it wasn't an insult as much as it was a breaking point for my job and it has really made me wonder if I should start to look for another job. I understand that everyone isn't prefect and sometimes people have bad days but I don't believe it's right to be talked about or compared to another employee just because you took a snow day that was approved previously but a different boss. I was also told that the boss had said to the other employee that he guess no ones has to tell him what's going on or get it approved from him but I was told again, when we had the office meeting about wages that we are all adults in this office and if we need to swap a day or take a day, or whatever, we need to figure it out like adults and that's what I was doing. But I have also been called a liar for telling the truth so Im sure this will be no different. I have been screamed at by this same boss, in the parking lot in front of customers and I have felt disrespected and degraded by this boss but I stay because I have given 4 years to this company and I truly believed that they seen my value but at this time, I fear that it's not value they see, instead it's just labor, I am just a laborer and if they could get away with not paying me at all they actually might consider it..I can't speak on their behalf but from my point of view I feel like I am not valued at a person or an employee. There are other issues with me just going out and getting a new job which is a bigger reason I haven't left and at this point I feel like it may be harder for me to get employed but I have to try right? Don't I deserve to have a boss or bosses that talk about me like Im garbage to my other employees? I get yelled at and disrespected for the smallest things like writing a receipt not the same way they would write it. nothing is incorrect or wrong with the hand written receipt but that's just an example of what could be said just because...",UnusualMishapping,2,0.7599999904632568,0,1740221520,2025-02-22 10:52:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivg785/i_need_advice_is_this_considered_reda_retaliatory/,2,2025

The range of salary is 88k to 100k. I will have an interview with small or say very small company in welly same role and band is 85 to 95. My current salary is 88k.

1ivf9ek,I complained to my boss’ boss regarding my boss,"I have been working in this work from home job since January as a sales representative and i was promised i would be paid by my boss by 10 Feb and its been so long now, i completed all the formalities and still kept waiting, my boss stopped replying to me, stopped giving me any kind of work(probably because this job is a scam or god knows), and i even learnt he gave my work to another colleague, i kept begging him to call me because i needed to talk to him regarding my pay, he never picked up(he used to always say if i have any problems i can contact him anytime) but as soon as he got the job done from me he just stopped, he would send in his secretary that would just keep delaying the whole process altogether by saying i’ll get an update tomorrow and nothing will come by, it had been one week now that i was trying to get ahold of him, in anger i did say to my boss i won’t do work unless i receive money it could be that is why he stopped giving me any work but god knows
So i took this difficult step today, somewhere i guess i had given up the hope of being paid a long time back, super boss said that Saturday Sunday are holidays and that i should connect with concerned secretary on Monday, kept reiterating that, i have tried being v professional in this fuck all company with everyone, i just feel so angry and i hope these miserable assholes one day pay for the way they treat their employees, i worked so so hard for this company along with full time college and this is the shit treatment i get, i want to resign i have been thinking about that but its the slightest hope that maybe i’ll get paid that is keeping me from doing that.

Tldr:- i work in a shit company with a shit boss this is my first job and i was supposed to get incentives for the work i did in my training period, its been 1 week since i have gotten any money, more so no responses from my boss or his secretary he doesn’t return my calls so i complained to the super-boss who asked me to talk to secretary on Monday because its a HOLIDAY🥰

1ivf4o1,Give Up FT Remote?,"Need input/perspective. Contemplating giving up a FT remote job for a primarily in-office one. 

Current job: I've been with my current employer for 5 years, fully remote. I love my boss and the pay is $110k (slightly above average for this area). They implemented a hybrid model for employees within 30 miles of an office, which doesn't apply to me. However, last year they laid off quite a few people and it made me feel like this wasn't as stable a job as I'd like. I also feel very isolated at times, even though I'm more introverted.

Potential Job: Employer is local, commute would be 5-10 minutes, and the company has only had one layoff in 60 years. I would be asking for a 20% pay increase. I would be required to go into the office Mon-Thur and WFH on Fridays.

A part of me wonders if I'm just bored and looking for a change that isn't necessary. However, the other part of me has this sense of insecurity about my current job being ""too good to last"". I'm also wondering if FT remote has taken a toll on my mental health. The biggest consideration for me are my kids. I have 2 kids who are grade-school age, so, no one is home during the day; however, it's nice to be home with them during the summers, holiday breaks, etc. I also have a lot more freedom in my daily routine. It's a tough thing to give up, but this move would be with the long-term in mind.

1ivet4a,Sitting on negative feedback,"Hi all, quick question and vent.

Context: I’m 1.5 years in on a new team and until now, I’ve been just sitting on my complaints of my manager just out of self preservation and a strong disinterest in going back into the job market. 

Situation: I was given a mid-level position but intereviewed for a senior level position. l was told that a senior title doesnt actually exist, but on my first day, I later met 2 senior-titled coworkers on the team. It’s fine if I fell short and got a job anyway - but this was just the first blatant lie. 

Since then, my manager, who is foreign, has told me false things like poor performance means getting moved to a lower position (illegal in our country of employment), has redistributed my projects to a new hire, delegated my role to coworker on the team, who then tried to change my job description. 

The latest strange situation - she just reversed her decision to promote me, citing personality reasons and that I’m too introverted. That’s a quote from a surprise performance review she just gave me. 

The climate is also a bit serious, 2 others on my team were fired out of nowhere and she doesnt make any attempt to discuss or explain what happened. 

Now, I basically have an unspoken agreement that she gives me flexible working hours and I give her good feedback, although she is a terrible manager. 

Question: Would you just let all of this go and stay employed in an uncertain market? Would you try drop anonymous feedback somehow? 

Id prefer not working for her, but I dont want to stand out for it while spontaneous firings are a thing and the job market looks terrible. ",Humbertohh,1,1.0,0,1740215456,2025-02-22 09:10:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ivet4a/sitting_on_negative_feedback/,2,2025
1iveqf5,What Jobs Should I Look For?,"I’m currently working at a martial arts school in Orange County and am making 4k a month, but I desperately want to leave mostly due to unprofessional management and underpay for the work I do (teaching 6 days a week, zero coworkers in the business, running phone and over the counter sales, administrative work, etc). I’d like to find a different somewhat short term job the pays more before handing in my two week notice. The goal is to pay my bills, pay off credit card debt, and save enough for startup costs to go all in on opening a martial arts school (my passion isn’t in martial arts per say but in owning a business, but I’m pursuing school owning since I’m very familiar with the industry and see an opportunity for myself there). This is my first job search and will kind of be my first time working outside of martial arts, and I wanted some suggestions as to what positions to look for.

I was thinking about doing sales since I know you can make a lot of money through commissions if you perform well, plus it will give me more experience in sales for when I own my own school. However, part of me wants to find a lower pressure position right now to decompress from my current job and breathe before becoming a business owner. Something where I sit on a computer sounds nice, but I’m not sure if there’s jobs like this for me that pay well with my qualifications 

Education and Experience:

Bachelors in Business Economics from UCI
(I honestly didn’t learn jack and got dog water grades. Terrible waste of opportunity there)

Like 6 months working as a sales associate.

A total of 6.5 years working as a head martial arts instructor at a couple different schools. Here I would make planners and teach classes of 1-40 students and build a relationship with parents to improve retention and build a community. For the last year I’ve done phone sales for trials from leads gathered through Facebook ads and over the counter sales to convert trials to members. Just started using a CRM application that a friend of the owner runs.

Some of the awards are pretty prestigious while others are nice but not a huge deal. Well, I received a letter from HR with my boss, my boss's boss (Regional VP), and the SVP of the company congratulating me on winning one of the top awards. Everyone congratulated me, and the Regional VP announced my award at the regional meeting.

1ivc0c5,"Lied about employment dates on resume, will it show on background check?","I was laid off from my tech job in June 2023 and have
finally gotten a job offer. The only issue is I lied about my employment dates on my resume and I have to complete a background check (Verified First) for the new job. Will the discrepancy in employment dates be an issue? I'm absolutely desperate for work and have burned through my savings, unemployment, and am in CC debt just trying not to lose my apartment. I'm working as a server right now but it's just not enough. I don't have anyone I can ask for help.

When I first started job searching I was getting some interviews but couldn't get past 1st or 2nd round interviews. In the beginning I was being honest about being laid off but it wasn't getting me anywhere. After 6 months of being laid off I knew I had to change something. When I started to act like I was still employed I was hearing back from recruiters more
often and was suddenly making it to final round interviews. I was more than qualified for all the positions I was applying for but I still couldn't get an offer. I kept getting told they went with a candidate who had more experience than me which is crazy
because that meant the other candidates were taking the job at a pay cut. These were entry level jobs I couldn't even get an offer for.

So I got rid of all unemployment gaps on my resume and stretched out the dates to make it look like I have been continuously employed. I didn't lie about anything I don't know how to do, only the dates. I know how to do everything they are asking for and in my field, having 2 yrs vs 5 yrs of experience doesn't make a difference. We do the same thing every day.

1ivblio,From College Student to Marketing Professional: Non-Traditional Career Paths in Business,"Many believe that a traditional business degree is essential for climbing the corporate ladder. However, my journey from being an average college student juggling part-time gigs to stepping into the world of marketing challenges this notion.



# The Common Belief vs. Reality

It’s widely accepted that formal education is the key to business success. Yet, real-world experience often teaches skills that textbooks don’t cover. In fact, a study by Harvard Business School found that 37% of employers prioritize experience over educational credentials (*FlexJobs*).



# My Unconventional Path

As a college student, I took up various side hustles—freelancing, managing social media pages, and even selling customized products online. Through these experiences, I learned how to understand consumer behavior, market trends, and the power of good branding. These practical skills turned out to be more valuable than I initially realized.



# Supporting Evidence

 **Skill Transferability:** Managing a college event, running a small online business, or even being part of a club teaches leadership, customer service, and marketing strategies that are crucial in corporate roles (*Medium*).  
  
**Employer Perspectives:** Many employers now focus on skills rather than degrees. Companies are more open to hiring candidates with hands-on experience in real-world projects rather than just academic knowledge (*Financial Times*).  


# The Surprising Insight

The shift towards valuing experience over formal education is gaining momentum. Industries are increasingly recognizing that unconventional backgrounds can offer fresh perspectives and innovative solutions.

I'm currently in a weird spot and I'm not sure what to do. I started college Fall of 2023 making me technically a sophomore right now, however because I got my associates during high school I am a first semester senior and I will be graduating Fall 2025 and I do not have the financial means to continue as my scholarship ends early because it was only granted for 5 semesters because I came in with over 60 credits.

I am an Applied Math Major with a concentration in Data Analytics (3.97 GPA), and I do not know what I am going to do after I graduate. I’m not interested in becoming an actuary or working in tech. Throughout college, I’ve been involved in research groups (sometimes multiple at a time) focused on Neural Networks and Machine Learning, but I haven’t enjoyed them either.

I also don’t have any internships, though I do work in a professional office position on campus. Which I have been promised the Graduate Assistant position for (w/full tuition waiver) if I pursue a master’s at my current university, but my only options would be an MBA or MPA due to limited graduate programs. My campus career services just told me to take Exam FM since I already took Exam P and figure it out from there but that wasn't helpful.

My first meeting with the manager went well, however it’s been downhill from there. She outright blew me off for an interview, didn’t bother to cancel or reschedule just didn’t show up at all. I sent her multiple emails before and after and 2 days later she emailed me asking if I’m available tomorrow. I said yes and asked what time and didn’t get a reply until 4 in the morning, for an interview at 9 AM the same day. I interviewed with her and she didn’t even acknowledge blowing me off at all she just acted like it didn’t happen. 

Fast forward to now. She hired me and I was desperate so I took the job. I just finished my first week and it’s been awful so far. I saw the way she talks to people (terrible) and she already snapped at me for asking a simple question (wanted to know how to track miles for expensing) and said “stop jumping ahead what the f*** is your problem” then apologized for cussing. She sent me on an appointment that nobody showed up for and turns out it was a cancellation and wasn’t even the right appoitment I was supposed to go to. No apology and didn’t answer my calls or texts while I was waiting for over an hour.

Should I stick it out for the experience / resume or should I just look elsewhere ?

I’m a newly arrived immigrant to the U.S. and have just received my work authorization. I’m eager to start a career in real estate—not necessarily as an agent—but I’m facing some initial challenges. The biggest one is that I don’t have a car or a driver’s license yet. While I plan to get both in the future, my current priority is securing my first job, building financial stability, and gaining industry experience.

Despite this limitation, I’m determined to break into the field because I have a wealth of transferable skills and previous experience transitioning into new industries from scratch. I’ve never officially worked in real estate, but having moved many times in my life, I developed a deep interest in the industry and the housing market from a tenant’s perspective.

My current plan is to craft a strong cover letter highlighting my relevant skills, attach my resume, and reach out to every real estate and property management company in my area to inquire about entry-level opportunities. If no paid positions are available, I’m even open to volunteering while working another job to sustain myself.

I’d love to hear your opinion on the following matters:

* What do you think of my approach?
* If you’re a property manager, real estate agent, or industry professional, how would you respond to an inquiry like this?
* Are there any specific entry-level roles you’d recommend targeting, especially for someone without a car?
* Is there anything else I could do to improve my chances?

I'm still in training, have no independent work yet and fully expect them to just send me a shipping return label for the laptop and to not work a notice, which is fine, but here's the issue. 

My new boss has been very open about the fact that her boss, the recruiter, and the recruiter's boss did not want to hire me because I was overqualified, but that she specifically wanted me. I have about 7 years of experience in my role and the position is basically entry level, I was honestly surprised they hired me too. So she's brought that up a few times and mentioned other things like, ""I had a great feeling about you, I think you're going to do great things here,"" or ""I can tell you're in it for the long haul,"" and even talked about taking me to the company in person 'beginning of a new fiscal year' event next spring. 

In my perfect world I'd send an email explaining the situation, and be on my merry way, but I don't know if it's more professional to set up a call with her instead? I've never quit a remote job before, and I also don't really know her and feel like she's not going to take it well. She's been nice to me, but she overshares a lot and seems to inadvertently pit some of her team members against each other with just kind of catty gossip snippets here and there, plus with all of the big game she's talked about hiring me despite everyone saying I'm a flight risk I worry she might take it personally. I really do feel a little guilty about it and despite the weird team culture I've experienced so far I could see it working out, but even if I wasn't excited about the other job offer I can't turn down that kind of pay raise. 

I'm taking the other job regardless of how they react, but if anyone has any advice on how to approach this/format my resignation/etc. that'd be great, I hope I'm just overthinking it and no one will give a shit, but would like to take it seriously and be prepared.

1iv6tjk,Best Career Advice I’ve Heard,"“You are always making an impression”

Don’t know where this quote comes from but I think about it often and thought I would share. Everyday others view you and form impressions based on the limited information they have on your life. While I’m a big proponent of not caring what others think, I think this quote helps promote self-awareness. For the people you do want to make a good impression on, I think it’s important to be self-aware and try to understand, for lack of better term, the vibe you give off.  

For example, when prepping for a job interview, not only dressing nice, but showing up early, making eye contact when speaking, coming across confident, are all things that leave a great impression. It’s really the soft-skills and leaving good impressions on others that will help you be successful. 

You will never be promoted by others on how you perceive yourself unfortunately, and it’s one of the biggest tips that’s helped me grow professionally.

I hate anything to do with math. I’m not good at math. Hell I can barely do basic math, I fuck myself in school. But it isn’t hard to relearn since it’s basic math. But just not centered around it.

1iv3qij,"I just can't be asked to ""learn"" anymore finance. Bite the bullet and make the switch?","I really don't know what I should do. I graduated in 2023 with a finance degree and as the best in the whole class. But literally I am just so disinterested in everything that is supposed to improve my career prospects. I had registered for February 2024 CFA Level 1, but cause of complete lack of interest, I did not study at all. Well, except ethics, because I found the stories interesting. Deferred to November 2024 with new motivation that this time I would actually study. Nothing changed. I open a book, a video, whatever it may be, and my brain checks out. I failed all topics. So now I thought that maybe financial modeling and valuation is my thing. I tried FMVA. I've spent over a month on a single topic. It just bores me to death.

I only did well in uni cause society expected it from me (family, friends, etc. I couldn't allow myself to fail). But now when no one is watching (cause no one knows I registered for CFA and FMVA), I couldn't care less. My brain is telling me I am in the wrong field, but sunk cost (6 years + a lot of money) is keeping me in finance. 

I wish I didn't listen to my dad and his friends and did Computer Science instead. All IT jobs in my country ask for an IT degree, even with certifications. If I go back, I'll graduate at 29. 29... I graduated finance when I was 23. Now I am jobless and miserable cause deep down I just hate it all. I don't even apply to jobs cause the JD's just look boring af. And even if I stay, improvement is depressing (the likes of CFA. CPA is even worse cause idk if I hate anything in this world more than accounting). I have no interest in this field. Is it even possible for one to be good at sth if they have absolutely no interest in it??

I already have a job offer from one of the WITCH companies as a backup cuz internship is not the one I will do its just college requirement, but I’ve realized that coding was never really my passion. I can complete tasks if there’s a deadline, but outside of that, I never practice DSA or feel motivated to code.

Recently, I got an opportunity for a sales role (business dev) with a much higher package. My long-term goal is to pursue an MBA and move into finance, marketing, or even entrepreneurship. I don’t see myself coding in the future—at most, I might consider data science or an analyst role.

Would it be a good idea to leave my current internship and take up the sales job? Even if I lose interest in sales after 6 months, I still have a tech job at WITCH company as a backup. Will sales experience help me in the long run for an MBA and business career, or should I stick with tech for now?

This has left him both with very little time for communication, and metrics that conflict with my group’s goals. 

Because of this unfilled position, and lack of a senior engineer in the other plant, I have yet to be able to work on my own stuff (that I was hired for) because he is using me and another coworker to put out fires in his new plant a thousand miles away. The VP above him seems disinterested in resolving the issue, and has put trust in my boss, so no use in going up the chain.

Anyone deal with this type of conflict? How did you resolve it? I like the company and my coworkers, but working on a plant I can hardly ever visit is driving me nuts. I have to be able to see what I’m working on.

1iuxq91,Lost in Career. Could use some real advice!,"Hello, 

  
I hope everyone is well! I am having a hard time making it in this current job market. Currently, I am working as a loan originator in training, and am getting paid a decent salary. However, the company I am working for is very unforgiving when it comes to human error. They have developed a system known as occurrences, and they are for lates, if you clock in or out too late, if you are two minutes over clock in/out period, if you get sick, if you have an emergency, any reason other than being a cookie cutter employee you will get an occurrence. If you rack up 7 of these, you are terminated, or you can accrue less and be terminated for their own reasons. I am having a very difficult time at this job and want to get into a new career. I ended up getting 5.5 because I lived almost 2 hours away at one point, and was late a few times because there were days when it would take me one hour to get there or two and a half. I moved closer to my job and am almost never late now thank god. 

However, the pressures this job has is becoming overwhelming. I'm almost 24, I have a BS in entrepreneurship, and am desperate to find a new job. I am currently making 65k per year, however that will get downed after the training period (which is one year and will end in July). Once we go into the actual position I will be taking a significant salary cut, and they have not given us any idea as to what our commission structure is going to be. They have some people who are supposedly making 400k and others that are making just above the base pay of 35k. With all of this instability, it is concerning, especially since I live alone and need to hold a consistent income. 

  
If any of you have any ideas or tips on how to find a new job, or where I can at least get started in changing careers with my degree, it would be a huge help! 

  
Thank you! ",JournalistNo4643,1,1.0,0,1740162075,2025-02-21 18:21:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iuxq91/lost_in_career_could_use_some_real_advice/,2,2025

If anyone knows retail, then you know that the hours are pretty much unstable. I know transfers can take a little while to process so I apply for other jobs in the meantime, so that I can still earn some kind of income. Just my luck, a temp agency that works with the city offers me a position at the same time that my transfer is complete. The position pays more, it's a full time 40 hour situation, but the problem is that it's a 1 month contract, with the POSSIBILITY that the city might keep me after the month is over. My dilemma is that, I'd love to take this job, but I also don't want to ditch the company I've been employed with for the past 5 years, especially now that I'm transferred to a whole different store. I feel like it would kind of be a bad first impression, especially after I met with the boss and kicked it off. He even gave me a raise from what I was making at my last store I was at.

1iuw4xb,Vacation time & Volunteer Vacation time? How to approach it at an offer?,"I am on the job hunt and I am trying to figure out how to balance my very important to me Volunteer lifestyle I have with my job. I hold I would say a mid-level type job as an architectural designer/project manager and that is the job type I am going after. Generally most places give you 2 weeks vacation and maybe 5 sick days. I am looking for 3 weeks vacation and a 1 week of ""community involvement"" I am not sure how to put it.

I had someone once tell me to be open about my community involvement and they may understand and give you that week off, probably not paid but it won't take from your vacation time. Has anyone ever dealt with this?

My community involvement is with a Local County Fair, I pretty much run the whole thing and yes it is all Volunteer. Its a 7 day fair, and I would leave work on a Friday head to the grounds for vendors and Amusements coming in, and take the following week off to run the fair. I am not complaining just painting a picture here, I run 18-20 hour days during that week and its non stop. Then come the following Sunday the fair would run till Midnight when I can close things up then have to go to work that Monday morning. So you can see it can be rough physically and mentally. I have very much done my best to separate the two so one would not effect the others work but it has gotten harder as I have gotten older and become more responsible at work (F30). I have been involved for 10 years or more with the fair and its a passion of mine and I do not plan to let it go. In the past I have used one of my 2 weeks of vacation for it and make it work but it gets hard. I also understand that unless you yourself are passionately involved in community volunteer organizations its hard for some to grasp and understand the slight insanity of it. One might think WHY? take that time and go to the beach, I mean yeah, but its what we joke about in the Fair industry and fair week is a ""high, a high off of being a master of 300 things at once and a passion for Community and Agriculture.

Anyways, I am job searching and I want to approach a new job with more transparency about my involvement but not make it a red flag. I would like to ask for an extra vacation week and somehow say its volunteer based so maybe there's a little more respect for it rather than them thinking I just want to go be drunk on a beach one extra week a year and they would be more willing to give it to me and understand when the time comes.

Anyone have a similar lifestyle? Anyone have experience with this, hiring or being hired? I know its a very small possibility but I am just trying to find the best way to approach it.

Option 1: I will ask them to postpone my joining date, so that I will join the internship/job role after last sem exams. So that I can complete my education properly. 
Option 2: I say that it's not a problem and tell them that I will require leaves for 2-3 weeks for finals, practical examinations, and Bachelors thesis defense. But in return I will get to work at an international company working remotely based out of Liverpool, United Kingdom.

I actually got this opportunity through my professor, and the professor connected me to one of the alumni working at the same company onsite in UK. So, they know that they are dealing with college students and that they have academic responsibilities.

I say this because I was invited to apply in October 2024 and they are conducting interview as part of the hiring process in Feb 2025, 4 months later!

1ius45c,Advice on pay,"Backstory before I ask for advice: I have worked at an early learning center for 4.5 years, started as an aid then assistant now and associate lead. I am qualified to be a lead teacher, however my center is religion based (not mandatory to be religious though) so I am not church qualified to lead since I live with my boyfriend which is viewed as a sin. They created my position, so I make between an assistant and lead teacher. 

I plan, and do activities as the other leads do. My lead teacher (whom I supposedly work under), but I do my own plans and such. I'm thinking of asking for a raise or to at least make the lead base pay since I'm doing all the work. I also found out today that an assistant teacher in another room is making lead pay doing assistant duties, and here I am doing lead duties not making that wage.

1iuqr5y,Can i leave content writing for good?,"I have almost 4 yrs of experience with it. 2 companies.

The first job became good at lot of things, master of none. I just learnt a lot by myself by trial and error. 

But. The second company burnt me the f out. A*hole people. Wanting to work 12 hr shifts. Giving weird ass feedback such as ""em dash"" is a mistake. Had to explain to a ""Co-founder"" what an em-dash is, which led to her giving negative feedback for every single draft since. (Family run business, no HR, get the drift?) 

Dealt with some people who have nothing to do with marketing, be given all power in marketing decisions, that messed up every campaign and then conviently blamed me. Cause I'm the marketing person????? (Favoritism for other teams) 

Don't even get me started on the toxic coworkers and bosses.Filled with interns who had an attitude problem and blatent sexism. I really regret joining the hole. 

It burnt me out so bad, by the end of it, I was staring at the doc, not having the willpower to work on the email, dreading my coworkers comments (they love office politics cause they have nothing else to do!), and dumb ass leadership according to whom everything can be done by AI within 15 min. 

Which Oh, didn't know AI spoke to SMEs, product teams, designers, designed content and uploaded content to CMS and other platforms, all by itself! You know who did all that? Me. 

An marketing email shouldn't take more than 15 min. Man. Do you know what competitor analysis means? Inspiration? What good subject lines are? Or even how much time it actually takes. No. Cause you were a consultant before you opened this crap show of a company. 

Hate that place. I still can't bring myself to care about writing with all these AI ass kissers (I'm not saying AI is bad, but the guys who think AI is a magic wand... Boom...done.)... 

On top of that working with coworkers who have their head up their *** and think they're holier than thou... And EVERYONE KNOWS MARKETING... Despite haven't worked directly on a single campaign. But straight up forcing me to do things I'm giving data stating it didn't work. Then saying it's my fault cause it didn't work. 

Man, I'm happy I left that place. 

But seeing jobs now.. Know coding and what not for literal writing jobs... Getting paid even less than minimum wage despite experience....I'm so fed up. No, I don't want to write your shitty assignment that you won't bother reading and ghost me. (Happened twice!) 

Should I leave this career? Is there anything ANYTHING else I can do with these skills that won't burn me even more. I think I'll burn myself with this. Or do you still think there are good writing jobs out there. 

Any other marketing people who can give me any advice. Please I'm so tired. ",AmbitiousExample888,1,1.0,0,1740144112,2025-02-21 13:21:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iuqr5y/can_i_leave_content_writing_for_good/,2,2025
1iuqlk1,Managers trying to convince me to quit..,"I left a job of 16 years based on what was layed out for me in the interview..

The job responsibilities have changed from customer focused to sales focused.

This is a rough draft of what I'm planning to send to HR..

I wanted to bring to your attention a conversation I had with manager on February 19, 2025, following our meeting with Delano Chevrolet. She asked me to meet her at Starbucks, where she began by questioning whether I was happy in my role, stating that I didn’t “look excited.” She then expressed doubts about my fit for the position and my personality, despite me being the same person I have always been.

As a new hire who has been with the company for less than two months, I am still learning and adjusting to the role. However, during our conversation, manager suggested that I consider asking for my old job back, quitting, or even going on disability, implying that I could “live off the government.” Additionally, she mentioned that management is concerned that I have not yet made a sale, despite the fact that the sales process has not been properly explained to me, nor have I received training in this area.

She also made comments about the owner, saying that if he contacts me, I should be scared, and that other salespeople are afraid of him as well. This came across as an intimidation tactic rather than constructive support.

I left the conversation feeling discouraged, as it seemed more focused on pushing me to resign rather than offering guidance or training to help me succeed in my new role. I wanted to formally document this experience and seek clarification on expectations, training opportunities, and how I can be best supported moving forward.

Please let me know if we can set up a time to discuss this further. I appreciate your time and guidance.

Advice?

I am crossed between 2 offers and can’t really decide which is the better option given the economy and long term growth. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Here are the 2 offers:
The first is Airgas for a Cylinder retest specialist and backup CDL driver. Pay is $25 an hour. 8 hour days with great hours. 6-2:30. Benefits are ok. 2 weeks vacation, 3.5% match on 401k. 5 days sick time. All the overtime I want. Job is very physical however and the company has shown signs of confusion and incompetence during the hiring process. 
Offer 2 is through the state of West Virginia. Human resource associate for the department of transportation. Pay is less. 37k a year. Good hours as well. 7-4:30. Tons of sick and vacation. Pension. Decent health insurance. Probably more room to move up and quicker. Also have the possibility of forgiving student loans since it’s a government public service job. 

Any advice or experience would be welcome. I have a family and I am thinking of a nice desk job now that I’m almost 40 with a few surgeries and miles on my body. I also have a bachelors in accounting with my MBA and am currently enrolled in a software engineering program. If that helps any.

1iupexp,Hiring Bias at Fidelity Investments? My Shocking Interview Experience,"**TL;DR: I had a concerning interview experience with Fidelity Investments, which raised questions about potential hiring bias.**

I recently interviewed for a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role at Fidelity Investments in Jersey City, New Jersey (hybrid role), arranged through Eliassen Group, a professional and diligent third-party recruitment agency. However, my experience with Fidelity's interview panel raised serious concerns about hiring practices.

**Key Takeaways from My Interview Experience:**

•⁠  ⁠The panel consisted entirely of individuals of South Asian descent.

•⁠  ⁠Interviewers arrived late, skipped introductions, and interrupted me mid-introduction.

•⁠  ⁠They appeared disengaged, did not ask meaningful follow-up questions, and cut the interview short, preventing me from showcasing my experience.

•⁠  ⁠At the end of their questioning, the lead interviewer abruptly ended the meeting without offering me an opportunity to ask questions. A fellow interviewer had to intervene, and when I was finally given a chance, the lead interviewer provided short, dismissive responses.

•⁠  ⁠During the interview, it became apparent that the SRE team was overwhelmingly composed of individuals from the same national background, with nearly half of the team based in India.

**Broader Implications: Is Fidelity's Hiring Process Merit-Based?**

This experience made me question whether Fidelity's hiring process is genuinely based on merit or if certain demographics are being favored. My LinkedIn research revealed a significant overrepresentation of \[specific demographic group\] in Fidelity's technical roles. With growing scrutiny of DEI policies in both the private and public sectors, transparency in hiring is more important than ever.

Has anyone else had a similar experience with Fidelity or other financial institutions?

**Taking Action: EEOC Complaint & Industry-Wide Accountability**

I have formally filed an EEOC complaint to investigate potential hiring bias. If you've had similar experiences, please share them. Let's work together to advocate for fair and inclusive hiring practices in the tech industry.

1iuoejl,Studied Radio-Television-Film and looking for future paths,"Hi, as I said I have a degree in Radio-Television-Film from the University of Texas. Since graduating 3 years ago, I've been fortunate enough to work a number of different roles but not all entirely related to my degree.

I was in a remote marketing role for a year and during that time I traveled to 23 different countries and now I am an English teacher in Spain completing an 8 month program. Travel is truly my greatest love, and I have a travel website with my photography and information that I share about trips, but obviously this is not something I've made money from so it's technically a hobby.

I'll be honest, I don't know what I want to do still, but it's definitely not be a teacher. The film industry is difficult and truthfully I don't want to live in the US, but maybe that necessary to get my footing. 

My dream was always working with National Geographic, Condé Nast Travel, or another major Travel publication where I could create content.

  
I am interested in more school, and I've always considered myself a creative so a stable job in this sector would be wonderful. I'm a little lost truthfully, because I want to follow my passions, but also I just want a stable career heading into such an turmoils economy and digital age.

1iuoacz,Just got rejected after months of waiting—feeling lost and frustrated,"I applied for a position in a National Government Agency (NGA) here in the Philippines. For context, I’m a fresh graduate and a licensed psychometrician. I also have training in business analytics, gender sensitivity, resiliency basics, and media and information literacy. As for experience, I did my OJT in HR (corporate) and education.

As expected, the hiring process was multi-phased. I passed all the initial stages and was eventually invited to a unit head evaluation and panel interview. The interview went great—I highlighted my training and OJT experience, and the panelists even complimented my skill set. What was supposed to be a 20- to 30-minute interview lasted for an hour. They even discussed which position suited me best since I applied for three similar entry-level positions (SG 10 and SG 11), none of which required prior experience or training. We even talked about the organization’s shuttle service and workplace culture.

At the end of the interview, they repeated my name as if testing how it sounded, and then they said, ""HR na ang bahala sa’yo, tatawagan ka na lang ng HR."" I took that as a good sign. I genuinely thought I did well, so I waited. I even turned down other government agencies I had applied to since I was already in the final stages here.

I waited for a month, debating whether I should follow up. Just when I was about to send an email, I received an update saying I was rejected for all three positions because I ""did not meet the required passing rate.""

I wasn’t being complacent—I trusted myself and had faith in my performance. But this still feels like a slap in the face. If I wasn’t what they were looking for, I wish they had just been straightforward about it instead of sugarcoating. I could have handled it better if I knew exactly what qualifications they were prioritizing.

I still have pending applications in other government agencies, but honestly, I’m losing the drive. I’m now considering looking for jobs in private companies instead. I graduated in July 2023, took a break to recalibrate what I wanted to do, passed my board exam in August 2024, and started job hunting in September 2024. I faced some rejections before the year ended, and now it’s already 2025. I don’t want to be jobless anymore.

I don’t have a strong support system—just my mom, who has always believed in me. I feel like I disappointed her. My relatives are probably laughing at me, saying ""I told you so,"" because they kept urging me to apply to private companies. But back then, I really wanted to work in the government.

Now, I just feel lost. I don’t have a solid backup plan, and this whole experience is frustrating.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

1ium6xu,Need a little help understanding the admission process and options after commerce in 12th please,"Hey guys a little long read but it would be so helpful to get some input. So my younger brother is currently writing his 12th board exams in commerce and is still very confused what he wants to do for college. He's leaning towards B.com (actually only because he doesn't know what he should do) but what is the best colleges? What is the process for admission? What forms and exams ? We are all confused 
So I am doctor and have NO clue about anything commerce related , neither does anyone in our family as he was the first one to opt for commerce in a long lineage of engineers and I can feel that he is lost. 
Hes an average student who took up commerce without math so Im not really sure what his options are. 
My father still has the classic idea of ""B.com then MBA"" and I'm sure that's not all that there is. My father is the least bothered in researching the colleges and the process , my mother is just angry at my father , I feel lost and it feels like my brother's future is at stake because of our lack of knowledge and trying. So I want to try for him. 
So please suggest some good colleges for B.com and a little bit of the process too!! And if there's any good resources or other courses please lmk

TLDR : Younger brother is confused what to go for after 12th in commerce, my entire family is slacking and not helping him out , we are all unaware of the process and courses, So I've decided to start some research and help him out.

Tuesday interview Now confused what to do? I will go for that interview. And ministry role ad closed on next Friday which is after 7 days. I have interview with perfume after 4 days. Now my concern is increasing salary. What should I do? Actually it is obvious that workload will be high in private company for sure. my concern of leaving this role is mostly learning. The thing that we do is not data analysis! So, how should I negotiate for each. Private can go maybe till 100k. Ministry always you know prefer to pay the least but of course negotiate matter. No junior in that role so maybe really can push highest. But when and how should I do?

It was my failure because I should have taken sick leave but I was not even aware about my condition (in spite of my direct supervisors knowing about some of my symptoms). 

I don't know how to continue. I don't feel myself capable of working anymore. I will run out of savings soon. I should start looking for a job but I don't have the energy and I don't know where to start. After I got told I was going to get hired I invested a lot of energy, money, time into getting better, having that job opportunity, and it all had a negative outcome because the evaluation period was before and not when my performance improved. That made my hopelessness and suic thoughts skyrocket.

Now I don't think it would be adequate to write that experience in my resume. I don't feel I want to send my resume because if they call me for an interview should I tell them all my diagnosis - with all the shame and feelings involved? If I don't would I be lying? I know I will sometimes be incapable of working in person rather than from home, I know there is going to be weeks that it's going to be impossible to get out of bed. Should I tell them? 

I don't feel the energy of being treated poorly, neglected, insulted or any 0,1 % of abuse, I don't have the energy to face that. I don't want to put myself in that situation but at the same time I should get an income because otherwise I'll end up homeless.

I'm not thinking anymore about working in the same field which destroys me and makes me feel extremely hopeless. I just want to stop suffering. I have done too many mistakes in my past and going to therapy didn't help. I am tired and I don't have energy to continue.

1iulnip,What are some high paying job options for someone like me [Econ/Engineering]?,"Hello! I am a 27F looking for some career advice.

A little background on me: I have worked as an analyst and as an associate software engineer in the past. However, I would say that only my last job as an analyst (in US for 2 years) gave me real work experience. In terms of education, I have a bachelors in electronics engineering (not something I want to pursue) and a masters in economics (only 8 months). 

Moving on to my skillset, in my role as an analyst, I used tableau, sql, excel, alteryx and ppt. My role wasn’t well defined but it required working on different projects as needed. 

Now I have realised I am good at learning new/complicated skills, and working hard. In terms of expectations, I want to work in a high paying job/field and commit to building a career in a specific field. 

Currently I have taken a break from my work (there were some valid reasons to do so) and I want to take this opportunity to refine my path. 

Any advice/comments are welcome!!! I am down for a 1:1 call as well. Thank you!!

What would you do if you just started a new job - and then got a much higher paying opportunity with a team you’ve already worked with in the past and loved?

I’d feel an incredible amount of guilt leaving my new role because I just joined and then also just found out my boss is going on mat leave soon and me leaving will cause her a huge amount of stress and difficulty. It’s a small company and she’d have to scramble to hire someone new and train them. 

I also got this job through networking so all of that combined I just feel like this would be horrible of me.

1iujxxp,Having a hard time navigating a team with no structure..,"I've just joined a new team 6 months ago and since then I've been put on several projects with no real structure. I came from a developer background and but haven't been assigned any coding work at all. I've spoken to my lead and manager about this but it's useless. The bulk of developer work is owned by a contractor and he's been saying he will get me on but never show up to meeting, never assign me any stories even though he said he will, and he keeps rescheduling meetings. We're supposed to be ""agile"" but only have 2 stand up a week and people don't even show up. 

For the past 4 months, I've been put on several POC work which is literally just a feature my PO create on a whims with no real requirement. Think ""create an ai"" and left me to run around and chase people for requirements and value on why this is something we need. I can't seem to understand corporate lingo and I've literally been having chatgpt analyze my PO's requests because he keep jumping all over the place, telling me to talk to this and that team. Whenever I report back, it's like he doesn't even remember it and keep asking me for the same thing. One time, he scheduled a meeting with a team I've talked to and ask them all the same questions that I've already reported back and sent him answers too. It makes me feel like there is no point in my work and they're just having me do things on a whim because ""there may be a need"" and ""we will be the first team to do it"". 

All my past teams, we had very clear stakeholders and requirements so I never had to question any user story assigned to me. On this team, they assign me a full feature with only the title filled out and I AM EXPECTED to create my own user stories and populate the feature. It's insane.

I know the job market is crazy right now so leaving is not a good option but is there a quick way for me to get better at understanding business talk and POC?

1iujhyy,Managing a nepo hire,"So recently I have been tasked with overseeing a female intern in addition to my other responsibilities. My company is a ""wE weAR MaNy hAtS hEre"" company, aka the responsibilities have become spread around among the managers because we are understaffed. I am also a female, perhaps a year or two older than this gal, and I think part of the issue is that she sees us as peers rather than me as her manager. She never interviewed with me, she apparently expressed to our CEO (who is a family member) that she wants to do what my department does, and objectively speaking, she clearly does not have the skillset or talent for it. So I got stuck with her.

She comes to my office and yaps nonstop about the silliest things. She often shirks the day-to-day tasks that our team gives her, and she has literally told me that she spends her 1-hr breaks which often bleed into 2-hrs at Lululemon and ZARA. I once asked her to run an errand that was time-sensitive for our department, she disappeared for hours, and came back saying she stopped at the outlet mall on the way to buy some clothes. 

If this internship was just for the semester I would definitely just brush it off, give her things here and there to do, and collect my paycheck. However, she has made it very clear that she wants to stay on when she graduates this semester. I don't really know how to work with her or manage her. I have always had a part in the hiring process of my department's former interns, so I knew that they all had good work ethic, could take constructive feedback, or at least had some desirable qualities. But seeing as this was not the case with her, I am at a loss of what to do because I am afraid that if I check her on her behavior I will get in trouble with my boss and CEO for not playing along.

She has negatively impacted our overall efficiency and also my workplace morale. I've sent notes to my VP with receipts expressing my concerns but I fear it's fallen on deaf ears and they just want to be agreeable and accommodating to her, and her family member. I want to speak up and get things to change with her, but the above factors make it feel daunting because it feels like I'm in this alone, and my other managers are also afraid of speaking out for the same reason. It's been so draining and discouraging that I actually have been passively looking for other jobs in the field that interest me. I really don't want to quit because I love what I do, but the office dynamics with her and the CEO and my boss who just wants to be agreeable and wants me to play ball has made me reconsider things.

1iuirwh,Toxic? Culture,"2yrs experience at well known BB bank. I’m getting a little thrown off by the culture at this point.

- It can seem like people just debate on subjective day-to-day decisions to prove their intelligence. 

- High level conversations are clicky. I thought this would eventually change and I’d feel approved of, but nope, if you aren’t in, it doesn’t matter what value you can add. I actually feel tempted to contribute to these conversations out of feeling left out, where my motivation should be from wanting to help.

- I can’t tell if it’s because I’m young or if I’m just taking things too personally but whenever I ask a question, I feel things are explained to me as if I know nothing at all. Maybe I expect they’re paying more attention than they are, but still, it’s almost insulting at times.

I am learning a lot, I just need a better game plan on how to navigate this culture. It kind of sucks at times and I blame the people and their insecurities. Maybe I just need to keep my head down and accept the reality.

1iui2ok,"Pivot, stay, or move?","28m HCOL

I've been in banking three years as of this month with the same bank. I went from Teller, to Personal Banker in my first 6 months and since September of 2024 I've moved to a Commercial Relationship Specialist role(I make sure we have all required documentation and collateral perfected on loans, Im not a relationship manager). I've also been enrolled in School for a Bachelors in Accounting that I'll either graduate from in Jan or June 2026.

Despite getting 2 promotions in 3 years, my wage hasnt reflected it. In 2023 I made $43,795 and in 2024 I made $43,584. Currently my wage is $43,992 a year. I think the discrepancy is i got overtime on retail side, but no longer receive that on the commercial side.

When I made the switch over to commercial i asked for around 55,000 which i was denied. They offered me 43,992 and i took it because i thought it would be a good move and great exposure. A good first step into commercial banking so to speak. Also, my current boss said that he could probably get a 10% raise for me pretty quickly during the interview(this never happened, they're new to his role so i dont entirely blame them). My boss also wants me to finish my degree before promoting me to Underwriter(we've hired and lost 3 Underwriters since September). At this rate i feel like I'm running in place in terms of wage. I cant afford to keep getting paid this little. I live in a rural area, but an average 1 bed 1 bath rental is $1200+ its almost cheaper to move to the nearest big city, plus there would be tons more opportunity. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I have a few friends who make double to triple my wage(some working from home). I'm glad for them but they're out doing what they want in life and I'm stuck making crap pay for a stressful job. I'm not even getting enough money a year to compete with inflation. 

I've considered getting insurance licenses and pivoting out of banking completely, because if you stick with it you can make good money at the right agencies. I've also considered reaching out to local CPAs to see if they need an intern. 

Ideally i want to move to a bigger city, but in order to do that i need to make around 55-60k and it seems impossible without a degree.

What should i do? Pivot out of banking? Move to big city and take my chances on finding a job that pays 55k or more? 

Also, am I getting screwed on pay?

I feel that I have reached the ceiling in my teaching career, and I do not foresee significant salary progression in the future. As such, I am seriously considering a career change.

However, I am mindful of the fact that my lifestyle is already aligned with my current salary, and I would like to know if it’s feasible to transition into a new career while maintaining a similar income level. Would it be realistic to pursue a new career path with my current salary as a base, and what steps or sectors would you recommend for someone with my background?

Anyway, I graduated high school in 2023 without a clear idea of what I wanted to do, so I decided to take some gap years to figure it out. Over time, I’ve considered a lot of different careers photography, medicine, forensic science, veterinary work, hairstyling, makeup artistry, fashion design but I still don’t know what’s right for me. I’ve always had a good eye for color and beauty, and I really enjoy working with my hands. Creativity has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, whether it’s painting, sculpting, working with clay, or just doing DIY projects. When I was younger, I loved creating things like that, and I still do. Last summer, I had a design job where I got to sew and create clothing. It was a place for people to explore creativity and tell stories through their work, and at the end of the program, we showcased what we made. That experience, along with my love for upcycling and sewing at home, made me think about attending FIT. I’ve been sewing since I was a kid just for fun, and I always enjoyed making clothes. But suddenly, I lost interest in pursuing fashion design.

Cooking and baking are other things I’ve loved for years, so I thought about going to culinary school. I even applied but decided not to follow through. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I could teach myself a lot through YouTube, and I didn’t need formal schooling for it.

For a while, I considered becoming a doctor, not because I was passionate about it but because it seemed like a safe option. I love helping people, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t the right fit. I also thought about working with kids who have special needs, but I’m still unsure. I have so many interests, but I don’t know which one to pursue.

Right now, I’m into doing nails, but the competition is tough, and I feel like I’m already behind. I’ve even thought about making press on nails, but I can’t shake the doubt of whether it’s something I can turn into a real career. I just feel stuck like time is passing me by, and I’m not making progress. I know I have time, but it still feels like I’m wasting it. All I really know is that I love working with my hands. I just don’t know where to go from here. It’s like I like something and when I get to it I lose interest so quickly and give up. I just wanna be happy.

1iug5s9,"Mental health, productivity, and a dismissive boss","First off I want to give a **trigger warning** that I will be discussing poor mental health, depression, and the opposite of living... I hope this is allowed. Also this is a throwaway account

So for the past year or so my mental health has   taken a nosedive down. I am in therapy and on medication. I have diagnosed anxiety, depression, and ADHD.  I have basically no motivation. Everyday is a struggle to drag myself bout of bed. By the time I get home I'm so exhausted, physically and mentally, that I just crash in bed. Life just feels like a chore and I'm really tired of it.

Along with my mental health my work productivity has decreased a lot. I work a desk job, but I am making more mistakes, getting less done than my co-workers, and it's hard to keep up. I know it is my mental health causing this. I've worked in this job for 3 years and the first 2 years were not this hard. I love my job and the people I work with.

Around middle of November last year my boss called me into her office and said that my work output was completely unacceptable and she put me on a improvement plan for 90 days. In that time I have been doing more/better work but at the expense of my mental health and it's getting to the point where I don't know how much I can keep this up. Life isn't enjoyable anymore and what is the point of doing any of this job or anything at all.

My boss has been having me come in for weekly meetings to talk about everything I've done each week. So in these meetings I have tried SO many times to explain my problems and that I really am trying but it's just hard. She has always been easy to talk to, understanding, and like a friend, but since this started she is extremely condescending, dismissive, and just mean. She recently told me that I ""have no more than anyone else"" when we were talking about my depression. I cried at my desk after that because I just felt so belittled. 

Like I want to be extremely blunt with her and say that I don't want to be alive anymore and there's no point in anything so why try. I want to scream it in her face that I literally want to kill myself and see how serious she takes me then. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I know I am not in a good place so please do not preach to me about that.

I am ok with hybrid but only for time being while they hire someone for this Y role + as I upskill at a few areas of X role.

I have a call next week, how do I communicate that I want them to continue looking for people for this Y position because I can only help out temporary? And that I won't be happy with it being longterm? 

Is 1 month a good time to revisit this structure? 
What do I need to ask and be prepared to discuss?

I want to be asolutely clear that this was not the role I was hired for. I was very clear in the interview that I don't know certain aspects of X but that I am a quick learner. 
They are okay with me upskilling but there isn't too much time right now to take the courses etc as there is too much workload. 
So I also want to make sure that I have time for those things so that I am set up for success. 

Have any of you gone through this? What helped you the most to stay in your current role?

1iuetk0,I don’t know what to do.,"I graduate university in October with a degree in Cybersecurity and Information assurance. (Aka. I was scammed into thinking I made a good choice.) I fell for the hype and didn’t do my research. And now I’m graduated with a a degree and a stack of certifications. And I can’t even get an interview for help desk, unless I take some bottom of the barrel slave wages job offer. I worked full time and studied full time in order to earn my degree .I sacrificed so much of my time, energy and money. I also attended 2 tech boot camps. Now there’s no jobs. This job market is so fucked right now, and probably going to be way worse with government layoffs on top of all of the other layoffs and RTO mandates. I feel like trying to work in tech was a serious mistake.

1iuee68,Career progression and unrelated job,"Hello all. My career pathway has been in marketing and I’ve tried looking but I’m getting to a point where I think it’s probably time to take a sufficiently paying opportunity while I keep looking. 

I’ve got an opportunity that is in operations. If I were to go down this path it would make sense to be a General Manager or Chief of Staff. I know how to do the job. I’ve done some operations or marketing ops roles or projects before. But this would not be marketing focused at all. 

Some questions:
- How might one shift back to Marketing from this? Would it be via a role downgrade “to get back on the horse”? I’m at a Head/Lead level at the moment.
- Would it be more worth it to go after downgrade jobs now and lower my bar for the sake of staying within marketing? 
- If I did downgrade either way, how would I get back up?

It’s just tough job hunting, and I need to be a bit more practical now.

1iudxdh,Pick my career!,"Context:
- 24F
- Completing an HR degree, will graduate early 2026
- Working as a legal assistant (5 years of experience)
- Live 1.5 hours away from a major city in Canada (born here)
- Not willing to move
- No student loan debt, but planning on taking loans and reducing work hours for future education


Goals:
- Want no more than 4 years of further studies, preferably less
- Want to earn 100k+ salary and have ample growth opportunities
-Would be preferable if it is a position that I could later on switch to part time
- Want a high likelihood for success after completing studies 

Options:

Sticking with Human Resources:
I don't care for my studies and don't know if I'll care for the actual work of HR professionals. I'm also not sure how attainable high paying positions in this field are in practice. I also want to pursue further studies to get a job that pays more.

Lawyer:
I think I'd be able to succeed in this job because of my experience but I don't have a passion for it and feel pretty neutral about it. I don't have a desire to open my own business, I think if successful it can fund the lifestyle I want, and I think it's something I'm capable and would be OK doing. 

Engineer: 
I was successful in Maths and Sciences in highschool and think this would be an interesting field to work in. I am not sure yet what engineering field I'd be interested in but I think it would likely be electrical, mechanical, or perhaps geological(?) I heard the job market at the moment isn't the best though and don't know the accuracy of that.

Medical: 
Not for me unless it's pharmacy but it would take too long to get the prerequisites and degree

Masters in Business:
Not sure what to specialize in and don't know my options, but I would only want to do this if I have a high likelihood of attaining a high paying position with job security after completion.

Others:
If you know any other careers that might be a good fit let me know! Also would love to know about any Masters that are unrelated to Business that I can get!

1iud3kq,Blackballed from an industry I love?!,"Would love to hear people’s opinions and advice on this, please! 

I feel like I’ve been blackballed from an industry I’ve adored working in over the last 6ish years and fear I may have to start again…
Some context - I started out in said industry as a junior, I had a lot of transferable skills which I brought along with me (a degree for starters and a few years work experience in the same sector). The role itself was totally new to me as was the industry but I very quickly cottoned on and by year 5 I felt I had progressed significantly and was ready for the next step (title and salary) unfortunately however after asking for a promotion for a little over a year (I explicitly asked what objectives I needed achieve in order to get the promotion, which btw didn’t exist, as in we were a completely new team to the business so there was no obvious role to step in to, however very much besides the point given members in my team were already on their 3rd/4th promotion) The other sidenote to consider here is I was the only one doing this role - in EMEA. Anyway pressures of cost of living, imposter syndrome and all sorts forced me to move on for more money and a clearer path for progression, HOWEVER I then found myself in one of the most toxic work environments, my manager was so nasty and I was let go during my probation. I then moved on to a temp role which went well. After the temp role I found a permanent role, which despite receiving a “concerning” reference from the aforementioned toxic workplace they took me on. It was more money and a promotion (title) which I was obviously delighted about…but then the cracks started to show. I was in effect reliving that toxic environment all over again. Micromanaging - reading and correcting every single email I wrote, saying one thing verbally but in emails saying something totally different, undermining any suggestions I made,  excluding me from meetings, having meetings behind my back with clients I prospected…..it was eggshells everyday and everyday I felt crippling anxiety I was starting to have mild panic attacks! In any case I also lost that job during my probation. Half a year later I’m still unemployed and have not managed to get back into the same field (or any job for that matter). The trouble is the industry is very big yet very small, it’s quite niche so indeed everyone knows everyone and people move around hence my fear of having been blackballed! I desperately need a job because as we all know cost of living is in crisis mode but at the same time I’m very career driven and I’m one of those with “by this time I want to be this earning this” people, I’m quite peeved that this has happened because I loved what I did and but for the egotistical managers I ended up with I’d be thriving! And yes I have self reflected, not everything is everyone else’s fault so I have indeed extracted learnings from the two situations to avoid this happening again anywhere else.

So I guess my question is what do I do now, if indeed I have been blackballed and need to pivot how should I go about it? I’m mid 30s and in a creative industry (womp womp), I have considered doing a masters to give me a bit more practice - but £10k+ fees and yet another year out when I was on the trajectory sounds daunting. How easy is it to start again? Some people I’ve spoken to have said they worry the roles they have to offer are too junior and won’t fulfil my ambitions - true that may be I have to put ambitions aside and concentrate on not losing my house or my mind!!  

This is the most haphazard text I’ve written lol but it’s just a brain dump, happy to give more context where I can! P.s - please be kind.",toughcookie1234,4,1.0,1,1740095236,2025-02-20 23:47:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iud3kq/blackballed_from_an_industry_i_love/,2,2025

1iuciwt,I've Hit A Ceiling and Am Burnt Out,"Hello everyone.

I am an elite level strength and conditioning coach working with athletes at every level, and am typically working with professional sport athletes.  Most of my expertise is in working with elite level military and first responders. 

The company I work for is a private organization, and over the past 2 years or so, my responsibilities have been taken away-some due to decisions by leadership to absorb those responsibilities themselves, and also because I am unwilling to travel to benefit my child-it was getting to be too much.

However, now those choices have led to me working with populations I have little interest in, and I see no path forward (upward?) past it.  I am actually doing the same thing I was when I started in this field 10 years ago, and as such I'm really frustrated.

  
I am frustrated because working in this organization has given me a body of work that most in the field would envy-I've done incredible things and worked with incredible organizations.  My resume is ridiculous.  However, I am very much a generalist in that I have a good amount of knowledge in all fields, but am a master of none, save for physical preparation, which is hyper competitive.

  
I will likely be leaving the field soon.  I am unsure what to do as coaching has been such a big part of my life.  I am considering going back to school, but really don't want to 'make a move' until I know the discipline I choose will lead  to mental fulfillment and happiness, and also pay well.  I have a decent job, but everyone wants it, and as such the pay is abysmal.

  
I've tried meeting with other leaders in the company but it seems that there are no new roles opening up soon-they're in a hiring freeze and I suspect layoffs are coming soon.

  
I look forward to hearing back.  I am frankly miserable and disappointed that I've hit this hard of a ceiling.  To be one of the best but not be able to do anything with that expertise is disheartening.",Ellocomotive,1,1.0,3,1740093658,2025-02-20 23:20:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iuciwt/ive_hit_a_ceiling_and_am_burnt_out/,2,2025

We have projects back where I’m from and she’s even brought them up as if she’s egging me on to join those projects.

1iuax39,What career path should I choose?,"Hey everyone, I am currently 21 years old and fairly close to finishing my post secondary education in business. My family owns a small company in the trades and have always been able to put food on the table and pay the mortgages. I have worked for them off and on for about 5 years so I have plenty of experience in this industry. Now, the big debate I have been battling with for the past couple years is whether or not I should get an apprenticeship in this trade or look for something related to my major. I think in the back of my head I expect to find some perfect dream job that will have zero cons. With how things are going in the job market and with AI taking over so many jobs I worry about my future and am already having a tough time finding internships and don't want to have to worry about job security for the rest of my life.

I am fairly confident in my skills and believe that with my schooling and experience in this particular trade that once I were to finish an apprenticeship I would be able to make good money in this career by working in the family business. However, that would require growing the business and obviously there is no guarantees there.

I think what I am starting to realize is that there's no job that exists that is perfect and that I will wake up excited for everyday. Every job will drain me in some capacity. This particular trade has some very easy days as well as some soul crushing days, but I always found it easy to get off work and enjoy the rest of my day. Its also important to note that this industry is basically recession proof as well.

I guess my big question is what would everyone here do if they were in my shoes. As I have not only limited life experience being so young but also zero experience in any job related to my field of study. I feel as though it may be a grass is greener on the other side scenario.",Ok_Help_3902,1,1.0,1,1740089434,2025-02-20 22:10:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iuax39/what_career_path_should_i_choose/,2,2025

I started at the bottom and spent the past four years earning my stripes, learning and refining my hospitality career. I enjoy what I do I want to learn and do more. I’ve developed a passion and love for Hospitality (it’s incredibly natural for me, and I’m really good at it too), but I don’t know what to do next. The restaurant I work at offered me a management position last year and I declined, because it meant spending more time in a place that I’m not interested in staying at for longer than necessary (it’s not sustainable - 12 hour shifts, never seeing family and not having a life outside of that). 

I don’t know what or where to go next. I love hospitality but I don’t know how to develop my career further? How high can you go after working at a 3 Starred Michelin restaurant?

1iu9kza,Should I make the job swap or stay at my current company?,"I am currently working an IT job in California and making $76,000 a year after recently getting a raise at my current company. I'm getting 4 weeks of PTO+10 Sick days that can basically be used as PTO so 6 weeks in total. I am fully remote in this position, so my original plan was to try and get as much as I can and save up for a few years while I live with my parents and then relocate to a cheaper state/area since my job will let me keep my salary after moving as well and then get a Townhouse etc. I recently got an offer for another company for $84,200 a year and then after a year I will be getting profit sharing that should be about $4-8k on top of my base. I would mostly be remote like 98% of the time but they want me to visit some places every now and then around where I currently live. So at least for now I would be stuck living around where I am in California which is very expensive(although in either option I was planning on staying around here anyways to save up) but there might be an opportunity in a couple years where I could convince them to let me move. This new company only gives 3 weeks of PTO and that never increases or anything with tenure, I might be able to negotiate to 4 weeks of PTO since they are a pretty small company. Not really sure which option is better, I'm not really tied too hard to California but I do have family here so in an ideal world it would be nice to live here but if I can't live comfortably I would rather go somewhere else. The benefits are pretty much all the same as well between them other then PTO. My current position is also very cozy, I pretty much know all the issues and my manager is very nice where as the new job would definitely be more stress. However if I take the new job I'd be able to save up quite a bit more in the couple years for a down payment on a place once I move out and if I am able to keep it would be very nice if I live some where the cost of living is lower and I'm sure the stress would go down after a bit and I get used to the role.

I've always been a computer nerd and really into IT-related stuff, building computers, diagnosing network issues, setting up scripts for devices, etc and I recently took a practice test for a Comptia A+ certification and scored a 70% w/ my current knowledge. Granted, it wasn't an exhaustive test by any means and obv I would need to study hella to make up for my gaps in skills between these two industries, but it got me thinking more about IT as a career and I'm looking to ask the community here if switching into IT would make any sense right now? Does it make sense to switch from being a software engineer to IT? Would it be any better trying my luck in IT than my applications in the tech/software industry? Any advice appreciated !!

1iu844t,"Laid Off, Advice on CyberSecurity / Coding Bootcamp or Online Certifications","Hey everyone, I (26M) got laid off back in October from an IT Project Manager Role in tech. I went on a 2 month vacation around Asia, and I just got back in the middle of January. It's been about a month into job searching and I've applied to 20 jobs, 7 rejections, 7 no response back, 1 failed interview, and the rest are still pending. I'm looking for roles in Project/Program/Product Management, Solution Consulting/Engineering, or even break into sales. As I lay out my options, I was also thinking about taking a bootcamp or do one of the google certifications.

There's a 12 week bootcamp I was taking a look at that can either do cybersecurity or coding. With how SWE job market is right now, I was leaning towards cybersecurity more. The market is so bad, and I wanna make use of my time and learn something. There's also free certifications on Google, and thinking about doing the Data Analyst one. 

I guess my questions are:

1. Are Bootcamps still relevant in today's market? Are they worth it?

2. Am I just catastrophizing my situation and just grasping any opportunity because of how bad the market is right now? 

3. Should I keep going with applying to jobs instead WHILE doing Certifications?

Would love to get some opinions around this situation, as I don't like sitting around doing nothing and feeling unproductive.

1iu70st,Have a feeling I might lose my job. Don't know what to do next.,"For context, I (24M) work as an Investment Analyst for an RIA. It's my first job out of college and In a week I'll have been here for exactly a year. 

Earlier this week I made a big mistake in which I accidentally leaked potential proprietary information from one of our partners. They told me vaguely that they're in the process of switching archiving vendors for a service we want to get set up with. I thought this meant something else and I sent an email to a service company that's partnered with our partner. I soon learned that I may have just told them that they're going to be dropping their business. 

In a position where attention to detail is paramount in ever aspect, i feel like I really messed up here by making this oversight. 

Today, I noticed that one of my coworkers that I would consider a friend has been acting weird. Very serious instead of lighthearted and is starting to do some aspects of my role for me.

1iu5jl3,"Given a new role 4 months ago, but STILL waiting on official title and raise","I’ve been working for this company for over 2.5 years now. This is my first career oriented job after college. After 2 years, I pretty much mastered my role, while taking on various projects and challenges that no one else wanted, to gain experience. My boss, who I had a great relationship with, got promoted. Got a new boss who I ended up really liking as well. I ended up getting more work and was starting to feel like I deserved a new role/promotion. 

Around 5 months ago, my old boss (my new boss’s manager) started to have me work on a project that was completely new to the company. Only him and I knew anything about the project, i had no previous knowledge or training of the work. Slowly I started to take on more and more work of the project. My previous responsibilities were passed over to another employee. 

At first, the new work was pretty stressful and confusing. But now I’ve got it pretty streamlined, still it’s pretty confusing and I feel like I’m the most knowledgeable on the subject at my company. 

After working on this new job for a month, I started to get resentful, since I had taken on more responsibilities, yet I had a title that didn’t match the work at all and also had no raise. I felt underpaid. So I started applying to other jobs. I had a couple interviews lined up. 

On the last day of work before Christmas break, my boss and his boss (my former boss) told me they’d get me a new title and raise. They said it’d be a new position for the company, so they’d have to work with HR. It was a relief because I had grown very resentful and was doing less work due to my frustration. They didn’t tell me the specific title. 

It’s been two months since then. I’ve been told a few times that HR is still working on things, that everything is set on my manager’s end. I went on an international trip with my boss’s boss last month regarding my new role. A week ago he told me that we’re a “day or two” away from having everything straightened out. Still nothing. Meanwhile, I had a long interview with another company a couple days ago. It sounds like I’ll get a job offer soon, hopefully with my desired salary, which would be 15% higher. 

I don’t want to leave this company because I like it and I like the people i work with. I like my bosses. But I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I’m house shopping so this raise would be great right now. If I left this company, there’d be a pretty big hole since no one knows how to do my job. 

Not sure why I’m posting this. I guess I’m ranting or looking for words of advice/encouragement. Fun stuff. Thanks",Efficient-Bus-1272,2,1.0,7,1740076187,2025-02-20 18:29:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iu5jl3/given_a_new_role_4_months_ago_but_still_waiting/,2,2025

Don’t judge me please. 
19F, sophomore year of college pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Psychology.
Although, I have no idea what the hell I want to do with it. Currently, I work as a daycare teacher from 8-5 and I’m able to save at least a little bit, but the pay isn’t incredible.
I have really no idea why I’m getting this degree considering I don’t know what I’m doing with it at all long term. I’d like to do HR, but honestly I just want to make money while I’m pursuing music.
What I will say, is I used to do musical theatre and show choir in high school.
Not to say I peaked there, but I fell in love with it all. I’ve been TRYING to write songs, but I can barely play any instruments so obviously this is not easy.
I live in a college town, but I want to move to CA. My partner is a pharmacy technician but is in the college of pharmacy at her school right now. 
I know I probably sound so stupid, but I feel so lost and need guidance BIG TIME. I also am not able to speak with my mother, and my dad is not good about these things (he thinks it’s a terrible idea for me to pursue music school so I didn’t.)

1iu4z7w,Should I approach my boss's boss?,"Hey everyone, 

I'm feeling stuck in a difficult position at work, and I'm not sure how to proceed from here. I work in Marketing (demand generation specifically, which is in charge of bringing new leads and business to the company) for a small tech company (around 60 employees), and my boss is the bottleneck to get things moving faster.   
  
She constantly takes projects or wants to review other projects, but she doesn't have the time to get them done. I have to keep asking when I can expect those projects to be completed so I can do my job. Since my job is to bring leads to the sales team, I cannot do that if she doesn't approve or review the things that need to go out, and I've been put in a hard spot when people ask me why we are not getting leads or achieving our monthly goals.

To give more context to this, when I was first hired, I was reporting directly to the Chief Revenue Officer, who was promoted to CEO in my 3rd week at this job. With this, there was some company restructuring the following week, and since then, I  now report to a new manager who was my peer before. Also,  we are a small team of 3 people in the marketing team.

I do have a good relationship with my boss and the CEO, and I like everyone at the company. It is a good company, but here is where I am stuck:  
\- The leadership team and BOD have the marketing department work on things that are not related to generation demand.  
\- My boss takes a long time to get tasks done, which impacts my ability to generate more leads.  
\- When I have to report to the leadership team on our lead generation, it's awkward because we are not meeting goals, and that looks very bad on me.

How do I proceed from here?  
\- I had a conversation with my boss, and she doesn't think the delayed on these projects is causing issues with lead generation, but the entire team disagrees with her.  
\- I'm thinking of talking to her boss (the CEO) and just basically saying that to meet goals, we need to focus on activities that will generate revenue instead of working on a logo for a tradeshow, for example.  
\- I was also thinking of bringing this to HR to ask for advice since I do have a good relationship with the head of HR as well.   

Since all the fingers are pointed at me, I want to find a way to communicate with upper management to make it clear Im doing everything I can in my power to meet goals, but our time and energy are being focused on the wrong projects. 

Any advice is appreciated.

However, I would appreciate any expert advice to confirm this and guide me on the necessary steps to meet the prerequisites for these exams.

I have already had my degree evaluated by a trusted consultancy, and here are the key details from the evaluation:
Credits: 129.0
GPA Points: 450.0
Cumulative GPA: 3.49 on a 4.00 scale
The evaluation concluded that my degree is equivalent to a U.S. Bachelor’s degree with a major in Pharmacy, and I would like to know the specific steps I need to take in order to meet the eligibility requirements for the FPGEC and NAPLEX exams.

Additionally, I would appreciate guidance on which pharmacy school I should consider enrolling in to address any gaps in my education, if applicable, and to prepare for these exams.

Lastly, can anyone let me about the most in-demand pharmacy positions currently available in the U.S., particularly those that are most likely to secure employment post-graduation? I would also like to know what additional courses or certifications might be beneficial to pursue to enhance my qualifications and improve my chances of landing a job.

That made me think I'd be free from the cycle of commuting and being chained to an office, just to enjoy about 4 hours when I finally get home.

My current plan was to do various CS classes as electives so I can make the switch from IT, but I realized programming just isn't for me. I researched non programming roles and how career progression can look, but being a product manager or tech consultant are highly specialized roles with years of experience required. There's no way someone like me who barely likes this field can work my way up towards that.

I think I don't have what it takes and just need to go back to commerce, or *anything* other than tech. 

But I just don't know what can possibly match the work life balance and pay of tech. I don't know what business roles can offer wfh. 

Another factor is that commerce costs 17k a year in fees while IT and CS costs 9k.

1iu3rj9,"Quitting w/o 2 weeks notice, waiting for bonus to leave","I’m looking to leave my current role for a career industry change. My bonus pays out in 8 weeks. I’m switching careers to a profession that cuts my pay in half (I know, but I’m passionate about it and have been wanting to make the jump for a while). So getting my bonus is really important to set me up to financially be in a spot where I can take the pay cut.

I have a direct contact there who recommended me for an interview, so I expect that would happen sooner than a normal candidate process. I put on the application that I couldn’t start until the Monday after the bonus (8 weeks from application).

But to meet that date, it’d require me giving my employer no notice/not 2 weeks. In that time, I could prepare documentation and set up my work behind the scenes to be easy for someone else to take over. But feel it’s too risky to put in notice pre-bonus. And I worry that 2 weeks after my bonus payout will be too far from my interview to start. My main concern is if not giving a notice makes me ineligible for rehire and would burn the bridge. I see my company/manager understanding my reasons for leaving especially going into a career in public service. But feel like it may not be the best idea to burn the bridge in any case or tarnish a reference for future employment checks.

Would it be bad to extend my start date at new employer out 2 more weeks from my original availability if offered?

1iu3ksk,Is it normal for multiple people to share one email for everything?,"So I work in the main office of a facility management company. There are 4 of us working in this office that handle well over 100 accounts. My manager insists on all 3 of us working off of one email for everything, from account concerns, billing, payroll, and employee onboarding. Their reasoning is because it keeps everyone in the loop and prevents emails from getting missed.

The exact opposite is happening. Emails are getting skipped or missed because we get a flood of messages coming in every day and simply can not keep up. It has been suggested multiple times by multiple people, including UPPER management, to utilize separate work emails within the server. My manager simply will not budge as they personally want to see every email that comes in. They are not technologically illiterate, they know how to work the server and emails.

Is this normal? This is my first office job and I've been here for a few years at this point and I have never heard of this being done before?

1iu3fb6,thinking about leaving job - am I being silly?,"Hi everyone,

Posting from a new account for privacy.

I’m in my early 20s working in an entry-level mkt role. It’s not the worst situation, especially compared to some stories I’ve seen here, but I’ve been feeling really bored. I’ve been at this job for about 10 months, working around 30 hours a week fully remote. The pay is okay, colleagues are meh, but I just find the work so boring and monotonous. There’s no passion in it for me. I hate how repetitive it’s become.

I’ve been thinking about making a move into the nonprofit sector, working for a cause that actually means something to me. Ideally, I’d like to find another fully remote role in this area before leaving this one. 

Is it silly to leave a decent (but boring) job in this economy? Any advice or things I should consider before making the final decision? 

Thanks in advance",Primary-Farmer-5279,1,1.0,4,1740071095,2025-02-20 17:04:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iu3fb6/thinking_about_leaving_job_am_i_being_silly/,2,2025

Since last August my manager started treating me as „Product head“ without giving ofc title or raise or promotion . After that he started criticising openly about almost everything and in front of the others. I remember a case that after a meeting he said to 4 colleagues to stay in the call and he started openly criticising me and saying this is an example for all. 

In my evaluation he gave me an average grade (last year was the best grade ). 

I wanted to start searching for another job but I just became a father and I am waiting for the parental leave . 

I am wondering if he tries to make me resign since he can’t fire me (immunity due to parental leave )

I also really enjoyed learning about conservation, protection of wildlife. And I really love the outdoors/nature. Also, I have an interest in forensics, but I’m aware it may take 2-3 years just for an entry level job in the field. I was in the pre veterinary track, but came to conclusion that was not for me.

1itzrob,Should i give up of my US medschool dreams?,"Hello guys, how are you?

I'm 21y from Brazil and i would like to get some good advices about medschool in the US and get some opinions if you guys think that i should give up of that in my personal situation.

I'm from a unstable country so my family struggle a lots with financial hardships but although of that i still think that maybe i could have any chance on studying medicine in the US.

I was planning on moving there for study as i could find some state schools with relatively affordable prices, the question is that i'm feeling really insecure because i don't know how hard is the college there (for premed courses), and i don't know what would happen if i don't get in medschool after that.

Some other issues are that: I still would have to wait for the long processing times of EB3 visa, which could give me one green card that would allow me to apply for the FAFSA for the medschool (which i definetely couldn't afford otherwise). The waiting times now are around 5 or 6 years, what would be more or less the same time of the college and maybe some gap year or post-baccharelaute.

Do you guys think that this plan sounds insane?

I feel like as i could be being imprudent for some questions:

1º: The company that's sponsoring me the EB visa, although stable, still would be vulnerable to bankrupcy in a crysis sceneerie between these long five or six years, so i would just be done and probably wouldn't have nothing else to do with my life or with my premed degree. I'm not sure if would be wise to so just begin waiting for the procedures again through any other company.

2º: I'm definetely not sure if i can perform excepcionally well in the college there because i don't know how it would be. I mean if the premed courses are too hard or something?

3º: Consequently, if i don't get in throught the MCAT i still don't know how expensive are the gap years or the post-baccharelaute courses to try to strenght my application.

Do you guys think that maybe would be just a better idea to go to study somewhere else, or maybe try to take the USMLE in the future or something? I know that the rates of IMG's matching in residency programs is close to nothing. Although that i heared too that some states are making easier for IMG's who want to go and practice there, i guess that these programs still are quite little and somehow uncertain, right?

Maybe the doctor salaries in other countries but US aren't so bad? I always dreamt about the US because i appreciate the country insurance/stability and economical/political position.

In view of all of this, do you think that i should just give up or that i still would be missing some things to consider not leaving that dream?

I appreciate and i'm gratefull for all your answers. Thank you very much.",Pure-Ad-6744,0,0.5,3,1740061832,2025-02-20 14:30:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itzrob/should_i_give_up_of_my_us_medschool_dreams/,2,2025

1itz0ew,Thinking of leaving a job after a year and reaching back out to a company that previously gave me an offer.,"I’ve been in my current role a more than a year now and am looking to make a change. Ideally I’d like to reach out to a company that offered me a job before I entered my current role, but I’m unsure how to start that conversation.

I knew coming into this position it was going to be a change from my past experience and a challenge. It’s a slightly different industry in a much larger public company, compared to the experience I had with a smaller privately owned organization. I was tasked with helping us expand into a new vertical and push a new line of business. I’ve spent much of the last year putting processes in place to improve this function within the company, but still find myself hung up in bureaucratic nonsense and dealing with most people in the organization who just don’t care about this effort. It’s unfortunate, but us expanding into this new field is dependent upon the performance in our current areas of focus, so I’m somewhat stuck waiting for the rest of the company to turn things around. I’m now past a year in and I just find myself dreading every day and I am actually not doing much of what I was brought on to do. I don’t fully expect the next year to be much different given the business plan going forward and based on conversations with my current supervisor, so I’d likely be stuck supporting other departments more than doing what I was brought on to do. I think this could be explained in future interviews why I was here such a short time, but don’t want to seem like someone who is a job hopper/not a long term employee. (I was in my previous role with my old company for almost 6 years.)

When I took this role last year, I had two offers and ultimately decided on my current position. Now that I’m looking to leave I was wondering how to reach out to the company that previously had offered me. I have friends in that organization, so I know they still have a need for someone with my skillset, but don’t think they have an actual position listed. Also the last communication I had with the hiring manager there concluded with them saying: “You know where to find us, so if you ever are looking to jump back into <Specific Industry>, feel free to reach out.” Overall just not sure the best way to reengage that conversation because I don’t want to make it seem like I’m just quitting on my efforts over here. 

Overall main questions are:

1) Will it look bad to leave somewhere after a year with the explanations I outlined available to me when asked?
2) What is the best way to restart/return to the conversation with this company that offered me a position a year ago?",GoCubsGo0070,1,1.0,3,1740059732,2025-02-20 13:55:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itz0ew/thinking_of_leaving_a_job_after_a_year_and/,2,2025
1ityzhu,Interview Prep for Desired Job,"So I've been trying to get a state job for over 5 years now, and in the last year I've landed interviews for 3 different postions but no job offers. 

I recently landed another interview, scheduled next week, for a position that was reposted and that I had already interviewed for before. I think it's being treated as a second interview for the position because the panel I'm interviewing with are higher level employees than the first interview, but I digress.

The point of my post is, what do you guys do to land a job offer? How do you prepare for interviews? 

So far what I do is:

I make sure the interview is scheduled on a day and time when the interviewer is most likely to be in a good mood. 

If I'm provided the names of the interviewers, I look them up online so that I know what they look like and get a feel for who they are so they feel more familiar to me.

I break down the job posting by posing their preferred qualifications as questions that I answer, and studying the topics they expect me to know about.

I ordered a nice pant suit that I'm going to get tailored once it arrives (hopefully today).

So yeah, what else should I focus on?

1ityhc3,Can I make my volunteer job my career?,"As the title says. I guess this counts as career advice as I would like to make it my career? I have been a volunteer in a charity for a year now, started out as a Team Leader Volunteer within my city area. They have been implementing a new structure that instead of having multiple branches in the region, they have merged them all into one. They basically told me that I was actually the only Team Lead (in my specialty) so they would like me to do it for all of the region. So now instead of a Team Leader Volunteer for one city, I am covering all of the region. I explained at the time when we discussed this that we do not know what this will look like in terms of workload, so I am happy to try and reconvene at a later date in terms of workload. 

I have a full time job (that I hate, but it pays the bills) and I really enjoy my volunteer work but I am finding it really difficult with the additional workload to manage my time and stress on top of my job. I have a meeting to catch up on rolling out our new operational model on Tuesday in terms of me being the organiser for my specialty. I really care about the cause and I would honestly love to dedicate all my time to it, but I have to make a living. 

So today I had to speak with an employee over the phone as she needed help understanding the new model. She said, ""Forgive me for asking, but aren't you a volunteer? Wow that is a lot for an unpaid volunteer to oversee this process for the whole region. Especially because this specific process is one of our biggest goals as a charity."" What I gathered from that was even a full time employee thinks I should be paid. 

I don't even necessarily want a full time job (not yet anyway), I don't think the workload could justify a full salary. But maybe even a part time gig to iron out admin related duties? They are also adding in more sort of paperwork and reporting related to my specialty, which I would love to take on if I could be paid to do. I am actually passionate about the cause, this wasn't a ""I just want to add volunteering to my CV"" sort of choice. I actually really care. I feel morally conflicted to ask to be paid, but they are just giving me more and more responsibilities (that I want!) but isn't feasible with a full time job too. I would love to make this a career prospect for me.

So my question is, do you think I am within my rights to ask if they would consider making me a paid employee, as I am the only person currently doing this role and for the whole region. If yes, how would I go about it?

Any advice would be appreciated, even just some validation that I am not evil for wanting to be paid by a charity.",Amphitrit3,2,1.0,0,1740058131,2025-02-20 13:28:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ityhc3/can_i_make_my_volunteer_job_my_career/,2,2025

My parents are in a tough financial spot and I want to help him find a job where he could apply his medical knowledge without needing to be licensed.

1ity5b9,Working in the US as a European Aerospace engineer,"Hi everyone,

I need some guidance on my career path. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering from Barcelona, Spain, and I’m currently pursuing an MSc in Space Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, Italy.

My ultimate goal is to work in the US as an aerospace/space engineer, but I’m concerned about the challenges of securing a job there as a European. I’ve been considering the option of pursuing another MSc in the US to improve my chances, but I’m unsure if that would significantly increase my opportunities.

Does anyone know how feasible it is for someone with my background to obtain an H-1B visa? I’d hate to invest in a US degree only to find myself unable to stay due to visa issues. Any insights on the H-1B process or alternative pathways would be greatly appreciated.

1itxkp6,Feeling sad about quitting my job,"I have a good position in a big company for three years, the company values me, they’ve promoted me, gave me raises, courses.
I have received a job offer to work abroad in a good country for a smaller company. The amount is much higher although the title is smaller. It is a risk movement, I have a wife that wont be able to work there for a while (she is fine with this) and a 3yo daughter. I wouldn’t stay in this country for too long, maybe 3 to 4 years but the amount I would save is high.
There are two things that are driving me crazy,
1 - I love the idea of the adventure but what if we don’t fit? Coming back would be hard, and I would be leaving a company and a team (I’m a team manager myself) that really values me, with managers that I enjoy.
2 - why am I feeling bad about telling them that I quit? They love me there, I feel like they are really dependent on me, I feel like betraying them, they’ve just gave me a bonus and a raise, this is a dream job where I live, it’s like I’m a cheater. How crazy is this? Is just a company right? Is it normal to feel like this? Do I need therapy?

1itxf3m,"Mental health, productivity, and a dismissive/condescending boss","First off I want to give a **trigger warning** that I will be discussing poor mental health, depression, and the opposite of living... I hope this is allowed. Also this is a throwaway account

So for the past year or so my mental health has   taken a nosedive down. I am in therapy and on medication. I have diagnosed anxiety, depression, and ADHD.  I have basically no motivation. Everyday is a struggle to drag myself bout of bed. By the time I get home I'm so exhausted, physically and mentally, that I just crash in bed. Life just feels like a chore and I'm really tired of it.

Along with my mental health my work productivity has decreased a lot. I work a desk job, but I am making more mistakes, getting less done than my co-workers, and it's hard to keep up. I know it is my mental health causing this. I've worked in this job for 3 years and the first 2 years were not this hard. I love my job and the people I work with.

Around middle of November last year my boss called me into her office and said that my work output was completely unacceptable and she put me on a improvement plan for 90 days. In that time I have been doing more/better work but at the expense of my mental health and it's getting to the point where I don't know how much I can keep this up. Life isn't enjoyable anymore and what is the point of doing any of this job or anything at all.

My boss has been having me come in for weekly meetings to talk about everything I've done each week. So in these meetings I have tried SO many times to explain my problems and that I really am trying but it's just hard. She has always been easy to talk to, understanding, and like a friend, but since this started she is extremely condescending, dismissive, and just mean. She recently told me that I ""have no more than anyone else"" when we were talking about my depression. I cried at my desk after that because I just felt so belittled. 

Like I want to be extremely blunt with her and say that I don't want to be alive anymore and there's no point in anything so why try. I want to scream it in her face that I literally want to kill myself and see how serious she takes me then. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I know I am not in a good place so please do not preach to me about that.

1itwbto,"Potential opportunity for a new job, unsure what to do!","Ill start by saying that my job now is quite boring and potentially this other one will be too, however the options available to me are the more boring ones and i am okay with that.

The job i have now is in retail and its only 4 days a week at 25 hours, however the pay at this company is above minimim wage which keeps any payments in check. The job is also close to me which makes it convenient, however its not essential for me to have a close by job as i do have a car. I start work in the late afternoon and finish at midnight, however i am up all day before work which is very annoying

However, this other job, which is a cleaning job is minimum wage, but i would be up to 30 hours and would end up making more than my current job. I would also be working with a few members of my family as they do various things within this workplace. This job is a little bit away from me and would require me to be up at about half 6 every morning to get ready beforehand but compared to my current job, it would mean i wouldnt have to fill a gap of time beforehand

I feel that i may be happier in this new job, starting in the morning then having the rest of the day to myself, as opposed to waiting around before work all day. I would also be working with close family member which would probably be good

I am just looking for any input people would have here as i feel a bit lost with this decision

1itvlu0,Silent treatment at work,"Hello! New here... I have been working in the same office fir 2 years now and it is one of those places that if you look from outside, it seems fun and a happy place. The problem is that I hated going there and didn't realized why until today at lunch: I being bullied with silent treatment from one of my colleagues, who is also the ""lead"" of the group (not the boss, but he has a huge influence in our boss, due to time, and being charming when he wants to). We are a group of 8 people, divided into 3 sub-teams. My other sub team members are ok,.we keep it to ourselves.

The problem are the other groups: this guy who is the lead has decided that I not worthy of conversation. He is polite if I ask him something, but he never ask me anything, and if we find ourselves in the elevator, he doesn't talk. Or if I speak in a group setting, he just ignore me and speak over me. Very small stuff that pile up and allies the rest of the team to trait me equally.

How do you revert this? I don't want to be friends with the guy. But as mentioned, the rest are doing the same and I being left out of many conversations even work related.

1itry06,Quit my job two weeks ago and I want it back.,"I quit my job two weeks ago and I’m considering on swallowing my pride and asking for it back. It was due to a multitude of things but I put in a different reason on paper. 

I’ve worked at this KBBQ place for almost a year now and just quit two weeks ago. I was one of the earlier hires when it just opened so Ive built a strong enough relationship with management and with coworkers that Ive made a pretty good rep for being a second-in-command for the other managers. 

The job was great at first but it slowly just started deteriorating my mental. we started hiring lazy employees and managers started to get overworked and so did the older hires from the beginning. I’ve seen a bunch of them quit due to the job conditions and just how bad it’s been compared to before. I held on because I still needed the money and I still had faith somewhat that things would look up. 

Flash forward to now management had gone downhill and there’s only a handful of OG hires left. I ended up quitting on the spot without two weeks notice and claimed that it was because I was neglecting college because of the job and I needed to focus on my grades because they were slipping and I couldn’t afford to lose my scholarship. 

My manager was very understanding and he tried offering to cut my hours but I ended up denying it and thanked him for his consideration on it. I asked him if I ever were to come back if I had to wait out the six months (company policy) to reapply and he said it might not be the case and to just reach out. So we parted ways and I left. I didn’t see the point in giving a two weeks since they cut my hours enough to the point that I only had three days scheduled within the two weeks. 

I’ve been job searching and turns out every other job sucks just as much but the pay is way worse. Although the job conditions sucked at this place it was bearable because I liked my coworkers and management and I had a somewhat close relationship so they were nice and more accommodating than I assume other managers would be. 

I’m regretting my decision to quit and I’m considering on reaching out to the manager I resigned to on getting the job back again next month. Would this be stupid? 

I was good at my job and was often praised by my coworkers for taking the lead and really boosting team morale. My managers mainly liked me or none had bad blood with me. I’d like to hope that my time there was also a good factor to take me back for. 

I guess one thing that’s making me doubt it is that they did offer a solution and I shot it down. Another is that toward the end of me quitting, since I was so sure of my decision I slacked off the last few weeks of me working there. I wasn’t putting in 100% into the job and I called off a lot and I asked to go home early twice. This behavior was only towards the end of the month though and prior I’d rarely called out and would be their go-to call-in. 

So with all that considered do you think I’d have a good shot at getting the job back? Or would I be embarrassing myself by asking? 


TL;DR: I quit my job two weeks ago and I want it back. I was an overall good employee but I slacked off heavily on my last few weeks. Should I reapply?

1itqan2,"I moved to a new city for my dream job, but now I’m regretting it and I don’t know if I should stay","About six months ago, I moved to a new city for what I thought was going to be my dream job. I had been working at a small company for a few years, and I was feeling stagnant. When the opportunity came up for a position at a larger, well known company in a big city, I jumped at the chance. The salary was better, the career prospects seemed amazing, and I was excited about the change.

At first, everything seemed great. The job itself is as advertised, I’m learning a lot, the work is challenging, and I feel like I’m actually growing professionally. But lately, I’ve started feeling more and more disconnected from everything around me. The city is huge, and while it’s exciting in many ways, it also feels incredibly isolating. I don’t know anyone here except for my coworkers, and they’re all busy with their own lives. I’ve tried meeting people through meetups and apps, but nothing’s really clicked. I thought I’d love the hustle and bustle, but instead, I find myself feeling lonely almost every day after work.

To make matters worse, I’m starting to wonder if the job is really what I want. The company culture is very competitive, and while the work is intellectually stimulating, it’s also exhausting. I find myself working late more than I expected, and I’m not sure I’m getting the work life balance I was hoping for. On top of that, I miss my friends and family back home. I didn’t realize how much I relied on them for support, and now I feel disconnected from my past life.

The worst part? I feel like I’m stuck. If I leave this job, I feel like I’ll be giving up on an opportunity that so many people would love to have. But if I stay, I’m not sure how much longer I can handle the loneliness and the pressure. I feel like I’m at a crossroads, and I can’t decide if I should stick it out for the career growth or if I should go back home and try something else.

While completing my final year, I interned at that company. After my internship, I joined as a full-time software developer. However, after a year, due to company cost-cutting measures, we were all let go, including the architect because the company couldn't afford to pay him. It's been nearly 10 months since then, and I've only received 2-3 calls in that time while trying to re-enter the IT industry. After that, I took up a job as a graphic designer for about 6 months, but I realized I wanted to return to IT, so I resigned and started preparing for software development roles, especially front-end development. After 2 months of preparation, I got only one call. I reached out to my friends for referrals, and they informed me of openings in roles like data analyst, support, etc. I've been preparing for data analyst roles for a few weeks now, but even with referrals, I haven't received any calls. It's been nearly 4 months since I resigned, and I'm still struggling.  

Now, I’m open to entry-level roles or internships and am willing to work full-time to get back into IT. Recently, I joined a company that offered me a 3-month unpaid internship in PHP without an offer letter. Should I continue focusing on one area (like front-end development) and improve my skills, or should I consider trying various roles within IT to increase my chances? I want to eventually land a job with a similar package to what I was earning before. What's the best approach here?

1itpazu,"Received a job offer, but I need more time to consider and need to ask for non-negotiables..","I received a job off today that expires Tuesday evening. To be completely honest, I'm not entirely sure I will accept the position. I am in the process of finishing interviewing for another company that is my first choice (and has verbally said I am their top candidate - I'm just doing an informal-ish phone chat with their CEO to complete the process) and I need time to see them send over a formal offer. I also have some schedule restrictions that I cannot compromise on, and the company that I'm responding to was a little non-comittal when I mentioned it previously. I've drafted this email, but would like some help fine-tuning it.

Here is my rough draft:

""Hi [HR REP],

Thank you so much for your consideration. I see that the offer has an ""accept by"" day of 5:00pm Tuesday, February 25th.  Is it okay if I give you an answer by EOD Monday, February 24th? I'd like to discuss with my husband before making any decisions and he is out of town until Saturday night.
Additionally, I know we briefly discussed my schedule over the phone, but I want to be sure that my schedule needs will not be cause for concern. Currently I have to leave work around 4:30pm daily to make daycare pickup, but come August I will need to be out by 2:15pm to make school pickup. I understand that [COMPANY'S] policy is no [PROCESS] can happen while there is only one [EMPLOYEE] in the building - I am happy to do [PROCESS] or any other sort of desk work in the mornings until another [EMPLOYEE] is on site, but unfortunately my schedule is the only thing I can't negotiate on.

I'm grateful to be considered for the position and want to make sure I make a thoughtful decision. Thank you again for your consideration!""",BruschettiFreddy,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1740023165,2025-02-20 03:46:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itpazu/received_a_job_offer_but_i_need_more_time_to/,2,2025

1itomyn,Chance to persue a job,"Need some advice, 

So about 3 years ago I acquired my license to become a bus driver. 

Joined with a company who were amazing at the start,
But things have changed over my 2 years with them, and not in a good way unfortunately, 

When I joined my plan was to go part time and return to college to obtain my qualifications for becoming a mechanic unfortunately that was a no from the company due to working hours ect. 

But was promised to be shadowing the new mechanic 

1 year later this never came to, and now they have picked someone else over me for the role. 

I applied for a job just 5minutes off my front door and found out that I have the job, 

But it comes with about 2.5k a year less money. 
And no sick pay 

But it would get my foot in the door in the automotive repair industry. 

I'm now at a cross roads on what to do in all honesty, 

I'm worried I fail at achieving this job

1itod4q,Wise gentleman's opinion?,"Can I get some advice, please if your a non steady working type don't want to hear fantasies of what you think would happen. Experienced folks or of higher management. So I left this certain job at one point because the manager had something he didn't like about me. Im a great worker, and I know everyone says that but im that idiot that takes over and overworks himself for pleasure. Anyways all the supervisors said they'd work it all out and eventually said ""sorry man, he won't budge won't even tell us why ...... And that kinda hurts your feelings. Im young having my first baby at that time I mean like ,,25, freshly married year prior, so I was trying to build a life for the family . Anyways I left on good terms and when the job I earned after that which was the hardest thing to ever do learn how to extrude plastic into a sheet with noone to help guide you . Two operators to learn from which purposely screwed each other (,themselves,) over by causing the other downtime. Years went bu and I thought this would be my long term career kinda. Second shift lead been there his whole life out of hs and he's 58 I believe. Alright Itll be worth it so I grinded with everything I had to learn this new skill and I did and became the best of the best. Well then my world shatters and this company which is huge decided to just shutdown the location because they went in with another partner for th worlds biggest production plant. At that time. Couple million square ft. And unfortunately we're to close and get absorbed. Two mins away just turned it to two hours away so off to w new job. I apply back at the first job and tell em just don't have me under or around that manager he broke some promises and he did . Promised me a raise aka promotion for a job I have been doing for over a year or even two if I gotten my attendance at zero which he thought I would never get and so I did and he still denied me it and couldn't come up with a reason than finally said I didn't do enough near misses...... Smh . So he tried to tell the other depts to not hire me due to guess what out of all things bad attendance. Which I explain and they hire me. Well couple weeks in the company starts hawking me down. Writing me up before even asking what happened type of scenerios. Stuff they said ahhh but I well already wrote you up. And even gave me a final warning and put me in a completely diff dept and hours than what I was hired on for. Then the new dept is exactly stuff I know so in really good at it. They wrote me up again for stuff they literally made up and went back to even before the other two they wrote me up for. Sorry bastards said I was late every single day for over a week straight in the first week or two of getting hired on which was three months before ..... Smh. Even the lifer manager of the new dept told me they're following me from the last one and making shit up. So now the supervisor gives me an ultimatum and gets taken off shift due to family. And tells me they're going to be trying to lean on me hard but in not dumb they looking and interviewing outside prospects. Im I the middle of trying to buy my house and im low on confidence cause these people hate me idky. Maybe cause im funny looking.... So getting s new job isn't reality for me for a couple months.....

1itl51g,Help negotiating salary after offer please? [UK],"I (M32) was told before my interview that the salary range was 60-65k. I wanted 65k but not 60k. The interview went great, and I got an offer within three days.

Negotiations have dragged on, with the HR lead taking a full day to respond each time. They offered 60k base + 2k bonus after 12 months. I countered, saying I needed at least 65k but was aiming for 70k. Today, they came back with 60k base + 4k bonus, citing internal equity and gender pay constraints.

I countered again: I’ll accept 60k base but want a 5k bonus upfront (realistically I’d concede to 4k if necessary as I want the job). Should I now say I need time to think and let them sweat, or would that risk the offer? I want the job and have turned down higher offers.

Was thinking of letting it sit until Friday lunchtime or so just to make them wait it out. They proposed a start date of Monday 3rd March and know I was interviewing and had offers from elsewhere. 

FYI - Leverage - I am currently in full time job on a slightly higher salary but much longer commute and expenses, this job would only be 15 mins drive and hybrid. Have other higher salary offers but don’t want those jobs.

1itk49q,Should I quit a high paying job I just started?,"I’m on day 2 of a new door-to-door sales job,  it pays surpassingly well but I’m already struggling—not because of the job itself, but because of my direct boss. 

This is one of those roles that expect you to dedicate your entire life to it, with no full days off except for a half-day on Christmas and New Year's. I actually enjoy the job & educational aspect but hate my new boss. 

Despite asking her multiple times to go over things with me, she either forgets or ignores my requests.  I told her about my schedule, but she didn’t remember until I arrived. When I arrived, she promised to review notes with me but never did. Today she spent time going over the script six times with another team member, providing notes, but only reviewed it with me twice. When I mixed up a small part in the second paragraph—despite getting the rest right—she sent me home (no pay) instead of helping me correct it, then continued working with everyone else.

I completely understand the importance of accuracy, but I don’t feel like I’m being given a fair chance. When I ask questions, she responds with dismissive comments like *""You should have known this by now""* or *""Well, you know English, right?""*—which has been incredibly discouraging. At one point, I was so frustrated that I was on the verge of tears. She also still hasn’t provided the notes she promised, leaving me to figure everything out on my own. I think we may have gotten off on the wrong foot because I mentioned I’d be arriving a little later due to my other job, even though I adjusted my hours to accommodate them.

1itjy5c,"I built their success, worked like a machine and got treated like one.","I started as a freelancer, making decent money while working on my own terms. Then, I joined a small company as the 4th employee to help launch a new offer. I built the entire marketing strategy from scratch—shooting and editing every video, managing content, and leveraging my personal equipment worth 20K. I worked weekends, skipped vacations, and in one year, we grew to 100K+ followers, which brought in all our clients and partners.

That community then enabled us to raise 3M through crowdequity. The company grew to 12 people, yet my salary remained the minimum. Two new hires in my department under my orders, both less skilled than me, earn the same as I do. I never received commissions, nor was my overtime paid. The moment I decided to strictly follow my contract (9-18) and stop responding to messages at 10 PM, my boss wanted to fire me—ironically, while still relying on me for every major decision.

Even the person they hired to be my “chief” admitted, “If we fire him, we’re dead.” But despite all this, my boss—who I worked closely with, helped build his personal brand, and made him millions—sees me as just another tool. He won’t offer better compensation yet expects me to continue overdelivering. He could replace me, but it would take multiple hires to match my output. Still, he’d do it because hiring cheap interns is easier than rewarding loyalty.

Lesson learned: There are no friendships in business—only sharks. Seeing how easily companies underpay, overwork, and discard employees, I don’t understand why more people don’t build their own businesses. You can dedicate a decade, generate millions for your employer, and still end up underpaid and replaceable.

So here’s the thing: how do people accept being employees their whole lives? Why don’t more people try to build their own businesses? I genuinely don’t understand it. In a way, I almost envy those who are content with a low salary and spending most of their life working for someone else—they seem at peace. But for me, it’s infuriating. I can’t shake the feeling of being just another replaceable cog in the machine.",Primary-Departure-89,2,0.7599999904632568,1,1740007543,2025-02-19 23:25:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itjy5c/i_built_their_success_worked_like_a_machine_and/,2,2025

* needs to search or find the answer on her own, then if exhausted all avenues, bring question to PM or CM.
* it's ok to bring a questionable solution to a PM or CM to review. It may not be the right direction, but at least the effort was put in to find some sort of solution to the problem, concern, or difficulty.
* retaining information provided is important. It appears that information is not being learned by her. Very little participation in team training lessons as far as answering questions go.
* a lot of the discussion and information we teach is applicable to all projects and not just the current one.

If I put my time in and I get lucky, the best I can hope for in this role is a director position, but due to the structure it's very unlikely.

1itfppu,"25, Working in ""PE"", Debating LMM PE vs. MM IB vs. US MBA—How Will AI Reshape Finance?","Hey everyone,

I’m 25 and currently working in PE, specifically at a software aggregator that acquires distressed businesses, rarely paying more than 1-3x total revenue. While I can title my role as private equity, the reality is that my work is mostly business development and corporate due diligence, with financial modeling that isn’t as technical as it should be. Since the job is remote, I have a ton of free time. I mean a ton.

I broke into this role through a mix of networking, luck, and self-study, but my path was far from traditional. I struggled in undergrad due to a severe autoimmune disease diagnosis, which hurt my GPA and made traditional recruiting impossible. Despite that, I hustled my way into this position.

Now, I’m trying to figure out my next move:

1. **LMM PE** – Lateral into a more technical, investment-heavy role at a smaller PE shop where I can build real modeling skills and work on more complex deals. What are my odds of being taken seriously if my professional experience has no LBO modelling?
2. **LMM/MM IB** – Move into investment banking for more rigorous training and better long-term optionality. My concern is whether my current background of undergrad in Canada/ low gpa/ work experience in sourcing and distressed acquisitions would make me competitive for IB roles.
3. **US MBA (as a US Citizen)** – Given my non-traditional path and weak undergrad GPA, I see an MBA from a top school (H/S/W or M7) as a potential reset button to break into IB or PE at a higher level. I’ve started studying for the GMAT, but I know I’ll need a strong score to compensate.

Beyond career progression, I also have a major logistical factor to consider: I’m currently based in Canada, and my autoimmune medication is fully covered by insurance here. If I move to the US for either IB or an MBA, I’ll need to navigate private health insurance, and I’m not sure if that will be a major challenge or not. 

A broader concern is how AI will reshape finance roles over the next decade. With automation advancing, will analyst positions in IB and PE start disappearing? If so, would it be smarter to pivot toward strategy, tech, or a different angle in finance?

But beyond all of this, why do I feel stuck? Why do I feel like a fraud? I can’t even confidently say I work in private equity, yet my LinkedIn says I do. I don’t know if I should weather the storm and fake it till I make it or if I should be upfront about the reality of my role. Anyone else been in this position before? Would appreciate any advice.",FinanceGuyWDream,1,1.0,0,1739996977,2025-02-19 20:29:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itfppu/25_working_in_pe_debating_lmm_pe_vs_mm_ib_vs_us/,2,2025
1itfaz6,How Do I Tell a Customer They Should Hire Me?,"I have worked at a SaaS company for the last few years and I would consider us a market leader in our industry. One of my newest customers is a legacy brand that is very well known but has struggled to adapt with the times, but seemingly now has the right people and strategy in place, which includes partnering with my current company.

  
However, while they have the right strategy in place (with my company's product playing a large role) they are missing the right person to execute said strategy and I think I am the right person to do this for them on their side.

They don't have an open headcount but have alluded to the fact they might be hiring more in the future. It would also not burn a bridge with my current company because we are in the midst of a reorg of sorts so it isn't really the best place to work at right now (my manager is well aware of this) so I think management would be relieved to have me off the books to be honest. Plus, having them be a successful customer would still help them in the long run, so having a friendly ally on the other side would still be a positive. 

So my question is how do I convey my interest to the customer without making it awkward, especially if it doesn't work out? At the end of the day, they have a need and I can fill that need. I already have a great professional relationship with them and I think they would be open to me joining, but I just want to go about this the right way and would regret if I didn't shoot my shot.",DavidBrownButcher,1,1.0,6,1739995964,2025-02-19 20:12:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itfaz6/how_do_i_tell_a_customer_they_should_hire_me/,2,2025

I’m 24 and I currently have a full time job in marketing for a telco and get paid about $65k, and this job will be about $15k decrease. I am pretty confident I could take LOA at my current job and come back after so that removes stress about being unemployed after I guess, but I’m wondering if the benefits even outweigh the decrease in pay? 

The internship is in sports, I am pretty interested in that industry and am looking into doing a masters in event management or something of the like, so I feel like it may be good experience for that, but also is an internship on a resume is even that impressive, especially when I’m already in the workforce?

My dream has always been to own a hobby farm and an opportunity has presented itself to me. However, my commute will now be longer. i would drive 50 minutes to a train and then its a 2 hour train ride to work. The train has wifi and I can work on my laptop so basically when I get to work I will have already worked two hours. I commute 2-3 days/week, less so during the summer months. Most people (friends/family) have been very supportive of my dream and are rooting for me. However, there is a naysayer out there (she has a 20 minute commute and does not live in a city).

1itd26v,Career advice for a creatively-inclined person currently pursuing Nursing,"Hey! I'm an 18yo college student (freshman) nursing major. I feel I might regret it and feel the best time to change my major is now if I'm unsure about it--so i wanted some honest advice.

Growing up I never wanted to be a nurse--I want to be a writer and pursue art/film. I wasn't born into a wealthy family though--and that path for college was highly discouraged. Healthcare/nursing was highly encouraged--and since i didn't know what else to do--i went along with nursing thinking that I'd still have time to pursue the arts and eventually quit nursing. (So basically, I have no passion for nursing.)

However--I think I'm now understanding that being a nurse day-in and day-out, might have to be a calling and not just a job I can do to pursue my hobbies outside of work, and have a comfortable lifestyle.

I've been encouraged to become a CRNA. I initially hated the thought. I would say that I have high baseline anxiety--and so I never even considered doing a job where someone's life would be in my hands, and I'd have to make split-second decisions (which I'd have to do as a anesthesia provider). However, the lifestyle is ideal outside of this factor, as I'd be able to pursue art easily outside of work, and I'd have money to invest into bettering my creative pursuits. Additionally, looking at CRNA reddit communities--everyone seems satisfied/happy with this job, so I figure I might be happy as well? Even though its not particularly interesting to me at all.

The problem is--can I really put someone's life in my hands for the sake of pursuing my creative hobbies? Being a nursing major--I have friends who actually are interested in being a nurse, or becoming a CRNA and love science, love anesthesia, love direct care. Seeing them be so passionate about it makes me feel like I'm doing the wrong thing in my life.

In an ideal world--I'd be a creative writing or film major in New York or something. If anything, I'd probably want a cushy office job. Maybe doing graphic design or even a marketing job. But the job satisfaction for those jobs doesn't seem as high, people seem to have less work-life balance, and they're not being paid as well. I'm also pretty introverted and don't feel I could do much corporate-climbing with my personality. 

I've also considered other healthcare jobs--like becoming a Psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, a Psychiatrist, Dermatologist, a Physician Assistant, a Veterinarian, or an Optometrist.

For the jobs like Dermatologist, Psychiatrist, or Optometrist--they appealed to me because it seemed like work-life balance would ok and I'd be helping people out. I also think I'd prefer an outpatient setting--which I could do with these jobs. The cons are the amount of schooling, as well as the fact that I'd have to go to med school for 2 of these options--and from I've heard from doctors--if you're not willing to put everything into it, it may not be worth it. Optometry has a bad ROI, or else I'd probably do that. Anther con is I'm pretty introverted so i don't know if I could last long in these fields. Physician burnout is also really high, which scares me regarding these types of jobs.

When is comes to being a PMHNP--I've heard a lot of mixed reviews and complaints about too much paperwork, not enough pay, and since I'd be doing this job to have a good work-life balance, I don't think I'd be too happy. But I do love the idea of pursuing something related to psychiatry, and they also have a chance of working from home. There does seem to be a lack of time for genuine patient-client relationships though, and compared to becoming a CRNA, they seem a little less happy.

I love animals--which is a main reason I'd pursue being a Vet, but everyone says that's not a good enough reason to do it. The burnout rates are high, and a lot of people experience compassion fatigue. 

At this point--I'm not sure if the healthcare field is for me. perhaps being a CRNA would be worth it for the lifestyle--but working in an ICU (to qualify for CRNA school)? The stress of that alone concerns me.

I honestly feel like once I get this degree and working as a nurse, I'll just try switching to a tech job (if I can't commit to becoming a CRNA). Bedside nursing isn't the only option--but it is in order to becoming a CRNA. I also feel like if it wasn't for my parents, I'd be pursuing a creative degree. I feel decent about science--but hate math--so i don't know if switching to engineering would be for me either--at least I could work a job where a life isn't at potential risk.

I really think I just have to sacrifice something. Either stress levels, money, or time outside of work. I just don't know which to sacrifice. As a CRNA, I might not even feel stressed after the huge amount of training I'll have to do to get there in the first place. Maybe as an 18 year old, the idea of holding a life in my hands is just too much right now. I could learn and feel comfortable somehow, later along the line.

The money would be great--not really for too many material goods--but for travel, which is something I've always wanted to do while young. I could own a dog, maybe save up and buy a dream house. But at the same time, couldn't I do all that with a business degree? Or would I not have the same job security/stability/work-life balance. The trade off is hard to think about. I think I'm not as hardworking as society and my family of very hardworking immigrants want me to be, and so something might be wrong about me, or at least my mindset. I've never had to worry about money before. I've also never gotten to make my own decisions...do I need a wake up call? Please be honest. Thanks in advance

1itcwzr,"I want to return to my home country, how do I best get a job at my home country?","So, context is needed.

Early last year I moved out of my country to here where I am now. Unfortunately I am completely alone, I have found it particularly hard to integrate into society here, finding friends here with the locals is hard. Whenever I am here I am full of negativity and my head is in a dark space(I am not usually depressive or like this). Had I at least had a girlfriend or wife to move together with it would have been much easier. 

I have decided to call it quits and return. I have deliberated this for at least 3 months now.

Of-course before I move back I want to find myself a job in my home country. Luckily it is just a 3 hour drive between the countries(although I have no car). And my parents are willing to have me back temporarily and allow me to use their address on my CV. That address is also on my home country government ID.

1) When I write my CV should I use the address from my remote country or my home country? 

I assume I should use the one that is closer from my home country. I can clarify during the application process that I am still in the remote country.

2) Should I clarify during the application process that I am still in the remote country?

3) Should I try to suggest in person interviews rather than teams interviews, to convince the interviewer that I am willing to move back?

4) What are some good answers if the interviewers ask me why am I moving back to my country?

5) Any other good advice?

The sad thing is that I like the company I work at, but I have asked around and even though I WFH, working from a different country is a big no for them.

1itcse5,Possible PIP Was Mentioned - Time to Find a New Job?,"So today I had a one-on-one with my lead. They had always been happy with my work and are a good manager, I've never had problems before. 

I missed a deadline last week and didn't realize. We had several tasks to review. The time it takes to review each task varies, so it was all rough estimates. I didn't update my lead on my progress and when the date passed with no update from me, my lead pulled two other people to get them finished. 

There was no check in or follow up on it from either of us (me or my lead) and I honesty forgot about the rough ""deadline."" In my one-on-one today, they said basically said they expected an update from me and when that didn't happen at all and those reviews still weren't done, they pulled two other people to help get it knocked out (at the time, I didn't realize this was why). As a result, they said they ""really didn't want to have to put me on a PIP."" And I'm obviously scared and nervous now. My lead said they want to start sending them a list of what I've worked on and how much time I spent on each task and send that at the end of each day to them.

I can't help but feel it's a bit harsh considering we have weekly one on ones and my lead never brought anything up or asked about my progress? I know I'm at fault, but am I overreacting? Did I seriously f up or was it an honest mistake? 

Should I start looking for a new job to be safe? Can I recover if I empathize and really show I'm sorry and taking it seriously? That I'll intentionally be more proactive with updates going forward? 

I'm really stressed and nervous.

It's not the workload, it's the fact that I have no benefits (such as health insurance, retirement plan, etc), I have to use my own car and pay for gas when I have to run WORK errands, I have no coworkers, my boss is never here at the office and I'm basically alone every day with no social interaction at all. I feel stuck cause I don't feel like I am doing much here. I don't see any progress. And I also hate working 6 days a week lol.

My friends/family have been advicing me to just start working on my own projects as an architect/interior designer. Build a clientele slowly or just open more doors for myself in general by freelancing. If I'm being honest I don't quite enjoy having to work 6 days a week, getting a shit pay and not even having health insurance. I could pay for it but that's not how it should work. 

I was planning to move out this year from my parents house but given the circumstances I think I would have to stay (they've mentioned they're going to support me during the process), but I don't know. It's scary not having something secure financially speaking, and having to basically learn from scratch because the world out there is so different when you're freelancing.

1itch72,Help me decide which job offer to choose for my career… Am I being overly cautious about a fed contractor job?,"(Cross post with r/jobs)

I’m overwhelmed at needing to make this decision, so I wanted some advice.

Background: Previously worked in entertainment, digital media and e-learning. Made a career pivot into instructional design. Got 2 offers and can’t decide which to take. My goal is to work my way up to 100k someday. I also am autistic, which puts a bit of an extra weight on the remote role for my sensory/social issues.

Job #1:
-Junior Instructional Designer
-Real Estate
-$65-$75k
-Fully remote
-Works directly with one lead who is very chill and isn’t even really strict about 9-5, as long as you work 8 hours and get the work done. Very laid back, it seems.
-Apparently the company laid off their team a few years ago, but are looking for someone to join to help out the lead ID.
-More comfortable with corporate culture
-Limited room for career growth, uncertain about job security
-Working from home gives me the flexibility to take on consulting or freelance work, to get myself closer to that 100k goal sooner

Job #2:
-Instructional Systems Designer
-Federal contractor
-$70k, no room to negotiate
-On site only
-A team of 8 IDs, it seems the team has to “sell” their worth to other departments a bit more. Seemed a lot more social.
-Working for an Air Force Base as a contractor, but 4 separate people have been hired on as federal employees. It seems they want to keep people around.
-It’s a 2 year contract with federal, but a full time employee position
-I’m less familiar with military culture
-Federal scares the bejeezus out of me lately, but this department is exempt from a lot of the layoffs
-But on the flip side, if I can get into federal, that’s a very long term career

Glad to answer any questions, I’m just… TOTALLY overwhelmed with this choice.",kettlewicks,1,1.0,0,1739989270,2025-02-19 18:21:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1itch72/help_me_decide_which_job_offer_to_choose_for_my/,2,2025

Do you think that failing to attend social events at work (office) affects your reputation, image and opportunities for growth or promotion, etc.?

Example: Secret friend, chocolate friend, team lunches or breakfasts during work hours.

I'm more introverted and I feel like my team doesn't like me, so these social events are always uncomfortable for me because on a daily basis I don't talk to anyone, no one brings up a topic or invites me to lunch (I have lunch alone every single day). 

So what's the point of team members organizing these social events when there are team members who barely interact and are more introverted? On a daily basis, everyone has lunch with whoever suits them best, but I believe they want to organize these events more to kiss up to the boss and show off their work than to create relationships between all team members.

I am required to do everything in the store because I am overnight, yet my coworkers just skate by, pisses me off. Boss just shrugs and says it is part of the job.

The things that are stressing me out is that I know what I get every 2 weeks at the gas station, the other job pays weekly, but I don't know the total per week till I receive my first paycheck, gas station has benefits, hotel does not (only care about dental atm), and it is hard for me to find a job due to having violent felonies, both places already aware of it, but not sure if gas station would rehire me since they don't do background checks (I was upfront during the interview) and maybe corporate will deny me if I wish to re apply now that they know.

I'm a little stuck on what I want to do for a career long term. I know I eventually want to go back to school to get my masters, but I'm having trouble with what I want to go for. It is important to mention that I graduated undergrad with a 2.98 GPA.

If nothing else I could retake some classes, but I would like to avoid that if possible.

I have discovered that I am very passionate about women's health, specifically maternal health. I seriously considered becoming a doula. After more research, I've heard the pay isn't great and the income is unstable. Having a stable income is extremely important to me. I would also like to make at least 50k/yr.

Hey there,

So I am currently a probationary federal employee and I am 90% sure I am getting the axe.  That is what it is, I can honestly say that I do not enjoy this job in the slightest and believe it may pigeon hole me in the future and cause my technical skills to lack.

So right now with the layoff hanging over my head, I have started putting out resumes and going through my network.  A previous job I had is willing to take me back, but all they have open is a junior role at the moment.  The only reason I am considering this is because I absolutely loved this company.  The growth and learning potential was amazing, and the company felt more like a family.  The only catch is that it would be a 45% cut (115k to 60-70k).

I have already run the numbers and with my wife’s income and the proposed income from old company and it looks like we could still live “comfortably” (she’s making 65k + small bonuses).  My concern here is that if I don’t take the job and I get laid off, the job market is so bad right now I may end up taking a pay cut anyways if it takes a while to find a position somewhere.  Or I end up staying here miserable in the work that I do.

1it6n5w,10 Years at the same company. Thinking about quitting.,"Hello,

Figured I would take to the Reddit universe for some advice on this. 

I’m currently a retail Store Manager for one of the largest retail pharmacy chains in the US. I’ve been with the company for 10 years but have been a SM for 3 years. Over the course of my time working, specifically as a SM, I’ve learned a fair amount about running a business and leadership. Unfortunately I’m having a bit of an existential crisis and my job is the main factor of this internal conflict.

I like my job and do enjoy some aspects of it very much but I’m currently at a point where I feel like I am done with it. The company has changed so much over the last decade and the workload that is expected of us now, without the necessary help (payroll cuts) is a bit overwhelming at this point. I’ve always been one to accept challenges and strive to rise to the occasion even against less than ideal circumstances and I actually do have a pretty good store metrics wise. I just feel as though going the extra mile to stay on top is starting to take it’s toll on me, both mentally and now physically. 

Aside from that, the higher ups never seem to be satisfied with your performance as a SM anymore. You can have a good store and they still have something to complain about. Which I do understand to a degree. They have a job to do as well but when it becomes a thing where they start to scrutinize you unfairly and question your leadership skills even with good results, it’s letting me know nothing I do will ever be good enough and makes me feel unappreciated as a leader. I work more than what I get paid for and risk my own health to ensure our success and get treated like crap, as if I don’t know what I’m doing. I won’t even get into the issues we have to deal with regarding staff. One thing I’ve learned from being a leader is, the more fair you try to make things, the more hated you can become.

Anyways, I need to stay on topic here. I just feel as though I am done. 10 years is a lot of time at one place. The company has more unrealistic expectations than ever before and I just don’t know if I’m up for it anymore. 

What do you suggest ? Anyone ever been in a similar situation ?
 
Few personal details about myself that I will leave here that may help in your advice/suggestions:

I’m 32/M. Single. No kids. Paid off car. No debt besides my mortgage which my monthly payment is well below the national average (manufactured home). I typically live below my means. 10k saved in bank, 60k b/t Roth IRA and 401k, 6k in HSA, 5k in real estate investments. I also resell online and have done that PT since 2012 but have taken it more seriously since 2020.

Any help here would be very much appreciated. Thank you.

My technical skills are highly regarded by my principal engineers and I pride myself on having a strong work ethic. However, I have significant struggles when it comes to creating project schedules. They tend to stress me out, and despite my best efforts, my schedules often end up being labeled as unrealistic or not aggressive enough.

Currently, I am working on a project with major technical risks, and due to program needs, I've been asked to create a schedule showing how we can still meet the next program release. The project is crucial for upcoming product release offerings. However, I am concerned that rushing to meet the timeline will compromise the quality of the final product. Currently I do not believe the solution we are working on is up to par, and releasing what we have will frustrate our customers more than if this feature were delayed.

Part of the problem might be that we are being told to execute and march to release, when this is very much still an open R&D project. I am being told to focus on the product solution, pencils down, even though we have major tech risks and flaws that are not resolved.

I'm looking for any advice on how to better tackle schedule creation, especially in high-risk technical projects. Additionally, I'd appreciate any guidance on how to communicate concerns about the potential technical inadequacies and quality issues of a project when there’s strong pressure to meet deadlines.

1it4mwx,"8-Year Career Gap, Not Confident to Apply, How Do I Overcome This?","I never thought I would be in this position. I am 44, and I used to be so confident in my career. Recruitment was my passion and I really loved connecting with people and hiring them for the job vacancies. I have worked in recruitment consultants and in a Corporate environment as well.  Then I got married and kids and had personal commitments for which I voluntarily took a step away from full-time work for almost 15 years.

Even in these 15 years of gap I wasn’t completely out of the game I worked for five years in a digital company, handling marketing and client communication. Later, I even took up part-time social media assignments and did surprisingly well :)))  When I work, I give it my all honestly and with 100% dedication. But despite that, I still feel like I’ve lost my edge could be more because of my age! 

Now, as I try to return to work, I am really terrified. Every time I open a job listing, I hesitate. I start second-guessing myself—Will they reject me because of my age? Do I even stand a chance after being out for so long? How do I even explain the gap?

So much has changed in the industry, and I feel like I’m starting from scratch, at an age where people expect me to already be established. And the worst part? The more I hesitate, the more I feel like I am losing time.

I know I need a remote job to fit my current life situation. But I don’t know where to start, and honestly, I just need hope. I have so many questions hanging over head like How do I push past this fear and start applying? How do I position my experience in a way that doesn’t make me look outdated? What remote roles could work for someone with my background (recruitment, client communication, social media)?Are there companies that actually give career gap candidates a fair shot?

Please help as I genuinely want to restart and i would love to hear of any encouraging situations.

1it1k3a,"I think I hate my new job, and my old job offered to bring me back.","Alright, definitely need some advice. 

I left my old job after being there for 3 years because I needed to make more money as my living situation and personal situation had changed. 

There were other reasons too, of course. I work in hospitality, and there were some pretty big issues with operations, staffing, upper level management, etc. I also felt like I didn't have much more room to grow. After my annual review, I wasn't offered a pay raise, so I started looking for a new job. 

I got a new job at a much larger place which can offer so many great opportunities to learn and grow. Even my previous boss told me it would be a great opportunity for me. 

Flash forward to two months later, and I think I hate it. Training has been hodge podge online training combined with just learning on the job which leaves me feeling unprepared when I talk to clients or work with them. I also already feel anxious every day that I'm messing up in little ways. I'm overwhelmed because I feel like the workload for my particular role is a lot. I also hate the computer system they use, and the general processes for doing things. 

It's basically a sales position and whereas my previous company had a system where you could input information and produce a quote or a contract, the new system is literally so user unfriendly, it's easier to produce quotes in a word document and edit previous contracts to fit your needs. 

My old boss caught word from a friend that I wasn't liking my job, and came back to me agreeing to match my new pay at this new job to get me back, which is insane because it was a significant raise. 

I feel wary about going back because I think I'll be missing out on an opportunity to grow where I'm at now. I also think it's telling that at the time I put in my notice at my old job, they didn't offer to raise my pay to keep me.

The issues at my last job marginally affected my ability to do my job, but the issues I'm experiencing at my new one feel pretty significantly impactful on the way I'm able to do my job effectively and efficiently.

1it1hyo,Forced Into Acting Role,"I have been the deputy to an Operations Manager for about two years in my current job. A few months ago that manager announced plans to change roles, and that I would be the acting manager until a backfill was selected. I do feel I've earned at least consideration for the ops manager role and I'm technically qualified, but I get the impression that the hiring manager doesn't like me (I suspect personal bias) and despite having months to open a requisition for the backfill, this hiring manager explained to me today that the posting is still not yet written. 

I have been the acting manager for two plus weeks now, and I had hoped it would not come to this but feel stuck accepting it and making the most of it. If I want the hiring manager to take my application seriously, I can't refuse to do the work in an acting capacity. However, I do not feel optimistic that doing the acting role is securing me any extra favor from this manager, and the longer it drags on without even a requisition to apply to the more I suspect he is taking advantage of my willingness to cover it while he looks around for a candidate he thinks is more qualified whom he'd rather hire.

This feels like a bad time to apply to other opportunities, so close to a maybe promotion in place. But if I don't, am I just waiting for the one option for an undefined amount time to maybe not even work out?  I also don't love the idea of working more directly for a hiring manager who doesn't like me, but the ops manager job more closely aligns with my career goals than any of the others I've  seen currently listed.

1iszf22,"I’m 22 and just started my own business a few months ago. Did I mess up by ditching corporate life entirely to go all in on my Social Media Marketing, Photography, and Videography passions, becoming a full-time creative?","Had a summer internship at a big-name health insurance company. Halfway through, I realized corporate life (or at least *that* company’s vibe) wasn’t for me, so I stopped trying for their post-summer extended fellowship program midway through and just focused on finishing my projects for rest of the summer. No regrets—I was happier returning to my freelancing jobs anyway for the remainder of my senior year at Uni.

Fast forward to post-graduation: I applied to 300+ marketing jobs, got one solid offer to be a Social Media Manager, made it to the final round, CEO promised me the job… then ghosted me for months. That’s when I said *screw this* and started my own business. Three months in, I networked my way up in the community to secure four monthly clients + having multiple individual contracted projects on the side. I finally hit $3,300 in revenue for this month. Still charging beginner rates because I am a beginner technically, but the business is growing from the initial month's $764 total revenue!

Thing is, when I see my old internship peers thriving in stable jobs, I can't help feeling a little behind financially and career-wise even though I absolutely LOVE what I do. I pay for my own rent, bills, groceries, and have graciously been gifted gear for my business from my amazing support system of friends and family. I still have a chance to apply to the company again, but I don't exactly know if I have that corporate personality they are searching for. My manager told me there was a rumor among other managers that I am awkward when talking to company leaders. I blame it on always having to speak in front of a crowd of managers watching me as I conversed—felt like I was being judged the whole time. My “corporate talk” often came off stiff and rehearsed, which sucks because I’m actually super extroverted when not being eyed-down by upper management. 

But here I am, after being sucked into a LinkedIn Rabbit Hole, questioning my career choices.

**A few existential crisis questions I have at 2 AM:**

1. **Am I immature for using my early 20s to experiment with my creative endeavors instead of going corporate straight out of college? Or is this the perfect time to do so?** LinkedIn is full of updates of old coworkers successfully obtaining stable jobs with the same company or bigger ones. It stings a bit because the same coworkers also saw me as *immature* in professional settings, which stung—I did my work well and thought I was fairly professional, just maybe not ""corporate polished."" I didn't know about the “work personality vs. real personality” thing when I first came in. And once I *did* figure it out, I hated the idea of faking a persona for 8-9 hours a day, 5 days a week just to save face around coworkers and management. With my clients now? No issues. My clients are mom and pop shops and corporate-lingo isn't their style fortunately for me. I actually feel like my personality gave me leverage with my business and with the clients I have obtained. 
2. **My family thinks I dream too big and wants me back in a ""stable"" corporate job, even pressuring me to return to that same company. How do I know if I’m just being delusional vs. actually persevering toward something real with what I'm doing now?** I love my job. Everyday, I get to create things: videos, graphics, designs... you name it! It's challenging and fun! Each client presents a different set of challenges and their own style of branding, so I'm never bored. It's difficult at times, but I love it so much. I may not be making much now and I do need to keep pushing harder, but the external pressures and persuasions to go back to a stable job make my job harder than it should be. It makes me questions myself and my career choices and if I made the right choice.
3. **Am I naïve for starting a business at 22 and going straight into working with clients? Or even thinking I have a shot of making stable income?** I'm learning new things everyday when it comes to running a business. I went through the correct legal gateways and obtained the licenses, business titles/entity (I have an LLC), and legal contracts I need (plus, getting a CPA). I have a great support system and community that welcomed me into their networking events, socials, and workshops, networking my business along the way! I do feel slightly insecure given I am fresh to this industry, so if anyone has advice or words of encouragement, I would greatly appreciate it!

1iszb2d,Career Advice,"I’m 22 years old and set to graduate from community college with an associate’s degree in business. I’ll be transferring to a four-year university to pursue finance with a minor in accounting. My dream is to become an investment banker or work in a related field.

Recently, I had lunch with a member of the investment banking club at the university I’ll be attending. We talked about what I need to learn, and honestly, it made me feel pretty stupid. I realized I have a lot to catch up on—valuation, DCF, financial modeling—but instead of feeling discouraged, I’m using it as motivation. I want to use this summer to really build a strong foundation.

My school isn’t a “target school,” but I know that if I put in the work, network, and gain relevant experience, I can compete. The challenge I’ve faced in community college is that I don’t really have like-minded peers—most people are here because their parents told them to be. I don’t have anyone to really talk to about investment banking or finance in general.

On top of school, I currently work retail at a clothing store, but I’ve been thinking about getting a part-time job as a teller or banker to boost my resume. Would this help me stand out when applying for internships later on?

I guess my main concern is whether starting at community college will put me at a disadvantage. Am I screwed for not going straight to a four-year university out of high school? And what should I be focusing on to maximize my chances of breaking into IB from a non-target school? What can I do NOW that will help me in the future?

Behavioral health Bachelors from 2016, 2.2 gpa that didn't fetch me any $50k jobs due to no real hard skills. Thought 3 yrs in call center would give me leverage to move up internally, but I found out due to nepotism at BoFA and certain depts of any large corps, if one gets micromanaged chances of letting you move up even if there's openings, movement won't be in your favour they'll try everything to cut you down and keep you stuck. Had some other shitty stuff happen in my life living at home with financially coersive parents making me commit tax fraud pretty much and not let me get on US Medicaid to upskill from 2021 to 2024 making me work 40hr odd jobs just to qualify for Obamacare and waste my time and money that I could've spent 40hrs upskilling towards something actually useful...but the dad got me stuck in a loop even after I explained it to him and I wasn't able to afford to move out he blocked me from Medicaid for a really stupid reason regarding arranged marriage/worried US immigration would block my future wife's immigration into the US and here I am without a decent career in my hands first and foremost. So I'm here in india with extended family.

Here's what I've deduced it and down to plan wise and ordered it down to job/industry interest wise:  

(Online WGU Cybersecurity Masters) 
- Cybersecurity: GRC Analyst to an OFSEC role 
- Telecomm: NOC Tech to Network Engineer
then start slowly transitioning to software dev. 

- If I can't crack the above then I shift to: 
AutoCAD drafting/CNC (operator/programmer/machinist) to be a design engineer 

- If that doesnt work then (WGU MBA) for Supply chain 

if that doesn't work then I shift to: 
- Ins claims adjuster in India or Ins Broker or Medical Coder

If that doesn't work then I shift to: 
- HR or sales

At this point, if none of the above pans out for me: 
- then I have a few other moves i can try to use
but I'll hold off on that for now and try to focus on making it into one of the above here in india first to get some experience to use that to get a job in the US and bring back an online business as well for financial laid off backup...

Does this sound like a good direction to try towards to try and yield the fastest way in terms of settling down financially at this point
What are some of the challenges I'll face that will slow me down or am I making the complete wrong move here in terms of direction by starting with IT since that may take me too long to actually get a job in? ...idk

The big challenge for anyone in my position is not knowing if there are truly enough jobs per quarter for which ever industry/profession I end up cracking into or how long I would last in that industry...or how long it would take for me to get that right interview for me to finally break into the industry...but of course my intention is to stick with one thing since I haven't had the time with the way it's gone for me thus far to actually sit down and grind towards an industry that pays enough and has enough jobs in the market per quarter...and with the atrocious hiring issue going on right now...idk what's gonna happen in the next 2-3 years. But any insight per profession I mentioned up top (pros vs cons) wise of trying to be job ready and timeframe to get that first entry job would be appreciated.

1isyvyx,Can Someone Get Rehired After Resigning Under Investigation? HR Insights Needed,"Hey everyone,

I’m curious to hear from HR professionals or anyone with experience in corporate rehiring policies.

A former colleague of mine resigned from a major bank while they were under investigation for workplace harassment (they weren’t given details due to privacy). They later found out that termination was possibly being considered, but they had already resigned because they felt stressed and uncomfortable returning to work.

From what I understand, their resignation was coded as “resignation under investigation”, which seems to be flagged in the bank’s HR records. A few years have passed, and now they’re wondering:

1️⃣ Would this internal HR flag ever expire, or is it usually permanent?
2️⃣ Have you seen cases where someone resigned under investigation and was rehired later?
3️⃣ Would a hiring manager even have the power to override an HR flag, or would HR always block the application?

I’d love to get insights from people in HR, banking, or corporate recruiting—is rehire even an option in this case, or should they just move on completely?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts!",OkIncome2856,0,0.25,4,1739946093,2025-02-19 06:21:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isyvyx/can_someone_get_rehired_after_resigning_under/,2,2025
1isyrr6,Should I go for the interview?,"Hi all, so I basically got an offer from a pretty decent company and I’ve accepted it. I don’t start till mid March. Signed the offer letter and so have they, and contract will be given on date of joining. I’m not spooked about this as at both my last roles I got the contract on the date of joining (I think it’s industry specific also under 300 people companies).

Now I’m ok with this role, but there is a more niche role at an even smaller company for £10k more. They’ve invited me for a third stage with a lengthy af task. I don’t mind tasks and I’m quite good at them. But, I’m knackered. I’ve done like 11 take home tasks since November. 

Additionally the level of detail in the instructions of how to do the task are a glaring red flag for me as it looks like there’s going to be a lot of micro managing in the role from the HOD. I don’t work well without autonomy, which I was told I’d get with this role. 

However, the industry and job title are interesting and could open a lot of doors for me! 
I’ve learnt that because when applying for jobs these past few months I’ve been specifically asked if I have experience in that area. 

Here are my key issues:
-Cost of travel (not a biggie but I don’t have an income yet so every penny counts)

-I’ve done some brilliant take homes and have always gone to the next stage, but it always comes down to them picking someone who has industry specific experience. I don’t have experience in this industry 

-It’s free labour, when I say it is extremely detailed instructions, it’s like a manual to do a presentation. Never seen a brief this crazy. It’s very blatantly free labour (like usually companies say just a 10-15 min presentation is good, this one’s like you’ll have 60 minutes, they’re not messing around)

-I’m mentally exhausted and I’ve accepted the other offer. I have a tendency to do this and confuse myself (did it with Deloitte and EY 2 years ago, when I could’ve  just not gone for the EY interview and then picked neither of them and accepted an offer at another firm instead) and make the most impulsive and random decision that turns out to be amazing or totally shit. It’s never mid.

-I’ve had a week to do this task, I haven’t started, I can whip it out in 4 hours max, but is it worth it? I have been throwing up out of anxiety of not having a job for 4 months (even when I was on notice)! This is the first vomit-free week I’ve had. Should I just chillax and focus on what I have? 

-I don’t want to take someone else’s chance away. If I get an offer and reject it, the people who are in the running will not receive an offer. Most companies will start the hiring process again. Someone really needs this job out there just like I would’ve had I not had the role already. Why make it harder for a someone who probs can’t afford groceries right now?

-If I work at this company (let’s say company B), my next role will be a monumental jump in pay like an easy £40-48k raise. (Based on market data, and yes, they are underpaying for this role because probably a lot of people with the exp haven’t applied).

-I haven’t started the new role yet, it’s like dating I feel. You’re not exclusive till you say you are. 

I dunno, I’m all over the place. What should I do? Any advice will do!

1isyk5t,Starter Job Dilemma; A vs. B?,"TL;DR: Please read entirely if you can, a lot of important details. However, Job A gives less money, but stressful yet potentially more enjoyable work with better coworkers. Job B gives more cash and offers me an extra day off while still making pretty much the same money, potentially easier work but less enjoyable. 

18M senior highschool. 

I started job A two weeks ago, make okay money one week, then crap money the next. Manager promised I could stay close and I keep getting sent home early. 

I got an offer for a job paying slightly more, so I cannot decide and my parents advice is just “lets see what you think after another week.”

So heres a breakdown of “stats” i guess, in hopes you guys could help me out a little. I need the money for school but also don’t want to feel stressed and want time to do my own things, its the last 5ish months of my childhood. (Anything before college is childhood imo)

Job A:
Keeps getting sent home early, -50 dollars this week, will barely make 110. 
Rude Manager

10$ an hr - Same amount as front desk people watching tiktok in between taking orders. 

Awesome coworkers, two people I’ve really hit it off with already. 
Stressful, sweaty work

I enjoy making Pizza

paid weekly

Scheduled for 26 hours next week, kinda hard to have free time with my gf and family with that, but if I don’t get sent home I’ll earn 260. Only Two days off if I want decent money. 

“One free slice of pizza per shift”

CRAPPY tips, AWFUL even, 0 last week. 

For Job B, my brother works here part time and spoke to the manager today:

11$ an hr
Manager is dope, a close family friend, insane amounts of free food. 

Only Coworker I’ll be chill with is probably my brother, at Job A I have some high school buddies. 

Should be less stress, but I don’t know if I’ll enjoy the work as much as Pizza

So far, promised crap ton hours and the ability to close, brother said he’ll sacrifice his hours if needed. 

MUCH better tips per week, upwards to 20-30 dollars a week. 

More days off, (2-3 vs 2)

paid biweekly unfortunately. 

If promises are kept, I will have 4-5 shifts a week. Putting the range at 21-22hrs for 4 shifts and 26-27hrs for 5. Pay range being 231-286 + 20-30 in tips. 

Proportionately to Job A, I plan on going down to 21 hours because 26 is so much if I stay there. So Job A would be 210 vs 231 + 20-30 in tips.  

231 + 20-30 in tips is 4 shifts and also larger than 5 shifts at Job A, if not only slightly less. And imo, even though I’m a determined worker, I would enjoy the extra day off before my life enters the next stage of working nonstop, even if the money was slightly less.

I’m a 29F currently working in business development in the power sector, and I absolutely do not want to stay here anymore. I have an MBA in Marketing, but my entire experience (4+ years) is in energy, B2B sales, and large projects. I don’t want to go into finance or power again, but I also don’t know which field in marketing would actually suit me.

What I do know:
1. I want a career that’s fast-paced, high-paying, and creative.
2. I’m interested in luxury branding, content strategy, and digital marketing, but I have zero hands-on experience in those fields.
3. My long-term goal is financial independence, international career growth, and a high-end lifestyle (think premium travel, elite networking, and investments in property).
4. I’ve been applying, but all my current job offers are from the power sector, which I want to leave.
5. I’m willing to upskill and learn new things, but I don’t want to waste time on the wrong path.

What do I do? Which industries and roles should I be looking at? Any courses, skills, or transition strategies that actually work?

1istd9l,About to finish my MBA and I am wondering what I should ask for in terms of a raise?,"I asked the sub related to my profession and they were being snotty about the MBA not being related to our field despite me saying I was planning on getting other profession-related certs in the future. My work is paying 70% of my tuition, encouraged me to get it, and when I told my mentors at work about the responses I received, they scoffed and said we are *running a business* so an MBA is absolutely related and useful. The MBA subreddit has a megathread for questions but it doesn't look very active so I came here.

At my work I am currently in training for project management, meaning I'm taking on small projects and learning the ropes. I will be completing my MBA with a project management focus in 12 weeks and then completing the Project Management Professional certification a couple months after that. My program is through LSU's online program so its... not the best, however, I have dedicated a good chunk of time to get it and its still an MBA! My last raise was from $30.25/hr to $33.25/hr in November.

So, based on the quality of the MBA, the perception from my work, my current rate, the additional cert, what should I ask for?",3lli3,1,1.0,8,1739928649,2025-02-19 01:30:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1istd9l/about_to_finish_my_mba_and_i_am_wondering_what_i/,2,2025
1istck3,Do I quit or wait to get fired?,"TLDR: I’m 90% sure I’m getting laid off this week. My contract stipulates a 1 month notice period for quitting. Even if they make me leave earlier, they have to pay the 1 month’s notice. 

Should I quit now or see if they will offer severance? I’ve been at the role for just one month. It is definitely a mismatch.

Context below

Marketing Manager here. Been part of a new department reporting to a Director. It’s been two gruelling months and we haven’t been able to have a full team running. I was promised a full team of 5 by mid January. We have one member since.

Instead, I’m essentially doing the roles of four people with little support. It’s to the point where I consistently OT 1-2 HRS and lose sleep over. Recently I’ve started to have a series small mistakes (think spelling mistakes like a missed period) on outbounds. Thankfully they are all caught by my director as we have a review system in place. 

However this has been happening for two weeks now. It’s where I’m so stressed that I keep tripping on small things I’ve never done in the past. Recently we hired a new hire whom I was to manage directly. However, I’m not getting updates from anyone on hiring process/updates. I was going to send a welcome email but was told to wait until Friday, as their start day was Monday. Strange.

HR was also supposed to set interviews with me and director for new hires. That hasn’t been done.
Increasingly there is now a new slew of work that I’ve been asked not to touch until Friday. I’m told to just focus on current tasks instead of work ahead. I have my usual one on one with him on Thursday. VP, whom I have a monthly sync with cancelled my meeting without any notes. I asked to reschedule, no response

I have never been asked on my call about my stress/mess ups. Its mainly been in review comments they will say “make sure to double check your work”

All signs point to a layoff, but what can I do here? Do I call in medical leave to buy myself some time?

1issd14,Advice needed: Reneging on internship offer due to new offer?,"Hello,

This is a bit of a long post but I feel like context is needed. TLDR at the end.

I am a fourth year aerospace engineering student, aiming to get my masters with an extra year at school(so I'm doing internships this upcoming summer). I love airplanes and really want to work with aviation of some sort. I am interested in ""field A"" of aerospace, and I've been emphasizing this in my coursework and projects. The field is very technical/math based and mentally stimulating, which I am looking for in a job.

A couple of months ago, I accepted an internship in a medium-large defense company, let's say company1. The internship is in field B, which is sort of adjacent to and works together with field A. B, however, isn't nearly as technical and more on the ""systems"" side of things. I might get a bit of exposure to A, but I'm not sure I'd be able to break into A through my time there.

In the past week, I have gotten interviewed and have received an offer from a different company. This company, which we can call company2, is smaller (\~500 employees) and works on a product I am personally more excited about vs. the defense company. This internship is also in field A, my top choice of specialization right now.

I want to work in company2 in field A. However, I'm worried about reneging on my signed job offer at company1. I don't want to lose my connections at company1, and I'm worried I will be blacklisted from the company.

For context, I interned at company1 through a connection last summer (in field C, which I am not interested in anymore), which is part of the reason I was re-hired into it for field B.

Right now, here are the pros and cons as I see them:

**Company1, field B:**

Pros:

* Almost certain to get a job offer out of college, most likely in field B but maybe in field A if I get lucky.
* Stable and secure employment in the future, company isn't going to go down anytime soon
* It's where my hometown is, so I could live at home with my family (no homesickness + no rent)
* Higher pay
* I know someone at company1 in fieldA. I actually tried to intern in company1 field A through his connection, but they wanted someone else. I could maybe use that connection to get into field A? But he's been sort of iffy on it tbh

Cons:

* Field B is not my preferred choice of field. Might be mentally understimulating. (I've had a past internship in field B at a company similar to company2 actually)
* Could try to break into field A but it might be hard and take a few years
* Products aren't as interesting (though still pretty cool), not too excited about the mission (its defense)
* bigger company, so my work would be more specialized, and I might not get to follow the products from design to test

**Company2, field A:**

Pros:

* The field that I like, field A.
* Could get a job offer in field A right out of college
* Work culture sounds exciting, I'm more passionate about this mission
* Smaller company, so there's more to do and I can follow the aircraft from design to test

Cons:

* I would potentially lose all connections to company1, which I might want to work for eventually. I might be able to re-apply but I've heard of stories of people getting blacklisted for doing this. Company1 is the only company in my hometown that works in aeronautics and is a strong contender for my long-term work place.
* Farther away from home, would need to rent a place
* Since it's a smaller, new company, job security isn't as certain in the future. They seem to be doing pretty well now though
* If I end up not liking field A(I've never interned with field A), it will be pretty difficult to switch out of it due to the small nature of the company
* Lower pay

The biggest con here is obviously losing my connection to company1. Company1 was perfectly good to work for, nothing super special but solid workplace overall. It is also the only aerospace company in my hometown, which I am quite fond of, so it would really suck to not be able to return to my hometown to work forever. On the other hand, company2 in general sounds more exciting as a workplace, and obviously it is in my field of interest. If I like company2, I could work at a great company in a great field right out of college.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

TLDR: I have an offer at company1 in a field I sort of like but isn’t what I’m really interested in. Just got an offer from company2, with a more exciting mission, in the field I am interested in. I want to accept that offer but I’m worried about all of the drawbacks, most notably losing my connection to and getting blacklisted from company1, which is a great place to work for me.",anon0110101010,1,1.0,2,1739925906,2025-02-19 00:45:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1issd14/advice_needed_reneging_on_internship_offer_due_to/,2,2025
1isrxcl,"23f - been in 3 office jobs, feeling lost and hopeless","Hi! I have been down many webpage rabbit holes, used ChatGPT to no end to try and work out my problems, but figured I'd come talk to some humans (even if online) about how I'm feeling.

  
I'm currently 23f (almost 24!) and since I graduated from university in 2023, I have worked 3 different professional full time roles in higher education. My first role was given to me as I was graduating undergrad, so I didn't have a break between school and adulting which was difficult. After my 6 month contract, and realizing the upper management was super toxic (ageism was at play and younger people in the office were being targeted by our director) my contract was not renewed and I found out about it like 3-4 days before my contract was supposed to end, and they posted my position. I didn't even bother applying, I was so upset. 

I was unemployed for 3 months, then got a job at a different institution, which I felt would be a fresh start, and working in academic advising, different from the work I had previously done. I was so excited and naive to think it would all be better. The commute was considerably farther for me (about 45-50 mins one way, my first role was about 10 mins from home) but I thought it was worth it for the fresh start. A couple months in, similar issue, except it was mainly our manager who was super toxic and there was high turnover, people talking gossip and negative all day long about management, and it became unbearable. I was desperate to leave. 

So then, I landed my third and current full-time position, back in student recruitment where I first started working, still within the same university I was working my academic advising job, but different department. I heard so many great things about this department and was very excited. Now it's been about 6 months in this role, and unfortunately, once again, management has become very toxic. My current leader has become very detached in his role, provides no real leadership or guidance, and leaves us to fend for ourselves. Despite multiple conversations I've had to bring concerns, I've either been placated or outright dismissed. 

  
I used to be someone who cared very deeply about their career (I am even currently enrolled in a Masters part time related to this field) but now I feel so disillusioned and exhausted by all these toxic environments, being short staffed, and as a result, being overworked. I was definitely burned out by my first time role, my second I was coasting becuase I knew there was no growth for me there, and now in my current role, I have stopped giving 120% because I was being taken advantage of for being so competent and taking initiative. 

I feel like I've lost a lot of my social support, many of my friends have moved away, or have different priorities now, so even though we keep in touch, it's not nearly as often as it used to be (and I know post-college life transition is difficult, I just didn't anticipate how difficult)

Now I just feel totally lost in my life. I am so young but I feel like full-time work has changed me and my anxiety is so crippling that I allow work stressors to impact me so. All I want at the end of the day is a peaceful work environment where I can do my thing, not be micromanaged, dismissed, gaslit, overworked, etc. Am I naive to think this is achievable? Is it the industry I'm in? Is it my perception and approach to life?

I really would appreciate any insights on where to go from here, because I am so tired of feeling so alone, exhausted, trapped in my own anxiety, and feel like I'm just going through the motions.",theunspokenwords__,1,1.0,2,1739924723,2025-02-19 00:25:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isrxcl/23f_been_in_3_office_jobs_feeling_lost_and/,2,2025

1isqpio,Feeling Stuck in My HR Receptionist Role – Should I Stay or Start Looking?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working as an HR Receptionist at a college since June 2024, and I’m starting to feel like this role isn’t the right fit for me long-term. The work is very repetitive and boring, and now I’m responsible for electronically uploading and maintaining ALL employee files, which wasn’t in the original job description.

I also don’t have my own office, so I constantly deal with loud conversations in the lobby while trying to make calls or focus on tasks. On top of that, I’ve taken on a lot of administrative assistant responsibilities—handling employee files, scheduling, processing reports, managing supplies—but I don’t have the title or pay to reflect it.

I like some aspects of HR, and I don’t want to write off the field just because of this experience, but I wish I had a different title like HR Assistant or Administrative Assistant.

Right now, I’m debating whether I should start job hunting or stay for a full year to strengthen my resume. If I don’t get promoted by then, I’d definitely move on.

During the recruiter screen for the start-up I told them that I'm only considering roles with a $150-200k comp. I also told them the expectations of the role are more in line with a more senior title than what they're offering. They said they would have to check if there was any wiggle room and asked if I was willing to proceed based on them finding out. They scheduled me for next stage but never clarified on what wiggle room there was, so I emailed them to withdraw stating that I can't accept a role that doesn't fall into my desired comp and I don't want to waste their teams time with interviewing. 

The recruiter hit back to say that they want me to complete all stages of interviews (5 stages) and if I got to offer stage they would then go to leadership to request if they can increase the budget for the role/title change. Problem is...I don't want to waste several hours of my time interviewing just to get a shitty offer. They would need to get approval for $30k+ over their budget and idk how realistic that is.

I’m a 29F currently working in business development in the power sector, and I absolutely do not want to stay here anymore. I have an MBA in Marketing, but my entire experience (4+ years) is in energy, B2B sales, and large projects. I don’t want to go into finance or power again, but I also don’t know which field in marketing would actually suit me.

What I do know:
1. I want a career that’s fast-paced, high-paying, and creative.
2. I’m interested in luxury branding, content strategy, and digital marketing, but I have zero hands-on experience in those fields.
3. My long-term goal is financial independence, international career growth, and a high-end lifestyle (think premium travel, elite networking, and investments in property).
4. I’ve been applying, but all my current job offers are from the power sector, which I want to leave.
5. I’m willing to upskill and learn new things, but I don’t want to waste time on the wrong path.

What do I do? Which industries and roles should I be looking at? Any courses, skills, or transition strategies that actually work?

1isoinl,Turning point,"Throw away acct because I'm probably just riding the low as most business owners are familiar with but genuinely curious of my options. 
Here's what's up, so I am a business owner and have been for the last 20 years. I started a small engineering company in a HCOL when I was in my early 20s (my career at the time was fine in a corporate setting but I have never wanted to be in the office grind) and after several successful years it all disappeared because of outsourcing to India which flattened my industry.
   Having a family and needing to find something quick I started a construction based company (had no idea what I was doing but faked it till I made it) and have now been in business for 15 years. Company gross is around 500k with half a dozen employees and I personally bring home about 150k working about 20hrs average per week doing the sales/estimates aspect of the company.
   That all said here is where the problem lies, the people. The customers (mainly since Covid) have been awful. Un attainable expectations, they don't pay the bill when jobs are completed, entitled, always knows better than the contractor (everytime I hear that they saw on Google or YouTube how to do things I wanna lose it) and frankly a bit racist at times but carefully done so as not to get canceled lol. We have all 5 star reviews but only because my job title has become ""Professional butt kisser"" (atleast that's how it feels). 
   Now before someone says our service needs to be improved please understand we have great service and reviews but that doesn't keep customers from constantly trying to lie to extort us out of money, berate our employees and generally, well, suck. A lot of it can be attributed to the area I live and work in (entitlement is off the charts). 
  Here is the heart of the post, I can continue to do what I'm doing but I'm getting to the upper 40s and it's all catching up. I am making good money and the hours/flexibility are hard to beat but all I see all day are luxury cars and huge houses that I'll never see on my salary with a family. Fact is I'm a salesman, have been since I was 5. My parents hated arguing with me because I always got the upper hand, some say I can be manipulative but isn't that a transferable skill set lol. 
  What I am asking is if I sell the company and decided to persue a career in sales for the next 20 years where would I start? What should I expect? I love sales, truly enjoy it. I have spoken to thousands of customers, countless suppliers, reps, advertisers over the last 20 years, sales is who I am. I love to travel and have been to quite a few international destinations and would drop it all if the right opportunity came up that would allow me to work from home and live wherever I want but I'm not sure how realistic that is. 
  AM I too old to persue a change? I loved being home all the time for my kids but the last one is almost moving along so I might be bored and welcome the increased workload with unlimited options to relocate. Oh yeah, and what would I even sell? I can sell anything really, practically invented the ice trays to eskimos line but where would it be most worth it and where to start?
  Maybe just skirting this low point but thought getting some opinions would be a good start. ",Rocknhardpla-e,2,1.0,4,1739914722,2025-02-18 21:38:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isoinl/turning_point/,2,2025
1iso9n7,Should I stay or should I go?,"I currently feel really lucky to have the job I have. I’m a school-based therapist for a middle school that pays very well and I only work 197 days. The biggest issue is that it's a little over an hour commute from where I live (in a home we bought a few years ago). The job itself is a brand new position which means we’re still in the process of building it up which includes learning billing and that’s been challenging. In the past 2 years I haven’t loved what I do. I don’t know if it’s the setting or lack of experience. I just don’t feel competent in sessions, learning diagnoses, etc. All things considered, I’m seeking advice on staying there another school year to finish up clinical hours (I’m at about 2,000 of 3,000) or switching up to either a local group practice or applying to school counseling type positions since I have my PPS. I think I’d like to work in the schools still since I’m 27 and wanting to have kids soon. But I’m open to other positions as well. I’m really good at creating and organizing, I feel I’d get bored sitting listening to clients all day which sounds awful. My husband and I have considered moving to the city of my school but I don’t want to move unless I absolutely love what I’m doing.

Side note: there aren't any school based mental health positions closer to me. And school counseling or private group practice would both be significantly less pay but I wouldn’t get any hours toward licensure as a school counselor.

So, should I stick it out for another year and get used to the commute or sacrifice trying to find something closer to home?",Flxwer_child,1,1.0,1,1739914128,2025-02-18 21:28:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iso9n7/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,2,2025
1iso8w6,I got fired today - where to go now,"TLDR - sacked today after nearly 2 years after openly speaking about my mental health issues and managing on my own to my best ability. Manager said I should never have passed my probation but kept me employed for nearly 2 years. I don’t feel sad but I feel used. Where do I go now?


I, F 26, had worked at my ‘ex’ job since August 2023. During this time I have struggled deeply with mental health issues and personal problems, which I have also been dealing with and trying to overcome for years prior to starting here. I will not deny there are 2 occasions where I had gone AWOL whilst in the bout of an episode. These at the time felt like they were understood and I have been focusing a lot on my mental wellbeing and ensuring it doesn’t slip into my work life since as I completely understand how important working is.

At the point of employment, August 2023, I was told one of my colleagues would be going on maternity in the coming February. Along with this one of my colleagues (Colleague A) would be retiring in December 2023 and another leaving for a new role in October 2023.This would have left me running both Sales and Purchase Ledger for a company, whose sales aren’t just a straight forward job of raising invoices. There are a lot of complexities involved and a lot of other boring accounts jargon. Previously the workload was shared between 3 people and no help was looked for until I had my first hiccup. It was verbally said that another member of staffs son (Colleague B) would be learning the sales side of the accounts office to relieve all the pressure from me. It had never at any point in my interview had it been said to me that I would ever have to run the entire accounts department on my own anyway, but I was relieved to have some assistance.

The training Colleague B and I received for the sales was adequate as we were being trained by a Colleague A who was heavily pregnant, and I can only empathise how stressful that must have been as she had only had minimal training herself - colleague mentioned earlier retiring had gatekept all knowledge on the sales for about 20 years. Neither myself or Colleague B complained about this and instead tried our best to muddle through. A lot of questions were asked and certain mistakes were made. 

After around 9 months (February 23 - November 23), my manager decided that the office was now settled to a point to bring someone in to take over Purchases for me so I could move onto Sales. At the time I was excited to have someone new come on. We begun training mid-December and was meant to do a couple of hours on any working days in between Christmas and New Year. We would be paid for a full day but only have to work a few hours which was fair, the person I was training made no effort at all to get involved. So to cover her back I did the work because I didn’t want her to get in trouble. When we returned to the office, now January 2024, we continued training, she didn’t seem too enthusiastic but I left her to it. I wasn’t being paid anymore than her and we were on the same level in office hierarchy, so I didn’t deem it right to say anything to my manager or to try and encourage her. As an adult she could decide that herself. Eventually my manager started to notice and I was honest about what was happening, as I was still monitoring the inboxes just incase along with training. After not too long my manager picked up on this and there was a whole drama with the fact her boyfriend had given her a reference. 

For around a month after I spent time tidying and fixing all the mistakes and bits missed. This was alongside still having a hand in sales and completing any other random tasks that people needed help with. I always went beyond to try and help people. Shortly after this my manager decided we would try again and that I would be involved in the process. Again I have no experience and with the 3 candidates we received, we had to decide who would be the best fit in the office. We were both in agreement on one of the women. This turned out to be a mistake. My confidence in my ability to train had been knocked at this point as I doubted myself for the last person, but I pushed ahead. I approached it calmly and put the past aside. Unfortunately the second cover didn’t last as even Colleague B was fed up of hearing me tell her the same things over and over, as it was the same questions constantly. Along with this there was an issue with personal space as she would consistently try to hug people at work. This was something that made me feel uncomfortable when it was forced upon me and was something I brought up as I can be weirded out on being touched involuntary. This time I felt a lot more sadness but also relief, I felt bad it hadn’t worked for her but relieved of the pressure of the constant questions over and over again as it made me doubt whether I even knew myself.

During the time of July 2024 - November 2024, Colleague B and I went back to muddling on just the two of us. Colleague B wasn’t happy as he didn’t get on with our manager and also never wanted a job in accounts to begin with. We had the additional pressure of another member of staff retiring so had to start planning a further hand over. I went out of my way to be as helpful as possible at work and even suggested I travel 200 miles down south to do at least a bit of training in person. Meanwhile, I had been struggling with issues at home that had triggered my mental health but was trying my best to persevere. It got to a point where I had to go and get medication from the doctors. I did this as I wanted to be able to cope at work and with life. At first I only experienced headaches and didn’t struggle too much, then once my dose was upped due to still not feeling like I can cope I started to have issues with waking in a morning. During this time I was completely open and honest about my mental health issues to my manager and communicated about my problems with the medication. 

In November 2024 Colleague B handed his notice in. So the process of recruiting began again. Colleague C was then employed. She would have a handover in the 3 weeks Colleague B was left in the business and would learn sales, I would continue with purchases and sales, and Colleague A would come back and overview the office. After around 2 weeks it was decided that they would now get a fourth member of staff, Colleague D to take over the sales I was learning. In the end this would leave Colleague C & D running the sales side, myself on purchases, and Colleague A as a supervisor. When Colleague B left it came to light that the training had been poor and many key points had been missed. Colleague D also only had around 5 weeks to again gain around 12 years of knowledge, on the premise that I’d had about 5 weeks of training. 

As mentioned before I have always gone out of my way to help people at work, more often than not going beyond what I should do. But both new colleagues are now months in and it had become exhausting being in the office, it was making me unhappy. They both clashed on numerous occasions but I kept quiet because it wasn’t worth getting involved and I just wanted to work peacefully. I had to manage questions from both of them whilst doing my own work for around 3 weeks, until Colleague A returned full time from maternity, this seriously drained me mentally especially when I was already mentally checking out. I had also been struggling bad with waking up with the medication so decided to stop as I didn’t want them stopping me from working. 

After returning from Christmas, January 2025, I came back with a fresh mindset. Things were starting to feel positive. I got offered the chance to go to Thailand for 2 weeks and jumped at the opportunity after clearing it with work. This turned out to be a disaster in itself and whilst I was out there Colleague A went out of her way to contact me. As I was on my own in Asia I opened up and kept her updated so she knew I was safe, we had one phone call the entire time. Once I got back to the UK I was embarrassed about the whole situation in Thailand as it involved a guy I had been bragging about at work. To not drag it out into work upon returning I thought it would be best to not divulge. I told the summary of what happened and tried not to talk about it anymore. I had also come back to pretty much two weeks worth of work to catch up on as none of it had been covered, this was due to Colleague A having things going on outside of work and the other two not having any time prior to also learn my role. I am understanding that things had happened but it just felt so disheartening after I have spent nearly 2 years covering and picking up things for other people, and also persevering to my best ability despite my mental health issues. Colleague A sent me a message on my first day asking for a catch up, I politely declined as I said it is best for me to keep my head down and just crack on. I did this because I didn’t want to bring any of my personal issues into work which I had previously been advised against doing. A second message was then sent which I genuinely did not see. This was raised as an argument of me being ignorant and disruptive and I verbally expressed I wouldn’t have ignored it on purpose, it was one of the reasons used for my dismissal today. Another reason is the fact Colleague D burst into tears, after I responded to her in the same tone she had spoken to me in. Further comments include any mental health episodes, along with the fact of my medication and sleep; which I stopped and have since improved my time management.

During my termination my manager said I should have never passed probation but only did because my quality of work is good. Is this not proof then they have just milked me dry for the greater good of their business. If I wasn’t right after 3 months then why did they keep me employed all this time. Another point which has been used against me is I made a comment about my own mental health and something I was personally going through. It was solely about myself and aimed at no one, Colleague D has claimed it to be harassment as her son suffers with depression. I have been in and out of mental health services since the age of 14 so I am confused how I cannot say something about myself and my situations that are personal to me. This is whilst I have been having to deal with Colleague D make constant sexual remarks which are just gross and not even funny. 

After all of this I feel so relieved to be out of there. It feels like a weight has been lifted, even though I have rent to pay for and I need to get a new job asap. Usually I would be spiralling but I’m taking it as an opportunity to start again and focusing on moving ahead. I do also feel used by my employer knowing they dragged me along all this time if they didn’t think I was right for the job and have instead waited until they have a full team. Am I best just deleting that time in my life and completely focus on the future, or should I at least feel something for the fact I’ve lost my job?

1isnvh2,Career Advice,"Hey all, need some advice here.

I'm a finance major, graduating this semester. I left my previous ops internship (1 yr duration) to come to take an opportunity at a new company, which ended up being an internship in settlements. This is at one of the larger energy trading companies in the country. This is a Spring internship, after that I'll be on in the summer as well, they've vocalized that they'll keep me in the same role. Then likely full time after that.

Basically, I do settlements for energy trading. Now, my team is cool, I like everyone. But the work itself I just do not enjoy in the slightest. I think it boils down to the fact that I've realized I cannot sit at a desk behind a screen all day (my previous internships weren't quite like that). Right about now you're probably thinking: ""well, you picked finance as your major ding dong""... and you'd be right. Regardless, to me, the work is tedious, This isn't to say I'm not asking questions and trying to learn, because I believe I am. It really comes down to the fact that I just do not find the work fulfilling, enjoyable, or interesting at all.

Even being one of the traders or front office people does not sound all that enticing to me. 

Ultimately, I've always planned to make rental property ownership/real estate my primary income, after enough time. But even with this as just a ""temporary career"" (assuming real estate works out) I just do not love it.

I'm betting the general consensus will be to just ride it out, but, in my mind, now is the time to experiment and change paths dramatically.

1islssr,Advice needed for communication skills with higher management,"A bit of back story but the title kind of says the tldr. 

I was promoted from a senior position to a senior manager a little while ago. I love this opportunity and have given it my all.

I've taken on a team of people 20+, globally. Which requires me to work and be available across multiple timezones (Asia, americas, middle east etc). 

We introduced performance targets and smashed them. I've worked on documentation, managing people, training and other things. This has involved me doing many more hours than requested, and being given tasks which are impossible to complete in just normal hours. However I've always tried and often succeeded in them. I've hired new staff, reviewed performance of current staff and such as well. 

All indicators imply that I'm doing a good job, (something's not mentioned here). I'll keep them to myself, however my manager has implied that I don't know how to work with higher management (directors and c level), which has me puzzled. I've done this before in smaller companies without issue. 

I would like to take this feedback and grow from it, but I'm never given time to learn/develop/improve. The area of the business I work in is chaos and in constant demand. 

I am therefore left wondering if this is simply a way to get out of giving me a bonus, or if it's genuine. If it is genuine and no training is provided on how to improve beyond a quick 5 minute chat, what can I do about this? 

I love the company, so I want to improve and push forward in my career but with only a couple of people above me, I now need to learn how to impress a different set of people which I guess I'm not skilled in.

Can anyone offer some guidance here. ",robbo2020a,1,1.0,1,1739908239,2025-02-18 19:50:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1islssr/advice_needed_for_communication_skills_with/,2,2025
1islfli,would you take the offer?,"**Context:**

* **Current Role/Comp**:
   * Director, 6 years at the same company (promoted 3 times).
   * Total comp: $155K (includes $147K base + 5% 401(k) match fully vested + $500 HSA).
   * After-tax around $121K (counting the match since it’s already vested).
   * Fully remote, stable position, but I feel my growth has plateaued after a merger.
* **New Offer**:
   * VP title.
   * $170K base + 5% 401(k) match (5-year vesting).
   * After-tax roughly $130K (ignoring the match, since it’s not immediately vested).
   * Hybrid schedule (3 days in office).
   * I’d work directly with a regional CFO who’s been with the company for 25+ years, which could be great for learning/mentorship.

**My Situation**:

* At my current company, I have a solid reputation and sometimes get pulled into high-level ad-hoc projects, but I’m no longer in a visible role like I was before the merger. I don’t see a clear path for advancement where I am.
* Over the past year, I’ve interviewed for three high-level roles:
   * Director (acting CFO) at $325K base (3 rounds, no offer).
   * VP at $220K (4 rounds, no offer; I really thought I had this one).
   * Currently in early stages for another VP role around $210K.
* These $200K+ roles are **competitive** and appear **infrequently**. I’m 32 with about 10 years of experience, which can be considered “young” for these bigger positions.
* The VP offer at $170K isn’t at the $200K mark I’d prefer (especially as I’m thinking about future life plans), but it’s still a title bump and might open doors. However, it also means going from fully remote to hybrid, and the 401(k) match is on a 5-year vest schedule.

**Question**:

* Should I accept this VP position (and gain title/experience working closely with a seasoned CFO), even though the comp isn’t where I’d ideally like it to be?
* Or should I keep searching for a $200K+ role (knowing they’re tougher to land and could take more time)?

1isl8yx,Thinking about quitting my current job in the future,"So, I have been working with little ones since I was about 22. I basically got stuck in this field because it seemed like it was the only job that would hire me for some reason. I’ve been doing it consistently for almost 10 years and Im officially burnt out. The new job I have working with ages 3-5 pays pretty well (53k) annually. Which is the most I’ve ever been paid in this field. However, there are some major stressors for me that have made me decide to move on to another place or a new field of work. This company has a mix of children on the spectrum. It is sooo hard for me to deal with mentally. We get no support and I feel like my job as a teacher can not be done with constant disruption. I am not trained to work with special ed. My family tells me to to try and stick it  through but it’s just becoming more and more difficult. I literally mentally check out when there’s a lot of screaming , crying, and redirection physically all day .

1isk7un,is bank teller job worth it?,"mainly just the question mentioned above.

i’ve been working in an after school program for some time as my only job thus far. had went to college + graduated to teach full time but i don’t want to go into teaching anymore and have been mainly doing tutoring and the afterschool program since. a family member recently offered me a job at a smaller bank branch he works at (nothing big like chase, BoA, etc, something more local and small-community-like). they had worked as a teller there, and mentioned that it was a slow-paced and easier job for them. i feel that it could be a good match for me, esp since im on the spectrum / autistic and am pretty slow processing. 

i was especially considering taking it these days because i haven’t been liking the work culture at my workplace lately and haven’t been as keen on working in education anymore. however, i would like to know if a bank teller position would be a good fit for me, and for any experience in working as one, particularly in a smaller branch.

1isjwez,Invited to participate a workshop with senior management as an introvert - any tips?,"I'm working as a marketer for a foreign retail bank. Our local unit represents one of the biggest markets for the group in terms of market size, income contribution and growth potential.

HQ (global brand management) has now invited various different market leaders to workshops in order to update the overall brand strategy. Each country has its own workshop, with senior managers (local CEO/country manager, local head of retail, local head of brand & marcoms) participating.

As I was helping prepare our contribution to the deck, my boss invited me to join the workshop. Problem is that I'm a bit of an introvert and sometimes have trouble speaking up when participating in a setting like this, where basically everyone else has much higher seniority and much higher pay grade.  

Any suggestions on how to best prepare for this kind of setup in which I'll be the only 'standard employee' (without leadership responsibility)?  I’m not too concerned about the factual / business side of things as I was helping prepare our position. I’m more concerned about how my appearance and how I can use this visibility for positioning myself.

I’m 23, from Italy, and I recently finished my bachelor's degree in psychology on time. I'm now pursuing a master's in Work and Organizational Psychology and have just completed my first semester with great results.

The issue is that my only work experience so far has been as a delivery rider for Deliveroo and Glovo. I’m wondering if I should include these jobs on my resume, considering that they aren’t directly related to my field. Would it add any value, or should I leave them out?

1isj8tj,Should I pursue my bachelors of nursing (I am currently a registered practical nurse),"Hey everyone, apologies in advance for the long post. I've been an RPN (registered practical nurse) in Ontario for the last 10 years. I'm recently considering pursuing my bachelors in nursing, but I'm not sure if it's the right choice.

Throughout my career, I haven't enjoyed most of my jobs in hospitals or long term care. More recently in the last 4 years, I found a niche in medical dermatology, and I really enjoy it.

I currently make $33 an hour. From what I understand, if I had my bachelors (RN degree) I could make $38-60 dollars per hour. I've been told that there are more opportunities for RN's, however, now that I've had a Monday to Friday job I really don't want to go back to shift work.

I've been accepted into the bachelor's program, and while I was initially excited, I'm not sure if it would be the right choice.

I started a new job about 6 months ago, with a boss that is absolutely fantastic, respectful of me, and sees my value. They see me as part of their practice long term and have told me they would like to give me raises and put me in more of a leadership position.

I've had a difficult time financially for the last few years, so by the time I start school, I will have just enough saved to cover the program. That means once I graduate, I'll basically have 0 dollars to my name and will have to start from scratch again at 38.

I'm currently 35 years old, have been in a relationship for two years, and plan to have kids in 3-4 years. That will be a bit tough without having a nest egg of money saved up by that time. Also, I understand the bachelors program is stressful and time consuming, and part of me feels like I should just keep doing what I'm doing so I will be able to save money and enjoy these early years with my partner, travelling and spending important time together before bringing kids into the mix.

I guess I'm worried that pursuing school and graduating at 38 years old will set all of my relationship goals back. And if we don't start trying to have kids until 5/6 years from now, I may have extra difficulty getting pregnant.

After tax, would I really be taking home much more money as an RN than I am now? Should I just bite the bullet, go back to school and struggle financially for the next 3 years? Or should I continue at my current job, see where this new leadership role that I will start January 2026 will take me? After all, throughout my whole career I've never had such an amazing boss like this. What if I am unhappy in the RN role and have crappy bosses, having to bounce around from job to job to find something I enjoy, like I did with my RPN career?

What would you do in my situation?

Also to note, I'm quite a creative and artistic person. Part of me feels that if I dedicate the time towards pursuing a second side hustle, I could make more money that way.

1isia4a,Disclosing reason for leaving last role,"Hi, 

I was recently dismissed following an investigation period for gross misconduct. 

In summary, the dismissal for was advising a junior member of staff to do something that breached a company policy, along with allowing a non onboarded person to complete a shift. Neither caused loss, theft or direct damages to the company and it was a civil process. 

I am completely at peace with the dismissal; and hold a very good relationship with my previous employer who have also agreed to not disclose the reason for me leaving employment to any future employers.

However, I have an interview next week with a direct competitor business, and I’m unsure whether to disclose the fact I was dismissed for gross misconduct, or to just say I left due to personal reasons. My concern is, although my previous employer has agreed to not disclose the information, the businesses both share a lot of suppliers, customers and former staff, and am aware my dismissal could possibly get mentioned at a later date. 

The role is a single step down in the ‘hierarchy’ from my last role. 

Is it best to be honest and tell them the full story? Or keep it short and sweet and just focus on the key details to summarise; or just avoid this entirely and state I left for personal reasons.

1isgxkj,Leaving permanent job for a 12 month fixed term contract,"Hi,

  
I have been at my current job as a Network Engineer for 3.5 years which is longer than what I wanted to work to be honest. I'm not working on projects or with equipment that I want to. I have little motivation and there's no room for progression - all roles above me are filled and won't be vacant anytime soon. Moreover, even if they did come up I'm not sure I'd want to put up with the shit that my seniors have to.

  
A job has come up at a business that I have had my eyes on for a while now.

Pros:

* Great reviews on sites such as Glassdoor
* Highly recommended by a former colleague who has been there for several years now
* Better pay
* More flexible work opportunities 
* Higher budget
* Opportunities to work with better/more industry recognised vendors and equipment - will look better on my CV

Cons:

* Fixed term contract for 12 months - I believe this is because there are secondments in the team, so they need the roles filling whilst their guys are on secondment roles.
* Pension not as good as my current employer (I'm 27 and don't really care at this moment in time to be honest).

I'm really pulling my hair out over this. On one hand, the pros outweigh the cons, but on the other, I've got a mortgage. 

  
Would appreciate any advice with this.

1isglep,To reach or to peace?,"I’m in the fortunate position of being in round 2 of interviews for 2 positions. I can’t decide what I should do should I get offer/offers. 

I currently work from home in the healthcare field. I don’t agree with some of the ethical practices and, after failed attempts to make changes with them, I have to make a change for me.

1) The first job I actually applied to last year and got declined due to lack of management experience (which is fair). The interview went really well though, and they came back to me last month when their hire didn’t work out. 

It’s a big job. Director of a service line. But I worked at a sister site earlier in my career and feel confident. I’m not sure I would feel the same way about my skills at another place. 

I would live at that job. Help people in person again. Help shape the field. Buuut I’m going to be walking into a shit show- lots of firings in last year to basically start fresh. It’s also far away from friends and family.

2) the 2nd gig is remote, so I can be where I want to be within the state. It’s a consultant position where I’m basically doing the same job I’m doing today, but with a better company with much better benefits. It’d be an easy transition and easy lifestyle. I have loved working from home. I take so much better care of myself physically, emotionally, spiritually. I spend all day with my animals and get to go on walks whenever I want. Yes, I do feel isolated sometimes, but I’ve adjusted to be more intentional about socialization. It’s just with people I love! We could get a RV (S.O. also works from home) and easily travel whenever we want. 

The pay of these jobs is identical. 

Any guidance would be much appreciated. My journal doesn’t talk back unfortunately.

I'm a second-year undergraduate student in a three-year bachelor's in economics and minor in mathematics course. 

Recently, Accenture recruited interns from my college for a data analyst role with good pay and I did not get in. I talked to one of the people who did and what stood out was that my CV was heavily based on research (in economics, business, and finance) and related writing. I was earlier interested in consultancy roles, and while I have not shut that out entirely, I do want the option to pivot into data/quant.

The person who got in had done certifications in R and PowerBI (Coursera and Udemy). Having read through the blog of an acquaintance who had completed certain online courses from HBS and was impressed by the quality, I was hoping to do the same but HBS online courses cost $1800+ and the conversion rates make it impossible for me to afford such courses.

It would be extremely helpful if I could get a repository of credible and affordable (or free) courses/certifications on data software like Excel, SQL, R, Python, etc. and fundamentals of financial modelling, regression analysis and the likes which could help me upskill and land roles in the industry.

1isdb6a,Parent Corporation of Former Employer Wants to Interview,"Hi everyone, I have a…. confusing (?) event that has occurred and will be ongoing at least through this week. I apologize for the length and I hope the post is at least somewhat coherent.

Back in 2023 I worked for a company that was literally my all-time dream job. I was so happy and, by all accounts, I was doing well. I felt good about my performance and the feedback I was getting from all of my colleagues was consistently very positive. This was the case until about 3 months when I was suddenly terminated. I got a message from HR asking to call them in teams and I thought it was a check-in to see how I was adjusting to my position at the company (they had checked in this way a time or two before - not in a concerned way (at least no concerns were made known to me) but in a formality “hey we’re just checking in to see how things are going” way). It might be important to note that almost my entire team in-house was new, either in their position or entirely new to the company, except for one person. Anyway, I made a video call to my HR point person right away as asked and right away they started with “we regret to inform you…” I was stunned. My jaw literally dropped and my mouth was agape for probably her entire spiel. I was completely blindsided. This was at the end of the day on a Friday and at no point during that day, that week, or the previous two weeks was I given any indication that my employment wasn’t working out or that I was doing something wrong. I didn’t know what to do in that moment except ask “why??! is there anything I can do or anyone I can talk to in order to rectify the situation or straighten out any misunderstanding???” The HR person very mechanically said “we will not be giving you a reason and by law we are not obligated to give you a reason. The decision has been made and it is final.” to which I said “okay but in the spirit of courtesy usually a reason is given or some conversation is had prior to this kind of action. This is so sudden and I’m devastated, surely this is a misunderstanding.” To which she repeated herself like a robot. At this point I was crying and stumbling over my words, and to avoid looking like Pearl (“I’m a starrrrrrr!!!”) I just sort of went into autopilot and did whatever they asked. I was given a severance package and told my official last day would be Monday as it was the first day of the next month and that way I could keep my insurance for one more month. Even though my last day was technically the coming Monday, I was locked out of my company account pretty much instantly after the meeting with HR. 

To say I was devastated about losing this job would be an understatement. It’d been my goal since I was 18 to work at this company. It drove a lot of my academic, professional, and personal choices (like extracurriculars/clubs/events). I didn’t think I would be able to get into the company so soon as when I did and I very much planned on it being my life’s career. I’ll be the first person to say that your colleagues - especially your bosses and HR - are not your friends and that your job is not a family. Regardless, this really felt like a break up where I was just blindsided then ghosted. I didn’t really know what direction to go in job-hunting wise because in my mind I’d hit my peak and achieved my ultimate goal. Plus I was locked out of the industry for a year due to a non-compete (the yearlong timeline for this just to ended). I still don’t know why I was terminated. 

Fast forward to nearly a year and a half later and I’m still unemployed (not for lack of trying, but that’s its own sob story that can probably just be chalked up to it fucking sucks out here). Filling out forms (applications), going to meetings (interviews), and exchanging emails/phone calls is still my full-time job, but now I’m doing it for free 🥲.

A few weeks ago, I saw a job posted by a mutual from parent company on LinkedIn for a position that perfectly matches my skill set at the parent corporate company of my former employer. I actually worked with this person very frequently during my time with my old company and we got along great, often having fun side conversations during our meetings and correspondence. In fact, I worked with many people from the parent company and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say I worked with parent company employees much more often than the people in my own department at my own company. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized the employees of parent company knew my name and who I was during some all-hands team building exercises. To be honest, they seemed to know me and like me better than anyone at my own company. Not that my colleagues from my company were mean or rude to me, not at all. But it always seemed like everyone was sort of in their own world doing their own thing and, overall, it felt a bit difficult for anyone to get to know anyone else. 

I applied to the job at parent company and about a week ago I received an email from the hiring manager and head of the department saying that she wanted to interview me for the position and she was really excited about this position and the person who fills it. There was no mentioned of my previous employment or anything to suggest she remembered who I was despite definitely knowing her and working with her during my time at my old job. And even if she doesn’t remember me - which is fair, she’s busy and it’s been over a year - the first item on my resume is an unmissable description of my employment at the subsidiary company. 

I guess my question is, how do I handle this history? If she doesn’t bring up that she knows I worked with her and many others in her department, should I? What should I say about my brief tenure at the former company? My plan right now is to tell her the truth of what happened without embellishment but I feel like no one believes you when you say “they didn’t give me a reason.” And I also feel like that truth alone inherently speaks ill of my former company which could reflect poorly on me as “bad-mouthing” my former company because there is just no good way to put it. I don’t want to do anything to suggest I’d be an employee with a conflict of interest, and maybe I just do have a conflict of interest by virtue of my job history, but wouldn’t that be something she would’ve considered before reaching out to me about this position? But what if she somehow didn’t? What if she somehow missed my job history (she’d have to have straight up not looked at my resume but I assume she did because that’s how she’d get my contact info) and it’s revealed during the interview and she’s like “ohh yikes nevermindddd.” 

Another part of me feels like this is a huge practical joke. Logically, I know that’s probably not true. But I have this nagging voice in the back of my head telling me they just want to see how much I’m failing and laugh about it. 

Yet another part of me feels pre-frustrated and like they better be doing this as a formality and, barring extenuating circumstances, fully intend on giving me the position. Because why else would they even go through the risk and potential difficulties of interviewing me for (kinda) re-employment? I don’t mean to sound entitled, I know that nothing is guaranteed in this world, we are owed nothing, and we shouldn’t expect anything; especially from corporations. But I would really rather not even go through any of this if there is no intention of a serious offer and a very real, good possibility I will be hired.  I know that probably sounds obstinate and bratty but I can’t help feeling that way. It’s also why I’m here seeking advice on how to approach this situation. Because I think I’m maneuvering more on emotions than logic and practicality. I want to go into this interview with as much professionalism as possible and with the right answers and words to say.

So what do you guys think? What do you think they (parent corp) is thinking? What are the things I should say and what are the things I should definitely avoid? What cues and clues should I look for during the conversation? Am I a fool for even entertaining this opportunity in the first place? Any and all thoughts are welcome. 

TL;DR - Was terminated from my former company and dream job over a year ago with no reason given. Now parent corporation of former company wants to interview with me for a position with them. What should I do, what shouldn’t I do, and what does it all mean?",ohmyglobyouguys,1,1.0,0,1739887257,2025-02-18 14:00:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isdb6a/parent_corporation_of_former_employer_wants_to/,2,2025

1isd2ct,"How do I tell my boss, my goal is to make as much money as possible?","Howdy y'all. I am an accounting manager at a small start up. I have 3 direct reports and 1 contractor that occasionally does projects for me. I have been here for 2 years in March, and plan to be here for 3 more years, if my company does not sell by then. 

In July '24, during my semi annual review, my boss asked me what my short term and long term professional goals were and how she can help me achieve them. At the time, I was dealing with a difficult employee that I had to eventually let go, so I asked her if we could potentially circle back to that question when things were as chaotic. She understood and agreed she would ask me at a later date. 

Fast forward, to last week during my 1st semi annual review of the year and my boss asked me the question again: what were my short term and long term professional goals. While I do have professional goals, I am currently more focused on my personal ones at the moment: read 3 more books than I did last year (read 3 last year), go on 2 road trips, attend 2 more concerts than I did last year (went to 4 last year), pay off my truck, spend less time on my phone, and save up $10k in my checking account, $15k in my immediate savings, and $25k in my long term savings. 

All that said, majority of my goals are contingent on having a decent amount of money. I want to be honest with my boss, as I do not want to say I want to do X then later end up hating it, but at my current rate I am at, it is going to be at least 4 years to achieve half my financial goals. Needless to say I just need to make more money. Is there a way I can tell my boss that I want to work in a position that offers the most amount of opportunities to make money?

1isc8oj,Professional References,"Hi everyone,

I have been wracking my brain over what to do about professional references for new jobs that I apply for given my fairly traumatic work experience. I am currently working as a business transformation consultant on contract for a small business. 

However, around 6 months ago, I quit my first career job where I worked 2.5 years as a law grad till lawyer. I quit because I had to look after my father who was diagnosed with cancer and because I could no longer handle the harassment I experienced from my direct supervisor. I had wanted to quit earlier but was scared how it would look on my resume if I only worked at the firm for less than 2 years. Given that the firm was incredibly small (5 employees!), my supervisor was the only person who was my direct senior and there was no HR. He was HR since he was the person who hired me. Since I started work, he iced out two long term employees who were working at the firm from the inception. He only hired entry level staff after.

To give a breakdown of the sexual harassment:

* Spent an hour on my first day telling me about how age gap relationships are good (I was 26, he was 40)
* Would take me to lunch (just me and him), pay for the meal, tell me about how I could tell any future dates that took me to the same restaurant that I was unimpressed because he had already taken me there, refused to correct the nature of our work relationship when hospitality staff assumed we were a couple.
* Would always set the cutlery, pour water, wipe things down for me when we were eating food, and when we ate with another coworker, he did not do the same for the other coworker.
* Would give unsolicited dating advice nearly everyday and tell me that 90% of the population of men were man-babies and they would consider me their dream girl because of my large chest and bottom.
* Said I was 'fuckable'.
* Found out he was in a current 4 year relationship with the previous law graduate (girl who was in my exact position), despite not having divorced his wife. Wife seemed unaware they were separated for the first 2 years.
* Made me act as his support person at his family mediation for the pre-divorce process. 
* Spent 3 days discussing how infidelity is ok as long as everyone performs their role, e.g. he provides financial support for his current partner (the previous law graduate), and that gives him the right to have his other needs fulfilled elsewhere (hint - with me). 
* Said I was the same as him and would never be fulfilled by my partner and that infidelity is ok.
* The last time he took me out personally to lunch was to have a one-on-one cryptic discussion about how if I ever needed him to do the impossible, he would do it for me and I would have to 'join him for the ride'. Also if I was still single and working at the firm by 30, 'chaos would ensue'. (I'm actually crying remembering all of this and I haven't processed this all properly).

I am scared he will read this but I truly could not bear to think about a career in law any longer because of my experiences. I felt like I was becoming more negative and depressed about my reality by working there. 

During the last year of work, we had hired another senior lady to assist with the workload. She was my closest confidant and she was incredibly sweet. She had told me she had wanted to quit previously due to the crazy workload but continued because of us. I had probably made the mistake of telling her about my experiences and although she was incredibly supportive, always being kind to me, giving me a thoughtful farewell gift, volunteering to be my referee, she has ignored all texts and calls from me since. I have made peace with being ghosted by her as I know she is the closest person to him now that I have left and I can't possibly begin to understand her complex feelings towards me given that she still works at the firm. 

There is also one other girl that I can use as a reference who worked with me as a law graduate. She is still working there and we follow each other on IG/she's been replying to messages on a weekly basis (we don't share real time text messaging). Is it ok to use her as a referee?",tudoufan,1,1.0,0,1739883971,2025-02-18 13:06:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1isc8oj/professional_references/,2,2025
1isbpae,Advice needed. Switching to a school science technician?,"Switching over to a science technician

I really need some advice.

I won't go into specifics but i currently work in a chemistry related graduate job. Graduated 4 years ago. Worked retail. Landed a job relevant to my education in 2024. It's fine, I can do it but half the time it can be quiet which I like. And the other half the time it can be very busy and hectic which kind of gives me anxiety stress headaches. 

I have talked to a few recruiters and I have interviewed at 1 local school. Seems good and they seem like they would like to have me. I was just worried about the fact that I would be the only technician responsible there. And that, while I did graduate with a chemistry based degree, it has been 4 years so my practical skill and knowledge is rusty. 

Despite the above. Is a secondary school science technician a good job for someone who wants a balanced chill low stress role? It's not something I necessarily see as a lifelong job but it strikes me as a somewhat cushy job I could manage to do for the rest of my 20s while considering and applying to other things. Balance concerns me more than money. I am fine sacrificing a few thousand a year if it means I can go from a 7am 9hr shift 30miles away, to an 8am 8hr shift a 5min drive away.

1is9wlb,"I’ve had enough of my company. Denied promotion, misled, stuck on a graduate salary, and now questioning everything. What should I do?","Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, so please point me in the right direction if it isn’t. Also, apologies in advance for the long post.  

I’m at my wit’s end with my current job and could really do with some advice on what to do next. I’ve been working full-time for 2.5 years at a consultancy here in the UK, primarily as a DevOps engineer, though I’ve also taken on other roles.  

## **The Promotion Debacle**  

Last year, I was told I couldn’t go for a promotion because I didn’t meet the utilisation target (i.e., being assigned to a project). However, earlier in the year, I was assured me utilisation was just one factor among many—not a strict requirement especially for my rank. This was even backed up by the person I’ll mention next. Come promotion time, though, I was suddenly told that utilisation was the deciding factor, completely contradicting what I’d been told before.  

To make matters worse, I found out that a colleague in the same situation, same rank, same struggles with utilisation was promoted. The key difference? They were unable to obtain security clearance, which limited their project opportunities. Because of this, they made an exception for her promotion, but my circumstances weren’t given the same consideration. At no point was I told that exceptions could be made. I don’t want to take the promotion away from this person. I’ve worked with them for over two years, and they fully deserve it. It’s the unfairness of not being told that’s got to me.  

Despite not meeting utilisation targets, I still received a high-performing score in my performance review for the year, which makes the denial of my promotion feel even more unjust.  

## **The Projects That Weren’t Really Projects**  

I didn’t hit utilisation targets because I was constantly put in situations where I felt powerless:  

- I made countless attempts to secure projects, reaching out to managers and volunteering for work, but nothing ever came of it.  
- I was placed on projects that didn’t align with my skill set, including one that had nothing to do with DevOps or engineering, where I was expected to solve a complex procurement data issue single-handedly. It was clear from my first meeting with the client that the problem required an entire team, not just me. Despite flagging this, I still assisted them, proposed solutions, and even made a presentation for them.  
- I was frequently called upon to help others on projects with no official utilisation. I spent time assisting people with Docker, GCP, SQL issues, and Postman, but none of this counted toward my utilisation because I wasn’t formally assigned.  
- I helped with internal initiatives, including assisting on a bid, gathering consultant availability numbers, and organising track records to help draft responses. Despite my contributions, this also didn’t count toward my utilisation.  
- I was initially promised work on an AWS-related project and was told I was confirmed for four weeks, only to be ghosted for weeks. When I followed up, I was told I was no longer being considered due to changes and needs of the project.  

## **The Stagnant Salary**  

Despite all of this, I’m still on a graduate salary from two years ago. My pay was frozen the same year I rolled off the graduate scheme, meaning I never got a proper adjustment when I was no longer a graduate. I find this especially frustrating because:  

- I’ve been with the company for over two years and have worked at a higher level than my pay reflects.  
- I’ve been expected to mentor others and assist with technical problems beyond my rank, yet I’m still treated as a graduate when it comes to pay and promotion.  

## **Where I Am Now**  

This year, I decided to take an unpaid sabbatical by going to study in Japan something that I have always wanted to do. I thought now was the best time because I was mentally drained and felt stuck. However, I’m now questioning whether I should just quit entirely.  

- I’ve been told I can’t go for promotion this year due to my pending sabbatical, so I’d have to wait another year to try again. By that point, I will have been at the company for 4 and a half, nearly 5 years, stuck in the same situation I’ve been trying to escape.  
- This whole ordeal has severely affected my self-confidence and caused significant anxiety. I’ve started questioning my own abilities, even though my performance reviews and feedback suggest otherwise.  

## **What I Need Help With**  

- What would you do in my situation? Is there any way to salvage this, or should I just move on?  
- Should I even bother raising a grievance? At this point, I don’t feel like it would change anything.  
- If I leave, how do I position this experience? And how do I explain it to other companies in future interviews?  
- I want to leave, but my family say I should stay, as I’ll have a job to come back to and an income. I understand their concerns, but I can’t face going back after my sabbatical is over.  

I’m honestly stuck here. I really don’t want to spend my sabbatical dreading the thought of returning to a job I absolutely detest after all that’s happened. What should I do? I’d really appreciate any advice.

1is9a44,I study CS and thinking about switching to medicine. What do you think about it?,"Hey all, 

I study CS in a very good university (something like MIT). Growing up in the 2010s, tech seemed like the perfect field—intellectual growth, great working conditions, and high salaries. As a math-loving nerdy kid, I thought it was just the place for me. 

But now, the field doesn’t seem so promising. The job market is oversaturated with new grads fighting for a shrinking number of entry-level positions, especially with AI automating more and more tasks. I think it's only going to get worse as LLMs improve and succeed at doing increasingly more sophisticated stuff. It feels like you’ll constantly have to reinvent yourself just to stay relevant, and be in stiff, constant competition with others, which sounds pretty stressful. I like what I study, but I'm not *passionate* about it to the degree I could never imagine myself doing anything else. 

On the flip side, healthcare still has plenty of job opportunities and isn’t going to be automated anytime soon. Becoming a doctor isn’t easy, but it guarantees job security and a good salary. I think I could be a good doctor—I'm social and love helping people.

Only reason why I haven’t chosen Google engineering instantly not even counting the fact that a Google Engineer makes a lot more than doctors and surgeons at all stages of career/life is that when I was a child I really wanted to be a doctor so I’m not sure whether I should chase my childhood dream and go to med school or go to Google Engineering and still enjoy it plus make a lot more especially here in Australia",Exact-Attention6612,0,0.14000000059604645,6,1739870618,2025-02-18 09:23:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1is8t0p/doctorsurgeon_vs_google_engineer/,2,2025
1is8jbe,Help! Is it possible to return to work after being on disability following assault & worse,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible. 

I was at the peak of my career in 2017 And then I was brutally assaulted and I'm talking tied up gun in my face beating horrifically,  drugged, And you can imagine what else happened, I am a woman and it was two or three men I guess luckily I have a zero memory of any of it except for a flash of the gun being on my knees and my hands tied behind my back and that's it. 

I was hospitalized for 3 months and not because of the level of the beating but because all the drugs that they shot me up with, which I'm assuming they intended to kill me with those but it didn't work and I ended up with acute kidney failure and being on dialysis for 2 months. My doctor's really didn't think I was going to get my kidney function back so I was on the transplant list but by some miracle And I think also because I willed my body to please start working again, overnight I noticed a difference in what you look for and output, told my nurse and they did another collection and sure enough I didn't need any more dialysis after that. Of course all of the labs had also improved greatly as well but they really measure by the amount of protein in your output I guess. Anyway I'm getting off topic here.

After the hospital I went into an inpatient mental health program cuz obviously I needed it but then when I went home I developed severe agoraphobia. The first year it was difficult to even leave my porch and I live out in the middle of nowhere in the country. With a lot of trauma therapy and a lot of time I've been able to overcome the agoraphobia and make great strides in my recovery. 

But as a result of all of this happening, I had to go out on SSDI and with all of the residual medical issues and mental health issues related to PTSD I wasn't in any shape to work. But I am now at the point where I feel like my life has no point without even some kind of a job. I need to get back into the workforce and I understand that I am definitely not going to be going back to where I was in my career making six figures, leading 100 million dollar software implementation projects. 

So I have two challenges: 

1. How do I explain this huge gap in my work history without going into all of that? 

2. How do I approach taking a step back in my career and I guess essentially going back to almost an entry-level job at the age of 47? 
I don't have a problem being able to adjust my resume so that it fits the job descriptions but I worry about the interview process and even a cover letter. 

3. My brain issues - I suffered a traumatic brain injury in the assault that combined with memory issues that result from PTSD, and not just memory issues related to the event but memory issues related to things you wouldn't even think would be impacted from PTSD. I truly didn't believe my therapist when she told me this is a very common thing with PTSD so she gave me a bunch of articles and research and after reading all of it I now understand thought it is true. 

So I've done some mock interviews using AI and I cannot answer questions like I used to be able to. I can't even remember examples of these great amazing things I did at my last job to use in order to have a successful interview.

I learned to answer interview questions using STAR
S= SITUATION  (20%), explain the situation so that your interviewer understands the context of your example

T= TASK (10%), talk about the task that you took responsibility for completing or the goal of your efforts.

A= ACTION (60%), describe  actions taken 2 complete the task or reach  end goal while highlighting skills, character traits, etc described in job description or that the interviewer mentioned

R= RESULT (10%), explain the positive outcome that were a direct result of your actions & efforts.  Be sure to highlight quantifiable results. Always emphasize what you learned from the experience &/ot your key takeaways.

So When I was prepping for interviews I  sit down & write up  different examples & eac example could be used to answer probably five or six possible interview questions. Luckily I saved a ton of old prep like that but I get tripped up or lose my train of thought. I tried to dumb it down as much as possible to help me kn the fly. 


I need to get back to work. Even if it's part time. Ideally, pt remote would be best for me but I'm struggling to navigate how to get back into workforce at 47 and worse, explain why I've been out so long without giving too much info. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated

1is8geg,What is my job?,"Summary: 

I (M40) don't have a single talent or interest. Instead I am generalist and I love it. But I have more and more problems finding positions, since my impression is that companies put specific experience and highly developed skills over being able to deal with all kind of tasks. Would you agree? And where can I find a job that fits my personality? (Also: I got a ADHD diagnosis recently so I might be forced by nature to search variety and non-routine at work.) Atm I work in online marketing (content and SEO) but I grew out of executing positions. They not longer challenge me and I have had first managing/organizing positions. Despite positions as official team lead or manager seem out of reach or are often non-existing because companies don't have a content or SEO department (here in Switzerland where I live).  

Long version:

Hi guys!

Would you agree that we live in a world that is incredible complex and gets more complex everyday? – Yet professions have moved away from generalistic approaches to highly specific fields. That is my impression. Every sub-sub-sub-field has it's own Bachelor- and Master-Program nowadays, there are certificates for everything. But the people making connections, getting overviews, working as correctives are missing more and more. Still nobody searches for them.

That being said, here is my problem: I am completely a generalist with all my life and I could prosper in such a meta- or connector-postion. I have talents in maths and logics as well as in languages and arts. I can be really precise and accurate and yet I am charismatic and spontanous. I am facts driven and earnest but I have lots of humor and always see the absurdity of human life. I can be alone at home not talking to anybody for days and I can go to a festival and talk to everybody and enjoy it really. And so on ...

My vita reflects that: I've been accepted to study art but studied Philosophy and German in the end. I've worked construction sites, been a waiter, a janitor's assistant, a delivery guy, worked at auctions, worked in a hectic newsroom, been a freelance texter, been a teacher, been a fitness trainer (kind of), been a SEO specialist, a marketing consulant and more (note: a pathway like this is not common in my country Germany/Switzerland at all – it's not like the US). I do a lot of sports but I also write short stories, do photography, drawing classes, I read literature but also non-fiction about political, social, theoretical topics. So I have decent knowledge in many fields, I am a master at leading a conversation with everybody – it might be a professor or a fruit vendor, I can connect really easy because I pretty much always have read or heard something relevant for the conversation, which I can bring up to break the ice.

I see great value in my broad line-up and I am pretty confident too that I could do many jobs well. But it seems I have no chance getting any good ones with my assets. The opposite is the case: When I create a portfolio or an application, in general I do not have to search for experiences and skills, I have to sort out many of them because there is no space or I can't make a connection. In the end only a shallow image of me remains which does disqualify me. So it seems. Other candidates probably are better suited for a particular position because the always focused on this profession or skill. It's immediately clear for HR and future bosses what they buy. I am more like an universal tool: Many functions are possible but you have to discover and apply them yourself. Like: I am as good as the challenge you give me. And nobody wants to give me any.

So any ideas on what to do or where to search? Where can I make use of my generalistic but profound skill set? Where do I find tasks that really challenge and excite me because I have to go all in and not only use a fraction of my skills and knowledge?

FYI: I just turned 40 and I want to leave the field I have some decent experience in by now, because it bores the sh\*t out of me: content marketing and SEO.

Greetings

1is83ae,Distressed after meeting with supervisor,"I had a meeting with my supervisor today which went badly. I had called the meeting to get clarification about processes as I am 3 weeks into my role.

He told me I need to “take the ‘heat’ out of my emails” due to the email I sent asking for the meeting and how I set out the agenda.

When I asked what he meant and if we could review the emails he is referring to so we could resolve the misunderstanding, he said “no, I don’t want to do that”.

When he realised I was taking notes during the meeting, he told me I was making him feel uncomfortable and put pressure on me to turn my laptop towards him and push it closer to him so he could read what I was writing down. I said no and he accused me of not being transparent.

I became upset by this, felt on the verge of tears so asked if we could end the meeting.

I have spoken to my female manager about this and have expressed that I feel extremely unsafe and unsupported. She said it was not okay but that he wouldn’t have intended to make me feel that way. I’m a big believer of impact over intent, and feel she’s minimising what happened due to their longstanding relationship.

There is a huge power imbalance here and I’m freaking out.

1is76ml,"Mid-30’s, fired from good paying job, decided to go back to school and have a few options. Need advice.","1. Do a 9-month medical program completely funded by the state but will probably only ever max out at about 50k a year in that field

2. Move back in with a parent, get a 50k loan and do a 3 yr radiology program that could potentially pay 80-100k after

Im single, no kids, have my own apartment, car paid off, have about 3500 total in my accts, about 19k available credit and 1k debt, no income but could possibly get back on unemployment in June and will receive the Pell grant for about 8k once I start a program. 

If I do the 9 month med program I should be able to survive in my current situation until I get a job in that field but will probably never be able to grow or make more than 50k a year. If I don’t like it I could always just apply for desk jobs similar to my last one and similar pay but will most likely hate it again. 

If I do the 3 yr radiology program I’ll have to move back in with a parent, get a part time job while doing a year (or more) of pre requisites at a community college, then quit and take out a huge loan and focus on the 18 month radiology program full time. 

Both of the schools have a pretty high placement rate so I will probably get hired by the place I extern at the end of either program. I’m leaning toward the radiology program bc I keep thinking of the money. But I one of my main concerns is moving back in with a parent at my age. Our relationship is good, not great but not bad either. I’ll live in the back room about the size of a studio and would have plenty of comfort and privacy but can’t help feeling like a failure for moving back home. 

Another big concern is how intense the radiology program might be. I always did good in school when I was younger without even really trying but I lack a lot of discipline and will really need to focus for the next 3 years.

1is666x,Advice on quitting my job,"**Hey, I'll keep this quick. I’m in a weird spot and need some career advice.**

I’m in my early 20s and have been working as the sole marketing staff for a real estate team in LA for the past seven months. From the start, I haven’t liked the job. My bosses are unreasonable, expecting an overwhelming amount of work from me even though I’m just one person and still early in my career. They also misled me during the hiring process, saying overtime would be occasional, but now they expect it almost daily. On top of that, they’ve actively discouraged people in the office from talking to me, which has made the work environment even worse. Most of the office doesn’t have a great opinion of my boss.

A few days ago, I found out that another real estate team in my office (a competitor) is hiring, and a friend recommended me. Now I have an interview with them and from what I’ve heard, this team is high-performing, the bosses are much better to work for, the pay is good, and I’d even have a hybrid schedule. It sounds like a great opportunity, but I feel weird about leaving my current job for a competitor, especially since our team was hit very, very hard by the recent fires in LA. Even though my current bosses haven’t treated me well, I can’t shake the feeling that I’d be a traitor by leaving.

Here’s where I need help:

1. Should I feel weird about working for a competitor in the same office?
2. If I decide to take the new job, how do I break the news to my boss?
3. I’ve never quit a job before—what’s the best way to do it?

1is6445,Career Dilemma: Data vs. Cybersecurity – Which Path Has the Best Long-Term Potential?,"**Hi everyone,**

I'm at a crossroads in my career and need advice from those with experience in data and cybersecurity fields. Here’s some background about me and what I’m considering:



# About Me

* **Location & Languages:** I’m based in Germany and fluent in Romanian, Russian, English, and German.
* **Experience:** I have 2 years of work experience in a data role at a large company—though my job encompassed data engineering, data architecture, business intelligence and data science (all on Azure).
* **Education:** I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and a Master’s in Business Management with a focus on Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.
* **Current Status:** I’m currently unemployed with benefits until the end of September 2025, giving me time to upskill if needed.
* **Cybersecurity Note:** I have no formal work experience in cybersecurity, and most of my insights in that field come from friends, Google, and ChatGPT.
* **Desired Job Market:** Looking primarily at the European job market, but would consider other regions as well.



# What I’m Considering

# 1. Data Careers (Data/Cloud Engineering)

* **Key Considerations:**
   * I already have solid experience from my one job in data-related work and a master’s degree in the data field.
   * Given the exponential growth in data, there’s always demand for professionals who can monitor, store, process, and analyse data, at least imo.
   * Data Engineering is more than just setting up some cloud resources, it’s also about talking and negotiating with stakeholders, understanding the needs and goals of the business and sometimes successfully leading a project from start to finish. In this context, I see it as being somewhat AI-proof for the next, let’s say, several years.
   * I keep seeing on the job portals that the requirements for data engineers include containerisation, big data, event streaming, workflow orchestration and many other tools and technologies which do not fall directly under the responsibilities of a data engineer, which confuses me on what is really needed on the market and what should I learn.
   * All data jobs on LinkedIn always have over 100 applications in less than a day, making me think there are more data professionals than jobs out there.
   * I’ve applied to over 100 jobs and had maybe about 7 interviews, and 2 went to the latest stages, but there was no offer in the end.
* **Questions:**
   * **Technologies & Certifications:** Which technologies and certifications are most valuable for a data engineer? (e.g., Docker, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, Hadoop, Azure certs, AWS certs, etc.)
   * **Cloud Platforms:** I have worked exclusively on Azure. Should I expand my expertise to AWS (or GCP) or focus on roles that require Azure?
   * **Market Outlook:** How do you view the demand, salary, sustainability (resistance to AI-driven automation), and long-term consultant potential for data roles?



# 2. Cybersecurity Careers

* **Key Considerations:**
   * Cybersecurity is booming, with strong long-term demand and impressive salaries reported across various roles.
   * I keep hearing that cybersecurity professionals are earning very attractive packages and are in incredibly high demand, which is hard to ignore.
   * Since I have no formal work experience in cybersecurity, I would be starting from scratch as a beginner.
* **Potential Roles (as identified with the help of ChatGPT):**
   * **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst**
   * **Incident Response / Digital Forensics Analyst**
   * **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) / Security Consultant / DPO**
* **Questions:**
   * **Entry Point:** What are the typical expectations for someone starting out?
   * **Workload & Work-Life Balance:** How do these roles compare to day-to-day stress and overall balance?
   * **Long-Term Consultant Potential:** Which of these cybersecurity roles offers better prospects for transitioning into a high-demand, well-rewarded consultancy role?



# Overall Questions for the Community

* **Comparative Outlook:** Which career path—data or cybersecurity—offers better market demand, job security, higher salary potential, long-term growth, resistance to automation in the AI era and could be leveraged upon gaining more experience in consultancy?
* **For Data Roles:** What additional skills and certifications (e.g., Docker, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, Hadoop, AWS, Azure) would you recommend for someone with my background?
* **For Cybersecurity:** What are the most valuable foundational skills and certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CISSP, etc.) for someone entering the field from a data background?
* **General Advice:** Are there any other factors I should consider when deciding between staying in data or switching to cybersecurity?

While I value the experience and knowledge I've gained since starting my career, if the benefits of moving into cybersecurity and starting anew outweigh those of continuing along my current data path in the long term, I'm ready to make that change.

I’d really appreciate any insights, experiences, or suggestions you have to help me make this important decision. Thanks in advance!



**TLDR:** I'm torn between sticking with data roles—where I have 2 years of experience and a relevant master's—and switching to cybersecurity, which promises strong demand and high salaries but is a completely new field for me. I'm seeking advice on which path offers better long-term potential in terms of market demand, job security, salary, and resistance to automation, as well as insights on necessary technologies and certifications for both areas.",New-Investment7599,1,1.0,0,1739859257,2025-02-18 06:14:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1is6445/career_dilemma_data_vs_cybersecurity_which_path/,2,2025

1is4fsl,Need to hear different opinions on career advise,"I am 26 years old and am looking to make a jump in careers. 
I currently work as a server at a steakhouse and also work at a retail tech store. Between both I made just over $100k in 2024 which is great but I can’t help but feel stuck and like an underachiever. 
I have worked in restaurants since I was 16 and while the money is great especially for the hours, as Ive gotten older I really just want to try something different and learn new skills. I have a bachelors degree in business management and previously worked in accounting department but didn’t get paid great and didn’t love the environment. 

As of right now I am debating between getting into some type of sales which is vague but I feel like my skills now more closely align with that line of work. I also know with the right pay structure and company I can make some good money. 

The other half of me wants to go back to school and possibly pursue something in the medical field like sonography and specialize in something. I feel like the medical route is a little bit more secure in the long run but I will obviously have to take some pay cuts while I’m going to school. 

Really just looking for general opinions or anyone with experience in either field to shed some insight. ",Striking-Amount-7549,1,1.0,0,1739853200,2025-02-18 04:33:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1is4fsl/need_to_hear_different_opinions_on_career_advise/,2,2025

1is3j3e,asking for advice,"Hi, I mustered up the courage to come here and share my experience so far: I am a 25yr old (f) and an Asian immigrant. i grew up in the US and had a passion for law and I really wanted to go to law school. As an immigrant, I wanted to gain experience and confidence within the legal field and interned at this beginning firm ran by an Asian attorney. It was in its early stages and I played a big part in contributing to its growth. I believe I invested time and effort in hopes of gaining legal experience and having a great attorney vouch for me… We all bonded and had a great vision to grow the firm and ourselves, however, the workplace became toxic due to the relationship between manager and owner, who were a couple. It felt like we were all walking on egg shells to please both of them. 
I wanted to see growth within my role to measure my efforts, and even after communicating with them, they were not willing to provide career growth or compensation. I respected them still and stuck it out to help them as we were short staffed and i still hoped for a promotion as a small validation but no... :’) 
these are a paraphrase of my roles: I supported the attorney, handled my own cases, led consultations, supported the manager and supported the other paralegals (ie i did their paperwork and research). (i assisted 4 paralegals as the only legal assistant). When i asked about a promotion or raise, they gave me little and actually was demoted as they hired a friend (whom i onboarded) and promoted someone that came after me. 
I now left the place, and I left relieved but I lost my confidence in my abilities and even the passion to pursue law… I am scared and now timid to pursue law, these are my concerns:
1. I am an Asian AND a woman- I am scared there will be no place for me within the legal field 
2. I don’t want to practice criminal or immigration and I am scared that I will have to end up doing just that
3. I want to gain connection and network but because I am an immigrant, I am not sure where to start
4. I am sad about this experience because I have no gain in the end… they don’t even want to write a letter of rec and i felt as though my time invested has no positive outcome…
I would truly appreciate some advice (kind or harsh is ok)
5.Should i still pursue law? Is it worth the time and money to invest?
6.what other field should I pursue bc I really don’t want to give up…🥲
—i have heard many (including them) say to develop thick skin… it just hurts bc i felt used yk?

1is3ij6,Changing Careers to Family Biz,"I am almost 30 and have been working in various capacities as a CPA for about 6 years. I started my current role 3 years ago and at the time, I thought it was the best move for me. The pay is great, the flexibility is amazing, and the work can be interesting. However, I do not see myself in this long term because the parts I do not like about my current job and career only grow as I progress. It is extremely unpredictable which does not jive with my new life situation (I can literally get a call on Sunday night at 9:00PM that I need to be in New York by 9:00AM the following morning)

My partner was recently diagnosed with a condition that basically has condemned her to be disabled the rest of her life. This caused us to move back home to where both of our families are, for me to be the sole income earner, and there is no chance we ever move away due to the new development (and I have pretty much taken over all work around the house, thankfully we do not have kids). If I stay in my current role and career, I will eventually be required to travel 80% of the time AND where I live now has no market for what I have been doing the past 3 years. So, I know I need to leave and I would rather do it sooner than later. 

I grew up in a family business (construction), but my dad always insisted that I find something I want to do and not feel any pressure to join the business. So, for pretty much my whole life, I steered clear of the family business. However, now that I have experience and have moved back, my family has been trying to recruit me to join the business (initially controller/finance role and then expand from there). I would probably take a pay cut up front and my salary progression may be slowed, but I would be able to continue building on something that has been around for many many generations. 

I am concerned with the pay cut and potential earnings limitation. I would probably make close to $200k this year all-in if I were to stay in my current role with potential substantial raises moving forward. I would probably have a maximum earning potential of $150k - $160k this year if I went to the family business. For reference (and due to medical bills), our break-even point is about $120k in pre-tax gross income with 0% 401k savings. My current gig is basically a start-up firm, so this would actually be a move to a slightly larger company (still a small business though, which I am completely ok with). 

Has anyone else out there left their career to join their family business? Did you take a pay cut to do it? Do you have any regrets about it?

1is2yeh,I’m having a career crisis,"I’m 26 and feeling completely lost in my career. I have a bachelor’s in healthcare administration and a master’s in public health, but I don’t think this field is my calling.For context, I’ve worked as a surgery scheduler at a women’s health clinic, a project coordinator at a hospital, and now as a program specialist at a health IT company. Each job has left me feeling like something is missing. When I was a Surgery scheduler (hybrid): I liked the in-person aspect but hated being on the phone all day getting yelled at. When I was in-person talking with the doctors, the MA’s, and my other coworkers, I felt like I was apart of something bigger than myself and enjoyed the face to face interaction, but I quickly got burnt out and felt like I was destined for more. When I was a Project coordinator (remote): I felt like the overall job itself was too easy, and I felt like I wasn’t using my skills. This job was fully remote and I didn’t work closely with any of my coworkers, so I felt quite bored and lonely. My current job as a Program specialist (remote) is more challenging and fast-paced. I have been trusted with big projects and feel like I am learning new skills, but I still feel so unhappy and unfulfilled. I know the work I am doing is impacting patients downstream, but the work I do feels like I’m not truly impacting anything, which is really hard for me. 

I got into healthcare because I wanted to make people’s lives easier, but I’ve realized I need to see the impact of my work firsthand. I thrive on organization, planning, communication, and critical thinking, but I struggle with working remotely all the time. I’m social and need in-person interaction to stay motivated. I also really don’t know if I can get behind the corporate hustle culture.. and I think I might not love healthcare admin, but I’m truly unsure. I think I’d prefer something more hands-on, but I don’t know what.I’ve even told my partner that I enjoyed working at a grocery store more than what I do now because I could at least see customers smile and feel like I was making a difference in their day.

I’m really good at my job, but I can’t shake the feeling that I missed my calling. I’ve considered teaching, event planning, real estate—something where I work with people directly—but with student debt, going back to school feels impossible.

Has anyone else felt this way? Any advice on how to pivot without starting over completely?",HarveyDSteve,3,0.800000011920929,4,1739848461,2025-02-18 03:14:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1is2yeh/im_having_a_career_crisis/,2,2025

1is2sn0,I do not deserve to what my goal is.,"I was working with my previous employer before for more than a decade, my last position is senior developer, my goal is to be a manager, but eventually they always giving that to someone else or hire a manager, and the funny thing is those who got promoted always bringing me, asking me what is the best approach, structure and task me to attend the meetings on their behalf, they added task to my workload. But in the end, they are being recognized on the projects, and me, stays in the corner.

I was so sick of what's happening to me, that's why I decided to resign, I got an offer to be a manager, but I don't have a staff, but will hire eventually, they want me to maintain their legacy apps, which total of 10 apps, left by developers who resigns, and I'm having a hard time on maintaning all of them.

Eventually, they hire a developer (without my knowledge or I didn't interview), all the new projects is given to him, I can't do my task to manage him as I'm busy with my own task, I want to give some legacy apps to him but my boss told me not to as those new projects to him is important.

Eventually, I messed up with the legacy apps, I told them that I will refactor it but my boss told me, add some features but don't refactor it, I'm doing both the BA, QA and Technical support works, and I messed up, eventually my boss does not like me or not confident of what I do, eventually the dev that we hire became more important, when there is a lead meeting, he was there, not me, and with other important stuff.

I eventually, losing my trust with my self, my dream and goal on leading and be a manager, is some what become... not suited for me.

I dreamt of transforming this company to a better software dev, but eventually they like what they having, even I told them my suggestions, they reject it, but when the other dev suggest a similar thing, they say yes.


I'm currently looking for a new one, but I'm having doubts that, I might do the same thing with other employer, I also thinking of changing careers, but might hurt my income, and might also messed up.

1is1dfj,Considering Career Paths as an upcoming graduate,"Hey everyone,

I’m about to graduate with a degree in finance and have solidified sales as the path I want to pursue. I’ve interned in commercial real estate (brokerage, development, and finance) and find the industry really interesting—especially the deal-making aspect and income potential.

That said, I’m a little hesitant about jumping into a fully commission-based role right out of school. I know CRE can be incredibly lucrative long-term, but the ramp-up period and lack of a stable salary are concerns for me. I also don’t have much money saved to keep me afloat, and moving in with family isn’t really an option, so I need to be mindful of financial stability early on.

I’m also considering corporate sales (BDR/SDR roles in tech or other industries) because of the strong income potential, clear advancement paths, and more structured training programs. It seems like a great way to build sales skills while having a base salary + commission.

For those who have experience in either field (or both), what would you recommend? Is it better to take a corporate sales job to gain sales experience and financial stability? Or is it better to go all-in on CRE early?

Would love to hear any advice, especially from people who have navigated similar decisions.

1is1261,The bad thing about being good at many subjects.,"I'm lost. What should I major in?

Good night. I'm a 16-year-old girl and I have no idea what I want to do with my future. I would like to receive advice and opinions from other people. 

I'm in 11th grade right now, and I'm doing well in practically all my subjects at school. I don't really have much trouble with any of them. My grades are very good (my average last year was 6.9/7.0, basically a 9.85 or an A+ on other scales.

I have always been interested in technology, I would like to learn to code, I am interested in circuits and electronics. and I like to make small projects. But my true passion has always been writing. I have won a few writing contests, I like writing poems, essays, I am planning to write my first book, I like blogging and journaling.

I am also very interested in social studies, I would really like to make a living from writing essays about sociopolitics, I would like to be a journalist to tell the stories of those who are silenced. I love reading too, I love reading history and realism. In general I love telling stories, I like to make small publications about art history, or contemporary history of my countries, I like to give my political opinions as 
well. 

I also love to investigate things, get to the bottom of something, discover new things, I like to read about new scientific discovers and sometimes fantasize about being in a lab. Or maybe social research, how society behaves, I like polls, doing them and analyzing the data.

And the other thing I care the most in the world is helping others. I am in community help clubs at my high school, I like talking to people and managing social help. At Christmas I participate in something that we do at my high school, we manage gifts, food and shows and we invite children from disadvantaged communities to spend Christmas at my school. 

The careers that have caught my attention over the years are systems engineering, computer science, electronics, international relations, international trade, journalism. I may like to become an author some day too.

I know it's almost impossible, but isn't there a major university that manages to unite all these things? Or maybe a career that will help me fulfill all my passions?

1is0c3p,Should I leave an amazing job?,"So I (24m) work as a tower crane technician, on paper. The reality of it is I make $36 an hour to do nothing, at home, about 75% of the time. My boss works 500 miles away in another state with the rest of my coworkers. It’s expected that I’m always available during work hours, and I am, and I usually hop on a phone call for about 15 minutes a day with my boss to chat about work and life. I sometimes travel and do small bits of work and repairs but most of my life is wide open. I’m guaranteed 40 hours a week and any work outside of that 7am-3pm is overtime as is anything over 40 hours if I’m traveling. Last year I made $125k doing this job and I genuinely enjoy it most of the time. This may be one of the best possible situations I can think of being in.

BUT:: having this much free time is taking a massive toll on my mental health. I’ve tried to be healthy and workout every day, create side hustles, stay busy in general. Nothing is working. And because I’m technically on the clock I can’t be far from home or do anything that takes me away from my phone for longer than about an hour. I’m genuinely depressed, and feel super socially disconnected. I also have many recruiters reaching out offering higher paid jobs but those would require me to go back to being full time 50+ hours a week and ruin my working relationship with the company I work for, including my boss who I honestly see as a brother/mentor. I’m truly grateful to be in this position but I don’t know how much longer I can live like this. I’m considering taking another job that would pay in the low 40’s an hour plus a company vehicle. It would set me up even better financially but I’d be working 3x as hard and learning a whole different type of equipment.

About a year ago, I left my previous job after a disagreement. Since then, I've received unemployment benefits and moved to a different city.  On my resume, I listed my previous job as current and indicated I'm still located in the same city.

I've spoken with my previous employer, and they've verbally agreed to confirm my employment if contacted. However, I'm concerned about other ways this information might be discovered.  Could the background check reveal my unemployment history or my change of address? Any advice on how to navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.",Beautiful-Plan-2792,1,1.0,0,1739839704,2025-02-18 00:48:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1irzzw0/question_about_background_check/,2,2025

1irzu0b,Should I leave my current job to pursue a new career path?,"
Hi there

I currently work at a blueberry tissue culture lab as a research technician making $22.50/hr.
We work 40 hours a week flat, no opportunity for overtime. If we do have the odd chance of working over 40 hours a week, the ag laws here prohibit being paid time and a half. So it’s just my straight pay.
I’ve worked at this company a total of 3 years (a returning employee with 6 years working experience across various fields total) and have had my title changed once due to a restructuring.
I’ve grown a lot the past year, stepping into a leadership role unexpectedly.
I’ve asked about career trajectory in my most recent yearly review and was basically told “maybe something will pop up if you wait long enough”.
That seemed too vague to me.
I have to work a second part time job right now to make ends meet. My drive to my current job is also 40 mins. 

I recently interviewed and was offered a position as a sterile processing technician at a union hospital.
The first offer they sent was too low to jump ship, but they reevaluated and were able to offer me $23.26/hr with a shift differential of $1.30/hr added on top. There will be on call days and time and a half paid for overtime.
I also would become certified within 9 months of hire and believe there are many career pathways to potentially follow in a hospital. 
The drive is 15 minutes.
I am looking for a more clear career pathway and better future opportunities. 
Should I pursue this new career path?

Thanks

Tldr; I make $22.50 an hour at my current job with barely any career trajectory. I have to work two jobs. I was offered a position at a union hospital for ~$2/hr more but with better career pathways and overtime opportunities.

1irzhqn,is this paralegal offer worth considering for career growth?,"it pays 85k, located in the Bay Area. The work culture seems a stressful (perhaps expected for a law firm) and my commute would be 1-1.5 hr each way considering traffic (2-3 hrs total).

However, my main concern is career growth. I do not mind temporarily doing this kind of work if it means that either this kind of work could be appealing to a different, higher paying job when I apply for jobs again later on, or if this experience would make me a considerably more attractive candidate for law school. But I heard paralegals are basically a dead end career field with limited appeal to other roles, and I’m not 100% sure if I’m okay with taking on debt to attend law school or if I even want to apply again (I threw out a couple of applications this cycle and I’m waiting to hear back; my only notice has been a waitlist from Cornell). And even if I apply for law school again, would a paralegal job even stand out? I feel like it’s so common that a perspective from a different career could be seen as more valuable, especially if I tie it into my application and narrative nicely.

Aside from this opportunity, I am a finalist for a sales position for a tech start up (similar pay) and some PhD programs (but PhD programs are very unreliable in general and especially right now) Also since everyone has been talking about how awful the job market is right now, I don’t know if I am in a position to be able to choose or if I have to take what I can get.

I’m in my mid 20s, and I just finished a masters. I’m feeling behind in my career path and have been job hunting for about a month.

1irz1xg,"Studying College at Age 40? If not, what are my options?","I'm having a serious spiritual crisis now. Please do not humiliate. Although I admit, my crisis is my own fault, the byproduct of years of negligence of my own life situation.

I'm a pathetic loser when it comes to career/finance/relationships. Age 40, never had a real job, haven't worked in years, live in parents' basement, never had a fulfilling relationship, never held my own life accountable for years or decades.

For reference, I'm not from the US, and the country I grew up in is notorious for having the worst work culture in the world. That's one reason I haven't worked. However, not having anything on my resume basically means I'm un-employable at this point, and there's no one to write me reference when I apply for anything, including schools. 

I am trying to migrate to a first world country, so that I can have a better life than now, also my children can have better lives than mine (though I don't have children nor a partner; basically this is just day-dreaming). But I don't need advice on immigration. This is about what I can do to make a living AFTER I migrate to another country. 

I'm thinking of going back to school, but there are some difficulties. I'll explain:

 \- Technically I have a Bachelor's degree, but the degree is in Art Theory/ Curator/ Humanities kind of thing, so it's not distantly relatable to any employable skills. 

 \- Even if I apply for graduate schools, most Master's degrees in Europe (in any country) will require you to have a Bachelor in the same area as the Master's degree. So I'll have to learn Humanities/ Social Sciences, and those will not help me get a job in a new country. For US Master's degrees I'll need reference letters no matter what, and I can't get them.

 \- For the first two years of undergraduate I was in the US, and I got a GPA of 3.8. But then a tragedy happened I had to go back to my own country. For the last two years of college I only got GPA 2.0. Barely made it to even graduate. So if a Master's program is even minimally selective, I probably wouldn't get in.

\- I really like studying Psychology. But to be a licensed Psychologist in any country, I'll have to start at Bachelor's level. The Master's programs won't even consider you if you hadn't studied psychology before.

So if I to have a skill to survive in a new country, going to graduate school is likely out of reach.

So I have to think about going back to undergraduate and start all over again.

 \- In Europe Bachelor's degrees take 3 years. In US & Canada, since I've studied there before, I'll likely to graduate in 3 years as well. But there aren't many programs in Europe that teaches in English. 

\- It means I have to pay the very expensive undergrad tuition fees for international students. $20,000 one year for tuition alone. I'm willing to suck it up if it really helps me. But if it doesn't, it'll be a loss. (At this point of my life, I'm willing to pay anything to overturn the circumstances I'm in. So money is not an issue; the issue is how to invest wisely since this is likely the only chance I have).

\- More annoyingly, I'll have to be surrounded by 19-21 year olds and try to socialize them. And my age is 40. I have youth at heart and I look 32 and still act like 32, but even that is too far removed from teenage years. I'm afraid I won't fit in. I'm closer to the age of the professors than the students, and it might be awkward outside of the classroom (when engaging in student/ extracurricular activities).

 \- If I want to do Psychology, starting from undergrad is the only choice. But most psychology careers require a Doctor or PhD. I'll have to start undergrad at age 40, finish my study at 50, then find out if the job is right for me for the first time.

So what can I do? If I can't go back to school, how should I survive in a new country, if I don't have a single marketable skill on my resume?

 \- Truck driving. Taxi driving. Uber, Construction work, Storage House - If I have to do this for 8 hours a day, I'll probably choose not to migrate. Two weeks of these jobs are fine, but if I have to do it for 2-3 years, I'll be sick mentally.

\- Waiting on tables, service industries- These are fine. At least I can deal with people & bring smiles to people & have human interaction (although on a shallow level). I don't know whether I can do these for years, but for survival, they're fine for a short time. But still they lack career prospects, thus will not solve the  basic life calamity of mine.

 \- Plus, what employers will hire a new immigrant to do low-level jobs? If I'm already legally residing in the country that's another thing. But I don't have work permit for now and may need a sponsor.

If these survival jobs are out of the way, then I have to work in a company or on my own.

 \- Are there really any company that'll hire a 40 year old without job experience, without network, without reference letters?

\- I'm not a tech-savvy person, so likely I can't learn programming/web development. I'm more into Arts/Humanities. But despite the innate talent, I don't really have visible skills/ portfolio to show for it. I didn't really develop the techniques needed, despite having always wanted to learn.

\- Theatre Arts field, no matter how talented, is too competitive to get in. Music field, I'm definitely not at composer's level, but I can learn music production in 3 years and create music on my own. However, the competition is also fierce (would you pay for an unknown random musician on Youtube?) It's more of a side job when you're free, not reliable as a main job.

\- Graphic Design/ Website Design might be the only choice, even though I have to start afresh. I'm a total novice when it comes to drawing. And if it's for me to choose I'd rather learn oil painting/water painting. But if it'll pay I'll learn Graphic Design as well. There are also undergraduate programs that teach that. But let's say I start at 40, hone my skill in 3 years, and by then not only the freelance market is saturated, also AI has taken over the entire field, in that case everything I learned will be in vain and I'll have to start all over again.

  
What would you do if you were in my position? Sorry to give you this kind of complicated dilemma, but such is the situation I'm in. A huge portion of it is my fault, but the other half is also the product of being in a society that's totally incompatible with my inner trait. Nevertheless, I'll have to find a way, one way or the other, no excuses needed. What would you do if you were in my position? Please give me your wisdom through years of surviving in the real world.

1iryd72,Don't know if I should continue with my job,"I currently work as a maintenance worker for a government funded housing complex. While I get paid generally well for the job and don't mind the work that I do, I absolutely had it with my supervisor. His condescending comments, poor communication and micromanagement has been a pain in the ass to deal with, and he even brags about how much of a prick he can be. On top of that, I have coworkers that hardly do any work and still maintain jobs for years on end, and one of my coworkers had to file a grievance due to overtime pay he wasn't adequately paid. I've been encouraged to speak up for myself and file a grievance of my own against my boss, but I'm not sure if I should try to resolve the issue with him directly first. 

For the past 3 years it seems like every time I start a new job I always find myself leaving after less than a year (sometimes less than 3 months in). It's nothing new for my generation to quit jobs often, but as a 27 year old man I really don't want to continue doing that. I want to find a career that I genuinely like that has opportunities for me to grow, but also one that pays well and treats me well. At the same time though, I also don't want to continue enduring toxicity and/or low compensation when I know there's better opportunities out there.

The hard part is I can't really make up my mind on what I want to do, and I keep getting pressure from my family to stay at my job despite everything that's going on. Specifically, my dad has told me that if he were hiring, he wouldn't want to hire someone with the resume with the multiple jobs I've had in the short amount of time. More importantly, my job offers a pension and good benefits and leaving it would mean losing that.

I've considered going back to school, as I haven't used the bachelor's degree I earned for years now. I'm also not sure if graduate school or trade school would be worth my time, and it's hard to find something that I feel strongly about doing.

All in all, I really don't know what the next step is if anything. I'm hoping for some perspectives on what I can do.

1irxxef,QA to where?,"Hi All,

I had been working as a manual QA from last 12+ years and was laid off last Feb. After that I have applied to multiple positions nearly 1500 on linkedin. Then during that time I learnt selenium, cypress, appium, framework setup with testng pom from scratch and little java and python too. 

I nearly had 10 interviews that I could not clear. I had done very well in most of the interviews - wrote a working java code and sql queries, answered to all testing related questions too but with 4/5 rounds at each company, I could not pass 2/3 round max. 

Now from last couple of months I am not even getting a single call. Not sure if the market is bad again. 

I have thoughts to switch my career since Im losing hopes in automation QA jobs. Im ready to learn anything at this point since Im a mom of 2 kids and need double income (both me and my husband must work) to pay mortgage at 6% and other expenses with this inflated prices. 

Can anyone suggest a career to switch to at nearly 40 and still learn and clear interviews and can sustain in it for atleast 10/20 years down the lane? 


I was checking cloud security engineer positions too but even there seemed a lot of people out there with a lot of competition just like automation QA. 

How is the market and future as a Python developer? Is there a too much competition there too?

1irwz8l,Would Law School be a good pivot after working as a TV News Producer for 7 Years?,"Hello r/careeradvice! (Crossposting with r/AskALawyer)

Asking for some advice about potentially going to law school.

Right now, I'm a TV News Producer in market 25, and I currently love my job a lot. However, the industry is showing a lot of cracks, and it's future is incredibly uncertain as we're constantly fighting for eyeballs in a world that largely blames the media for everything.

My day consists of a lot of reading, writing and building a newscast with video, inserting graphics and banners and adapting on the fly when need be. I'm also not necessarily a stranger to reading police reports, probable cause affidavits, or charges. I practically never eat for a lunch break, and I'm pretty much sitting at my desk typing or reading away from the moment I arrive, to about 5 minutes before showtime.

The company I work for has a mountain of debt, and opportunities for growth via any significant pay bumps or promotions feel as though they are mostly gone. Right now, I'm breaking about even on paying my monthly expenses. I've considered job hopping to a field with a similar skillset (Public Relations, Marketing, etc.), however, my coproducer has been trying for over a year to do that, and while he gets interviews, the same thing pops up in that employers struggle having an idea on what we do as producers.

I can't go work for a local competing station due to a noncompete clause in my current contract, and that noncompete doesn't expire until 1 year after the last day of employment with the station. That being said, my station is arguably the best paying in our market. My contract isn't up until March of next year, and my current apartment lease isn't out until June, which I can likely renew for another year if need be. So I have a little bit of time to consider this. I likely could take the noncompete to court and win the challenge, but I have no desire to hire an attorney to do that.

For some background, during my years in undergrad, I got to listen in-person on an aggravated battery jury trial, and I also got to take a 10-week crash course on 1st Amendment Law and enjoyed them both a lot. We got to listen to a lot of Supreme Court cases as well and I enjoyed hearing questioning and arguments from lawyers and justices. I also have enjoyed listening to debates from NPR's Intelligence Squared debates back when they were on stages with an audience.

What's holding me back is the financial aspect of going to grad school. From brief searches from an in-state university, it seems like it would cost around $130k on average to go for the degree, and interest rates on Student Loans seem pretty high at 8%. However, at the same time, Indiana's legislature is considering legislation that would address the [attorney shortage](https://www.wrtv.com/news/wrtv-investigates/bill-would-address-attorney-shortage-by-offering-scholarships-to-future-prosecutors-public-defenders#:~:text=House%20Bill%201049%20would%20create%20a%20state%20fund,%E2%80%94%20a%20maximum%20scholarship%20of%20%2460%2C000%20per%20student) in our [state (HB 1049)](https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/house/1049/details), providing up to $60k in scholarships if the recipient serves as a deputy prosecutor or public defender for at least 5 years. It seems like this bill is gaining traction and would likely become law this coming July.

EDIT: I also have roughly about $10k from current Student Loan debt from undergrad, which will be about $5k by next March.

Sorry if the long writeup, but I'm just considering my options on a potential career change during these uncertain times in the media, and I'm not sure how long I want to stick this out as a producer.

Midway through my contract, my boss told me that I’d be extended, but I haven’t heard anything since, and now I’m starting to feel uncertain.

The company has offered me a permanent role, but the salary would be between $65K-$75K. It comes with benefits (401k, health insurance, PTO, etc.), but it’s still a significant drop in pay.

I’m trying to weigh job security and benefits vs. staying at a higher salary but with no guarantee of renewal. I could try to find another contract at a similar rate, but there’s always the risk of gaps in employment.

I was even told once I lock in my degree I can definitely transfer to other departments I.e network or engineering..

1irv6ic,Just completed a bachelor’s in neuroscience in the US. Can’t land an interview.,"I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in neuroscience in December. I have some experience in research but the job market for clinical research is pretty rough right now. People are being laid off and I have only landed one interview due to a referral from a family member. I’ve applied to hundreds of entry level positions with a cover letter for most.

I am living with my mom and am about to start working in retail. I’m trying to figure out what other positions I could apply for or what skills I can gain in the meantime. I don’t want my career to stall out completely. I’m smart and willing to put in the work. I want to work now rather than continuing my education with a more advanced ($$$) degree.

Does anyone have ideas of what kinds of entry level positions I could pivot towards?

In addition to my research experience, I have a basic understanding of R and data analysis, which I have an interest in.

1irurpa,My partner has a master's degree and can't get a job. What can he do??,"Hi all -

  
My partner graduated with a Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing and Publishing in May of 2023 (plz don't say ""well that's your problem! What kind of job can that get you??""). Since then, he's had one copywriting job (which fell through because the business owner decided to fire his writers and use AI to generate content) but has not been able to land another job. He applies to every copywriting/editing/proofreading/tutoring job opening he can find, reaches out to hiring managers directly, and has gotten to the final round of interviews 8+ times without getting an offer. I've seen him grow more and more disheartened as time goes by and it makes me so sad to see him like this. 

  
At this point, he's open to any kind of writing role, whether it's copywriting, proofreading, editing, etc. However, he's also open to non-writing roles. The only issue is he doesn't have a ton of experience outside of his schooling, since he want straight from an undergrad in Journalism to his MFA program. He's open to remote and on-site roles. He's willing to do retail/service if needed, but I would love to see him doing something even SEMI related to his education while he tries to make sense of his next career move. Thoughts? Advice? Ideas for roles he should look into? TIA!

1irur0a,Left Job After 4 Years and Have Instant Regret,"My previous employer, like any other company, had its faults. Mismanagement by senior leadership, lack of promotions, favoritism, layoffs for the past 3 years. However, I excelled at my job, had the best manager and had built a network of trusted colleagues and friends. I admittedly just got tired of the corporate BS and saw my new job as the right move (title bump, salary increase, something new,etc.)  

I started my new job two weeks ago. Within 48 hours of being there, I realized I made a huge mistake. This new company is smaller, less integrated and doesn't respect any work/life boundaries. The role isn't what I was hoping for and I'm feeling incredibly defeated. I've worked until 9PM for 10/14 days. I came down with Covid last week  and was super sick. I was still messaged (repeatedly) after trying to ensure coverage with other team members after flagging how unwell I was (100 degree fever, body aches, etc.) How they handled my unexpected illness really solidified how much I regret my decision to leave my old job.

While I know there's a learning curve to any job, I do think it would be better to admit my mistake to my former employer sooner, rather than later, and see if I can go back. 

I left on good terms with my previous employer, but of course people knew I was leaving (i.e sent a farewell note, changed LinkedIn, etc.) I'm supposed to check in with my former manager (who's also a mentor and friend) this week and want to tell her how I'm feeling. While I feel stupid and ashamed, I don't think I'll survive another 30 days at my new employer. 

I'm not sure my previous employer can hire me back, but I feel like it's worth a shot. Should I shoot my shot now and try to go back? Has anyone done this successfully?

1iru5zq,How to Navigate Office Politics When Starting A New Position?,"I recently was offered a new job and want to hit the ground running by setting myself up well with office politics.

In college, I worked in the service industry and quickly learned that workplace politics played a huge role in opportunities and advancement. Now, at 29, I’m playing a bit of catch-up on the career ladder, and this will be my first true “office” job.

How can I best navigate office politics when starting out to position myself for future advancement and opportunities?

A bit more context:

- I have a degree in computer science but had to pivot due to the state of the tech market.
- I got my foot in the door because my partner is best friends with the manager’s daughter, which then lead to an interview.
- From what I understand, my qualifications may be a bit excessive for this role in a normal job market.
- The position is a Controls & Automation Engineering Specialist—I’ll be programming factory computers to automate production processes.
- I’ll be splitting time between the main office and factory sites that hire us.

I want to be proactive about setting myself up for success. What are the best strategies for managing workplace dynamics, building relationships, and positioning myself for growth?

1irtwsw,Should I turn down an internship after my professor stressed the risks of harassment?,"My professor told be to be careful about harassment now I am paranoid

apologies if this is the wrong sub but i think people here would have knowledge dealing with these kinds of issues and some useful advice.

I may have an opportunity to go abroad to Europe for a lab internship through cold emailing professors. However when I told my professor (who is a seasoned academic woman) she was advising me to be really careful as she thought his communication was odd. She was mainly alluding to harassment and advising me about distance but we wouldn’t know until we get there. Also how I would be an international intern in their lab makes me vulnerable to this kind of treatment. I’m paranoid as hell but not to sound desperate but I don’t wanna turn this down. I am really excited about this opportunity and the project looks great. We had an online interview and he seemed genuine. However I do recognise that I might be naive. He didn’t ask any personal or intrusive questions. 

My question is are there any warning signs, red flags, etc I should look out for. How do I prevent getting stuck in a bad situation if my professor is right. Has anyone had this experience before? i have another interview to meet with him online but other than this I am not sure how else to grasp.

Context: I’m a young woman (early 20s)and have never gone abroad for an internship before.

1irtswu,how to move forward in this situation?,"tldr - I’m miserable, overworked and burnt out  in my first job at a tech company postgrad, have no clue what I want to do next, and am completely frightened by the idea of quitting without anything else lined up. I also have a one way ticket to Europe in May. Do I continue to stick it out past May, stick it out til May and then quit and go travel a bit or just quit now? What would you do?

I’ve been in my job longer than I would’ve liked to by now, and it was my first thing out of school. I’ve honestly been itching to leave a little after I started — it’s a growing company and management has been poor in my opinion. No real mentorship, very lackadaisical. But I decided to stick it out a bit since the pay and perks were decent. 

But I’ve been struggling for the past year or so - the role has shifted around a lot and I’m doing things that not only I don’t want to do but am not good at. My plan over the past year was to work while looking for something new, but I suffer with pretty strong social anxiety and for whatever the reason just could not get myself to look for something after work/on the weekends, because I was finding work so draining. I’m also really unsure about what I want to do next. 

More recently work has been a mess (not going into details bc will doxx myself). I haven’t been sleeping or eating regularly, have a fallen out of my workout routine, and am now physically ill (nothing serious but overwork certainly contributed).

My workload is not slowing down at all and I just don’t see how I’m going to land something while I’m still here. I am so mad at the thought of quitting without anything else lined up, and having to explain that to potential future employers. But I just can’t take the way I’m being treated anymore, and unfortunately it’s not substantial enough to bring to HR.
 
I have a one way ticket to a destination in Europe in May for a random reason (again don’t want to doxx myself) - I wasn’t planning to use the ticket for that trip, but I am now seriously considering quitting by then and traveling for a while. I love traveling and have never done any solo travel, and as much as it’s not the best circumstances to do it, there’s never a good time for it either.

Has anyone been through a similar situation? How did you/ how would you handle it? Any advice on how to move forward would be much appreciated 🙏

1irs9jj,Burnt out 34yo restaurant manager - crazy to consider career change in current job market?,"I've been feeling desperate to change careers for the past couple years. I've been in restaurants my entire working life (15+ years) with the last 3+ in full-time management and I'm burnt out. My current salary ($66k) is right on par with entry-level salaries in the fields I'm targeting. Ideally I'd transition to something in finance or data. I have 3 years of experience with basic financial modeling in Excel and I'm currently taking a Udemy course to be more efficient and polished in my Excel work. I'm also studying for my SIE.

The most obvious transition is to find a data/financial analyst job for a food and beverage company. I think I would be an ideal candidate to analyze data and make operational recommendations since I've spent so much time in operations. A few years of experience in such a position would theoretically open the door to other industries.

I have a secure job right now, with potential to move into a senior leadership / corporate role in the next 1-3 years ($80k-$100k), but there is no real timeline or guarantee of anything. In theory, I'll have opportunities to change companies and move up as well.

I'm concerned because all I see (granted it's mostly on Reddit) is doom and gloom about the impending recession, layoffs, and increasing unemployment. My wife and I have a 2yo son, and even though she also makes around $65k, stability definitely matters.

My question is, would it be crazy to take a chance in a new field right now, where I would likely end up at the top of the list for potential layoffs? Is the fear of recession overhyped?

The expectation now is that I develop skills/perform in a capacity that is two levels above my paygrade. I've already been working well above my paygrade, but now he expects me to work on the same level as lower management without the compensation of that position. 

Meanwhile he is making an equity claim to justify expecting so much more from me than those at my level. Because I have been in the workforce longer, earned my masters degree, and generally have accumulated more experience, I am being held to a much higher standard. Despite the fact that I had to work my ass of for these accomplishments, he made it sound as if i was given a higher starting point and so should be expected to do more.

The interview I did last year went nowhere but I wasn’t skipped over. No one got it. Now here comes the part where I feel like I’m in a limbo situation. I’m one of the highest paid for my job title and they “can barely give me a raise each year.” Because if I were to transfer to another property they may not be able to pay me the same. So, I’m stuck with no higher position to attend to at the moment. If we lose the contract at the building I’m in they may have another site for me to go to but they can’t guarantee they will pay the same amount.

1irov68,Only person on my team forced into office and I feel useless…,"I work at a large company as a data analyst.

I am on a small team with a manager and a lead. Our entire department works in our building… except my team. The manager works at our other office in another state and the lead works remote due to our old office in that state being closed during the pandemic. That makes me the only person from my team in the building and the only “lone wolf”. (My boss’ bosses work in my building as well but we don’t interact.)

Despite being the only one on my team in the office, all questions/tasks/requests still get directed to the manager and lead who discuss it amongst themselves and occasionally fill me in.

I meet with my lead once a week and she delegates a handful of small tasks to me that I complete in a timely manner, only to be left with nothing to do the rest of the week.

Any time I reach out to my lead to say I have extra bandwidth, she assigns me (what she calls) “busy work”. Usually this consists of very minor report maintenance on old reports that people no longer use. Useless, time wasting stuff. I fully feel like “the help”. My lead is always being recognized for awards for her performance and the “millions of things she’s responsible for” while I’m not sure anyone knows who I am. 

I constantly see younger, newer people being hired in my office in my department (not on my team) and they are loaded with projects. Constantly in meetings, people coming by to ask questions, some being recognized for all of their hard work. Meanwhile I’m forgotten. The new hires don’t even get introduced to me. I’m very much the stapler guy from Office Space. 

I’m at the point where I’ve started applying for new jobs because I’m tired of it. I bring a lot of value to the table and it’s not going to use. I don’t want to leave because I’ve invested so much time learning the ins and outs of the business but I can’t help but feel like I’m being misused and pointlessly forced into an office I’m not a part of as a formality. Do I have alternatives?

1irogz8,How important is 2 years of my life? ( UNIVERSITY ADVICE),"I (20M) am currently 2 years into a 4 year degree studying mechatronics engineering ( will be going into my third year at the end of this month). However I found I do not enjoy the subject at all. despite this however, I found I am pretty naturally good at everything related to my degree being able to achieve an at least 90% in all of my classes.

Everytime I think about returning to university/college I simply dread everything about it I have also found I just simply can’t connect with anyone I meet at uni as well as I would hope, having no interest in my studies making me question how my social life will be in the future once all my old friends move on with their own life.

In my heart I know that I want to pursue something in music but I know a degree will not help me in what I’m hoping to achieve.

In the meantime however, the only other degree that interests me is medicine specifically ENT. Switching however would essentially mean binning the past two years of my progress and money and also meaning I would be people 2 years younger than me. This thought terrifies me as time is extremely valuable to me and switching would essentially mean finishing my degree at the age of 25 rather than 21 (medicine here is 5 years with first year being used a way to enter med school) less importantly I am also worried about the social stigma off being older than all my peers 

Furthermore, I am not 100% certain I can even make it into medicine if I pursue it as entrance requires more than just pure exam scores.

Essentially what im asking is how important will the two years I’ll be giving up be in the grand scheme of life and would it be more wise to complete my current degree then maybe pursue something else or change early before I lose even more time.

Not specifically looking for a direct answer to this I know I am the only one who can make the final decision but any advice or assurances would be greatly appreciated.

My husband and I started a cleaning and maintenance business in 2023 to make some extra money in the side. My husband quit his FT job this year to work our ""side"" job full time. He has plenty of work and is making double what he was working foe someone else. I do all the books and help clean apartment buildings twice a month. I also help clean vacant apartments when it's needed.
Here is my dilemma. I love my job but I'm finding that I'm having less time to help with the cleaning stuff and my husband is getting pretty busy with the handyman work. But I don't want to give up the cleaning (we make $1500/mo just in cleaning the building halls twice a month, let alone the vacancies that come up)
I make roughly $2800 take home from my regular job. Should I quit my job and work our business with my husband? I'd essentially fund my own retirement ($7000/year in an IRA for each of us). We are VERY healthy (we are on carnivore, have lost a lot of weight, feel great and have pretty much gotten rid of any health problems we had) so we haven't been using our health insurance. I'd probably shop around to find something for us just in case. I could always pick up more cleaning jobs and I think I'd make more money doing our business full time than staying where I am.

Please give me all your advice. I want to make the right decision for our future. I always thought staying where I am was smart but now I'm wondering if it is still a good decision.

1irmrc3,I was offered a new job that begins the same week I receive my bonus payout at my current company. Is there a good way to maneuver this?,"A couple of weeks ago I received a job offer and last week my background check was completed. Base pay will go from $75k to $99k, come with a senior title and full WFH. I liked my current role and loved my team, but it was a bit stressful and I didn't see much of a path for growth. But this company's reputation and the salary increase is too good to pass up. 

I think they're going to be pretty shocked when I give notice. I own the company's BI platform and am one of the only people who know how all of our company's data streams work. I'd be happy to offer them 5-10 hours a week to consult, honestly for some extra pocket change. 

Anyways, my tentative start date on 3/10. One problem, this is the first year my company has a 100% bonus pool. Meaning, I'll receive my full bonus. It will be disbursed on the week of 3/10. I honestly just didn't think about it because we never receive our bonus, but it's like $3-4k I'd like to have and have earned.

I imagine my company won't be keen on giving a departing employee this money. I don't trust HR. I don't think my current boss would screw me over, but he's not in charge of it at the end of the day. And I don't know if the new company is going to help me at all (it's a Sr Analyst role at a big company, I'm not some director getting signing bonuses), nor would I expect them to.

1irm0fr,"I landed an associate level job, I’m 23 (youngest employee), recent grad, and they want me to start a program from scratch. Anyone have any advice?","Hi everyone, I’ve never posted on Reddit before but have asked friends and family about this and have gotten pretty standard answers so I figured I’d ask on here. 

I recently got a job paying around $40k a year as a recent college graduate with a company that has no experience in the industry that they are trying to push this new program within. I am the only one who has been hired to help create this new “tourism” program so the work has been not only confusing but taxing on my mental health. To give a little bit of background, I had graduated after about 5 years of college which in general was not a great time for me. I have no friends from college and had a couple awful experiences that have worsened my MDD and whatever other crap I might have, so I didn’t necessarily leave college with great memories. A week after graduation I moved to another state to begin this role. So, I’m feeling a bit burnt out to say the least. They had hired me based upon  my college experience and 5 month internship in hopes that I could bring my tourism knowledge to the table and create a new program internally within their organization to create additional revenue streams. They have a program that helps folks get work done on their homes and it’s been around for quite some time and each year about 100-200 or so volunteers help to complete this work and pay my organization for lodging and sourcing the service projects. The person who had previously led the housing volunteer side of things never recorded anything and essentially did not leave enough information for me to take over the program in an efficient manner so I’m finding myself constantly asking questions as im am approaching the 4/mo employment mark. While asking questions in theory is a good thing it’s getting to the point where I can tell my supervisor is tired of it. Anyways, this organization I work for wants me to essentially recreate the housing volunteer side of things and outsource new groups while also creating other tourism packages simultaneously for service work tours that source volunteers for more leisure base oriented tours and even tours specifically focused on outdoor recreation. 

At the moment I’ve already established 8 different groups for this summer within the organizations housing program which amounts to about 120 people total (about $25k-$55k total revenue dependent on group turnout/registrations), and have created over 25 documents, and sent at least 300 emails both for sourcing new groups and interdepartmental. The goal is to have 10 total groups, but of course it’s a bit too late in the year to meet that quota as they hired me halfway through the year and registration closes in March. Missing this “quota” is something that really drags me down, but with all the work I’ve had to do to gain a foothold in this company I’m not sure if it’s realistic to beat myself up for it? While I’ve completed all of this work I only see my supervisor once a week and this person has a different departmental role entirely. So ultimately I’m feeling pretty lost, always second guessing decisions, and wondering how any tourism knowledge I may have retained from college and my internship could ever apply to this role aside from the marketing portion. 

So, I’m leading a housing volunteer program, kind of like habitat for humanity, as the only employee, while also generating ideas and the back work for new tour packages. From 7:30am - 5pm I’m marketing, finding clients, recording/creating documents with no outreach lists, historical references, marketing campaigns, or any history of tourism expenditures within the organization all while dealing with crappy moving companies, a broken washer/dryer, an evil landlord, and trying to pay for bills and find at least one available doctor to prescribe medication in this state. 
Eventually the organization wants the housing service side of things to be a single tour package option, and they want 2-3 other tourism packages that focus on different facets of the region and it is my job to make this happen. One other challenge is that I am the youngest one in the organization, and maybe the youngest person they have ever hired. In my office I am maybe 20-30 years younger than most if not all of my colleagues, so this presents challenges with pushing different ideas or clashing work styles. I’ve been seeing articles about gen z work styles vs gen x, where gen x is more “here’s the project now come to me if you have any questions” whereas gen z just wants a straightforward “tell me what to do and I’ll do it”. This difference in work styles is ever apparent in my organization and makes it difficult to have confidence in my work. I am also the only person who works on the tourism side of things in this organization and do not have any other employees by my side to complete this work which presents challenges as I have no one my age to collaborate or work with, and no one to assist me in this work. I of course can ask my supervisor questions but I only meet with them once a week and a lot happens in a week. 

To all the people that might read this, what should I do? My goal is to stick around until the end of the year and see if this job works for me, but I’m beginning to think I could have done better with a company that already had a framework for a tourism department established prior to hiring for a role like this. Is the role to big for me, or am I getting in my own way with this style of thinking? 
Did I fail in not being able to get 10 groups versus the 8 that are booked for this summer? 

I mean, I’m still at the drinking beer and playing Jedi survivor phase of my life, and I’d love to travel. No one wants to work, but everyone needs to and that’s fine, I have no issues working, but the big question here is, is this company the right fit for me and should I be doing this amount of work with what I’ve been given and where I stand in my career? 

Any advice or criticism is welcomed. I would only ask that anyone who might view this does not go looking for the organization I work for as they do not really need to know my vast array of insecurities! Thanks all!

While I have received significantly increasing bonuses each year, making my total compensation adequate, something doesn’t feel right about my salary remaining flat. Receiving my recent promotion was almost disappointing because of the lack of salary change.

My manager indicated that we have had a small amount to allocate to salary increases over the last couple years and that he has prioritized increasing the salaries of our more junior analysts while my “bonus will make up for it”.

1irj901,Losing my work partner and Feeling Overwhelmed,"Hi everyone,

I work in a small company as part of a tiny sub-team—just my boss, my colleague, and me. My colleague and I are both 22, and over time, we've developed an incredible synergy, tackling major projects together despite being a small team with a heavy workload.

Unfortunately, I just found out that my colleague is leaving for another company. This hit me hard, not just because we’re friends, but because we work so well together. Our field is quite niche, so finding a replacement won’t be easy. Now, I’ll be the only one left besides my boss, and I can't imagine handling everything we used to split between the two of us.

To be honest, I’m starting to panic. I’m afraid that with my colleague gone, my individual productivity will drop significantly, and that might put my job at risk. But it’s not just about the workload—all of his support and second opinions helped me immensely. Having someone to brainstorm with, validate ideas, and share responsibility made everything more manageable. Losing that feels like I’m losing a key part of how I work.

How can I navigate this transition effectively?

Thanks in advance!

1irj3ef,Not sure what to pick,"Hey reddit! Any advice and guidance would be appreciated. I really need help especially with the economy going the way it is and I’m trying to start a family with my wife. Both are telecommute options.

I am faced with 2 options in my current career.i recently applied for 2 positions. 1 internally and 1 externally. Both will increase my pay. 


Here are my two options:
1. Stay at my current company getting paid $130,000 basically doing the same thing I’m doing now. Will not exactly learn anything new and I will also be the only developer the team (I like working on a team more so I can learn from more talented developers) Continue to get my bonus every year and 401k match and all my other benefits.

2. Move externally, getting paid $135,000. Learning more of Python and other skills that can potentially earn me $200k in the future. 1st year at this company will not pay me 401k, 2nd year only get paid 50%, then 3rd year is when I get the full 6% match. Also this companies do not have bonuses.

Which one would you pick and why? Especially with this economy. I want to make sure that I am not being biased because I’ve been wanting to leave my current company for a long time now.. 

Here is my problem. I do want an environment where I can learn from others which option 1 WILL NOT give me but the benefits at my current company and 401k and bonuses are hard to ignore.. option 2 is a better growth opportunity, not sure if it matters but I am 30 so have some skills under my belt but could still be considered new.

1irj169,Seeking serious and helpful advice!,"Hey everyone,

I’m seeking serious career advice -please respond only if you're confident about your comments.

**Background:**  
I’m a 27-year-old professional in the content creation industry with a bachelor's in literature and a diploma in filmmaking/photography. For the past five years, I’ve worked with an overseas diplomatic mission (12 LPA), with a total of seven years of formal experience. I’m considering a career shift to tech (AI and big data) and plan to pursue a bachelor’s degree abroad—most likely in Germany—as a starting point.

**Reasons for the switch:**

1. Subjectivity in Art: Creative work in India is increasingly subjective, making it harder to receive fair compensation despite the effort involved in the projects delivered.
2. AI’s Impact on Content Creation: With AI emerging rapidly, much of the content creation process is most likely to be dominated by generative AI in the next five years, prominently affecting job security. It's a personal opinion based on my experience and industry giants. Some roles have already been compromised.
3. A personal preference to establish a career outside India.

**Questions:**

1. Is it worthwhile to transition into AI-driven tech fields (e.g., algorithm development or its large-scale implementation)? Are there other promising fields to consider?
2. Would it be more practical to complete a bachelor’s in India before moving abroad, considering I am already 27?
3. Open to alternative tech career paths, advice to reconsider, or any other practical suggestions.

Thanks in advance—eager to hear your thoughts and get the ball rolling. ",That-Access8577,1,1.0,0,1739796362,2025-02-17 12:46:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1irj169/seeking_serious_and_helpful_advice/,2,2025

1irhl1z,Freelancer being expected to commit like an employee - help!,"Okay so this is a rant really, but any advice about whether I should move on to something else is welcome.

I’m a freelance creative (27) in the UK whose main income comes from being a self-employed artist, but my side hustle for the past 4.5 years has been working on social content for a small creative company as a freelancer. I’m essentially on an unofficial retainer, where I work 10 hours a week for £10 per hour. This company aren’t the best at communicating all the time, and they have a team of about 6 employed staff. 

My main income takes up pretty much the rest of my week, so time is limited - as a freelancer with them, I have the mindset that I do what I need to do within my set paid hours, and if they want more they need to ask and assure me I’ll get paid for the extra hours I work. 

However, I’ve always felt completely walked all over at this place. They take a lot of energy from me, they constantly change their mind about what marketing direction they want to go in, and they then blame me when it doesn’t work. If their socials don’t translate into sales every month then it’s my fault, which I guess maybe it is. But I’m working my *ss off for these people whenever I can, and I feel completely underappreciated. As the only female member of the company I feel I’m scapegoated as the one to blame.

I’m also asked to attend extra days of meetings and other things, very last-minute, without being paid extra for coming into the office (my role is supposed to be remote). They then get upset with me if I don’t come, or if I have other commitments.

I guess the basic TLDR is, this company I freelance 10 hours a week for on less-than minimum wage are upset that I’m not prioritising them as though I’m an employee. They want employee-level commitment & hours for little pay & a non-secure role.

I love my job and my colleagues. However, the management and leadership were (and still are) making me sick. I’m completely burned out - to the point where I feel numb, angry all the time, and very negative. Even my friends have commented on it because they’re worried about me.

I thought quitting would give me some energy to get through the final weeks, but right now, I feel so overwhelmed. Five weeks feels like an eternity. I woke up early on Saturday and Sunday, feeling somewhat energized, and managed to do some of the things I enjoy, even though I still feel burned out. But today, Monday, I woke up feeling so exhausted -like I almost have to drag my legs with my arms because they can’t move on their own.

So my question is: How can I survive these final five weeks?",Livid-Hat-9090,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1739788858,2025-02-17 10:40:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1irh2sd/i_quit_my_job_and_i_have_five_work_weeks_left_how/,2,2025

1irg89i,22m- deciding between pursuing law or skilled trade as a career.,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice regarding my career options- especially from lawyers or skilled tradesman, I would like to hear about your experience.

I 22m have been weighing up if I should become an electrician/HVAC technician to kickstart my career or go all in to become a lawyer and study at university.

After high school, I wasn’t sure what I wanted for a career so I just worked retail and warehousing until I could figure it out. I went university at 18 but left after a year as I only did it for the sake of going university at the time (different degree).

Why I say trade?
- I enjoy working with my hands and being outside. Low start-up cost, paid to learn, goal to start a business once Im licensed and maximise my earning potential. work doesn’t follow me home.
My only concern is how sustainable this path may be for me as I get older.

Now, for law.

I would most likely specialise in personal injury or corporate. 

-  I find the aspect of reading cases, going to court to testify, and working in an air conditioned office at a good law firm at the city very interesting. I also love the aspect of having to wear a nice suit to work everyday and look professional.

But ofcourse, I’ve only mentioned the good sides here, which what makes law school very competitive. I will likely accumulate a lot debt and would need to compete for internships with thousands of students and maintain a very good gpa to get considered into a top-tier or mid-tier law firm. The study load can be very rigorous but I’m confident that regardless of which career path I choose, I will go all in.

I also don’t prefer to bring work with me home but the latter (law) option might not be accommodating in that department. 

I’m interested in you’re opinions and experience.

1irg6k0,Music industry career paths—any advice?,"I hope this post does not become too long but I would truly appreciate someone's advice on the music industry and maybe get some insight into some career options I have not thought about yet.

Some things about myself… Since kindergarten, I have been singing (not professionally but have been part of choirs). From there, I have also been dancing for 15+ years (that includes coming up with a few dance routines). Now, fast-forward to gymnasium (aka upper secondary school), I started to understand the importance of securing a future for myself financially, so I pursued a science field (mathematics more specifically). As a final-year IT student, I have come to the conclusion that I want to try an analytics position (and potentially see myself working for the next couple of years). 

Now here's where things get interesting.. I truly miss being creative. I TRULY love the concepts of concerts, like I mean I LOVE concerts. I don't mean just seeing artists perform but the wholesome feeling you get from it – no one gives a fck about what others think about you, everybody is smiling, dancing, laughing, screaming, FEELING the music, and for an hour everyone enjoys the present and being content.  Being at concerts and being surrounded by music is just such a dopamine high for me - singing my lungs out, enjoying the moment (with friends), being surrounded by loud music that leaves no room for thinking about your problems and feeling united with everyone on the stadium or concert hall. The same is with Eurovision, from 2009 (as early I can remember), I have loved every minute of it – I have not seen it live yet, but every year for one week, everyone is united by music, and every country shares their stories, music, feelings and it just gives me chills. All in all, if I could earn income by visiting concerts I would probably be the happiest human alive xd

Lastly, last week I was coincidentally able to visit Avicii's museum and ohboy how I cried after that – this was the last bit for me to remind myself that I CRAVE to be part of the music industry. I am not trying to say that I want to become the next Avicii, but more so that the way he was able to follow his passion. I want to be so focused on something that I LOVE as he did, I want to give people something so that they can come together because of it, and get the feeling of high I do when I am visiting concerts and just overall get the feeling like every person is on top of the world with me - I want to give back something, I want to be able to share the same kind of rush I get when I take part of concerts. Even Avicii was able to bring EDM to people who know nothing about it - he brought people together and gave a reason to them to sing their lungs out, dance until their feet hurt and night to remember forever.

Now, I tried to combine my (possible) analytics 9-5 job with the music industry and look for a job but I have no idea if those kinds of jobs even exist or if I would be happy about it (the analytics part). I started singing lessons but to be honest I don't think I see myself on stage 24/7 and singing feels more like a hobby. Could there be a place in the music world for someone who wants to be behind the scenes (but I don't mind being on stage), creating those euphoric moments before they hit the stage? Anyway, I wanna know if someone can relate to this and share their bit of experience on what they have done or if someone has an idea of the ""music concert” jobs. It feels like now or never to make a decision that doesn't just pay the bills but also fills my soul.

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate any advice you can give!",Dependent-Chair993,1,1.0,0,1739784978,2025-02-17 09:36:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1irg6k0/music_industry_career_pathsany_advice/,2,2025

Got a call from a recruiter, I just woke up and took it. Andd boy... I wasn't completely right about my experience (off by a month)... Couldn't remember my current salary in Per Annum so said that monthly and expect in.... * brain freeze**.... Current salary...Yeah... X Per Annum. 

Then, I didn't have the exact experience she's looking for. I could have said I'm interested, I'm willing to learn. But no, I just said... I know X Y Z. I don't know R thing.

Maybe it wasn't that bad? Maybe it was okay?

A few days ago, I received a call from my old boss that they'd like to offer me my job back a year and half later after I decided to resign. I was so excited to receive that call because truth be told I loved my job however, the stress was a lot plus I felt unappreciated, micromanaged and demeaned by my boss. I currently work at a dental office and make $23/hour plus bonuses- three 8hr shifts, two five hour shifts, no PTO and four women co-workers. I never dread going to work and my boss always shows appreciation which is something I've never experienced before.

My old job offered to pay me $26 an hour with paid time off and although I enjoyed my position, my work environment was quite toxic. But gawd I cant help but consider how an extra $500 a month could help as I live alone in LA. I started the onboarding process but I have until tuesday to either proceed or stay put.

1ire8mp,Need Career Advice: Stay in Current Job with Promotion or Switch to New Role?,"Hey everyone,

Sorry is long!

I’m at a career crossroads and could really use your advice.

I currently work as a Production Manager, and I oversee the maintenance department. However, it’s been really tough working with the head of maintenance—he’s older, resistant to change, and doesn’t like being told what to do. This has been draining me mentally and leading to burnout, to the point where I sometimes question whether I’m a good leader.

In a few weeks, I’m set to be promoted, where I’ll be responsible for around 100 people. I already work with them, and it’s going well—much better than with the maintenance department. But my bad experience with maintenance makes me doubt if I can handle such a large team.

At the same time, I recently got an offer for a Deputy Director position in another company. In this role, I’d be managing a team of consultants and working on making their support to clients more efficient. It’s a corporate, office-based role, which excites me because:

1-.I enjoy optimizing processes and making things more efficient.

2-.It would look great on my CV and help me develop new skills.

3-.My current job keeps me on the factory floor all day, and I’m already feeling burnt out. The new role is more strategic and remote, managing operations from the office.

The challenge is the salary. My current company is offering me a significant raise (around $15K more), while the new offer is about the same as my current salary.

So, what would you do in my situation? Stay and take the promotion, challenging myself to lead a bigger team despite my struggles with the maintenance department? Or switch to the new role, even with a lower salary, because it aligns more with my long-term career growth and moves me away from factory work?

I’m currently a 3rd year Econ student with no finance internships, I have finance clubs on my resume but they’re not great. I recently found out about this insane recruitment program that could help to possibly place into IB summer internships- but would I even be eligible for Summer Analyst programs if I already have a Bachelors degree? On all the applications they just say “Current undergraduate student graduating 202x.” 

This second degree would put my grad date 2 years after my original 2026 grad date, so 2028 with a little bit of time to prepare for the next recruiting cycle. But I understand that this is a very non traditional route and idk if it’s allowed or feasible.

The second bachelors would be in Computer Science. I understand that it’s not at all related to IB, but if I manage to get investment related internships, would this help? I can’t get a Finance degree at my school, I want to stay at my school so some of my credits roll over and it would only take 2 years.

And before anyone asks about doing a Masters, all of the applications for IB SA seem to say they only accept undergraduate students? Not sure if there’s a loophole there. Also, if I start a combo masters program at my school, my grad date would be 2027 and I’m far too late for 2026 SA internships given I have no connections and no related experience.

Getting more exposure in my investment banking clubs really made me think that I want to pursue this path.

The people/company, expanded responsibilities, and the idea of something new makes it somewhat tempting, but it takes my career in a slightly different direction than my ideal, making it a bit of a tough decision.

**(I did use AI to help me write this to help structure my sentiments in a way that is organized for the people of Reddit.)**

---

**Hey everyone,**

I’m facing a tough career decision and would love your insights. Just **one week ago**, I started a **Digital Marketing Manager (AVP title)** role at a corporate mortgage company with a **$120K salary**. I wanted stability, but the environment has proven to be restrictive:
- They’re **adamantly against AI**; on my first day, I was accused of trying to download it when I was only reading about it.
- To install work email on my phone, I have to give **root access**, which feels invasive. 
- After a **week**, I still don’t have access to **WordPress**, which is core to my role.

Now, I have a **competing offer from a Private Equity-backed coaching company** for a **Growth Marketing Manager role at $140K (remote)**, offering more creative freedom and leadership potential. However, I’m worried about:
1. **Job stability** due to PE ownership.
2. Being enticed by high pay and remote work, only to face layoffs post-sale.

### Things I’m Weighing:
✅ **Corporate Job (Stability)**
- Predictable path, **5% 401(k) match** with strong benefits, and decent work-life balance.
- **Downside**: Restrictive policies and slow processes.

✅ **PE-Backed Job (Growth)**
- **401(k) with a 4% match** that vests immediately, higher pay, and creative control.
- **Downside**: Risk of instability if restructured.

### Personal Factors:
I’m **32, married, with a child**, so stability matters, but I also want to advance my career. I feel guilty about considering leaving the corporate job after only a week.

Would you go for the **higher-risk job** or stick with corporate **stability**? Any experiences with PE-backed companies vs. corporate jobs would be appreciated!

**Thanks for your thoughts!**",VapureTrails,0,0.33000001311302185,0,1739770171,2025-02-17 05:29:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1irclsv/leave_new_job_for_another/,2,2025

1iraj28,Should I stay in University for an extra year?,"I am a 5th year senior who can graduate in May this year. I major in Criminology & Criminal Justice, with a minor in Computer Science. My question pertains to the fact that though I only have the minor currently in CS, I could stay and extra year in University, do the double major, and get both degrees as I have 4 more CS courses left to do so. I am though unsure if this is even worth it. I don’t enjoy the CS course work that much, especially as it has gotten to the higher level courses. They are very difficult, I have failed a few, and my school’s CS program is okay, but far from good. The area of CS that I enjoy is Data Science, as I have done a research fellowship this year in this, and it has been great. It made me decide that I would eventually like to work in that field. So, from that newfound perspective it made me think that doing the double could be a good idea. My other option though is applying to graduate school, specifically an online program. I would take a gap year to pay off my undergrad debt, and then apply. It would allow me to work part time, while also getting a masters in Data Science. I guess my question is which path is better? Getting my BA in Criminal Justice & Criminology, with a minor in CS, then going to graduate school for Data Science, or Staying the extra year and doing a double major?

Long story short I called a microphone I had to speak throughout in drive thru stupid and that I couldn’t hear the customer and I did apologize for that. Then because I asked the same question 3 times then she helped me after the 3rd time figure out her name, she got mad at me and filed a compliant. Yet two of my other coworkers had a complaint filed against them for something and they did not get fired. I also had two coworkers go throughout my stuff to make sure it was correct but the second coworker I did not trust because she kept feeding me wrong information while I was being trained. The boss knew that she kept feeding me wrong info but I could not prove a leading factor as to why they fired me when it was not my fault. I want to apply to other banks but I know being fired from a bank isn’t the best thing to have with my only experience from one and the fact that it’s very unprofessional as to why I got hired but it’s been a long 10 months and I can understand now how I should of handled that situation differently.

1ir8zxu,Is a masters degree worth it?,"So I just graduated and recently got an internship because my undergraduate (basically a bachelor degree) program only lasted for 3 years and I didn’t manage to get an internship on my second year which results in me having a hard time finding a full time job after i graduated. Most people at my workplace have a masters and I think I might have better chances scoring a decent job with a masters degree. Even if that’s not the case I already have a specific field that I’m super interested in on a personal level. At first my vision after my undergraduate degree was to get some work experience then do a masters but given the job market that just ain’t happening. Companies would interview me and can’t even be bothered to send an AI generated rejection email even after a whole day assessment and in person interview.


TLDR: I have 2 problems: 1. I can’t seem to get a job with just a bachelor degree and no experience, 2. Even if i were to be able to get a job it probably wouldn’t be in the field i’m interested in which i wanna do for my masters.

1ir8q0x,I got fired from my last toxic job; how can I explain this in future interviews?,"Long story so I’m going to try to summarize (and leave out specific details just in case)

I worked a coffee job for the past 3+ years. I originally loved this job and what the company stood for, and I put my all in and the boss/owner was even vocally appreciative of the hard work I put in. 

Then about a year ago, the culture started to get very toxic and cliquey due to my new manager above me. I’d considered all the coworkers friends until this point but when it started to shift more toxic, I tried to distance myself and keep out of it. This led to me being targeted by my manager, and I even got a write-up that was all false claims of my work ethic and character. I handled it professionally and tried to continue to work with my head down.
It was then brought to my attention that my manager went as far as to go into my google account on the company computer, so I reported this as well as other fireable offenses (drug use on shift, drinking in the shop after hours, etc.). The owner claimed to have done a thorough investigation into these claims, but nothing came of it. 

Then about 6 months later, I got called in for a meeting with no explanation and got fired. It was again all untrue claims of misconduct against my manager and another coworker who is close with my manager (whom had been openly rude to my friend and I in the weeks leading up to this). It was all written in a narrative because if it were strictly factual actions, there would be nothing. There were even “quotes from me badmouthing my manager” that were words I had never spoken before, but since all of it was her word versus mine, the owner was not willing to listen to anything I had to say and was extremely cold to me. Needless to say, it was very disappointing that after everything I did, my employment there was reduced to lies on paper that I couldn’t even refute.

I guess my question now is how to professionally handle the questions I’ll inevitably get in future job interviews about why I left/was fired from my last company. I already can’t put down references from my previous boss nor manager due to this whole situation, but now I’m worried I’ll be unable to get another job since there’s no way to explain why I was fired and/or can’t provide references. Any advice? 

Tl;dr: nasty people doing nasty things caused me to get fired from my last job.

1ir7h0a,Any advice for a 65F looking to continue her career in marketing?,"A little background: I was a mid-level manager (valued by my manager, no performance issues). I have good professional references. My direct reports loved me as a manager because I looked out for their well-being more than other managers had ever done. I was laid off after 15 years at a leading global marketing agency almost 2 years ago due to RIFs when the agency lost a major client and missed our numbers big time. After my latest review and raise, I was making $150K and led a team of eight. There were many rounds of deep cuts; I wasn’t hit early on—no resentment on my part; it was a business decision.

Before that role, I worked in B2B and B2C marketing for tech manufacturers for another 10 years. I’m not ready to retire—financially or otherwise—I have a lot of enthusiasm for problem solving, building collaborative relationships, managing projects, improving processes, meeting business goals, etc. I’m healthy, young at heart, and I hope to work for another 10 years.

I enjoyed a generous severance and 6 months of unemployment benefits and have been able to secure a couple of freelance gigs, one for a single project and one that was going to lead to a FT job until that company moved to quickly cut costs drastically, do RIFs, and pause freelance contracts. We may not be in an official recession, but it’s still tough all around.

My search has been for mid-senior level jobs matching my skill set and experience. I had some first- and second-round interviews early on, worked through my network for some of those opportunities, and I’m not getting a lot of hits lately and must admit to myself that ageism may be a factor. (I know, it sounds like I may have an identity crisis, but I have always worked and socialized well with all ages.)

So, I’ve begun widening my job search to include lower skill level (and hence lower paying) non-managerial positions, as well as to industries that may not be as tied to ageism as marketing and tech are. I’m still hopeful and excited to find another opportunity, and I know I can contribute positively most anywhere. I love to learn and don’t bring a giant ego with me. But I know it’s an employer’s job market with much younger and equally experienced candidates vying for slim pickings. It doesn't seem like an advantage to me to apply for less relevant roles.

I should note I am in the US (Salt Lake City) mostly looking for remote jobs for the flexibility that offers.

I’d appreciate any advice on how I can position myself to be a valued candidate in today’s job market so I can continue a thriving career for a few more years.",Realistic-Raccoon78,1,1.0,6,1739753351,2025-02-17 00:49:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ir7h0a/any_advice_for_a_65f_looking_to_continue_her/,2,2025

1ir74ff,Performance Review Advice,"Hi Redditors,

<New account for obvious reasons>

For the last fifteen years I have worked for a tech company that has exploded in growth.  My title is Director of Implementation and have twelve managers and sixty one employees implementing six different products.   One of the products is not mature, and everyone in my group finds it very difficult to implement.  My team implemented hundreds of projects in 2024.  

Our company, like many in this space, is managing lower performance employees out, and replacing them with workers that take lower salaries in other countries.

With this company I have received good performance appraisal scores from six different managers (VPs); Averaging a five out of seven, which is defined as ""Good."" In my 2024 performance appraisal, my manager (VP), who was hired externally just three months ago, rated my performance a 3.9 (""Improvement Needed""). I feel that my performance was not fairly evaluated and here’s the reason why:

My manager listed four deficiencies that no other prior manager has mentioned to me.  Additionally, my manager did not previously discuss these deficiencies with me until my performance review. His descriptions were vague and did not include metrics. I am having a hard time with this score because 95% of what me and my team are doing is good work and at no point has my manager or another Executive indicated that I have been underperforming. A 3.9 or lower usually indicates that an employee will be placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) that is difficult to fulfill and the employee could be subject to termination at the end of the PIP period.

Yes, I missed about three deadlines out of \~150 activities. My team and other groups in the company have also struggled selling and completing projects due to an immature product. I requested to have a weekly or twice a week touch base with my manager both in email and verbally with no response. My emails and instant messages have also gone unanswered even when the subject matter included important changes or decisions needed. 

I have an opportunity to put comments in the system in response to this appraisal that came in at 3.9 (""Improvement Needed""). Should I leave comments in my appraisal? If so, what should I include?

I am 29F who recently moved to Canada (Toronto) and I’m feeling incredibly stuck with my career path. I have an MBA in Marketing with experience in business development and sales from my home country. Since moving here, I haven’t been able to find a suitable job in my field. Out of passion and a bit of experience, I landed a job as a cake decorator in a factory. While I’m grateful for the work, it’s not sustainable long-term, and I’ve been actively looking for a change. The problem is, I’m torn between two directions:
	1.	Corporate Career: I started studying for my CAPM certification and plan to take the exam soon, hoping this might open up opportunities in project management. I think a stable corporate career could provide financial security and growth.
	2.	Baking Business: On the other hand, I’ve always dreamed of running my own small home bakery or even opening a cafe one day. Baking brings me joy, and I’ve started a small side hustle, but I’m not sure how realistic it is to grow it into something sustainable, especially when I need financial stability right now.

I’m so stressed because I feel like I’m at a crossroads and don’t know which path to commit to. Part of me feels I should go all-in with project management for stability, but my heart seems to pull me toward baking.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you figure out what direction to pursue? Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated.

Our company, like many in this space, is managing lower performance employees out, and replacing them with workers that take lower salaries in other countries.

Three months ago the company hired a new manager( VP) externally.   This new manager rated me a 3.9 (improvement needed).  He listed four deficiencies that no other prior manager has mentioned.   did not discuss these deficiencies either.  I am having a hard time with this score because 95% of what me and my team are doing is good work and at no point has my manager or another Executive indicated that I am underperforming.    A 3.9 usually indicates that an employee will get an Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) that is difficult to fullfill and are terminated after the PIP period.

I missed about three deadlines out of \~150 and struggling to close out some implementations related to the one immature product.  This manager does not respond to my emails even when the subject matter includes important changes or decisions needed.  My manager does not respond in our instant messaging app either.

I asked to have a weekly or twice a week touch base with this manager both email and verbally.  The email requests go unanswered and when discussing verbally, there is no response.

I have an opportunity to put comments in the system in response to this lower appraisal and my manager will be able to see them.  It is unknown if it will be read by HR or Executives.

Here are some thoughts.  Which one should be included in my response?  Feel free to add any responses you think would be important and not listed here.

1. Should I respond to this performance appraisal?
2. The score of 3.9 is disappointing, all previous scores over the last 15 years.
3. Respond confirming these items are acceptable, admitting the criticism.
4. Had a known that my manager felt this way, I could have taken in action.  These items have not been shared with me previously.
5. Since you are the first to outline these issues, please defer a Pip  for a few months to allow me to address these items.  (He did not suggest I was going to get a PIP)
6. Let’s meet and confirm every few weeks so that you will realize the vast improvement in each and every item.
7. Outline how much I enjoy my work.



Additional Bonus Questions:

If responding to the performance appraisal is the right move here, do I copy HR in it?  

Do I copy the Executives or an Executive that I believe is a good mentor?

Do I let my manager know I have sent copies to others if it is decided to share with HR or Executives?",BlueCollarMess,1,1.0,0,1739747634,2025-02-16 23:13:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ir5ib8/difficult_and_important_career_decision/,2,2025
1ir5d9q,Would I regret this?,"Hey Fam! I’m looking for some advice. I (27 F) was a server for years (in one of the top tourist destinations in the US), and I thought what I wanted was to get out of it and get a “real job” like I’d always been told I needed to. 

We had some life changes and moved across the country, and I ended up getting a sales role at a tech startup. But I think I hate it? The rigid hours, being expected to work outside of my 40 hours for “the grind”, sitting at a desk all day, the stress of making quota. It was fun at the beginning, but I’m really unhappy. 

I’ve been teaching myself Adobe Illustrator, I hope to be working for myself someday soon. But in the meantime, what do I do? Do I keep at this job that’s sucking the life out of me, because it looks “better” on paper? Or do I go back to serving for more flexibility, and because I KNOW I’m good at it? 

Has anyone made a similar switch? Do you regret it? Thanks in advance ❤️

1ir3afw,27M Considering Career Change from Federal Employee to Financial Advisor,"Please provide me your opinions. I have worked for GSA my entire professional career as a Contract Specialist, in other words I am in procurement and I buy AE and Construction services for federally owned buildings. Obviously with everything going on, my job security is shaky at best. I am a solid performer but who knows what will happen. I currently am making 104k as a GS12 step 3, which is fantastic and I receive annual raises and move up GS steps as well. This job provides me with everything I need, the work life balance is unreal, I have great benefits, it's low stress, and the pay is better than anything I would be making elsewhere and I will be able to have a great retirement if I stay here my entire career. 

  
Those are the pros, here are the cons. I find my job to be dreadfully boring. I am not challenged, I am unmotivated, I feel stagnant, and I know I am capable of greater things. Working from home it was okay because I could be productive around the house while still working, but we are about to go into the office full time. I consider telework a privilege and not a right so I don't mind it as a concept, the only thing is that it means I will be very bored. Like, spinning in my chair for 6 hours a day bored. Trying to look busy as I stare at my computer screen after I finished all my work for the day within an hour, it feels like torture. Plus Elon could fire me at any moment so while job security was a huge ""pro,"" now it is a huge ""con."" The workplace morale is miserable and we are constantly receiving threatening messages from the folks up top. 

  
With all the uneasiness, I've been doing some soul searching and I know that my dream job would be to become a CFP. I am passionate about financial planning and spend hours of my free time working on my own financial plans. I feel it is a meaningful career that would challenge and inspire me and it's definitely what I want to do with my life. However, to break into the financial industry, I would likely need to step back a significant amount of pay. I have 3 job offers, one for Northwest Mutual and another for a different financial advising firm, but both of those are commission only and seem super risky. I have another job offer from Vanguard that would pay for my SIE, Series 7, and Series 63, but the salary is 65k. That is a 40k salary reduction and it would take YEARS to get back to the level I am currently at. I believe that the overall ceiling for being a CFP is higher and so taking the short term pay cut could pay off in the long term, but it would probably take over 10 years to reach a salary that would overtake what I would be making if I just stay with GSA. 

  
For additional life context, I am engaged and going to be married in May 2025. I will have a 13 year old step daughter as well and my fiancé and I want to have babies right away. We live in a big city and want to buy a house in the suburbs when our babies are school age (the step daughter is going to a solid charter school so her education is okay, but we don't want to raise any more kids in the city's schooling system).



I am wondering if I should just suck it up regarding the boredom and hope Elon doesn't fire me, or if I should accept a drastic salary reduction that will take a significant amount of time to catch up to my current salary but I will be working on something I am passionate about. It just all feels risky and I am stressed out. Please provide your opinions. 



TLDR: I work for the government and am considering taking a 40% paycut to move to the financial industry with the long term goal of becoming a CFP.

1ir26fq,Should I change my career in personal training?,"Hey everyone,

I've been working as a personal trainer at David Lloyd for a few months now. I really enjoy the environment, the members and staff are great. But I find the sales aspect challenging to implement, even though I understand the theory behind it. There’s also quite a bit of unpaid work and admin, which makes me wonder if the long-term payoff is worth it.

I’ve worked at gyms before and did some personal training in the past, but I’ve also been learning about online fitness coaching and consulting for the last 3–4 years. I follow several online coaches and dietitians who do one-on-one consultations, and I'm considering whether that’s a better path for me. Especially since nutrition is my main area of interest. I'm even thinking about pursuing a master’s in dietetics.

Personal training at David Lloyd, they take half of the cut which is understandable. But as a self-employed coach or consultant I would be keeping all of my earnings.  


At the same time, I see a lot of online business/fitness coaches saying you can go straight into online coaching and make good money relatively quickly. 

Personally as a long term goal, I’d love to consult on nutrition and fitness and run an affordable online membership group. 

I’m at a crossroad, should I push through with personal training, refine my sales skills, and build a strong foundation first? Or would it be better to transition to online coaching now and focus on that? 

I've thought about leaving there and securing a very local job to support me? Which would allow me to have more time working on my online business. Would this be a good idea?


I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience in personal training, online coaching, or even the dietetics field. Any insights would be really appreciated!

Thanks!

1ir24yi,Got A Bad Review Because My Managers Have Unrealistic Expectations,"I recently got my annual performance review and it didn't go well. My managers cited my inability to meet ECDs as the reason reason for my poor review. I plan on writing up a response to the review citing the following points:

1. I am currently doing the job of 2-3 people. This is shown by the budget allocated to the project. For whatever reason, my managers have refused to acknowledge that the project is budgeted for more people and will not provide those resources. As the lead of the project, all of the tasks fall to me by default. So, I feel like I am essentially getting blamed for the manager's not staffing the project adequately. I luckily have a presentation saved from about a year and a half ago where myself and the finance person presented to my manager that we were not spending the budget allocated to the project and as a result several tasks were already falling behind. 

  
2. My job involves working multiple things at the same time. I have been with the company for over 15 years and the entire time I've worked here, it was understood that we handle the highest priority items and some of the other tasks would fall behind and we would try to catch up later. Often times, ECD's are due on the same day (end of the week), so the ECDs conflict with each other and we often have to pick and choose which ones can slip. This is the first time I've ever been told I was expected to hold all of my ECD's no matter what. And honestly, the first time it was made clear to me it would affect my review was at my review. I feel like there was a lack of clear expectation. 

  
3. My mangers have never sat me down to work with me on this concern. They have also never sat me down to figure out what I am working on to assess if my workload was resonable or if I was working the right priorities. Because of this, I kind of just assumed what I was doing was ok and they understood what was going on. So, similar to the above, I was not aware that there was anything to correct or work towards. It also seems like none of my other colleagues on the project are held to the same standard. Several people miss their ECDs and don't seem to be held accountable at all. 

  
4. I have a more technical role in the project. Although we are supposed to help maintain the schedule, we are told that it is not our top priority. We are to ensure that the products we are putting out are technically sufficient. We have separate project managers that are supposed to answer to the schedule. The project manager barely talks to me about issues or concerns, so it seems to me that they just threw me under the bus to my management saying I was not meeting dates in the schedule. 

Essentially, my main case is that I performed as well as a single person could be expected in the situation I was in. I have talked to several colleagues that work on the project with me and they say they agree with my interpretation of the situation. My managers have no experience in managing a long term project, so I think there is just ignorance on their part on how to do so. My managers have even tried to tell me that citing bandwidth and other priorities are not reasonable to state as to why an ECD is missed. I'm not really sure what this means or why it is not reasonable. 

  
My current plan is to challenge the rating just in case they try to use it to fire me or lay me off later, but I will be working on applying for other roles in the mean time. Any other advice on what to do in this situation? It would also be helpful to hear if I am out of line. Thanks all in advance.

1ir1dkm,Job offer process question.,"I had an initial phone interview followed by two in-person interviews.

Since I've been at my current job for many years, I'm rusty regarding the process.

Which comes first... agreeing to the money? Or background and urine coming back good?

Also, on my initial phone interview, I was asked about how much money I'm looking for. I gave them a price that I would have no problem uprooting myself from my current job. However, in-between interviews, my current employer gave me a nice merit increase. So, I feel I'd like more than I initially quoted on the phone interview.

1iqzqks,Making a career out of interdisciplinary humanities fields - Any Hisory BAs out here faced with too many options but also not enough?,"Hey hey! I've practically graduated with my History BA from a Dutch university (international student but planning on staying) and am kinda faced with way too many options, but none that feel right and are a realistic next step for me.

For context, I specialized in Cultural History and minored in Visual and Sensual Cultures (a blend of art, art history and media studies) which I thoroughly enjoyed because of its interdisciplinarity. I loved researching my thesis on historical narratives around gender and sexual subversion amongst 17th-century French nobility, but now that I’m looking at next steps, I feel stuck.

There are a lot of people who transition to law, journalism, international relations and other such paths after majoring in History but none have been my intention from the beginning and they aren't looking enticing now, either. Teaching is something that I'm definitely open to, but I don't see it being my ultimate career path as I've always wanted to focus on public history and more ""industry"" related jobs even though research has realistically been the best part of my degree to me. An issue I've had to consider is that most of the available positions in the Netherlands are highly concentrated on contemporary war history which doesn't really fit my background and there is definitely a language barrier from a lot of research-focused positions. So you see, I am torn.

During my BA, I went through some rough patches mentally, so while I finished (only half a year late because of a class), I wasn’t able to do much outside of coursework like internships, learning experiences, or any events that would help me get closer to learning about the options of what I can do and what I want to do. Now, I’m looking at master’s programs, but I’m unsure if I even am ready to face another 1-2 years of studying after having been in the education system for the past 15 years straight. Ideally, I would be ready to take on an entry-level job vaguely related to my field but counts as experience in certain skills while I complete a part-time master's. However, that feels like throwing myself back into a pit that I would need to fully commit to if I want to make it out and not burn myself out again. At the same time, if I manage to find a degree that ""sparks joy"" if you will (joy, in my head, considers the logistics and viability as well lol) I do see myself committing, even if I take it slow with finding a side job in the industry. Though, whether I want it or not, if I want to stay in the Netherlands need to either start a degree or get a full-time job in my field which would rule out a MA in the near future and doesn't feel like a realistic option with just a History BA. There's also the option of an orientation year during which I could look for part-time work and ideally do all the events, networking and ""finding yourself"" parts that I couldn't do during my BA.

Since a lot of my difficulties during my BA kinda left my sense of identity, wants and motivations a bit fractured, I've been trying to tap back into those wants, passions and reasons why I'm doing this at all, even if they're idealistic. That being said, I'd love something that offers some flexibility in responsibilities and that involved some level of interdisciplinarity; history, art, media, cultural heritage, digital public history, publishing, even anthropology and social studies. I love research, curation, and making history accessible through digital history, but I don’t know what that realistically translates to career-wise without needing to dive into a fully new field that would require a pre-masters.

# I've been considering:

* Cultural history and heritage degree (safe, but will I be back in the same spot?)
* Museum studies (interesting, but competitive and depending on the degree, might need a pre-masters)
* Publishing/media (I enjoy writing, but is it viable? It would need to be a subsection that requires history credentials which I'd be very open to but niche to find a job in)
* Art History (why fight it? I've been dipping into it so much my whole life and I do have a strong background in it but that would be quite a diversion)
* Library studies? (I took a coding class for humanities that presented many options that could end up being lucrative to explore and if I'm able to get credentials in digital and data-intensive humanities, I see some possibilities there?)

My main question is if there's anything I’m overlooking in all this and what steps you recommend for getting a better picture of what I'm working with. If you’ve been in a similar situation, what worked for you? Would love to hear any insights you might have and let me know if there's any clarifications or questions.

The only two things i can say i like in terms of a potential career are computers or something creative. But i cant draw, dont have musical skille despite playing for a few years, and dont have a camera for photography, which i really wanna dive into. That leaves computers right? But heres the thing: i am horrible at math. I know not all jobs involving computers use high level math, but i struggle in college algebra. 

I also cant wrap my head around coding, i always forget something or its riddled with typos. I like the idea  of physically working with computers, stuff like maybe repairs or even software stuff like maintaining a local network, organizing data or items. Ive got no idea what degree could lead me to a job that isnt intense with math, doesnt rely heavily on coding, but is still in the computer realm of jobs.

1iqyong,Stay and Save or Make the Move,"Hello everyone,

I’m graduating from nursing school this May and I’m at a crossroads with my career choices. I was waitlisted for a position I really wanted in Greensboro, where I currently live. Staying here would allow me to live with my parents and save money, but I don’t have an official offer yet.

On the other hand, I have received a job offer in Chapel Hill. This would give me the opportunity to move out and gain some independence, which is something I’m also considering.

There’s also a third option: accepting a job as a nurse at the nursing home where I currently work. The pros are the pay is really good, I’m familiar with the unit and the people, and the workload is manageable. However, the downside is that I won’t be learning much beyond basic medication administration, and I really want to build my clinical skills since I plan to work in a hospital setting for most of my career.

What should I do?",sonnnzzz,1,1.0,0,1739730169,2025-02-16 18:22:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqyong/stay_and_save_or_make_the_move/,2,2025
1iqykru,Should I apply for this job?,"I currently work at a resort as a purchasing specialist. I make $20.80 an hour and am expecting a decent raise in a couple of months. At least 10% from what my boss has told me. My boss loves me and I'm always eager to take on more work and learn from him. I've become the go-to purchasing specialist at the resort for pretty much everything except for alcohol related things (I don't have the accounts to order booze)

An AR Accounting position has opened up in my office and I am really confident that I would get the job based on my education and my experience. The pay is $25 an hour, so a pretty good raise from what I have now. 

It seems like an easy move, however I am currently getting a bachelor's degree in Operations Management, as my goal is to eventually work as a purchasing manager or something else operations/logistics related. I'm getting this degree slowly, taking only one class each term as it's really all I have time for. 

Another factor is I plan on moving to a new state for a sort of ""life restart"" in about 12-18 months. I've just had a lot happen to me in this area and I feel like I need to get out, at least for a while. And when looking for jobs in the area I want to move to, there are WAY more accounting jobs than there are operations related jobs, so getting some accounting experience on the resume seems like a smart idea.

I've been an F# Software Engineer(SWE) for 3 years. I'm in the UK and C#/.NET is the dominant language/tech in the SWE industry here. Coming out of uni with 0 experience, I took this job where they offered to train me up since F# is so niche, hence they didn't expect me to be ""good"" straight away. They essentially took a big chance on me and from their pov, it has paid off massively as I've been a great hire, team(6 devs total including me) is happy with me and team lead has told me so constantly. Been told im essentially the 3rd most valuable team member, even though I have the 2nd least experience(2 above are team lead and the senior engineer, the others are mid-level and 1 junior), so me leaving would have some impact on the team. The team/job has been amazing and I cant help but feel like I'm indebted to my team(not the company, just the team, as they spent a lot of time essentially taking me from a useless dev to a genuinely competent one). However, I'm now leaving, after 3 years, because of family pressuring me to earn more(currently on 34k, new role is 45k). It's essentially been a 2k raise a year but I decided to negotiate a couple times to get some extra bumps. So now I'm leaving as 2k a year won't cut it.

Im just wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation where everything is perfect except the salary, and you aren't just a junior that they wouldn't feel any impact at all from losing, and you get on with the entire team, and then had to have the awkward conversation that you are quitting.

1iqxx0v,Looking for advice to pursue Aesthetic Medicine to work in Dubai,"I’m 24F living in UK and currently work in Fashion but looking to change careers to follow my passion in Aesthetic medicine. 

The difficulty is that I am aiming to move to Dubai in the future (ideally as soon as possible) but would like to create a solid foundation for my career so that I can progress when I am living there. The regulations for Aesthetic Medicine in Dubai are a lot stricter than in the UK currently and as far as I am aware, the only way I would be able to earn a good salary there and have opportunities for progression is by pursuing a MBChB or MBBS in Medicine with a foundation year (this would be a 6 year course as i have no medical background or relevant prior education) and then go on to study dermatology afterwards which can take up to 4 additional years. 

I just need some advice as I’m struggling to believe there is no other route I could take when my only real medical interest is in aesthetics and dermatology. I feel I may struggle to complete such a lengthy degree in medicine when I only plan on going down this specific pathway. I also currently work full time and am saving as much as I can to move to Dubai. While i live at home with parents, I have no idea how i would be able to afford to study full time for up to 10 years for the rest of my 20s. I would obviously work part time but I worry about being in my early 30s and not having any more savings.

My ideal scenario would be to study in Dubai as I already have a student 10 year Visa and have family living there, however University fees are a lot more expensive there from what I have looked at and they also don’t have government student financial aid like the UK, so I don’t know if this would be a realistic possibility.

Please help as I really do not want to give up on my dream but it seems so out of reach based on research I’ve done. I am aware I am in the very early stages of any career in this industry and that it will be hard work but I don’t know what other career I could see myself doing and feel my heart is set on it. I just don’t know if it is realistically achievable.

1iqxt2v,Two offers - help?,"
Hey, I think i need the help of reddit 

Current: I have been with this company for 3,5 years, started at £30k, currently in £40k chilled job, it’s very comfortable , we all get along there is some flexibility in terms of hours , no flexibility on WFH. 10 min drive. 
Reason to move: feel stagant, I’ve learned what i needed. No overtime work available since 2023. Amazing people, fun. 


First Offer: 10k more , same role initially but with the expansion that i’m looking for.
Older, more serious team. 70 years in business, so very established. 
Big projects that would make me learn so much. Office is 15 min drive
 Aren’t as technological proficient, so I would have to lead on that area. 
People seemed nice enough. 
Offered me two weeks WFH pa. 

Second offer: 
Only 4 years old company 
1 year in probation period with one week notice. Which is not ideal as I’m here on a visa and need a job. 
Super flexible , make your hours as you prefer sort of thing. I could go to my country for a few weeks and work from there and eventually work full time when i decide from there. 
Expanding, new office next year etc. 
£5k more but with a different title with a lot more responsibility. - project architect which I will have to get trained on. - which is already more than he wanted to pay.
5 min walk
Open to make changes and adapt with my suggestions technologic wise
Have the most interesting project, but smaller than the first offer.  
Looks like super welcoming people and are younger. 


I would think that my current one would try to match so that would be on the run if they would
Surpass offers, but this wouldn’t solve my issue  of the need to grow professionally.


I have been debating, for me is clear that first one has more advantages. Better pay, bigger projects, more exposure to things I haven’t done. Afraid of being a place that would resist change in technology ( they seemed open). 
But the flexibility that I love from my current job will disappear ( hours wise) and it cant match the second offer.. 
the second offer gives me anxiety to think about if something goes wrong. He seemed super and chilled , and I think culturally this would be the best fit for me.. 

An outsider could give me their opinion please?",Aluminer,1,1.0,0,1739728015,2025-02-16 17:46:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqxt2v/two_offers_help/,2,2025

Hi all,

I'm wondering can anyone relate. I'm in my mid 30's and still struggling what my next career move is. I know what I enjoy but can't relate it to a job. 

Background is I have held numerous positions in retail up to store manager level, with many stretch roles given to me, HR cover, extra department to manage which I did successfully. My focus here was business improvements, managing change, managing budgets. 

Transitioned to the pharma industry, starting at entry level to gain experience. The positions I held gave me exposure to many areas of the business.I got promoted to a management position as a result of my natural leadership abilities, which at the time Ii didn't realise how impactful my contribution to the team was. My new role was leading a team of 40 people.

Since then there have been numerous people changes across the business. 

I have a supportive new manager for the last year,  and my most recent conversation has been about my next move. I have upskilled and completed some courses recently.

They have said that I am better than what I'm doing, and what is my next move..I said I Don't know. They asked about the HR route to which I said I'd consider. They also mentioned a more business technical role, and mentioned an temporary opportunity coming up in another area of the business. 

I am committed to the future of the business but where do I go for clarity on my next role, I know it's my responsibility to sort this. I know I have a broad range of skills, but my struggle is defining a career.",finding_vonniev,1,1.0,0,1739725752,2025-02-16 17:09:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqwwiu/any_advice_on_finding_career_clarity/,2,2025

1️⃣ **Analyst role at a reputable commercial real estate firm** – More aligned with my interest in commercial real estate, offers solid experience, and could lead to strong earning potential down the line. That said, the long-term trajectory often leads to a 100% commission structure, which is a bit intimidating.

I could apply these skills to different industries down the road, including ones I’d be more interested in, like tech sales.

My ultimate goal is to maximize my income. I don’t necessarily see myself staying in sales forever, but I know it’s one of the fastest ways to make money early on. On the flip side, I’ve always been intrigued by the earning potential of CRE, but the commission-based nature of it makes me hesitant.

1iqt7f1,"From Top Performer to Manager: How Do I Break the ""Experience Barrier""?","Hi everyone,  
Throwaway account because you never know.  
Conciseness isn’t my strength, so sorry for the wall of text.

Male, 30 years old, about 4.5 years of work experience.  
**Employers so far:** Multinational pharmaceutical companies.  
**Degree:** Master’s in Chemistry.  
**Additional Education:**

* Master's in Quality Management Systems (very low level).
* Master's in Data Science from a mid-level Business School (1 year, with a capstone project that was a flagship Data Science project for the company).

# Timeline:

**Site with about 600-700 employees in Italy.**

* **1 year 5 months:** Shift work in production. Quality Assurance. Due to the team structure, I eventually ended up (unofficially) managing the team (4 people) because it was convenient for the senior. I created a bot using RPA software that saved a huge amount of annual hours (I don’t remember the exact number, but the headcount impact was 1-2 FTEs). → My boss realized I had an edge and suggested I move to the office to focus mainly on department projects.
* **9 months:** Became my boss’s second-in-command. The projects progressed excellently, and I was recognized as a **top player**. My position level and salary increased faster than anyone else in the company’s history with my years of experience. My boss tried to keep me in the department, knowing I never liked it.
* **2 years:** Applied for and got a position in a more **scientific** department. Optimization, analysis, process troubleshooting, and KPI tracking. Focus on yield and efficiency improvements. **Stress levels skyrocketed, but I became project coordinator/manager for several key projects.** I proved to be a top player again (this time to the whole company) when I was assigned one of the site's strategic projects, which I successfully delivered.Meanwhile, I earned my **Master’s in Data Science**, worked with data scientists on various projects (including multivariate analysis, which was my master’s capstone project). During this time, I also took on informal leadership, organizing colleagues' work, prioritizing tasks, identifying risks, etc., as I became the senior person after almost everyone left (high turnover due to stress and mismanagement).
* **Realization:** I had reached the **maximum possible growth in this company**, both in terms of skills and career. The organizational structure didn't allow for further advancement, and the projects weren’t evolving in complexity or requiring new skills. Additionally, there was a total lack of **talent identification & retention strategy** or development initiatives.

# Current situation:

Moved to another **European country** to enter the **Data** world more specifically. Now working at a **non-production ""global"" multicultural site** in a European capital (where they bring in specialized talent at lower costs and ditch consultants. Gotta love vertical integration!).

I’m a **pioneer** in a department built from scratch, which will grow to 200 people, within a site aiming for a total of 2,000 employees. I'm “chained” to the company for at least a year due to my **relocation bonus clause** (if I leave earlier, I have to pay it back).

Work situation is **great**: global projects, **recognition from multiple global top managers within just 2-3 months.** Right now, I’m at the center of almost all the most important projects.

My **""real"" manager** is in another European country. My **""official"" manager** is in the country where I live, but he's just a figurehead. We have a few meetings, but he never assigns me tasks, nor does he really know what I do or how I do it.

# The Core Issue:

I want to **escape basic slavery and enter managerial slavery.**

**Goal:** Get into a **reporting role ASAP,** do a top-tier **MBA**, and climb to **higher-status positions.**

At my current company, this goal is **written in black and white on my profile**. I've told my figurehead boss and, even more importantly, my real boss in the other country. I **don’t think** the head of the whole department knows, though.

Yesterday, I saw they opened a position **identical** to that of my figurehead boss. I knew this would happen.

**Context:**

* The figurehead boss **doesn’t have skills in what I do** or what my colleagues do under him. He also **doesn’t have strong managerial skills**, but he has **many years of experience**.
* All the managers below the department head are of the same **local nationality** and have at least **10-15 years of experience**.
* The job posting **requires 10 years of experience.**

Right now, I **basically already manage** a direct report. I organize his work, delegate tasks, and trained him from scratch. Our sub-team is small and will **not exceed 20-25 people.**

# The Plan:

I **want to apply** and tell the **big boss** directly.

# How would you sell yourself best?

* What do you think of my current situation?
* Any advice?

I **already know I won’t get the role**—despite the fact that (and I say this knowing I’ll get flamed with “get off your high horse”) I **know I’m the perfect fit for it.**

Why?

* I **know the systems.**
* I **know the projects.**
* I **know and am well-liked by my colleagues.**
* I have the **right hard & soft skills**—but **not** the **official** years of managerial experience.

(My managerial experience is **unofficial**—leading a QA team, managing people in multiple areas—but if I had **official** experience, I wouldn’t be here writing this novel, I’d already be a manager.)

# My Strategy to Convince Them:

* **""I am the right person at the right time.""** Explain hard & soft skills.
* **Leverage relationship with the department head:** We joined at the same time, she appreciates me, and we talk often—but I suspect that alone won’t overcome the **""you're not local & don’t have 10+ years of experience""** issue.
* **Propose a clause to ""chain"" me to the company** for another year or two.
* **Suggest a trial period.** If I don’t perform well, they can demote me back. If I do, we continue.
* **Make it clear this is my goal.** It has been stated **multiple times** (though the department head probably doesn’t know).
* **Highlight the risk of me leaving.** If I can’t **grow vertically,** I’ll **grow horizontally**—which means they lose me to another department.

Thanks to anyone who replies!

I also welcome **general career advice** on my long-term goal.",Flat_Community8386,0,0.33000001311302185,3,1739715725,2025-02-16 14:22:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqt7f1/from_top_performer_to_manager_how_do_i_break_the/,2,2025

1iqrjxq,Career advice needed,"Hello all,

I need some advice for my next career move.

Here is a little bit background on me. Married with 3 kids, 37 years old. Located in a developing country. Electrical engineer with substantial experience in semiconductors.

I have worked as engineer, team leader and engineering manager for well known semicon companies in the Netherlands including one good startup experience.
Recently we moved back to our home country where i joined a big company with a managerial open position waiting for me. But, long story short, after i joined due to political reasons i was pushed away from the managerial role and working as a senior engineer. It is a well paid, secure, life time job but as i said i had that pushed back unfairly. I know that it is unfair because it is being told in the corridors of the company.

That was a big blow for me to accept especially when you know the decision is not related to experience and skillset.

But i need to move on, i need to decide to stay/accept or change.

There is a startup company which is 7 years old by now, having customers, making sales, making profits. They are at the stage to scale up. They are also oj semicon. 

They want me to join them as as leading person to scale up the company. Compansation is good/higher than what i get now, there is a possibility that a customer will come due to me joining them and if that happens i will get % from that revenue.

On top of this, environment is good, flexible, remote work during vacation times possible. People are also good.

My worry is after 5-10 years if the startup fails, when i am around 45-50 range, i would be unemployeable due to my age. Worst case, catastrophic scenario is not able to find any job forever.

A little bit supporting details, we dont pay rent/mortgage, having modest life. Also we would have some rental income that is good enough to have a basic life. In worst case/catastrophic scenario, basic life would be a step back from our current standards.

As a side note, i am a respected engineer in my domain, with a fair amount of international network.

What would be your suggestion to me considering all info? Stay and accept or move to startup? Do you rhink my worries are real or am i too much catastrophizing? 

Any advice welcome..",Meetmemontauk,1,1.0,3,1739710271,2025-02-16 12:51:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqrjxq/career_advice_needed/,2,2025
1iqr3h3,Relocation after Job loss - take the leap or wait it out?,"Hello everyone. I’m looking for some advice or input while I ponder this opportunity. 

I recently lost my job and have an offer for a new one. This has never happened to me before so I’m struggling with this decision. 

The new job would not be JUST a job, but an opportunity to work for a manager that I have previously worked for, allowing me some much needed job security. It is a role that I can easily perform as it is very similar to my previous role, and It offers a significant increase in salary. 

Details:

I have a wife and high school aged daughter. 

The wife is not excited to move but will - she WFH and would keep her job. 

My daughter does not want to move until she completes HS (she starts in the fall). 

The plan, if I accept, is to relocate on my own first and lease an apartment. My wife and daughter would remain in our home while I get established. The new role takes me 4.5 hours away so I’d commute home every other week or so. We live in Central VA and the new role is in SC. 

My wife and I have been married over 20 years and we could potentially be apart for 4 years unless something changes. 


The new job offers:
> 30% pay increase
> Relocation allowance (not the norm, but they really want me to come work there!)
> Decent benefits (slightly better than my previous employer 
> 11 paid holidays
> 3 weeks vacation 

Not knowing how quickly I can find work locally that pays enough - BEFORE it starts to affect us - is a huge concern as my old job was not local either - it was a WFH role that pays more than the average salary where I live. 

Am I nuts? 
Do I take the leap and hope my daughter changes her mind and moves sooner? 
Do I pass up the offer and take my chances?
Should my daughter have that much weight in the decision?

All input is welcome. Thanks!

1iqqbju,"Feeling Stuck: Internship Ending Soon, No Job Offer Yet—What Should I Do?","Hey everyone,

I’m a final-year university student, and I’ve been working as a developer intern for the past two years—first at a US-based startup and now at an Indian startup. My current internship (8 hours/day) ends next month, but my company hasn’t told me if they’ll offer me a full-time role.

# My Experience & Tech Stack:

* **Previous Internship (US Startup):** Next.js, React.js, Node.js, Express.js
* **Current Internship (Indian Startup):** Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, Express.js, React Native
* **Additional Skills:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Docker

I feel like I’m performing well—not just as an intern but at the level of a full-time developer. They trust me with critical tasks, and I’ve been delivering.

# The Problem:

* No clarity on whether my current company will convert me to full-time.
* No other job offers or interviews lined up.
* I’m passionate about blockchain, Solidity, and smart contracts, so I spend my free time learning and contributing to Web3 projects instead of grinding Leetcode.
* I barely have time for Leetcode/interview prep due to my full-time internship and blockchain learning.

If they don’t convert me, I’ll be left with no job next month.

# What should I do?

1. **Prioritize Leetcode and start applying ASAP?**
2. **Double down on blockchain and Web3 job hunting?**
3. **Try to balance both (if yes, how)?**

Would love to hear advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation!

This is going to be my first ever job but I'm not officially hired yet and I'm still training at this agency without pay. So, my future employer asked me if I can make a video for something. They did mention that they were gonna pay me if I do it. I did make a video once in college but it wasn't good. It was bad, in fact so I was very hesitant to say yes. The job position that I applied is not related to making videos tho but should I still say yes? I asked from someone I know and they think that my future employer probably didn't like that I was hesitant and kept giving reasons that I'm not familiar with making videos and all that. I do admit that I could've expressed it better but I get nervous easily so I ended up saying the wrong thing.

What's your opinion on this? As a future employee of that agency, should I say yes to doing something that I' not confident in doing? Or is it ok for me to say no if I'm not good at what they're making me do?

1iqp7ei,Should I keep the job I have or try to find a better job that has a better work environment?,"I work at a restaurant but it's a small restaurant, we get more online order than in person but that's beside the point. My manager is entrepreneur, she's owns and runs one big fancy restaurant and this small fast casual restaurant but she seriously has temperamental issues. The job is good but I feel like I was lied to, she said it was 15 dollars an hour plus tips, but when I see my information from my paychecks there's no reduction for tips,  and I've done the math and it doesn't make sense. I wanna bring that up and other issues but I'm afraid because she's a very aggressive person. As a person she's lovely, but as a manager she's a nightmare. She has yelled at my co worker until she cried and changed her availability, yelled at my other co worker so bad she dragged him outside near the dumpster to yell at him even more, and has yelled at me to the point I started crying and started dissociating and she got even more angry at me even though she was like yelling at me so much. And at her other restaurant it's the same thing, many employees complain saying how she's scary, aggressive, and just straight up brutal towards you. And supposedly she's like 10x worst at the other fancy restaurant because everyone is like ""she's worst here you wouldn't last a day"". One of the employees over at the fancy restaurant said she took fried and had a mental breakdown because she was so mean to her. And the crazy part is it's like normal to her??? Like it's okay to yell and scream at ppl until the point it's literally harassment??? Her husband works at the restaurant sometimes to help here and there (both restaurants) and he's very well aware of her atrocious personality to point he tells people ""just toughen, your an adult, you're being too sensitive"" to the ppl who have tried to say something abiut her shitty personality. It honestly just feels like abusive relationship, remember when I said as a person she's really good? The reason is because she will buy you snacks or coffee and stuff for you but next fucking minute she's yelling at you and treating you like you're the dumbest person ever. I'm always walking on egg shells when around her, like every time she's in my presence I tense up, and I've think she noticed because last month she asked me if I liked her and I was like ""hahaha yeah, you're really cool"". Like seriously I was saying that cuz I felt so pressured lol. Anyways I just wanted to vent and ask y'all for advice and all. And with the tip thing I want to bring that up also plus her shitty personality but I'm afraid I'm going to get yelled at and it won't even be worth it. Other employees have stated she's always been like (she has owned and runs the fancy one for the past 8 years and has always been a shitty manager lol). During the interview she said I would get paid 15 dollars an hour plus twist but my information for when I get my checks done show where the tips are and the tax reduction, pretty sure she just lied, and I even showed my parents just to get more information and they were also like ""that's really suspicious you need to bring that up asap"". Overall she's just a rude, demeaning, aggressive, psycho lol.  Should I bring this up and try to talk about this with her and say I don't appreciate her attitude plus the whole thing about the tips thing??  And there's no like HR department either because it's not a big corporation or anything, it's not like I can't file a complaint against her lmaooo. It has been affecting my personal life also because Everytime I think about work I get so stressed because of how toxic the environment is. You get yelled at, you co workers get yelled at, they start crying, and boom everyone is depressed and wanna go home, it just ain't fun.

1iqp157,Offered surprise promotion I don’t feel I can accept,"Last Friday, I (27 f) was offered a promotion during my performance review with my boss and I feel like I should not accept it. It would be for a brand new position as a lead that my department has not had before that they are currently creating a job description for. I have been with this company nearly three years at my current role and have been involved in a plethora of different projects and have collaborated with almost every department at the company in some capacity. I do know my work speaks for itself. My boss let me know that if I do not accept the role it will become an open position for anyone to apply to, so I need to let them know if I want in before it goes public. 

One of the problems I am facing is that in the same week I was offered this, we had a massive layoff where I lost two direct team members and tensions with the remaining members of my team have been high. Besides myself, I have two more senior ladies-fake names Pat (40 f) Gina (36 f)-and on my team and one man-fake name Sal (28 m)-who joined around the same time as me but started in a different area before he transferred to ours after around a year with the company. The ladies have been VERY vocal they believe it should have been Sal terminated and I know he feels this from them. Because of the heated tensions and the feelings of unfairness that are already present with the team and along with me being a) the youngest member of the team, b) the second to least senior on the team, and c) the only non POC on the team, I feel like I should not accept the position at this time. Pat has already had personal issues with me and has expressed to others before that she feels that I have tried to steal the spotlight or take her work from her when I am asked to step in and help her on occasion. I know that with her being the oldest and most senior with the company, she personally would have issues with me being chosen as lead and could possibly even try to sabotage or take things out on me depending on how strongly she feels (she has already threatened to get me fired before behind my back). 

However, apparently word is already being spread that I AM already taking the position. Not even 30 minutes after my performance review, a leader from another department whispered to me in passing “congratulations” which shocked me. I then found out that the organizational charts for the company had already been updated to reflect the new title before I have even accepted it which really caused me to panic because I still have not officially accepted it. My boss said I can think it over during the weekend and get back with them, but I really can’t see any but three options for this:

1. Accept the role and face the possible rejection or retaliation from my team
2. Reject the role and stay at my current one for who knows how long 
3. Let the role go public and then apply and see if I could still get it

I have been wrestling with this since I left my performance review and I feel like I can’t think straight anymore.. Any advice or guidance would help.

1iqocw3,Should I wait to tell work I want to move?,"So I moved to Australia from the UK about 6 months ago to be with my wife. I got a great job but it's a long way from where my wife lives/studies (2-3 hour flight). I've been doing the job for 5 and a half months, I really like the job, the team and everything but I'm basically stil doing long distance with my wife. The whole point of me moving here was so we weren't apart so much. I've recently decided I can't keep living away from my wife so much, life is too short and I miss her. I want to request to work more remotely, like a few full weeks with my wife then flying to the office and spending a full week or something there.

I'm an engineer with over a decade of experience (the most experienced member of the team, excluding my manager) and currently work hybrid pretty much alternating between the office and my apartment each day. I've got my probation meeting coming up in a couple weeks and I already know they want to keep me on. I'm trying to decide if I try to talk to my manager now about wanting to change my working situation or just wait for the probation meeting. Given I've already decided I want to have the conversation at least, I'm wondering if it's better just to talk to them now, instead of waiting.

1iqnnhr,How do I handle a manager encroaching into my space?,"Recently, the office went through a round of reassigning desks. While I was one of the fortunate one to stay in original my desk, the empty desk to my right is now occupied by the manager of an adjacent team.

He has a habit of leaving his coffee cup on my desk while I'm not there. I dont care when I'm not there. But when im there, I do care. At first it was a minor annoyance. He would move it and apologize when I'd arrive, but now it's almost a permanent fixture on my desk. We'd go through the same motions. Hed grab it swiftly as I sit down, and apologize.

He also recently started sprawling out tote bags. I don't know why he has so many tote bags. They're the ones you put groceries in. He'd just have them open, on the ground, between us. I don't know if it's like a way of creating a fence to divide space? I'm beginning to feel like I'm being invaded. LOL.

When I accidently buno into one of the bags, again, hed apologize. Hell quickly collapse them, or move them away. But, I don't know, after the first few times—you'd think they'd just not do it? I don't want to be confrontational, but, it's getting annoying.

I'm about to start University, and I'm really interested in both philosophy and computer science. My uni doesn't let me double major in both directly. Instead, the closest I can get to studying both is doing a Bachelor of Arts (majoring/minoring in Philosophy) with a Concurrent Diploma in Computing. I know it's more practical to major in Computing within a Bachelor of Science, but I would love to study philosophy (I also don't want to be rejected from pursuing computer science in my career though, and am concerned that a diploma will be viewed as insufficient education by prospective employers).

I have been getting a second degree in Social Science with a minor in Business Administration for the past two years.

1iqk68g,I am almost 20 years old with no declared college major. I do work. What career paths should I be looking into?,"
I’m currently on a babysitting gig, and loving it. Took the 5 year old I’ve been babysitting occasionally over the past few months to the park - they made a new friend. Helped them learn their sight words by having them practice making the letters with sticks and writing them in the wood chips. I do enjoy babysitting her, this morning I was at my behavior tech job (started working full time, officially this week as a behavior technician. I babysit on the side and take college courses as well.) I admit that what I have begun to realize about myself after working with 2-7 year olds is that I really prefer the 5-7 year olds. I loved playing a game of tag with the 5 year old today. I did pass my behavior tech exam (through my company it was the BCAT, content is similar to RBT exam just requires you to know more about autism.) I was a teaching assistant for a little over a year and I also have to say that I’m finding now that I really prefer working with an older age group (5-7) in comparison to 2-3. I like having the opportunity to teach kids more about the alphabet, spelling and just build off of what they may already know. I realized tonight that I want to make learning exciting. I love being a behavior tech as well, most of the time (there are challenging days. I am considering becoming a BCBA, but have only had the job since October and really feel as though I need some more time to get used to it.)

1iqjkzl,Should I cut my 4 hour commute down at the expense of moving from my life I’ve built?,"I have just started a new job in the city which is 3 days a week in the office and 2 WFH.

The commute is 2 hours door to door each way by public transport. 

I love the job (Sales) and sometimes have to work some extra hours to hit my quota. 

I am wondering if it is worth uprooting my wife and I's life to cut the commute down to 20mins door to door by getting and apartment in the city. 

For context, cost of living will be about the same if we moved. All my family and her family lives in our current town plus out friend group which we see once or twice a week.

There are no jobs similar to my current job in my country down as no big businesses run from here.

My current town is a country town and I want to long term not be in a city. But I thought for the sake of building up my career before having kids, it might be worth living closer to work?

Thoughts?

1iqj8p5,I’ve been a little too relaxed as a manager and realized I’ve been getting taken advantage of. Any tips to make it clear this won’t fly anymore without turning into a jerk?,"I work in a white collar office of about 50 people. I got promoted to a manager a few months ago, over some colleagues that many people felt were more qualified. I’m also about 5-10 years younger than the other managers, and younger than many of the people I’m managing. I currently have a team of 8 under me, and another team of 5 who have a dotted line to me.

The whole time I worked there, I tried to be a fun, relaxed guy. The office is filled with people who like to make fun of each other, and I took it in stride. And now that I’m a manager, there’s some actual animosity towards me.

This is all at the levels at or below me. I was promoted over others because the entire C-Suite genuinely likes me and my work product the best, and I report directly to them.

People don’t feel I deserved my promotion, some feel like they got passed up, and feel I’m too young to know what I’m doing. In several cases, they just straight up ignored me or laughed at me when I tried to ask them to do something. 

Honestly, I kind of feel like Kevin Spacey in Glengarry Glenn Ross. 

It reached a boiling point yesterday. I asked one of those guys with a dotted line to do something that the C-Suite has been asking for. He responded with “I’m busy. I’ll get to it next week.” I told him they asked for it today and he looked at me and laughed and said “well then you do it. Mr. Manager.” At the moment I was just focused on getting it done, so I went off and did it. 

But afterwards, I was pissed. I realized I let him walk over me, and they’ve all been doing it. I came back over to him and he had the same shit eating grin on his face, “oh, the manager is back.” I leaned over his desk and said, as calmly but firmly as I could, “that’s not happening again.” He tried to play it off, “you okay man?” And I said “No. That’s not happening again. You, me, and (his direct manager) are sitting down on Tuesday about this.” He said “okay” kind of sheepishly and went back to his computer.

*Tl:dr to this point: everyone has been walking over me, it hit a breaking point, and now I need to actually bring the hammer down.*

So, my question now is what do I do on Tuesday, and going forward?

I’m done playing along with the jokes. Everyone likes to rib each other but they’re going to far.

But I’m walking into an office on Tuesday of a team of 13 people who don’t respect me. 5 of them report to another manager that they do respect, and I want to bring him in. I was worried I’d seem like a tattle tale, but then I remembered A. This isn’t Middle School and B. I’m not their peer anymore, and I need to put a stop to this. 

Do I need to try to go out of my way to assert myself going forward? Do I need to be more aggressive, or just firmer? Every single manager in the office who is respected is actually fairly aggressive. 

Also: there’s another team member who I’m letting go for performance reasons (legitimately, his work product is bad and we as a group agreed to let him go this week), but he’s also one of the worst offenders of not taking me seriously. I was planning on just bringing him into HR’s office and then telling everyone he’s off the team. But, I’ve noticed other managers instead have brought their people into a conference room where everyone can see them getting fired, and having them do basically a perp walk. I never liked it, but those managers all never get screwed with.

*Tl;dr on the whole thing*: I have no respect or legitimacy as a manager. How do I fix this? ",milkmandead81,14,0.7200000286102295,65,1739676736,2025-02-16 03:32:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqj8p5/ive_been_a_little_too_relaxed_as_a_manager_and/,2,2025
1iqj813,"30 years old without a degree, but desperately wanting more","This post could get really long but I'll try to keep it concise.

I presently work for a hospital doing insurance authorizations and referral processing, working from home. I make $24 an hour. I would say the biggest benefit of my job is that the culture is super lenient and understanding towards work life balance and having a family. Most of the people in my office are mothers and almost all have families. I have a 7 and 5 year old so this is really critical for me.

However, and it is a huge however, my job is almost meaningless, I am very replaceable and I get no feeling of purpose or accomplishment out of it. I got into health care because I really do care about helping people and I love working from home. But I 1.) Don't have any way of moving up in the company which means I 2.) Have no way of making more money and 3.) Want to feel more purpose in my career. My promotions would be maybe $.50 raises a year. 

The context of the situation is that in my teens and twenties I suffered many traumas and mental illness affected my stability and finances. I really messed up my college transcripts at a couple different schools by not dropping classes when I should have. 

I am now very stable, emotionally, financially and otherwise. My fiance and I want more children but I think we need a larger home and income. Most of all, I want more from my career. I think I would love to get into health related tech. I like working independently but am a good communicator especially on subjects I care about. I am very detail oriented, organized and good at solving puzzles. I have looked into data analytics or health informatics bachelor's degrees but I fear my gpa is far to low to get into any schools. Specifically Capella and WGU. I have heard that data analytics and coding are saturated fields but, I find it really interesting.... 

What I am looking for is advice in how to advance my career/move up/or transition completely. Is college an option? How do I improve my GPA?  Is it worth it? Or are there other paths to gaining the skills I need? Certifications? 
I really appreciate any feedback.",pkeshabram,8,0.9100000262260437,3,1739676673,2025-02-16 03:31:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqj813/30_years_old_without_a_degree_but_desperately/,2,2025
1iqj77j,Anxiety about changing jobs…knock some sense into me.,"Well, it finally happened. I have been working for a franchise of a popular fast food chain for 9 years. I got promoted to assistant general manager, I bought a condo. I don’t speak to my family so I have basically no safety net. It’s been fairly stable, although I’ve been transferred a few times but agreed to stay for the stability and to work with my boss. Until last year when something snapped, she was one of the best bosses I ever had. She finally got frustrated and walked out two weeks ago. 

Things went to hell in a hand basket. The new general manager (who despite seniority has learned next to nothing) is bouncing around happily bragging about how peaceful it is (it isn’t, she just doesn’t have anyone telling her what to do anymore). 

By some freak miracle I landed a job at a more upscale restaurant. It’s $22 hourly instead of $47k annually (slight pay cut by my calculations) and I’m down to 40 hours a week. I’m not 100% sure I’ll even have any better work/life balance (executive chef ensured me that he tries to make things fair, and I can handle the closing time with the shorter distance, but I might not get the right nights off I really want for quality of life). 

So I’m torn. New boss spent all day today reminding me why I need to leave. But I have a mortgage. I have a third of that amount in savings. The cost of living is already enough. And I’ll have more free time, in which my favorite things to do all involve spending money.

1iqit6b,Class of 2026 college student considering starting another Bachelors to be able to recruit for Class of 2028 high finance jobs?,"Tried to post in r/FinancialCareers but don’t have enough karma for that yet, so any upvote helps.

I’m currently a 3rd-year Economics student at a T30 overall US college, it’s a state school that doesn’t seem to be all that respected outside of the South. My main issue is that I’ve always been curious about many different career paths, namely between Finance, Tech, and Law. Tech jobs aren’t interested in me due to a lack of a technical degree, even though I’m interested in product management and I see business people from low ranked schools get into PM internships with no difficulty because they have connections. Due to my varied interests, my extracurriculars for finance are ok, but not entirely strong for high finance investment banking without connections. 

The bottom line is, I need connections, and at this point in time, I have none. I don’t know what to do. The hard thing is that at my school, alums in high finance only seem to come from 1 of 2 extremely selective student investment clubs, and won’t speak to any other current students who aren’t in those. I was not selected for either of the clubs because I didn’t know my path in high school so didn’t have years of knowledge necessary to get into them as a freshman. 

I’m 99% considering starting a combined masters degree in Information Systems, but that only buys me one more year so Class of 27 grad, and I’ve seen hundreds of IB acceptances already so I’m already too late for this ongoing recruiting year for Class of 27. I would have to either extend my Masters graduation or start another Bachelors (at least 1.5 years later than my original Bachelors grad date) to have any chance of breaking in. 

Would employers accept this? Has this even been done before? I don’t know what to do. You may say that the summer 2026 internship recruiting season isn’t over yet, or it just started, but I’ve been trying since last year, and I don’t even have an internship for this Summer 2025, which would have been my junior summer. (I have a business management return offer from last summer but it’s not finance) and now I know that it’s all about connections and I have none, and those will take me a year to cultivate. Idk if waiting another year is worth it. Though if I start the masters, I may only have to wait one semester. But many of the applications also say the student must be pursuing an undergraduate degree, idk if already having one is an issue. I recently found out about this extremely niche program for women that alumni of my school run that help with IB placements, but it starts the summer before recruitment season so I can’t ask for help now for Summer 2026 internships. 

I’d appreciate anyone’s 2c, I know this is a crazy idea but after trying the law path out and working with law professors, I’ve realized I have a more quantitative knack and I find acquisitions/fundraising very fascinating, and from what I know, 99% of full-time offers come from a summer internship.",Scared_Ad5021,1,1.0,0,1739675262,2025-02-16 03:07:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqit6b/class_of_2026_college_student_considering/,2,2025
1iqip5i,Purse MSW or Law Enforcement?,"I am looking for guidance, advice, and personal experiences that can offer some perspective outside of my own. 

I currently work for a county-based CPS agency as an Assessment/Investigations Caseworker in Appalachia. I’ve been there since the fall of 2023. I graduated with my BA in Sociology-Criminology in May of 2023.

I love the agency I work for and I believe our practices, values, and team are unlike many other agencies. I’ve had a positive experience with supervisors, coworkers, detectives, and court personnel. It would be difficult for me to work at a different CPS agency.

I am leaving in June of this year due to my partner and I purchasing a home 2 hours away near a big city. He is a veteran and federal employee, making a good living. So I decided to move where he is so he can continue his professional career and I can find mine. There are more opportunities where he is. He is 6 years my elder. 

I’ve been handed multiple tragic cases that most CPS caseworkers have not experienced in their careers. My work through these have led to a promotion as a Team Lead. I’ve received awards and praise for my work. As a people pleaser and someone who puts my worth in my work ethic, sometimes I feel like this is what I am meant to do, to help and support people. Whether it’s social work in CPS, substance use, hospitals, schools, etc. But sometimes this fogs me from seeing what I truly want to do- outside of what others make me think I am meant to do.

But the trauma, stress, pay, and our current political environment gives me doubts. I worry about a growing and promising career. I also feel I do my best work and get most satisfaction in the investigations part of my job. The difficult, challenging cases are what keeps me motivated. I put my 110% in them. My favorite part is collaborating with our detectives on criminal child abuse cases. I’ve been referred to as a “super sleuth” by leadership. Sometimes, I feel like what I’m meant to do, is to help people maybe not in a clinical or service setting, but maybe through pursuing justice.

I’m torn with what my next steps are. I struggle with mental illness and have always had difficulty knowing what I want and truly understanding my desires. I don’t know if pursuing my MSW is worth investing into, considering how unsure I am with what I “want” to do. On the other hand, I need a major pay increase in order to live comfortably in this next chapter of our lives. 

I’ve enjoyed reminiscing on working as a family counselor, in schools, or hospitals. I also can see myself working in human trafficking, missing persons, or child abuse and exploitation investigations. I know both have pros and cons. The major one for me being that I will always feel like I’m not doing enough. That I am helping people, but will feel it is not making systemic change or providing significant enough relief to people.

If I join the academy, I may not need to go into further debt to get an MSW, and the salary expectations are similar. Coincidently, our house is being built down the road from our state’s Peace Officer Training Academy and BCI.

FYI, my entire childhood I envisioned working in the movie industry as an editor or special effects makeup artist. That all changed freshmen year of college when I became passionate about various disparities facing individuals and communities. Social, political, cultural, and economic issues. Applying for my position with CPS was suggested by my therapist as a starting point. I’ve never really been set on a particular direction with my career. 

I would love to hear any and all thoughts- especially if you have experience with both social work and law enforcement. Should I go into micro or macro work? What kind of jobs are a mix of both social work and investigations? What steps did you take to discover which area of social work/populations you enjoy working in the most? How did you decide on your career? How did you manage pursuing your MSW while maintaining a full time job? What type of work did you do to support yourself financially while pursuing your MSW and fieldwork hours?

I’m a 23(f) recent college graduate with a BA in Political Science and a minor in Criminal Justice. Recently, I’ve realized my career interests have shifted. While I initially planned to pursue a career in politics, I’m now more drawn to the criminal justice field.

I'm struggling with picking something to pursue because I tend to overthink things and, well, I don't want to have any regrets later on or waste time. So far I've only been a content writer, writing blogs, articles, and so on for several clients on Upwork/Workana, and also landed a job as a Marketing Specialist on these platforms. I have SEO knowledge, I've worked with script writing for YouTube content, can do basic video editing and animations, and I also do translations (Spanish/English).

I don't think my skills are advanced or valuable enough to pursue them full-time (e.g. full-time video editor, full-time script writer, or developer) and I'm also not particularly interested in any of them. That's also why I'm not afraid of starting from scratch.

So, I have questions for people who switched careers.

* How did you do it?
* What career did you switch to?
* Was it easy? Did you have to upskill/learn a new skill entirely? \*Considering you come from being a writer.
* What other requirements did you need to meet to switch?
* Do you have any advice that could help me?

It is a nice job, very flexible, but not sure how long it’ll be around. That being said, I am trying to be proactive in case that job is no more. I have about a general associates degree (science related) amount of classes done and have a 4.0 (intro to chem, BIO 1 & 2, A&P 1&2, Calc 1&2, Stats, intro to Psych, intro to soc, etc), but not sure how to apply those classes. My goal was to do nursing but now thinking about the time spent doing clinicals etc is it worth? Not sure if I should fully send nursing school and just get my kiddo into daycare. Another option I was thinking was accounting or business administration. Not sure how far I need to go to get a job in accounting (do not have any classes really in that area), but I could do that schooling online (wouldn’t need to worry about childcare). 

My fiancé has a year left in his engineering degree, so trying to figure out what I should do for my school/career. 

Concerns, I know there is a high demand for nursing, but from my understanding not as family friendly and can be a toll on body compared to other careers. I have been a CNA for a couple years and have seen how short staffing plays in nursing homes and the fun of being mandated to do another shift after finishing one. I do know there are many options with a nursing degree though. 

I do not know much about accounting and business administration. I am thinking business administration would be much harder to find a job. Would I need to get a bachelors in accounting to really start making a livable income? 

My biggest concerns go: livable income, good work life balance (consistent hours, no mandatory stays), job doesn’t get kicked as technology progresses. Is there any other degrees or careers worth pursuing that may better fit my needs?

Any input would be amazing.

1iqh2zx,Changing jobs,"I’ve been working at Company A for the past four years, designing and developing implants for a medical device company. I started as a CAD tech and worked my way up to engineering manager. As an introvert, managing a team has been challenging, and I only took the role for the higher pay. Between that and not getting along with the CEO (too much to type), I’m considering a job change.

The owner and COO of another company (Company B) have approached me about joining their team. It’s in the sheet metal industry, where most of my experience lies. I’ve had two interviews, and they really like me. They mentioned they’ve never paid anyone as much as I’m asking but are willing to match my current base salary, offer a $10K–$15K bonus, and provide a gas card.

One big draw is that I immediately felt comfortable with the team at Company B, unlike with my current CEO, which is important as an introvert. However, I’m concerned about being their highest-paid employee and the fact that they don’t have a 401(k) yet (though they plan to in 1–2 years). I just don’t want to be stuck at my current salary just because it might make them uneasy.",Character-Twist-5797,3,1.0,1,1739669649,2025-02-16 01:34:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqh2zx/changing_jobs/,2,2025
1iqgyv7,"lost in my career, what do I do?","Hi everybody, 
I currently have a masters of business with a concentration in healthcare administration. I got it back in august of 2024 and picked up a job with a big insurance company. It took me 4 months and hundreds of applications to find this job. Some jobs even told me I  was over qualified… I love the company i’m with because there is room for growth eventually but do I love the field i’m in? not so much. The pay is also pretty low for someone with a masters degree but im trusting the process and hoping I can move up.

However, once I finished school I fully regretted not doing something with direct patient care. While in my masters program I started a semester of an sonography program but the school had limited modalities and only trained you in cardiovascular.. they were also really unprofessional & unorganized so I left the program. 

My boyfriend is a nurse.. future NP & his entire family is in the medical field. Being surrounded by them made me realize the love you can grow for the medical field. For the past year.. i’ve been trying to figure out if I should go back to school OR I was trying to find ways to get into the medical field by doing a quick online program (there’s not many unless I go for MA or phlebotomist and that’s definitely a demotion because they don’t get paid much). 

My boyfriends dad is a doctor and owns his own cosmetic business, my bf will eventually take over the business when his dad retires. I’ve tried to find a way to get myself involved but without going back to school.. I cannot do anything. 

I’m just completely lost. I work remotely & of course it’s a blessing but the monday-friday 9-5 really isn’t for me. I dislike staring at a computer screen all day and I like to be up on my feet. I’m really lost & don’t know what to do. I don’t wanna leave my current company because I just started generating an income & if I go back to school im going to have to go part time or leave. 

I just truly need some advice or suggestions on what I can or should do. ",No-Butterfly-9836,3,1.0,2,1739669274,2025-02-16 01:27:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqgyv7/lost_in_my_career_what_do_i_do/,2,2025
1iqgn37,How to justify a dismissal in a job interview?,"Good evening, at the beginning of December I was hired at a preschool as a maternity substitute, for at least the entire school year.
The day before the holidays they told me that they would interrupt my trial period (which actually ended in January) because, and this is the reason I was given, I was too shy with the parents.
Let me start by saying that I have social anxiety, which has never caused me any problems when I work with children, but with adults it leads me to be very introverted and take longer to build a relationship. So I am aware that this penalizes me, however I only got to see the parents for a few seconds in the morning, and I did not have the time to build a relationship with them, a relationship that I know I would have been able to create if only I had had more time, time which, in my opinion, was not given to me.
I soon have an interview for another school, and my fear is that they will ask me why I no longer work for that other one. What would be best?

1iqg9kr,Should I join the Navy/Airforce to fly. Or just go to civilian flight school instead?,"Howdy y’all, I’ve wanted to fly for a long time. My end goal is to end up flying the airlines. 

But I’ve been split recently if I want to take out loans and do civilian flight school, or go into the Navy or Airforce to fly. 

I’ve spoken to officer recruiters from both branches. I got a 9 9 8 on the ATSB, I have a degree, and I’d be a competitive candidate for OTS/OCS. For a long time I wanted to fly in the military, specifically the Marines, but I want fixed wing, and my chances at fixed wing in the Marines are piss poor as there are few slots. So I decided it’d be between the Navy/Airforce. 

Flying fixed wing in any branch would be kick ass, especially if I end up in jets. My biggest issue is, it’s an 8-10 year minimum commitment after wings. That typically totals to around 12 years in service. Not only that, but the pay isn’t the best, and such a long service time, just to start at the bottom of the totem pole at an airline. 

Is it worth it to go the military route to fly? To the airlines even care if you have military flight experience? Or should I bite the bullet and go the civilian route? Cause life been told seniority is king in the airlines, unless it’s cargo. Thanks y’all!

Our whole team joined very early in the company \~3 years ago, - one of us joined in April, one in June, and I joined in December of that year. The first to join was made team lead. We all joined fresh out of our PhDs. 

When I disagree with TL, we discuss like adults and come to a conclusion. If we can't come to a conclusion, I do what he says - end of story. I understand that that's what it means to be an adult with a job. For most of my time at this company, I didn't mind much - just sucked it up and moved on.

But the more time progresses, the more I am frustrated by this as I now have experience that he doesn't have - I work heavily with other teams and on projects he isn't involved in, and also have grabbed a master's degree in engineering management while working here. The fact that he has veto power over projects he isn't involved in is starting to get on my nerves. When a colleague or consultant disagrees with him and I side with them, he gets very frustrated and angry. 

I have no desire to leave the company or anything and would really prefer to address this head-on. I'm looking for any advice you fine folks might have for me. Thanks!

1iqe680,Feeling lost,"Hello all,

I’m 23 (F) and I’ve never really cared about college or careers. Now that I’m getting older however, I’m actually starting to think about it. I’m planning on enrolling in a community college in the summer for business management and social media marketing, which is something I AM passionate about. I just can’t help but feel lost because I have also been piquing a huge interest in graphic design(most interested in brand design/identity), and UI. Graphic design is something I’ve always been interested in and enjoyed doing. I’ve also been wanting to start my own cosmetics business selling products. So I guess what I need advice on is; Is this a good path to achieve all that I want to do? 

My goal is to finish school, but while going to school, I want to build up a graphic design portfolio by volunteering my services for local businesses and doing a few passion projects. Once I finish school, I’m hoping that I can get into an internship and earn some sort of resume cred this way. Once these 2 seem to be working together for me, I’d like to be a freelancer in both graphic design and social media marketing. I’d still like to sell products at some point down the line, but that would be more like a hobby. 

Is there any designers and social media marketers that may be able to lend me some advice on how to sort of “co-manage” these careers. Advice from anyone, however, is greatly appreciated.

1iqdw1e,I am so lost,"Im broke with 0 social security. 

really want a full time job that is related to my skill set. I studied UX/UI but didn’t prepare for after grad. I’m now 26 and aside from having a masters, I feel no closer to having a solid career. 

I lost interest in UX partly because of the fact that no one is getting jobs. I can’t name a single person who I graduated with who has even landed a paid internship. 

On the other hand I’m more passionate about art and I make a few hundred a month from commissions. (I’ll link my art station at the bottom) 

people insist that with my skills I could land a job in a games company but I have quite bad imposter syndrome. I convince myself it’ll never happen because it’s so competitive so I don’t even try. Further, I don’t want to get to 35 having failed getting a career in games only to have no money and be in the same position. 

I also think I could expand my income from illustration just doing freelance work. But I really want a secure income. I also struggle a lot to manage my own time. 

I’m willing to do any ‘proper job’ I’m so tired of retail and bartending. I cannot stand it anymore. I’m genuinely very willing to work hard, but I can’t seem to form a clear goal. 

I need some solid suggestions / advice

1iqbbnd,Requesting accommodation for disability - does it have to be formal and through HR?,"(I live in Texas)

I am diagnosed neurodivergent as an adult, had trouble my entire life with holding down jobs, and few years ago in mid/late 30s I really learned why that is. Given me an opportunity to work on things and hopefully stay proactive if I'm having issues. I've talked to a therapist in the past and am reaching out to her again to revisit preparing to request accommodation, or at least have documentation ready. 

I know I have different ways of processing information and communicating, and I'm at the point I'm concerned about how things have gone recently that I feel I need to do something.

Do I have to formally make the request through HR? Or can working with my boss in a way that goes over some of the challenges and needs, suffice too? But offering me the ‘legal protection’ same as a formal request would have? I swear I read about this before, that it doesn’t have to be a formal request, it can be simple plain language and be made without formal setting or meeting with HR/others. 

All I need is at times, maybe once a week, twice a month, maybe more or less, someone who is understanding if I need another 15-20 minute conversation so I can gather more information and in a way I need to process it. I’m not asking for my boss to end up with 5 more hours of work a week, catering to me.  I typically do better with written communication, am a visual learner who needs to often draw things out to understand big picture and processes. May need more time to process things so to be understanding if I need to revisit a topic or can have some more details upfront to prepare before meeting. I’m not incompetent or incapable, and it’s too easy for people to write me off as that. 

I work in a highly technical, specialized field, have a BS and MS in science, loads of industry certifcations, been doing this for 15 years and highly recognized for good, quality work, solid work ethic, etc. I've been with company for a year and half, have had tons of amazing feedback, great review end of last year with pretty decent raise. I have made significant impacts on several projects that have been highly visible and praised at higher levels. It’s clear I know what I’m doing and probably one of top we have in my field inside the company (out of about 20 across the country). 

I’ve talked with my boss little over a year ago about ‘here’s how I am’, in some plain language without going into neurodivergence, touching on some of what I’ve mentioned. I feel like I’m at the point where I need to do something, but if it’s possible for me to still approach him and reiterate these needs, especially as I do have some stuff I need to go over with him and would be perfect way to illustrate what I’m talking about. But I’d like to have ‘protection’ and help avoid the ‘she’s just annoying to work with’ and end up pushed out of another job.",pugsdrugshugs,1,1.0,0,1739653373,2025-02-15 21:02:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iqbbnd/requesting_accommodation_for_disability_does_it/,2,2025

(Backstory info) I work a pretty late shift, till 10pm to be exact. Work is 35-40 mins from home so a decent drive. Morning shifts start at 7am. This apprenticeship requires me to work a pm shift, and then to come in the next morning at 7am as they said that was the only way I could train due to the schedule. (Mind you everyone gets what they want hour wise) Now I know it’s legal bc it’s over 8 hours in between but it’s just not enough time for me to rest and come in. after doing this for a couple weeks I have started to make more mistakes at work, including coming in late 2 times now with over an hour lateness due to oversleeping. I feel completely burnt out yet I feel this is what I need to do to learn how to train dogs. I just feel like it shouldn’t be normalized for me to get >5 hours of sleep and be ready to start my work day. Today  I was late for a 3rd time. This time I was sent home as a punishment, and I told them I felt like this wasn’t working for either of us.

I hate my major and I hate my classes, the only class I do enjoy is my ceramics class. Ceramics is honestly my passion and I’ve never enjoyed anything they way I love working and creating with clay, but I know I can’t major in that because I won’t be able to make a substantial living from that. I truly love art and I wish I could do something in the future that incorporates that, but I can’t think of anything that will make me a living. I’ve been thinking about possibly doing psychology or nutrition because I am fascinated by how the body works, but I’m not sure if that would truly make me happy in the future or if it would even allow me to make enough money to sustain myself.

I’d really love your help with choosing which skill to go into. 

I work as a freelance translator and copywriter and i’m an English major. Lately, clients are getting fewer and fewer and I was thinking of learning a valuable skill.

I have a friend who switched to QA where she does software testing. She recommended I learn this skill and get certified and apply to similar jobs.

I like computers, tech and gaming so I thought why not. However, I feel cyber security is more in demand and it would provide more long term benefits and I’m intrigued by this field.

Any IT people here who can give me some advice in which field to go into? I’m willing to do the work, learn, apply and get certified.

1iq9lpj,My old boss is coming back as a VP,"
Hi All 
Looking for some advice. Using a throwaway. 

I’ve been with my current employer for 9 years. In 2021 my then boss (who was a Director level reporting to CEO) quit to pursue another opportunity. The CEO offered me a promotion to the Director role instead of hiring externally and I have been in the Director level reporting direct to CEO. Everything has been fine since that occurred in 2021. 

For the last 8-9 months our company has been working on opening a new division which would require a number of net-new staff. My old boss has also been asking my CEO for a job since about last August 2024. Myself and my CEO verbally agreed that my old boss could come back to his previous Director role (My current role today) and I would be “promoted” to be the Director in the brand new division. This would occur sometime in 2025, maybe Q2. This works for me. 

Yesterday I get a call from CEO to tell me that things are progressing quickly and my old boss is coming on board in the next two weeks and will be hired on as a VP. I remain in the Director position, unchanged. (Same division) 
So to me, this means he is again my boss, essentially a demotion to me because I will no longer report to the CEO but again to my previous boss. 

Am I wrong to be pushing for myself to be promoted to VP, and my old boss can have his old job as Director back? (The VP position by the way that has never existed until this hiring because the Director level reported to CEO, there are no VP’s in the company) ",Creative_Silver_1688,10,0.6800000071525574,39,1739648915,2025-02-15 19:48:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iq9lpj/my_old_boss_is_coming_back_as_a_vp/,2,2025

If I had a question, they really had no answer since they were very dependent on the person on sick leave. I usually only recieved answers like ""X knew"".

On top of that, I usually have to take work at home because my work load is a LOT. Like 2 people would be necessary to get everything done without always rushing around.

Unfortunately, I don’t see any career improvement or future in procurement, since I covered the whole concept of the business during my internship. What I’m currently doing is the same thing however in different way.

1iq7ry2,HR had a chat with me about my demeanor one week into my job. Where to go from here?,"
I joined a job about 7 days ago. Today, HR reached out to me to tell me that two of her fellow colleagues (two HR ladies) who I met earlier this week had told her that I seem uninterested and seem to have an attitude. 

I’m shocked. I’m quite a shy person by nature and suffer from social anxiety, but I’m quite good at what I do and I love meeting people and making friends. I can be awkward, but really my interaction with these two ladies was perfectly sweet. We were even joking around. I thought they were very sweet. One of them walked me through the HR systems. I’d already been through them, so I didn’t have any questions, but I did make sure to show my interest by nodding along and laughing at her jokes. We had coffee together. I really liked her. This meeting was one day into my new job. The other lady I only met in person once, but she’d set all my onboarding meetings, so I knew her by only her name.  I went up to her and introduced myself and apologized for constantly asking her to reschedule the onboarding meetings she’s set for me (I always make sure to be very thankful). 

The day before yesterday, I saw the First Lady and said hi to her, and she said hi back and then looked away. I got weird vibes because I was going to ask her how she’s doing and continue the conversation, but it seemed like she doesn’t want to talk to me. But I ignored it because I thought maybe it’s just me overthinking social settings again. 

Today, my HR recruiter came to me and told me she got this feedback from those two ladies and she was surprised to hear this, so she wanted to check if someone is bothering me. 

I’m very shocked and hurt. I thought the interactions were perfectly lovely, and it’s deeply hurt my feelings to know they were talking about me like this on my very first week (I’m on probation). Am I wrong to think it’s too soon for them to be making judgments and gossiping about it? At the very least, they should’ve tried to talk to me about it. It’s been 7 days. I’m still getting used to the job. I’m overwhelmed and stressed. Is it wrong to expect empathy? I’m also very hurt because I always overthink social interactions, and it takes a lot for me to put myself out there. It hurts to know that this is the outcome when I do. With my other team members, things have been going great, but now I’m overthinking every interaction. I’m deeply hurt. Is this not unprofessional of them? Sorry to repeat this but I’m extremely extremely hurt and almost feel unmotivated.

1iq7epx,How to avoid co-worker pulling me down?,"I have worked for a small/medium construction subcontractor (about 15 office staff) for the past 6 months or so. For the 10 years prior to this I worked as a tradesman. 

Another guy started on the same day as me, in the same trainee role, but has no prior experience, let's call him Tim.

Here is my problem, everyone in our office has a company car except for myself and Tim. They are coming up for renewal in a couple of months. A colleague told me that we probably won't be getting them purely because the boss doesn't want Tim to have one, and thinks it's unfair to give me one and not him.

Although my current role is new to me, I had prior industry experience, and have been studying part time (in my own time and at my own cost) for the past three years towards this role. I have been performing well and get complimented on my work (I'm far from perfect but put a lot of effort into this job). Tim is constantly on his phone, and has been pulled up for lying about consequential errors, laziness, and lack of effort more than once.

Here's the kicker, there are two owners of this company. Tim is married to one of their daughters (although this owner doesn't work in our department). 

I took an almost 50% pay cut to transition into this career and so a company car would be helpful financially.
Co-workers have told me they think this is unfair and I should get one, but there's no guarantee the boss will listen to them. 

What can I do to distance myself from Tim? I'm new to the office environment so have no idea how to avoid his poor performance affecting me.

1iq6w60,Making a decision to move on from my current job/profession of 5 years: young professional seeking advice.,"I (29 f) have been working in an agriculture-related industry for almost 6 years. I’ve been at my current company for 5 years (I work in small consulting company). I earned my license in my occupation back in 2023, which   is difficult to obtain in my state; getting licensed in my profession is seen as a huge milestone and accomplishment. There was very minimal enthusiasm from my work when I got my license.  Since then,  have not been happy in my job due to lack of mentorship and professional development opportunities, especially as a newly licensed professional. 

For years, I would get treated differently from my male co-workers and am usually one of the last people recruited to help on projects (preference always goes to my male co-workers who has less experience than me).

I have expressed my concerns about lack of equal opportunity to my boss, and he has not done anything to address it. I also expressed how I do not feel like I am not getting the consistent opportunities to practice certain skills.  My boss and another senior professional in our office have talked about the need for me to “build my confidence” as a professional by getting me more opportunities to build my skills and get on-the-ground experience. Since that conversation six months ago, I have not noticed any significant changes in trying to meet that objective.

There are other issues around communication and project planning in our company, that have made me build resentment around my job and has started to take a toll on my mental health (anxiety and depression). I have been looking for another job in my area for over a year now and have not had much luck because jobs are limited in my area and I am not in a position to move.

This week I interviewed and applied for a job with a company that has a big work contract. The job itself is work that I am pretty familiar with as utilizes some of the skills from my experience. However, it is not a job that is aligned with my career trajectory and would not be my first choice of job if I had other options.  There are many benefits to the work including better pay, more structured work schedule, working with men and women and it is a union job. The drawbacks that I have seen is that they typically lay off workers in the winter and rehire them in the new year; this company also does not have the best reputation for their upper management and HR.

I am likely going to be offered a job from this company. I am just wondering if it is worth taking if it is not a job that is not aligned with my career and profession. If I accepted the job, I would probably still continue my job search for something in line with my career. I was also wondering if this would be a good opportunity to take a break from my career, just so I can work on my mental well being. Any advice would be appreciated.

Typically in those meetings happen, each department gives updates, it's run by the CEO. I have been going to that meeting for over a year and barely speak unless I'm called. I also never speak up in large meetings where other departments are there unless I am called or have a portion. All the other managers or heads freely can speak up.

1iq550f,Struggling to find remote work - should I stick to it or pursue my passion?,"For context, I have a degree in Interior Design and been in the industry for almost 8 years. When COVID hit, I had to shift to remote work, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise since I needed to be home due to family circumstances.

Last year, I resigned from a toxic remote job. By then, most interior design work had returned to onsite or hybrid setups, making it incredibly difficult to find another remote position. It’s been five months, and despite sending out countless applications, I can count the responses I’ve received on one hand. I’m losing hope, and on top of that, I’m drowning in debt—especially since my previous employer never gave me my last paycheck. I don’t want to fight for it anymore because it would only lead to more conflict.

Interior design is all I’ve ever done professionally, and I feel stuck. Should I keep pushing for another remote job, or should I pivot and pursue my passion?
 
Logically, I know it makes sense to find financial stability first—get an interior design job, pay off my debts, and then explore my passions once I have some savings.

That said, I’m deeply passionate about coffee, art, and pottery, but I don’t have the money to start a business in any of those areas. So, my question is: How can I pursue my passion without spending a dime?

1iq4j95,Stuck in a Never Ending Promotion Process – Need Advice!,"I’m dealing with a frustrating promotion process at work, and I could really use some advice. It feels like I’m stuck in limbo, and the whole thing is starting to impact my motivation and confidence.

Here’s how it all started: I was basically led to believe that a promotion was mine. It wasn’t official, but I was given every reason to expect it. Then, after a colleague showed interest in the role, everything changed. Now, we’re both being considered, and the whole process feels like a moving target.

The thing is, I have a higher title, more tenure, and more experience at the company across different roles over the years. I also review some of my colleague’s work. They’ve even mentioned that their performance evaluations with our manager haven’t been great and that they don’t want to manage people—ultimately, they’re interested in the promotion because it’s the only way to get a raise in our workplace.

Meanwhile, I’ve consistently gone above and beyond, showing initiative and actively working on my professional growth. I’ve taken on extra responsibilities, pursued training opportunities, and even sought out ways to build leadership skills. I’ve had good performance reviews and have made it very clear what my aspirations are in terms of growth for years now. Our team is small, so opportunities like this don’t come up often, which makes this situation even more frustrating.

I genuinely love the company and believe in its mission, but working on this team in this capacity is making me question whether I should stay. Having this assessment without a clear timeline is dragging out the process and making me doubt my abilities. I feel like everything I do will be micro-analyzed, and it’s exhausting.

I’m at a crossroads because I’ve put in the work and truly want to grow within the company, but the lack of clarity and moving targets are making me feel stuck. Part of me wonders if it’s time to start exploring other opportunities, even though leaving would be a tough choice.

I’m also baffled by the decision to have us knowingly compete against each other. It feels like this will inevitably create tension, and I’m confused about how leadership believes this is the best way to handle the situation, especially with no clear end in sight.

I understand the point of algorithms.. but I don't think testing a candidate based on these abstract concepts are an accurate way of judging whether they can do the job.",jdhindsa4478,1,1.0,1,1739635270,2025-02-15 16:01:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iq4g6m/doubting_my_skills/,2,2025
1iq4dl8,Was it right to quit my job in the second week?,"


There was no on boarding. I was swimming and didn’t know what to do. The manager said we will sit down next week to see how we’re going to do this, but also had no idea how we were going to make a plan because it was something new.

If there would have been a proper on boarding, I probably wouldn’t have left. It’s such a mindfuck. I also didn’t feel like they acknowledged my feelings. I didn’t feel like I knew what I needed to do. Very frustrating. And if other people also don’t know when you ask, you feel really lonely.

Still don’t know if I made the right decision and probably will never know. But I didn’t really feel respected as an employee. They didn’t even have  the right materials for me where I need to work with.

I don’t know if we could have solve this issue or that my panic take over and made me decide to quit the job. I didn’t had the feeling things would get better, because there was no on boarding at all. I was working with clients I didn’t had any experience with, so I was totally lost on my own.

But I also think on boarding is very important and respectful to the employee. The whole company was quite chaotic and there were a lot of people with a burn out. Colleagues where all complaining that it’s not normal how they were treating me as a new employee.

Did I make a right decision? I can’t stop thinking about it. ",Forward-Jicama-4421,0,0.25,51,1739635074,2025-02-15 15:57:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iq4dl8/was_it_right_to_quit_my_job_in_the_second_week/,2,2025
1iq4c4t,You can do it!,"\*\*Disclaimer\*\* I understand that this is not a one-size-fits-all method/advice post. 

I am very young in my career. I graduated from higher education in 2022 and have worked in IT Compliance for about three-ish years. Over three years, I have had three jobs (two lasting more than a year, the other a short tenure). Recruiters constantly approach me, and while most of these opportunities fizzle out, a few have materialized just in the last year. 

Fast forward to January of this year, I receive a call from someone working with a huge global company. This opportunity is for a senior role within the company, but I knew I did not have the complete work experience requirements that they want in a prospective employee. That did not stop me, them, or the recruiter. I met the direct hiring managers, received strong feedback, and then went through another three interviews (talking with multiple people at different company levels). I received the same input and eventually accepted an offer, which was the senior-level position. 

Long story short, here is what I did to always put my best foot forward:

1. Practice, Practice, Practice—I memorized the job description and aspects of the company, rehearsed my answers to interview questions (try not to sound like a robot in your rehearsals), and researched the interviewers. 

2. Be Flexible—This organization wanted to move fast, and so did I. Change things around and keep your schedule open. For global companies, you must be flexible if you are meeting with people from around the globe, or the process could be drawn out. 

3. Don't Lie, Be Yourself—If anyone asks you a question that you do not know, be honest but turn it into a positive. Say that you haven't done ""that"" specifically but would like to explore everything you can to expand your knowledge. Don't fluff your resume or make yourself seem better than you are; they will eventually figure out that you may be full of it. 

4. Be enthusiastic - Share your enthusiasm and excitement in every conversation with company stakeholders.

5. Ask questions - Everything may seem reasonable on paper, but bring questions about the work environment, workload, and how things operate. They will also be impressed by your interest. 

I understand that not everyone has a perfect job-hunting experience. Trust me, I know it can be hard out there. Don't be afraid to seek out recruiters; find what they are actively hiring for. This combats mindlessly applying to every job listing on Indeed/LinkedIn, where you run into ghost jobs, slow responses, and ATS. Try to get that personal touch, work to improve yourself, and you will find your opportunity. It won't be overnight, but companies appreciate someone proactive, and you can do it!",Ok_Association_1188,1,1.0,0,1739634962,2025-02-15 15:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iq4c4t/you_can_do_it/,2,2025
1iq49a6,Bait and switch but still better than my current job. What now?,"Have been at my job for 5 months and was approached by another company asking me to interview for a position. First 3 interviews went extremely well but after the 3rd i heard back from the hiring manager that there was a mix up with the salary and they can only offer 70k (was originally told by recruiter it was 75k) but that they’d give me a 5k signing bonus to accommodate. The hiring manager told me ‘full transparency’ they were hoping to hire someone at 65k but the caliber of candidates wasn’t there so they raised it to 70k a year instead. No idea why the recruiter told me 75k. 

I am currently a communications coordinator. I am underpaid (62k), the culture sucks, i’m on contract, and they have poor policies (ex: can’t just flex hours to go to an appointment must use vacation time, no visible tattoos, even if you are sick you must come in and just mask up etc). Commute is also far from my house.  Pros are a good pension plan (HOOPP).

for some context, i worked for a health care non profit for 3 years and loved it. Was happy with my pay (76k), had great work life balance, vacation, got to travel, etc. Was also on HOOPP which was nice. We lost federal funding last summer and I took this job because i thought i wanted to stay in health care and because with the job market i was afraid i’d be unemployed for a year or more. 

So what’s happening now feels like a bait and switch, but honestly the job itself is still better than my current one so i have no idea what to do. 

some more pros: it’s permanent (i’ve only ever had contract work so this is a plus for me), flexible (2 flex days/mo), would cut my commute time in half, travel opportunities, and the work itself just sounds way more fun and interesting to me. I have also been considering making the switch to the private sector for a while now. 

I told her i’d take the weekend to think about it but i don’t know what to do. I don’t want to sell myself short but it’s also a higher salary and title even though they can’t meet what i said. Lots of room for growth as well and every employee ive looked at on linkedin has been there 5+ years and moves into a higher role every 1.5-2 years. 

i know of the sunk cost fallacy but honestly if i wasn’t so unhappy at my current job i wouldn’t entertain this but the job market is bleak for early career professionals right now. 

I was thinking of countering their offer to meet in the middle (72k) and lowering the signing bonus, and seeing what happens. But honestly i hate my current job so much i kind of don’t want to risk losing the opportunity to leave.

Long story short, I work for an investment bank (think bulge bracket) as an associate in the EU (Central Europe). Salary is decent with savings topping up \~1.1k EUR / Month, but poor quality of life (grumpy people) and limited opportunities for MD promotions.

I was recently offered to either get promoted to VP, or relocate to London within the same bank.

I would love to hear some thoughts on what is the optimal thing to do here.  
Some additional information:  
\- I am 26, third country national, and interested in long term permanent residency and EU nationality  
\- In 10 months, I'll be elligible for Permanent Residency in the country I reside in  
\- VP salaries here are meeh compared to the UK/US, but greatly exceed the median salaries in the country  
\- Opportunities to network here are almost none, the closest thing to networking is having coffee chats with VPs/EDs  
\- My technical background is in Data Science and Engineering

1iq3b3g,Is this a red flag? or am I rejected?,"I had HR screening interview and financial modelling test at a company last tuesday, the HR informed me that she will inform me about the result/next step of the process by this week, but now, Saturday, she still has not replied to me? 

Is this a company red flag since this is not professional? or is this something common?   
For your information, it is a big consulting firm. 

I also think it is important for you to know about the process so far, and why this bothers me. 

I was initially approached by that company recruiter. We did around 30 minute zoom meeting where she explained to me about the job. She told me to apply through their portal and she would pass this to her manager. I did not immediately apply that day and as I wanted to take more time to know about the job by reading their web and put my thoughts on it. The next day, she contacted me again reminded me to apply, which I eventually did that night.

I was then emailed by her manager around 2 weeks after, we scheduled for an HR screening interview, in which she was slightly late, her first question was ""tell me about yourself"" after I answered, she asked me whether I like to proceed with the financial modelling test since I do not do it in my current job. She then gave me time to think about it, I can inform her if I wanted to proceed. 

At that stage, I felt like I was rejected softly. However, I still proceeded with the financial modelling test. 

We scheduled for one, I felt like I did pretty well, by the end of it, she said that she will inform me by this week, which she hasnt and hence the question above.

  
Or is it possible that I am rejected? She is just taking her time before rejecting me? ",AstronautClassic3551,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1739632092,2025-02-15 15:08:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iq3b3g/is_this_a_red_flag_or_am_i_rejected/,2,2025
1iq3182,"Struggling to Break into Quant, What Other Math + Coding Jobs Are Similar?","I’ve always wanted to break into quant finance—my ""dream"" role is quant researcher, but honestly, I’d be happy with any quant job (research, development, trading).

I’m 27, with a BS and MS in Applied Mathematics (focused mainly on CFD). However, I have no job experience or internships**.** I’ve attempted some online assessments for trading roles (mental math, IMC Neurolympics, etc.), but I don’t think I scored high enough, and most of the applications I sent got ghosted or rejected from my resume.

My biggest challenge is time constraints; I can solve most problems, but I take too long. After seeing a solution, I can apply its pattern to similar problems, but I struggle with creating solutions from scratch.

On the coding side, I wouldn’t call myself highly experienced. I can probably do LeetCode easy \~80% of the time and medium \~50%, but again, I struggle with coming up with novel solutions. I’m much better at taking an existing solution and adapting it to a new problem.

Right now, I don’t think I have what it takes to break into quant. Instead of continuing to hit a wall, I’m looking for similar roles (not in salary, but in workstyle: solving problems, facing challenges with math and coding).

My plan is to work in a related field (preferably finance I guess would be best) for 2-3 years, gain experience, and then try again for quant at 30.

What other careers would align with this plan? Any suggestions on how to improve my problem-solving speed and ability to create solutions from scratch?

I’m 27 years old, UK based in London. Have a bachelors degree in economics and a masters degree in mathematics.

Been in sales since graduating my MSc as it is the only offer I received and I needed to pay rent.
I’ve been desperate to get out of sales ever since getting in to be honest, i’ve applied to 100s of graduate roles related to my degrees but no luck on any of them so I’ve stayed in sales out of necessity which is making it more and more difficult to get out now as I lack any technical skills or experience in anything else which is the number 1 feedback i’ve been receiving from recruiters after rejections.

I worked 2 years at my first job where I got promoted from SDR to AE, then got PIP’d and let go along with most the team as the company performance started to tank. 1 year at my current job as an SDR but I see no real future here and I am getting sick of the cold calling grind.

Ideally I am looking for a role which plays to my strengths. I’m great with numbers, a quick learner, and I get along with people. I enjoyed presenting as an AE, hopping on zoom calls and being a subject matter expert so maybe some sort of trainee advisor or consultant role?

1iq1i7z,Should I stay in my current position or switch jobs?,"I'm (33M) currently working my dream job. I worked 4 years to get into the position I wanted to get in and just managed to start it 4 months ago. I work from home, can speak English (I'm a migrant and not fluent in the country's language), and have a semi comfortable set of tasks. I used to love our company culture because of how chill my colleagues were and what we sell is fun and creative. 

However, in these 4 years, the company culture has turned very toxic. Lay offs are imminent and financially the company isn't doing well, so morale is abysmal. Basically I know I'm on a sinking ship and may be laid off next at any time.

I love my tasks and my colleagues, but very much dislike my new bosses. Upper management tends to pile on lots of tasks outside of what would be my responsibility on paper on me and give irrealistic deadlines, while being badly organized and lacking empathy for first level employees. On top of this, the paycheck is below living wage. We're poor despite my working full time and working overtime often. This all has caused a lot of stress. I'm also so incredibly sick of being poor.

I was offered a job recently at a local company. My paycheck would almost double, but I'm looking at a demotion to a customer service position where I'll have a phone shift all day which I find difficult due to several mental issues I have. While getting into my current position I worked phone shifts too. This was difficult but I managed so I do believe I'll be able. There is no option to work myself back into my current position in that company as they lack this job position there.

The company is very traditionally corporate and white collar, suit and tie. I'm from a poor family and have very non finance or career focussed values, so don't really fit in. Every guy I've met there so far rubs me wrong. They seem sexist and egocentrical, like all they care about is money, and I'm really not about that life. 

I would thankfully be in a team of women who all seemed nice, but I'm a bit worried and disturbed about the average male employee and I super not vibing. Like what does that say about this company? How would the women feel having me in their team suddenly when their male colleagues are generally like this? I foresee a lot of solitary lunches in my future.

Additionally I would have to speak this country's language all day every day, which seems like good practice to me but I also fear might be a tad harder than expected.

Basically it's a demotion to a company I feel is an ill personal fit, but a massive payraise and job security vs leaving the job I wanted to have a career in from a sinking ship where I love my colleagues. 

Job opportunities are very few and far between for me and I have a family to take care of. So I'm looking for advice. What would you do and why?

I currently have a job as a .NET developer with two years of experience. I’ve worked on Android apps using .NET MAUI and have experience developing web applications. I also have some exposure to reverse engineering Android apps and website pentesting.

My interest in how code works behind the scenes led me to start exploring reverse engineering. I’ve used tools like Ghidra and Radare2, particularly with Android apps. I’ve also dabbled in web pentesting but haven’t had much success finding bugs so far.

I’ve even created an app that I’m thinking about releasing on the Play Store soon.

However, I don’t feel very confident in my reverse engineering skills yet, and I’m not sure if I should continue exploring this field or focus on web pentesting.

My question is: Should I focus on growing my .NET development skills and continue down that path? Or should I dive deeper into reverse engineering (learning more about tools like Radare2, Ghidra, assembly, etc.)? Or would it be better to keep practicing web pentesting?

1ipx4fy,"Architect by qualification, went too deep into finding my niche/passion and now I don’t know what to do","Hi guys! 26F here, based out of Dubai, UAE. South Asian by nationality. 

I studied architecture in university but was always interested in research, journalism, writing etc. Got through architecture school easily but the real world practice was daunting. 

Did my internships in sustainable practice firms / NGO’s that had little to do with design more with documentation, problem solving, material research etc. ( enjoyed every minute of it.) but after moving back to the UAE, my first internship here in a proper firm really changed the course of everything. It was too fast paced, made me realize I suck at softwares and computation etc ( which I’ve always found very intimidating ) And the work culture was terrible. 

Got my first job at a publication ( like a regional Arch Daily (A renowned architecture website)), but didn’t really help me grow much, but again I enjoyed it and so I stayed. Made some great connections.

Left that role for a curatorial & programming role at the regional Biennial ( I am deeply passionate about the arts and culture scene here and took the first opportunity I got to contribute to the same ). It was a project based role and all through it, I was doing freelance social media marketing and brand building etc. For small businesses. 

Last year, i was job hunting, none of the ‘Dream Jobs’ in the gov. Sector for arts and culture came through, and i needed a visa and have some financial liabilities (for family etc.) 
And I got a decent job as a marketing and social media coordinator and all the skills I learned over time came in handy, and I’m excelling in this job. 

However, I do not like it and do not see it as the way forward in my career. But I also do not know how to get my foot back in the door foor a role that is heavily related to architecture, public design, community building etc. But does not have to do with making drawings. 

I’m extremely mentally affected by this and looking for any advice from architects who’ve switched careers or found their niches and any way forward. 

Please excuse any mistakes. Just looking for advice.  ",priart19,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1739608313,2025-02-15 08:31:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ipx4fy/architect_by_qualification_went_too_deep_into/,2,2025

That was not sufficient according to her and said I have “elementary thinking” and kept belittling me about it for five minutes. I’m 22 weeks pregnant and my emotions are all of the place. I started crying on the phone and she said “I know you’re upset but this is not how I would react I would feel empowered” WHAT THE HELL she is mad because I’m crying..? The call ended with her letting me submit the report and that was it. I’m just so upset about this entire thing. She has done this to other people so it’s not new it just made me feel so dumb and for something that wasn’t a huge mistake.

1iptg5g,I’m tired of losing sleep,"In 2009, when I was 23 year old college student, I was working as a commissioned wireless sales rep at a well known national electronics store chain and was excelling. Another wireless agent (think franchisee) moved into town. This agent had 5 locations at the time and had a local owner. I was familiar with the sales volume of another one of their locations and also understood a branded standalone wireless retail location would be more prosperous than the chain store where I was working. 

I applied and was hired. I had the opportunity to move into store management within months of my initial hire in 2009 and I decided to leave my business degree college track to pursue this career opportunity after finishing the spring semester. Later in 2009 I had a chance to move up again into a Sales Manager ($36k total comp) role overseeing now 6 locations across 300 square miles. It required a relocation 200 miles away. The working hours were long with constant travel. The responsibilities were immense, for example I remember working 21 days straight once to help stores due to staffing.

The following year (2010) the General Manager of the company, who had hired me, had a falling out with the owner and was pushed out of the company. My title was changed to Operations Manager and my total comp was raised to $40k. Sales & Operations of our now 10 locations all rolled to me. We didn’t have a dedicated HR Manager until 2014 so I had to design and implement many procedures and initiatives across all channels of the business. In 2011 I was appointed to VP-Operations without a pay increase. 

This continued across two acquisitions and multiple new store openings without much support from the owner who wasn’t in the stores and only involved in the financial decisions of the business. It was left up to me to identify and implement a solution to any gaps in the front end operations of the business. Hiring & firing personnel, designing and proposing compensation structures, managing our relationships with the parent company, traveling to out of state work conferences multiple times a year, all were required of me. I grew the company from 6 locations to 26 without a dedicated HR manager and with sales and operations both rolling to me with a total compensation package under $50k the entire time.

Once in 2012 when the business hit a rough patch due to market factors my salary was lowered from $40k to $35k for 6 months per the owner. The business rebounded and we even completed an acquisition the following year. I was required to sign a non-compete clause around this time.

In 2013 I had a mental breakdown. I wasn’t sleeping and was having daily panic attacks from work/personal stress and lack of support from the owner and CFO. I was spread way too thin. The owner noticed and asked me to take a week off. I started talking therapy but couldn’t continue when I returned to work. I remember the owner of the company questioning time I took for a therapy appointment and asking “didn’t I just give you a week off?”. In reality I used a week of PTO. 

I felt like a Pariah from that era forward and in 2014 the owner brought over a senior manager from the parent company to oversee the business as COO. The following year the owner hired his brother-in-law and I was abruptly moved from VP-Operations to VP-Marketing with no employees reporting to me. 

It’s been 16 years now with this company and it has grown to 70 locations. I stuck around and still have a VP-Marketing title with at least Director responsibilities. My salary is now in the high 5 figures and my total compensation is $110k/yr. I don’t get regular raises, even cost of living. 

I now know I was acting as an Operating Partner during those years from 6 locations to 26 and was not compensated as such. That combined with the income trajectory I’ve been on I feel slighted. I now have a family and have settled down in a rural area without many comparable career options. 

I’ve hinted at raises and have received remarks like “no one makes that in this area” and where else are you going to go?”

I went back to college and finished an Associate Degree in Business Management without tuition assistance. 

What advice would you give and is there anything to reconcile with my current employer?

Thanks

1ipt0p0,"I got accepted to my dream Master's program, but I love my current job","I graduated from university with a Bachelor's in psychology, and my plan was to take a gap year and then apply to graduate school with the ultimate goal of pursuing my PhD in social psychology and becoming a professor. During this gap year I've learned that the job market... sucks. For the first few months I was working a terrible job and only stayed because the pay was too good to pass up. Recently I started a new job where I actually get to use my degree (rare af for psych majors) and so far I love it. I'm still very new and in training so there's a non-zero chance I'll end up hating it, but the pay is good, the benefits are great, I like my coworkers and the culture is great. My hours aren't awesome, but there's plenty of opportunities to pick up extra shifts (once I'm done training) or change my FTE.

I just got accepted into my dream Master's program, which would require me to move to a different state and leave my current job. If I had gotten this news about a month ago, I would have been ecstatic. But now, with the state of US politics, and finally having a stable job I like, I don't know if accepting the offer to study social psychology is a good idea. I would probably also need to go into debt to pay for this degree, because I wouldn't be eligible for an assistantship and I don't know how likely it is for me to get a scholarship/grant.

1iprrtg,Strung-Along after Lengthy Interview Process. Advice?,"Seeking advice and confirmation on my assumptions. 

I interviewed for a position at big company in Houston, TX. Was contacted by a recruiter who stated they were looking to fill the position by end of Jan, early Feb. 

Including the initial screening call with recruiter, I had a total of 7 interviews(virtual & in-person) with 8+ individuals over a span of almost 4wks. After my final interview I was told, again, by the hiring manager that they would be making a decision very soon. 
After 2 & half wks I reached out to the recruiter with no response & then the following week(week 7)to the hiring manager but only received a response from the recruiter, an hour & a half later, stating that he should have an update by end of the week.
 
Next day he followed up asking if I had other opportunities I was close to getting an offer from. I replied yes, & that I had till end of week to make a decision but that I was still interested in the position with them. 

Three days later, he emails apologizing for the delay & that due to scheduling conflicts he’s unable to give any updates until the following week & asked again if I had any other offers I’m considering. 

I responded conveying my disappointment in not being given any updates & stated that I had mentioned earlier that I have other offers needing a decision by EOD. 

His last email apologized for the delay again & that he understood I needed to make a decision but that they were unable to make an offer at this time & reiterated he wouldn’t have an update until end of the following week. 

How should take this/deal with this situation? 
I’ve never been in a situation where I wasn’t given a straight forward answer (or simply ghosted) after a lengthy interview process. 

I’m pretty sure my initial understanding that they’re stringing me along because they’re hoping to find a better candidate but I’d appreciate any advice or insights from anyone who’s experienced this before. 

Feel free to be blunt & candid.

1ipqyew,When to jump ...,"I'm looking for answers, guidance, and assurances.

I'm a mid career professional. I make about 100k annually as a product manager at a Medicaid, not for profit health plan.

Recently, because of tomfoolery in our state and more recently because amost all but certain Medicaid and Medicare fuckery, we've been operating at a tremendous loss because reimbursement rates to our plans are razor thin and only getting worse.

At the beginning of the month, the supervisor and our director told me to be prepare for Very Bad Things and asked if I wanted a resume review or if I saw any jobs they posted on LI, to ask for a referral.

I lamented the state of my job to a friend who then told me they had an equivalent role over at her social service agency. She recommended that I apply, using her as a reference. She even introduced me to the director of that department, the supervisor for the role over email 

I applied, waited a week, and then let the supervisor know I had applied on the portal. I ended up with a screening call the same day and a follow up for the manager a week later. There are two calls after that. 

My qualm is ... I like my current job. It's fully remote, I know the system inside and out, I'm the resident SME, and I have my job down to a few hours a day. I don't want to leave on the likely chance that I'll get a nice severance package when we inevitably get bought by a for profit giant or (hoping against hope) I get kept on by the newer bigger org. 

This other job is slightly less money and is hybrid. My friend who works there goes in very infrequently, but she's been there seven years. They are moving quick with this role. They are as stable as a nonprofit will be at this time.

I don't want to leave my company prematurely. I hate change and resignations always feel like giving up. This job has seen me flourish, skills wise, and I kind of want to stay to the bitter end.

On the other hand, I have daycare bills and a mortgage payment, and not a lot of savings. 

Should I be applying myself to this and other job postings at a frantic level? Old job will be falling down bc of reimbursement rates, and a hostile purchasing seems to be looming.

Office is 15 min drive
 Aren’t as technological proficient, so I would have to lead on that area. 
People seemed nice enough. 
Offered me two weeks WFH pa. 
I have requested a bonus  to go up


Second offer: 
Only 4 years old company 
1 year in probation period with one week notice. Which is not ideal as I’m here on a visa and need a job. 
Super flexible , make your hours as you prefer sort of thing. I could go to my country for a few weeks and work from there and eventually work full time when i decide from there. 
Expanding, new office next year etc. 
£5k more but with a different title with a lot more responsibility. - project architect which I will have to get trained on. - which is already more than he wanted to pay.
5 min walk
Open to make changes and adapt with my suggestions technologic wise
Have the most interesting project, but smaller than the first offer.  
Looks like super welcoming people and are younger. 


I would think that my current one would try to match so that would be on the run if they would
Surpass offers, but this wouldn’t solve my issue  of the need to grow professionally.


I have been debating, for me is clear that first one has more advantages. Better pay, bigger projects, more exposure to things I haven’t done. Afraid of being a place that would resist change in technology ( they seemed open). 
But the flexibility that I love from my current job will disappear ( hours wise) and it cant match the second offer.. 
the second offer gives me anxiety to think about if something goes wrong. He seemed super and chilled , and I think culturally this would be the best fit for me..

He got upset then said “I thought this would be an easy yes from you” and left.

A few days later during our team meeting, my director brings it up again and says thanks to everyone who will be working the wedding but doesn’t mention who’s doing it. After the meeting, he comes up to me and says “you’re working the wedding and there will no payment”. 

To be given a choice and having an aforementioned payment then being forced to work it and without pay really left a bad feeling with how my director treats me.

1ipkusx,Google Engineer vs Investment Banker (top finance) Australia,"Google Engineer vs Investment Banker (top finance) Australia?

Hello,
I did a double degree with diverse internships wondering what to do as a job in the future.
I’m looking at 2 potential graduate offers which I could choose to go through.
First one is a graduate offer of a graduate Google Engineer vs graduate investment banker in Australia.

A Google engineering graduate position pays 40-50k more total comp (not even including stock appreciation just the value only) compared to the top finance position which is the investment banking graduate position (total comp too so assuming max bonus) in Australia.

To sum it all up I’ll make a lot more money as a Google Engineer (Graduate and all stages of career) than an Investment Banker (Graduate and all stages of career) whether at a top bulge bracket investment bank or not.

What I value is money and work life balance which makes it a no brainer for me to want to choose Google for both those factors but I have pondered to myself to think because I eventually want to be an entrepreneur and not work a 9-5 and rather create something or have my own business.

So I am wondering which pathway would be the best for me now considering I want money and work life balance and eventually a remote job or in a dream world be an entrepreneur ",Exact-Attention6612,1,1.0,0,1739566827,2025-02-14 21:00:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ipkusx/google_engineer_vs_investment_banker_top_finance/,2,2025

1ipjz2o,Got Fired Yesterday from a Company I’ve worked at for 6 years,"Some context: 

I graduated college in early 2019, prior to graduation I was interning at a small company as an IT Project Coordinator which ended up bringing on full time after graduation. 

In 2020 I had the opportunity to jump ship and work for an international accounting firm as an IT security consultant. At the time I was weighing my options for “small company, more flexibility” vs “giant corp which will treat me as a number and ruin my work/life balance”. 

I ended up staying at my small company and getting blackballed at the accounting firm because I initially accepted their offer and then decided against it. The hiring person was so pissed lol. 

So over the 6 years of working at my small company, lots of changes occurred. My starting pay of $38,000 per year steadily increased to $90,000 per year, I got promoted to IT Project Manager, my boss was promoted to Director of the Project Management Office, and then my boss pursued a VP role at the small company in 2023 and got promoted to overseeing a different department. I got a new boss at the start of 2024, then fired in the beginning of 2025. Coincidence? You tell me. 

Suffice it say the new boss sucked at her job and put a lot of blame on me when things didn’t go as planned. I wasn’t the only project manager underneath her either, but it seemed like I was the one getting the most negative attention. 

I survived a Performance Improvement Plan at the end of 2024 only to be fired Q1 2025 for “slipping back into bad habits”. I kinda hate her for that. 

Now that I’m unemployed, I’m not necessarily panicking. I’m eligible for unemployment, I have a decent amount of savings I can survive off, and I’m just trying to decide what to do next. 

What do y’all think for next steps? I could take some time between jobs or I could start applying immediately.

1ipixev,Fed up with management and I feel very mistreated (LONG post),"this will take some extensive explaining and serves as a vent, too. bear with me:

so my workplace has went under some extreme changes recently with management. 

my previous manager was fired without warning due to ""operational changes"" within the company, which started all of this mess. the ""changes"" were pre-planned based on a ton of initial changes my team saw, but it wasn't communicated at all to my manager, so she was blindsided completely. 

notably, the supervisor who fired her told us about the decision and specifically said that it was due to her performance. we called bullshit. when we questioned what she meant, she told us that she can't tell us that due to policy. but isnt stating that the ""performance wasn't good enough"" already a violation? from my understanding, it is.

cut to weeks later, we get a new manager with a very separated tactics. he rarely comes to our office space and when he does, it's to talk to our leads about nothing related to the actual job my team does. he never even gave an announcement to us as a group, pulling us individually to his office to ""meet"" us. 

this means that he does not know us. he just knows the leads, and even that statement is pushing it. and this is where the big issues for me begin:

at my job, we have hourly pay. we submit an availability for hours per work quarter because the job is based around a university, most of us being current students. apparently, the new management made some changes that aren't in company policy and did not once inform me of this until it was a problem.

i submitted my availability per usual. i had one single day marked as completely unavailable because i had 3 appointments that day. every other day from january to the end of may has the same availability. i was scheduled for a 9-5 on that day. i was given no opportunity to fight it because of some work policy that says we need approval for a time off request 4 weeks in advance with a doctor's note. this ""policy"" is no where in our employee hand book. but obviously, i didn't ask for time-off and didnt need to. i submitted my availability per company policy as i always do. if we cant work on one day, we can put that time as unavailable. according to the handbook, we would have to provide a reason for the total unavailability IF IT IS TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS OR MORE. i had one day. i have never once had issues with scheduling funtil this new management came in.

so i spoke with the manager and told him the issue. he looked me in the eyes and told me that the reason i was scheduled for that day was because it ""differed from my other availability"" and that it is ""not his or our scheduling teams' responsibility to look at our availability outside of a consistent week-by-week schedule."" so because that one day differed from the rest of the quarter, they scheduled me anyway and completely ignored it. keeping my composure was so hard at that point. obviously, that makes absolutely ZERO sense. i had to miss 2 of the 3 appointments and work from home to even make it in time, which they're really strict about work from home. fun side note: management works from home once a week or more depending on simply how they feel.

it was also a lie. i spoke with a coworker about this and she is unavailable to work tuesdays due to another job and classes. she showed me her schedule and she was scheduled every. single. tuesday for an 8-5. i saw her availability and confirmed that she had every tuesday for the semester marked as unavailable. that's a consistency and not consecutive days, yet she was scheduled anyway, completely contradicting my manager's explanation. this happened to many others, too. 

cut to a few weeks later. we have lead applications opening. i submitted a more than sufficient resume and application. i have been at this company for 6 years and i've been seen as a leader for most of those. i am by far, by FAR the best employee we have. my job involves

am the only one that can help with countless issues since the leads and management and my co-workers simply don't know. they know the basics, but struggle with most anything else. there have been issues with centralizing our information for the job, so it isn't their fault, but management doesn't know a damn thing at all. 

i am the reason we know most of the things we know in this job. our company we partnered with didn't give us anything to work with at all. i figured it all out and more and have contributed the most.

i preface this because i ended up denied the lead position. i was extremely confused and emotional about it and everyone was astonished that i didn't get it. i met with the manager and he proceeded to explain that he wanted to hire me as a lead, but the supervisor intruded and stated that i ""cant handle pressure at all"" and forced HR and my manager to not promote me. my jaw hit the floor. 

this is a blatant lie. she sited an example for me to prove that i cant handle pressure: allegedly, i had a ""total mental shutdown"" because my monitors wouldn't turn on. this is insane. yes, it was stressful. everything was going wrong. monitors wouldn't turn on and when they eventually did, i couldn't connect to the VPN. then, i couldn't connect to wifi outside of the VPN. then, the monitors wouldn't turn on again and i had to get new chords. then, when i finally got to actually work, my headset wasn't working and i couldn't hear my callers. then, i had to call our IT support because it lost connection with the VPN again. i couldn't log into any other computers because our credentials are tied to the one we were assigned. OBVIOUSLY this is stressful. but i handled it and never once shut down or gave up

but how did my manager know this happened when he wasn't even there that day or ever? because of my lead. he was the one that was there and helped me do all of that troubleshooting. the management only talks to our leads, they only talk to my coworkers when we're in trouble. my manager is stupid if he thinks i wouldnt figure out who told him. i was especially hurt because my lead has been such a good friend to me for years, he has helped me so much and been there for me when i was at my lowest. that hurt so bad. 

i have an anxiety disorder and was on disability resources at my university. it doesn't impact my ability to lead or work, which is clear since i handled the most pressure at this job. i will be helping 3 people at the very least while also on a call and helping my coworkers with their many questions that i only have the answer to.

i am incredibly distraught by this circumstance. i lost my most amazing manager for one that barely acknowledges us and has a negative view of me because of some lie that prevented my promotion. 

anyway, i feel like there were some legally questionable things that occured in these situations and i was wondering if that is the case? it's probably by a state basis but wanted to ask anyway after getting this off of my chest. i am a woman in minnesota if that helps.

This individual is a working classical singer. It's a struggle because it doesn't pay much but she's OK. She has worked with ensembles and orchestras in the US and Europe. 

She has found that bad behavior is tolerated. This isn't MeToo suff, just basic treatment - screaming conductors, rude program directors, etc. The stories she has relayed would not be tolerated at any large employer or most employers for that matter.

Sometime back, she worked with a Dutch conductor who simply behaved decently. Things went just as well as with the screaming maniacs, actually better. It made her realize - wait a minute, this is what normal should look like.

The universal excuse is that they are just so passionate. It's hard to believe this sterotype is a thing, but it seems to be.

1ipdd7u,Should I stand up for myself on this?,"Hi, throwaway here for anonymous advice.

I (45F) work in a niche industry and I have extensive experience. I was hired by my current company to build a specific product. 

The problem is, my company competes with larger, better established companies. From the beginning I told them they faced an uphill battle on this but we had ways to make it work.

I also told them specifically that we were approaching the issue incorrectly and launching the product to the wrong market in the wrong geography. They told me to sit down and shut up. I did what they asked, while telling them we were losing momentum in the overall market by not placing this correctly 

Lo and behold, the product is not selling.

They have now hired an arrogant young guy who has told them he can create and deliver what I failed to do. They hired him in the correct geography so at least there's that. My original thought was cool, this is the direction we needed to go, I will support him launching there.

However, a few things have become clear.

1. He doesn't know what he's doing. He doesn't have the experience or knowledge base, and I can see that he's way off track. But they believe the things he's saying, and they haven't listened to anything I've said since I started. It's bad enough to actually be nonsensical, but my management are so inexperienced in this area that they can't tell the difference.

2. I don't think he was hired just to launch in the other geography. I think he told them that he can replace my product and make it successful, which isn't possible. For one thing: the current presidential administration is shutting down this entire thing. The potential customers have already announced in their quarterly earnings that they are redirecting all efforts to other continents. This product depends on an environmentally concerned government, so it is dead for now

I was actually correct the entire time, but they don't care about that. 

I am looking for another job, but I need to hang in there long enough to find one. It will be tough right now. I'm very concerned. I'm also really angry that they have ignored my experience, even when I was correct, and they believe this nitwit because he's a brash talking man.

If I can't find another job, I'm not sure how to combat this at all, or how to hang on.

I am getting more assertive. My manager has been undermining me this whole time, I realized, mostly through laziness. After I asserted myself yesterday specifically, he suddenly had a bunch of critical information that I've needed for months and he had said wasn't available to us. 

I realized this week that he had hidden a large portion of my work and had made it appear to upper management that I didn't do any of it. I have a way to make this known in a professional way. I'm just not sure if I should. It will become obvious that he was undermining me, but I don't wish to make an enemy of my manager. On the other hand, I'm afraid that being too nice is part of how I got here.

Do I make it clear I will not take this lying down, while I search for another job? Or do I sit tight and flee?

I think my manager is mostly a coward but obviously he can make my life very difficult in a wide variety of underhanded ways.

I (23M) have been in my current position for nine months, and it's a manufacturing contractor. It's a Korean company that hired me because Korean was one of the three majors that I completed in four years (the other two were music and international studies; as you can see all three of them have low employment prospects in those fields not to mention I lost interest in them after getting burnt out). However, the bosses hardly ever use Korean language with me and usually address me in English, if they address me at all. I'm the only non-engineer in the office and have no idea what's going on with the technical aspects, and because of my lack of skill the bosses tend to either ignore me and have me do nothing, or do mundane tasks like organize the storage closet, nail wood to the walls, etc. I don't think that type of work is ""below me"" by any means, but there's only so much office cleaning/organizing you can do to make yourself look busy before it's all done, and the days drag on with me feeling useless and meaningless. The bosses are also pretty rude to me (understandable because I don't do much, but it's still often hurtful as I feel like that isn't my fault since the hiring managers said I would be trained on the technical aspects of the job and I haven't been). 

Obviously, I'm looking to leave but 1) the job market is horribly unstable right now and 2) I'm really struggling to pinpoint what it is I even want. I feel like my interests are constantly changing (maybe this is just part of being a young adult?) and my attention span doesn't stick to anything for that long (I have chronic ADHD). I've thought about becoming a flight attendant and have applied to several airlines with a few rejections so far. My parents are understanding of my job situation and we're discussing my moving home and potentially going back to school for something like Certified Nursing Aide or Medical Assistant. I like helping people (when I know what I'm doing, which is rare) but I am afraid of going back to school and spending money on something I might lose interest in quickly again. When I google entry-level jobs not much comes up that doesn't require experience and I get rejection after rejection for all sorts of things, if I hear back at all. I'm starting to feel hopeless and like I'll be stuck at this job for years on end; I know I theoretically have a lot of options but I'm overwhelmed by them and staying positive is increasingly elusive.

It’s challenging me, it’s enjoyable, and I’m having a good time stepping into this role. However, I have made so many mistakes and yesterday was the worst day I’ve had since I started. I disagreed with everything my boss told me and rather than stepping away and just leaving I had a panic attack, ranted to everyone, and just left without saying anything. I’m making all of these amateur mistakes and I can’t stand it. 

I’m very lucky, as I have surrounded myself with some awesome mentors that stayed with me when I transitioned roles, and they even told me this was coming. The top of mount stupid, I think is what they call it, and it’s just really frustrating because I knew this was coming but I wasn’t able to mitigate it. 

I want this disgusting, gross feeling to go away but with my amazing mentors I know this is part of the process and to enjoy the journey, to enjoy growing and learning, and take stock of what I’m falling and stumbling on and learn from it. 

But, to be honest, even with the encouragement and support, I hate it here. I hate that I feel like I don’t know what’s going on. I hate that there’s gaps in my thought process. I hate that I can’t articulate what I want to say well enough to get my point across. I just want to be the best I can be in my new role and all I can see are my shortcoming, failures, and lack of knowledge. 

How do I mitigate this feeling?

Yesterday after coming home I screamed at my partner and stared at the wall all night because I couldn’t fully process the day.

And, on top of it all, even though I know there are gaps in my knowledge and I don’t have full visibility on everything, I still very strongly disagree with the choice my boss is making and don’t know what to do about it.  

I feel so naïve and I hate it.

1ipb3gg,"Manager wants me gone, but I at the same time like the job.","I have been working here for a year, and when I joined I thought the manager was a cool guy. Of course he nitpicked me when I was in my trial-phase for things the others did, but I thought he just wanted me to be better.

I have ""gotten"" in trouble a few times, mostly because I always called out the upper management for being lazy or doing sketchy things. One example is when customer is waiting for their orders and there is an issue only a certain manager can fix, they would let these issues stack up over weeks.

Today I get messaged by my direct manager saying I have 2 weeks to fix my work ethic and behavior or I will be sacked. When I ask for details, I get given a recent joke I told my coworkers. Where we laughed and forgot about it.

It is a part-time job as I am in uni, and the pay is pretty good. We get bonuses relative to what we do, and I do the most so I get high bonuses.

There is a hiring phase going on, where the owner wants 4 new people. When practically even 1 more person is more than enough.

Money wise they would be paying more new people for the same extra tasks I do, so I don't know if they just want to sack me intentionally or no.

I want to ask the manager in specifics what he has in mind, but at the same time I know he is the sort to let you dig your self deep inside a hole and doesn't respond/ignores you. And when something happens he brings it up in a weird way like you ignored what he said (best way I can explain it).

1ipayuy,Not enough considered at work,"First of all, this is my first time in this subreddit, and I'm quite new to Reddit, so I don't know the rules very well.

I've been working in this family-owned company for a year now. I'm in charge of quality management. Since I started, I've sensed some passive-aggressive behavior from one of my colleagues. She withholds important information that I need or only informs me at the last minute. She also constantly reports everything related to my tasks to my N+1.

For example, during an external audit, she reported the audit results to my N+1 before I even had the chance to do it myself. She also kept all information about new products from me—I wasn’t even aware that new products were in development. Then, at the last minute, she asked me to prepare all the legal documents needed to market the products. I believe I should be involved from the start of product development since there are strict regulations we must follow. Now that the product is already developed, if anything is non-compliant, it would be a waste of resources to redesign it.

Worse, six months ago, she asked me to organize social events for our office, such as team-building activities and gatherings. Now, I feel like my colleagues see this as my only role.

The problem is that because of her actions, my workload is quite light, making it seem like I’m doing the bare minimum at work. And yet, I’m not being reprimanded for it.

1ipau34,Feeling Lost About My Career Path—Need Advice!,"
I'm an 18-year-old student in my final year of high school, and I’m struggling to decide on a career path. I want to pursue a science-related major, but I’m unsure which field would be the best fit for me.
I’m interested in bioengineering, biotechnology, microbiology, or marine biology, but I worry about job stability and financial independence in these fields. I value time over a traditional 9-5 job and don’t want to feel stuck in a routine.
Outside of academics, I enjoy writing poetry, reading fiction, and doing art/sketches. While I don’t see these as full-time careers, I’ve thought about monetizing my art or exploring freelancing as a side hustle.
I feel anxious and lost because my peers seem to have clear goals, while I’m still unsure. I don’t want to end up in a degree I regret or struggle with career stability later.

For those who’ve been in a similar situation:

1.How did you figure out your career path?
2.Should I consider alternative career paths or ways to combine science with creativity?
3.Any general advice for someone struggling with this decision?


I’d really appreciate any insights or experiences!

1ipassy,Raise smaller than inflation and passed up for promotion. Is it worth negotiating?,"I am a 25-year-old in the US and I have been with my company for about 20 months now. This is my third role out of college. During my first year with my current company, I wasn’t given a raise because I had only been with my company for six months at the time of our review. Now coming up on annual review time, my coworker told me that she was shown our raises when she was talked to about her promotion. She told me I am getting a 3% raise (about $2k annually). Inflation since my start date is about 4.12%. I work in sales but make very little in commission (at least at my current property). There is a fixed number of units to sell and I work at a site with a smaller sales inventory. When I took the job I was told I would be the only salesperson on site, and about a year in another salesperson was hired because they couldn’t fill a different office role. That person working alongside me cuts my commission in half. The person hired had the same experience as me and he is just a year older. Even after my managers gave up on filling the aforementioned non-sales role, they had to raise the title and pay to fill this role. So, he is a senior salesperson and makes about $10k a year more than me. I recently applied for a promotion to management which would have been a $20k-$30k bump in pay. My direct manager pushed for me to apply and get the promotion but I was passed up for an external candidate because they have prior experience in that role. Luckily the other salesperson is soon being transferred so I should expect to be the only salesperson but our property is now stabilized and there is less inventory to sell. The bump in commission might translate to an extra 100 dollars a month.

 It pains me to think about leaving because I love working with my direct manager, I like the company as a whole, and I have a short 9-minute commute to work, but I feel like I might be wasting my time and money staying here. With a new person starting in the only role I can be promoted to, I expect to not have another opportunity to be promoted for a while. Being passed up for the promotion didn’t get to me too much, but what got me angry was that they were willing to pay my coworker 10k more and give him a senior role for the same job/experience,(all while cutting my commission in half) but I can’t even get a raise equal to inflation from when I started working? I took this job hoping I would finally be at a company for at least 3-5 years but is that a reasonable expectation these days? Is it too early to move on from this role just shy of two years in? Would any of you even bother negotiating the raise given other issues in the role? Or should I just focus on finding other opportunities. Any advice is much appreciated.

1ipambc,How to reach out to boss where I received an offer last summer ('24 June) but I didn't take it?,"I've been at my current company for 3 years by now, last summer I was referred to a position by an ex-colleague at a competitor, where after the interviews I was made an offer with a significant salary increase. When I told my company I got an offer and will leave unless it's matched, they agreed to match it (giving me an over 50% raise). At that time I was quite happy at my current company overall (just saw I was being underpaid prior to the raise), but there were already some potentially dark clouds on the horizon about the future company performance.   


Fast forward to now, and a lot has changed for the worse at my current company. There has been leadership changes and the strategy is chaotic, the company results are dropping and they just laid off a large part of the company (I'm still safe). Because the current situation is limiting my opportunities for growth, and the company is going to be in sustain mode for 1-2 years (in the best case), I now started to consider looking for new opportunities. 

I saw the other company (who made me the offer last summer) had a similar job posting for a while now, and I was thinking about applying for it and reaching out to the VP who hired me (hiring manager). After I rejected last time, the hiring manager already hinted 'we never know what the future brings', so I don't think they were offended (I also rejected fairly fast + politely, so not wasting their time).

Do you think it's a good idea? What to keep in mind? Also, should I write to VP first and then apply, or vice versa? Also, should I reach out to the ex-colleague who referrred me? 

Thanks in advance!

1ipaimi,"Manager is giving me 2 weeks to fix my behavior, but I don't exactly understand what behavior he has in mind exactly.","I have been working at this company for 1 year, as customer support. It is part-time, and I have changed my role a few times already.

Now currently, there is a hiring stage happening. Manager wants to find 4 new people, while there is only need for 2 maybe.

He messaged me today (as he is out of town) saying that I need to change my behavior or I will be sacked. I wanted to ask for specifics, he told me a badly worded joke I said in the office was one example. But there are many others from months.

I have been here the longest, and do the most. As we get bonuses for our work done, I get more money.

I am in uni so pretty needed money. But I have a weird feeling that he just wants to replace me.

As I have recently started being more vocal on some issues being ignored, when they shouldn't. Resulting in some customers waiting for way longer to get their issue fixed.

I honestly don't know where to go, as it is a good job. But I don't know if me starting to just be quiet is the key part, or what he wants exactly.

Any real advice? Prior when I joined I thought the manager was a nice dude, but more and more lately he has been doing less and less himself.

1ip9erz,How do I level up my career?,"Hello everyone!
Unfortunately, you’ve come across yet another post on “tech careers.” Repetitive, I know. I truly do apologise. But I feel quite stuck and unsure how to level up my career, so I’m here to ask for advice from those with more experience - or at least take inspiration from hearing your stories.

Background: M29, EU-based, mechanical engineering background, experience in product compliance within emerging tech (Europe).

I don’t have a specific dream sector (I like emerging tech, sustainability, AI - the usual suspects), but I feel like my background is too niche and sector-specific. While I have experience in regulatory compliance, standards, etc., I’m worried this will pigeonhole me into a very narrow career path.

How I Want to Progress: I’d like to transition into a more high-impact role in tech policy, product, or program management - ideally at companies driving major innovation (so the most competitive ones).
I’ve applied to some roles, but so far, I feel like I’m missing something in my profile to really stand out.

Some Thoughts:
- I don’t have a coding background, and while I don’t want to become a developer, I figure that having a grasp of the fundamentals (AI, cybersecurity, data governance, etc.) might be useful for credibility in tech policy or product roles. Would you suggest I take some courses? If so, which ones?
- I’ve looked into tech policy masters degrees, but they’re expensive (often 2 years long), and I’d have to pause my career - not ideal. Are there alternative ways to gain relevant expertise without going down this route?
- For those who made a similar jump - what helped you break into bigger, high-impact roles?

Would love to hear your thoughts and any personal experiences on how you bumped your career up a notch!

|$425-720k||Total||$310-570k|

  
Cost does not matter since my benefits cover them both.

About me:

Air Force vet. 4 years medical. 5 years FT WE in medical field (incl. time in military). 2 years WE as a team supervisor in AF and a couple internships regarding health admin. Career goal is to work in hospital operations and eventually hold a C-suite position. Currently a senior at a t10 public uni.

Plan:

I pick Dartmouth if I find a well-paying FT job ($70k min.). I pick UNC if I don't. I know UNC is the superior program. But everyone around me is pushing me to do work and school FT together so it shows ppl im hungry and to make up for loss time since I'm a nontraditional undergrad. I don't want to. I want to go to a traditional in-person program bc I know you just learn so much more that way. And you get way more out of it than online learning. 

Dartmouth:

Hybrid, mainly online. 12 days of in-person learning in the whole 2 years. Expects students to work FT. I can make a significant amount of money while getting an Ivy League degree. literally getting paid to work and go to school. time efficient but will for sure make me exhausted. life will feel more like a grind than anything else. expedite my career pathway by 2 years.

MHA program is brand new. id be in the 2nd class ever. Dartmouth is Dartmouth and they will always be quality. But a brand new, mainly online program? surely there's not as strong of a networking bonus compared to others.

UNC:

In-person, traditional learning. Has all the benefits of in-person learning. dream school and program. but ill be broke. or at least broker than the other option. money makes the world go round. it pays the bills. it makes things easy. i always hear  i guess we can forget about the countless ppl who have similar paths to me. 

MHA program is very well established. the entire school of public health is. alumni and network runs deep. resources and orgs that help students build experience are plentiful. 

Situation:

I got offered a healthcare consulting job with 85k salary. It's not from a consulting firm or anything like that. It's from a large healthcare company who has hospitals but now have ventured in other services in the health field.

I was a bit surprised bc I applied to so many consulting jobs from various sized firms and only got 2 interviews including this one. I have ZERO consulting experience whatsoever. I also applied for manager positions which I know I'm highly uncompetitive for since I don't have enough formal leadership experience. i got rejected very quickly. im not settling for anything less than 70k, which would be the vast majority of admin jobs in a hospital if you're not a manager. 

i just feel that this opportunity is a one-off. that i got lucky. for some ppl, thats fine. but i feel like i'd have to apply for 1000 more jobs to get one like this. what if i hate my new job? glassdoor seems good. what if they hate me and i get fired then id have to resort to a <$70k job?

im not qualified to be a manager yet so i cant make >$70k that route. the only way to reach that number with my degree and background is through consulting, which is one of the most competitive fields rn. AND the job market is down overall.

My biggest critic and voice of reason:

one of my closest friends and largest critic, B, has grilled me over the last few years. he's a fellow vet and a little older than me. he doesnt care about rankings or anything. to him, a degree is a degree. and he validates this by his success in the corporate industry. ""nobody cares where you get your degree from"". every. day. 

he's the type of dude to have a shrine dedicated to david goggins. wakes up at 6 am to run a 10k and do strength training. has a six figure stock portfolio. wants to invest in real estate to make passive income. lives in the city. records day in the life videos of him and his luxury car and his fancy meals. that guy. 

he also tells me that working and going to school FT is the best way to achieve my goals. 

here are some of my favorite things he says every week:

""everyone i know thats on top worked and went to school at the same time. no complaining. just grinded. thats how you make it."" 

""you'll be 28 by the end of your MHA with no formal manager experience?""

""what do you have to celebrate for?""

Big question:

am i making the best overall choice by picking UNC? ",Cyphvr,1,1.0,0,1739528012,2025-02-14 10:13:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ip7hn7/which_one_would_you_pick_dartmouth_or_unc_for_mha/,2,2025

It could be something that would only take a few hours/minutes to do and it’s the correct way to do it and I know that if it was another engineer suggesting the same thing nobody would have a problem with it but because its me I have to prove why it’s the right way

1ip3zsc,Help?,"Hey everyone, 

I am 23 and graduated last spring with a BA in political science and a minor in criminal justice. However, my interests have shifted more toward the criminal justice side rather than political science. I’m looking to get my foot in the door with the GBI. I know it’s a long process— I was invited for an assessment a few months ago to become a death investigation specialist but unfortunately didn’t hear back. Still I’m grateful for the opportunity.

I recently had an interview to work at an all mens prison as a CO and I’m truthfully terrified. I’ve always imagined myself doing something within the law field but, I’ve never had the passion to work corrections. I was hoping some of my experience within the prison would help me towards my next path within the criminal field but, I often remind myself that sometimes it’s not about what you know but, it’s who you know.

I was wondering if anyone has any connections that could help. Most positions require experience, which I lack as a recent graduate, but I’m highly adaptable and eager to learn.

1ip30xa,I got into grad school for a MSW and now im second guessing it.,"I've been wanting to become a LCSW for a while now and was accepted into my top choice for grad school last week. I was given enough aid to cover my tuition, but Im left with the expenses of moving out of state (part time) and all other living expenses and standing bills I have. I knew this when I applied, but now Im hesitant because I make good money at the job I have now by being subcontracted through the county. So now, I feel like I'll be shooting myself in the foot financially. I'll probably receive an unpaid internship and eventually ill have to resign from my job... how do I deal with the fact that ill literally be paying thousands of dollars to go to graduate school to work for free? I have worked at all levels in the non-profit sector for the homeless and cant fathom not being paid to work. I've even trained and had interns work under me. Half of the time, we gave them busy work and the other half of the time we gave them small caseloads because we didn't trust their judgement, they were only on site 2 days a week, or we didn't want them in situations with high liability. Also, the work can be absolutely exhausting. I want to become a therapist and it seems that this is the only way to accomplish that. Im currently on track to make 6 figures in the next 2-3 years, but with minimal job security, and I feel like Im getting exploited to do what I am already good at. I can get books like The Body Keeps The Score and the DSM-5 for free right now. Lol. But in all seriousness, what does graduate school really have to offer other than being exploited in a system where you can work your way up? Whats worse than free labor? Paying thousands of dollars to be a nuisance to a paid employee or fill in all of the organizations gaps? Any advice?

No programming, no serious research—nothing that’s actually helping me grow my skills.

I recently accepted an internship at a well-known national lab, and I couldn't be more excited. The projects I'll be working on are amazing, and for the first time in a while, I feel genuinely excited about what’s ahead.

I asked if there was a chance for a full-time role after the internship, and they gave me an honest answer: right now, they don’t have any openings that match my skillset, but they’re ""always on the lookout for talent"" and open to talking about long-term plans during my internship.

It’s a big risk, but I really want to go for it.

I admitted that I hadn’t because it was difficult to pronounce, but I mentioned that I got a referral.

Instead of acknowledging the referral, she just said, ‘I heard you have the conversation, but you need to be doing more.’ Then she started listing off everything I did wrong, like how there was a brief moment of silence while I was looking up the client’s information. And that I should have asked about his day and make small talk with him instead so it's not awkward. The situation didn't feel awkward to me at all. The client was filling out a withdrawal slip while I was looking him up. It completely ruined what should have been a small win for me. I ended up stepping to the back because I felt so discouraged.

1ip1ktc,Which Job to Take? At a Complete Loss,"Hey, thanks for reading this. Right now, I am at some crossroads & am not sure where to turn.

Background on me: I have been at Job1 for 2.5 years. I am 24 years old, and survived some DV stuff 5 months ago. This is important for some reasons.

Right now, I have 2.5k in credit card debt, and $500 I owe in another debt that hasn't been sent to collections. My credit is... ok. In the 650's. I have a little over $500 in an emergency fund, and add $250 every paycheck.

I got a roommate this month, which is cutting my rent in half- from about 1.3k/mo to 650/mo. It only started this month tho, which is why my debts aren't close to paid off.

Now, onto the jobs,

Job1 is where I've been for 2.5 years, as I mentioned. It's an ISP, doing B2B tech support. I *love* the work - a job hasn't been this fun since my catering job. Still, toxic work culture. I make 20.50/hr there, working 40 hours a week. Very little opportunities for progression or OT. I don't have a car but my mom drives me. Still, about twice a week I pay anywhere from 15 - 30/ride to get home. They pay for my internet, and a bunch of nice lil' streaming packages on top of it. With their 6% match, I now have about 15k total in my 2 retirement accounts, about 9k uninvested, and would be vested in 6 months. Oh yeah, and this job put me on a PIP that I just beat.

Job2 is fully remote, helping people fill out their Medicaid applications, letting them know if they got approved or not. NO financial advice given, just very simple customer service/answering basic questions. 16.50/hr. 4% 401k match, I'd be 50% vested after 2 years & 100% after 3. More opportunities for OT, and full time.

Idk, I'd essentially be resetting my 401k by a lot. I admit... I'm not too worried about retirement. I know it'll need to happen one day, but more importantly I just want a house or something, to enjoy my time on earth. I *could* take about 2.6k out of my vested 401k to pad my emergency savings a little... there's no benefit except that since I am a victim of DV, I can take it out penalty-free, which would help me since these bills are closing in... and tbh, the bills are only there due to expenses from that episode, like property damage & being out of work & things.

Anyway...

Any clue which I should take? I ran out of time, so I have to decide tomorrow.

The only reason I ran out of time btw, is Job1 told me my pip would be in 2 weeks... then delayed it 2 months but never bothered to tell me. So Job1 is very sensitive to collapsing, but with the money I can take out, I could have a nest egg... and idk, it is very easy for me to at least get a 16 - 18/hr job rn. I already almost have a full month's rent in my emergency savings, but y'know... not sure whether to risk unemployment just to be fully vested.",Critical_Success_936,0,0.5,2,1739504166,2025-02-14 03:36:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ip1ktc/which_job_to_take_at_a_complete_loss/,2,2025

To preface this I have a BA in marketing and a MBA in management - 26 (F). I have worked marketing related jobs for the last six years - all through college. One being for a marketing agency and my current role as a “director of marketing” for a local business. (I put this in quotes because I am a one person in-house team that contracts out help.) Recently I have felt like I have contributed all that I can to my current company and I have nothing new to do. As a marketer I feel that I am falling more behind since I do not have anyone in my current company to learn from/with. I really want to excel at what I do. 

I’m not sure if I should stay and try to continue my education maybe online? I’m open to getting another degree. 

My other option would be leaving this company and going back to working for a marketing agency to learn more about the trade.

1ip18oy,Motive or Keyence (Sales Postions),"I am a recent college grad, and I'm currently juggling two offers. These are from Motive & Keyence. The Keyence position (Sales Rep) is for my home city (Columbus), whereas Motive (SDR) is for the Austin area (not my home state). I wanted to see if anyone had any insights or advice on the two companies. For a basic understanding, the Keyence offer would be around 55-60k base, with commissions/bonus of potentially around 6k per quarter or 24k per year, making OTE around 79-82K. I've heard stories about Keyence that, for sales reps, they burn you to the ground. However, after a few months to a year or two, you can put yourself in a good position for another sales opportunity in the industry. For Motive, I believe the base was again around 55K, with a commission structure that would lead to OTE being around 72K. The Austin office is relatively new, so culture is what you and your team make it. Haven't heard too much of people's experiences on Motive, but obviously, I would love to gather any advice between the two.

Side Note: Keyence's position being in my hometown would allow me to live at home rather than paying for an apartment, especially if the time there is relatively short. Motive's position would require me to move to Austin, which is subjectively better than Columbus (better weather).",TangySauce31,1,1.0,0,1739503061,2025-02-14 03:17:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ip18oy/motive_or_keyence_sales_postions/,2,2025

However, I wish to learn about Engineering and Robotics.","I am a 23-year-old autistic man and I don't have college-level knowledge about most scientific fields. But I am a pretty fast learner, well a visual learner at best. I wish to get into things like Mechanical engineering, Mechatronics, physics, computer science, and robotics. I have always been a fan of robotics since I was a little kid, because of shows and movies like Robotboy, Iron Man, Metabots, and Transformers. I really like the idea of myself building or crafting things. Because one Christmas morning, many years ago, my father bought me a bunch of PC parts, he then helped me put it together, and I loved every moment of it. Then months later, my father taught me how a car engine worked. Then last summer, I saved up enough money to buy new parts for a new PC, and when I put it together, I felt the same joy from I first built the PC that my father helped me build. Now, I don't have much money to go to college, so I'm most likely going to be self-studying. I'm already buying and collecting books on science and other resources. I also want a better career for myself. I understand that without a degree, it will be like asking a medical student to perform surgery when they haven't earned their medical license. But I really don't want to work crappy job after crappy job my entire life.

1ioypl2,Should I change job?,"Hi everyone,

I started applying for jobs earlier this year due to several reasons:
	•	Full return-to-office (RTTO) policy
	•	Feeling stagnant in my current role
	•	Dissatisfaction with management
	•	Office politics and not feeling valued by my team
	•	Increased workload as our team is being downsized, with pressure to “prove our worth”

I recently received an offer for a similar role at a new company, but it comes with a 15% pay cut and fewer PTO days. The main advantage is that the new company offers a hybrid work environment, and since it’s in the government sector, there’s some level of stability.

I’m debating whether to accept the offer to explore a new work environment. If it doesn’t work out, I could continue interviewing for other hybrid opportunities. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would you take the offer or hold out for something better?

1ioyfxk,Taking a break from job hunting to become fluent in second language?,"Hi everyone, 25f I'm currently seeking advice from people who have taken a short career break to advance their language skills in a second or third language. I've been unemployed for the past 6 months, but have 3 years of experience in my field and quite a strong resume with experience at a well-known global company. As the job market is quite rough in my field right now (and in general), I'm having trouble finding a new role. I'm also hesitant to go back into my career field since my experience at my last company left a sour taste in my mouth due to a hostile work environment (which was also one of the reasons why I left). 

Since leaving my job, I've been living in a different country (I'm a dual citizen) and have thought about taking a break from job hunting to spend a year or two studying the local language. My current language level is not advanced enough to continue my career here, so in order to do that I would have to spend a year or two to really become fluent. I'm lucky to have free accommodation here (due to family), so money would not be an issue and I plan to take on part-time work to cover basic needs.

However, I'm struggling with the idea of letting go of my career in the previous country for a few years to do this. I was doing very well in terms of career trajectory so this feels like it would be a big step back. I'm also worried that if I take time off, the gap in my resume would make it even harder to get back in the field if I chose to return after a year or two (big emphasis on this). However on the flip-side, I think becoming fluent in this second language would open a lot of doors for me in both countries and help me become specialized/standout in my field.

1ioy61h,"Pursued and became successful in Hospitality Management, now I feel entirely stuck and don't know where to go next.","Title should be obvious. I feel like I've done it all in Hospitality. I initially started in 2007 at a major property in San Francisco, but it all fell apart when the recession hit and as of 2009, and I had to bounce around different sectors making ends meet.

In 2013, I chose to move to San Diego, which had a much more robust travel industry at the time. I used my drive and passion to work my way into management there, eventually leaving and traveling through Texas, moonlighting on the East Coast, before heading back to Bay Area when the pandemic hit, and later landing an Front Office Manager position literally blocks away from my first property in SF so many years ago.

It sounds like a great story right? Well, it's been three years.

I'm tired. I'm bored. I love my staff, I love my property, but working with the public these days is taxing enough while I have to explain all the ridiculous additional fees hotels have begun charging in place of stagnating wages for employees. I don't see the industry recovering any time soon, and it's incredibly hard to remember what that first hotel gig was like in 2007 comparing to the bare bone amenities the industry offers now.

My question is ... has anyone had or known others with experience in service industry management and know where to head next afterwards? I've done everything from Accounting, Payroll, Inventory Management, Human Resources, as well as the ugly stuff I won't get in to .. but I'm completely at a loss where I can go from here without going back to college.

1ioxuuq,Should I quit my job,"Should I Quit My Job? Need Advice

I know—another “Should I quit my job?” post, but hear me out.

I’ve been working at a bank call center for three years (my first job out of university) and was recently promoted to a more sales-oriented role. And honestly? I’m miserable.

Everything is measured down to the smallest detail, the metrics feel impossible to hit, my calls are constantly monitored for compliance, and to top it all off, the pay is garbage. The original plan was to gain experience and transition into a more investment-focused role, but that hasn’t worked out.

My new manager says they’ll help me find a better role in a couple of months, but every time we talk, that timeline keeps getting pushed further into the future. Meanwhile, I feel like I’m just burning out.

That said, I’m grateful for the experience—I’ve learned a lot about banking and sales—but I feel like it’s time to pivot before I completely lose it.

Would you recommend I stick it out a bit longer or quit and pursue something else?

For context:
	•	I live with my parents, so I don’t have major expenses.
	•	I have a decent amount of savings, so I’m not in immediate financial stress.

Any advice or similar experiences would be really appreciated!",Enzo7717,4,0.8299999833106995,19,1739492448,2025-02-14 00:20:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ioxuuq/should_i_quit_my_job/,2,2025
1ioxpay,Offered SW position but I don’t have SW degree?,"Offered a position as SW - no SW degree

Hello, I feel like this is a dumb question but I am currently a liaison for the social workers in my org. I have been told prior that I wouldn’t move up in position because I do not have a bachelor’s in SW - it is just a degree in Health Education. After being a liaison, it would be social workers and such, BUT the requirement was I either had to have a master’s in SW to move up. I am doing a master’s program right now but not for SW.

But today, my supervisors offered me the SW position in my org and I am a bit concerned.

I was wondering if this is the right step. I know of the caseload and due to being a non-profit.. it is a lot. 

At the moment, the questions I have are the following:
- How would the caseload work since I’m currently working on my masters?
- Would I be allowed to lessen my hours, but still get insurance coverage? (I work 40/hrs per week, but if I were to ask for 32/hrs per week, would that be okay???)
- Can I please get a copy of my requirements/tasks that I will be handling?
- If I am trained on SW duties, what are tasks that I would be able to do (I understand that there can be rules on MSW, certs, etc, so is this even allowed..)


Do you guys think there’s any other questions that I should ask? This is making me anxious 😭

1iox000,Passion or money?,"Hello all, I’m in a predicament and I would love some removed perspective other than my own on this topic: 


I am a mid 20’s individual trying to figure out my life. I had a career plan that was solid leading up to my graduate school that ended up not working out. This was the most difficult thing in my life since I worked very hard to get there and planned on turning said thing into a successful career. This took a while to recover from and now I am set with a “fork in the road” and I must make a decision: 


I have a passion and talent for learning about the human body. I would like to become a nurse. Learning about how the body works is genuinely stimulating to me and I love learning about it. I have started classes towards becoming a nurse in the mean time. 

On the other hand I have an opportunity to make a lot of $ via a business endeavor and I mean lots of $. As I’m not so passionate about said business, being wealthy sure does make life easier especially when I also have a talent for business. 

 The issue is I must pick one over the other. On one hand I’ll probably love being a nurse and make a decent living, but on the other I will make millions and have nothing to do with the human body. Whichever one that I choose will forfeit the other. I’ve been pondering this for little over a year with true uncertainty.

1iow3sr,"Do I give my leader a heads up, or keep my mouth shut?","Looking for advice - a new group is forming at my workplace, and I’ve expressed interest in joining. The team lead will be chosen first (either internally or externally), and then the rest of the group will be selected from existing employees. The odds of me being selected are pretty high; not a lot of people have expressed interest in joining. From what I know, only one existing employee, “B,” is interested in the team lead role, but I am not willing to report to them due to workplace incidents that have involved HR. It’s possible they’ll pick B anyways if they can’t find a better external candidate.

I don’t want to remove myself from consideration outright, but if B is chosen, I would likely need to stay in my current role. I’d prefer to give my division leader - who is one of the decision-makers - a heads-up now rather than putting them in a tough spot later; however, I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances entirely or seem difficult. There’s some external factors that are delaying the selection process for the team lead, but the go-live date for the group is not changing. They won’t finalize the rest of the group until after they pick the team lead, so if I back out late, it could cause problems and hurt my reputation.

My current draft:

""There’s a possibility that the internal hire is someone I am not comfortable reporting to. [My manager] is great, so in that case, I’d rather stay in my current position.

1iovwuv,Contract to Full Time,"Contract to Full Time?

I know the reverse question has been asked many times over in different subs, but I’ve only seen a couple of comments touch on my situation specifically so I thought I’d throw this out there while I’m still digging for info since the clock is ticking.

**Background:** I work for a hiring agency that contracts me out to bigger companies for certain term limits. As far as my Googling has shown, I seem to be paid more at this current company on an hourly basis than a full time employee.

Now this company is interested in hiring me in as full time, and since I enjoy it here, I want to consider it. My concern though is that I will be offered a significantly lower base pay than what my hourly pay is equivalent to. Yes, I would get all the benefits, stability, and equity but I already have the option for benefits from the hiring agency. Probably not as good but I forgoed them anyway so it doesn’t matter — the main reason I point that out is that *someone* is paying for it. Which means…

That the typical assertion that the company pays less for me as a contractor overall compared to a typical full time can’t be true because then my hiring agency wouldn’t be making any money. Hiring agencies typically make 1.5 to 3X per person they contract out (from what I’ve read).

While the company probably saves money from not having to give me severance, equity, and getting to trial me before they decide to keep me long term (though I think this last one doesn’t matter as much since most employees have that 1 year probation period that allows them to be let go in the first 12 months for any reason), they must still be paying a lot for me as a contractor overall. If that’s true, then I have justification to ask for a higher base salary that reflects my true worth.

And I know there’s equity and possibly a yearly bonus that would make up the difference in total compensation but unfortunately, we live in times where the cost of living is so high that those things don’t matter if I can’t afford my monthly rent. This is why my base salary staying the same at minimum is so important to me. But I love this job and this work too :/

*Is it unreasonable for me to negotiate for my base salary+ or do I have an incomplete understanding microeconomics? And how would I go about doing this?*

**Things to keep in mind:**
- Not an individual contractor
- My hiring agency provides a higher hourly pay in lieu of benefits (this option was given to me and if I wanted, I could have 401K from them as well)
- The company or agency still provides me regular amount of PTO just after 2-3 months in instead of day 1
- I work holidays and travel is on approval basis but they do have a budget for it if necessary
- Company is prone to layoffs so equity doesn’t seem to mean as much even if they offer a lot (personal opinion)

1iovuwh,Seeking Advice on Certifications and Training,"I'm currently a mechanical engineer working for a company that specializes in welding within the oil and gas industry in Alberta. I've just submitted my application for P.Eng and now have a 6-month wait until APEGA approves it. My plan is to find a higher-paying job once I'm licensed (which is typical). Long story short, I need to make some major cash to pay off this student loan!

My current job is in the city, I took it because I saw it as a path to get the experience to get my P.Eng. and it has served its purpose and its time to move on. Before this job, I worked as a field engineer with lots of overtime hours. So I'm no stranger to working on rotation with over time etc.

My current company recently paid for me to become a CWB Level 1 Welding Inspector, and now I'm eager to complete some additional training during this transitional period. My goal is to secure the highest-paying job possible asap, potentially doing fly-in fly-out rotation work or seeking employment in the USA. Another option is becoming a Level 2 Welding Inspector, as these positions have huge earning potential.

Does anyone have advice on specific certifications or training programs that would be beneficial while I'm waiting during the next 6 months? Any insights on high-paying certifications or training that could boost my career prospects would be greatly appreciated!

1iov7at,"Help with career switching and deciding what is ""worth it""?","Hi y'all

I've been with my current company for 3.5 years and starting to feel a bit jaded. There's minimal salary growth and promotions don't come with opportunity for negotiations - it's a set number that everyone at that level makes. I've done research on my position at other companies and they always seem to pay more. I'm drawn to the higher salary and other opportunities for career growth and personal development, but feel stuck. I've started to apply to new roles and running into the same caveats with each one.

**Pros of current job:** fully remote, I live at home rent-free, minimal living expenses, occasional team outings like eating at restaurants I could never afford on my own dime, I've been promoted 2x in the 3.5 years that I've been here, probably on track for another promotion in 2 years

**Cons(ish):** salary is $85K and I feel like I could be making more elsewhere or doing better for myself financially in general, my duties are very hands-on-keyboard and ""plug 'n' chug"" type of work, same day-to-day

**Pros of potential new job:** $100,000 salary, switch to a more strategy/management/consulting role which could be more useful for role changes in the future, less hands-on-keyboard work, bigger clients with larger budgets and more at stake

**Cons of potential new job:** 4x a week in office, I would have to get an apartment in a metro area (\~$1,700 to $2,000 in living expenses) *or* commute 100 miles round trip 4x a week during heavy rush hour, would probably see a decline in my savings after all expenses are considered, coming in as the most junior person on the team

After listing out my pros and cons, I still feel unsure of what is best for my future, both professionally and financially. I'd like to think I'm still relatively young in my field so I'm looking for the best experiences that can allow me to keep climbing the ranks, while also trying to be financially smart and more financially independent.

1iov3wt,How Do I Forge Ahead?,"I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career and could really use some guidance. I’ve been working in digital marketing for 7 years, specializing in Paid Search (Google/Microsoft Ads). My first 4 years were at an agency, where I worked my way up from client services to a Paid Search Team Lead managing a team of 7. After that, I transitioned into the tech industry, still doing PPC management—until I was laid off in early 2024.

Since then, I’ve been focused on landing a role at a video game company, which has been a lifelong dream of mine. I’ve spent the last year applying, networking, and even getting interviews, but I haven’t been able to secure a single offer. Now, my unemployment benefits are running out next month, and I’m facing the reality that I may need to take any job just to stay afloat.

I feel lost, frustrated, and scared for my career. I know I want to work in gaming, but I don’t know how to actually get there. Should I pivot into freelance work? Start a side hustle? Keep grinding applications while taking a temporary job? Or is there another path I haven’t even considered?

If anyone has been through something similar or has advice on breaking into the gaming industry with a marketing background, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1iouxba,I'm finding myself at a fork in the road career wise and would like advice on the situation below.,"I'm currently working at an organization that I really enjoy being a part of (obviously it has its problems but the culture is good). Over the last 2.5 years I've built up a solid reputation here and enjoy my co-workers, however I've definitely outgrown my current role and I'm ready to move up.

I interviewed with a different organization last week and it went really well, they told me I'd hear back by early this upcoming week but moved me along to the 2nd round of interviews just a couple hours later. I believe it's down to just me and one other applicant, so assuming I received an offer after the 2nd interview (I know this isn't guaranteed) I'm seeking advice on how to approach it.

The problem is my current organization has a job listing with the same pay scale as the organization I interviewed with, and I have a good amount of internal support for that role.

However, this position doesn't post until after interviews finish for the company mentioned earlier. I really like my current organization but there is another internal applicant that has a solid shot as well so it's definitely not a guarantee.

Either job would be about a 20k increase/year and I just had a kid, as much as I love my current organization, being able to support my child better financially has me leaning toward taking the role I already interviewed for if offered. 

What would you guys do? Is it worth risking less money to stay with an organization you really like? Also, before people comment, my field is non-profit so I don't feel disrespected by the fact I wasn't paid more earlier on at my current role, they just never had the budget.

TL/DR: I interviewed for a new organization and am considering taking the role if offered even though my current organization that I really like will be posting a new role with similar pay in a month or two.

1ioudf7,Pick Systems Engineering because it is too late to find a niche?,"I started school in my thirties after falling on tough times post-covid. After graduating with a Bachelors in EE last year, I got a very interesting job as an applications engineer where my only role is to select silicon. Unlike my internship where I learned to use tools like Altium, CANalyzer, Oscilloscopes, and programed in C and Python, this job only has me use MS Office. I do a lot of research on my own and my deliverable is learning different aspects of system-on-chips and make a selection based on use cases. I am having a lot of fun learning ADAS, FuSa, and IVI, but I feel this to be more of a Systems Engineering role than an EE role because I spend most of my time writing requirements, and working with cross functional teams. I don't think I will ever specialize in anything at this role in a specific niche like ADAS, IVI, PCBA, Calibration or Test.

If I were to go back to school for my Masters, I think it would be a good idea to just study Systems instead of EE or CompE.

I studied for 2 years full time, and now part time whilst I work full time as a construction site manager.

This position also has a high possibility of travelling to different cities for year long projects, which is something i dont want to commit to with family/partners living where i currently do.

It has good earning potential, and i currently have little to no debt from my studies, so I feel like ive got a great start to my financial life. I say ill tough it out, but i always end up dreading the work and looking for an out.

1iotix4,I’m stumped on which job to take,"Hi guys, I need an opinion as I am torn/dont want to burn any bridges. 

So I recently got laid off from my job and ended making a facebook post to my town asking for any employment opportunities available. I got reached out to by a Starbucks store manager, small business owner, and an insurance company. The second two didn’t answer right away and out of desperation I took the supervisor position at Starbucks. Today I got reached out to by both other companies letting me know they would take me over. 
So here’s where I’m stuck. 

After working my first day at Starbucks, I honestly was not vibing with the setup as well as the management. I could easily thrive there but it’s also a 30 minute drive from home and primarily highway. Scary this time of year ya know. I also just felt like everyone was kind of upset that I was an external hire, and not someone who was previously a barista with Starbucks. Idk maybe I’m just being overly sensitive in that part. 

The best offer at the moment is the small business as to work for the insurance company id have to get licensed and this is more of a career thing, which I don’t want to do for more than 4+ years. 

The small business is an ULTRA SMALL brand new car flipper and they’d want me to do admin and take care of their assets. I’m only worried about this as I just got laid off from a small business that failed. (Also this job pays more than Starbucks, would also offer me benefits and has a nice schedule + super close to home) I really want to take this but the business hasn’t even really began running and I just feel like something like this wouldn’t be a super long term gig in terms of company longevity. 

Anyone have any recs on what to do? Who should I pick in terms of logic and if I do leave Starbucks after only working a day, how can I leave without burning a massive bridge due to the fact that the store manager herself reached out to me and offered me the job.

1ios8x6,To take or not to take the counter offer?,"
Hey everyone,
I’ve officially got an offer from another company. It’s a position I’ve been offered through an old colleague/friend who I’ve worked with for about two years. He’s actually also made this offer to my friend, who’s already submitted her resignation (they did not counter her offer) and will be starting next month. 
Now, a little context on where I’m coming from: I currently work 48 hours a week in my role, which is a bit on the high side compared to others. On top of that, my salary is way below market average, and the benefits aren’t exactly fantastic. The company provides basic health insurance (which is mandatory here) but I have my own coverage, so I’m covered for now.
I had this same offer last year (with a 60% salary increase), but I turned it down because the job was in another city, about 1.5-2 hours away. At the time, I had already requested a salary increase from my current employer (about the same 60%) to match the market, but they kept dragging it out. Eventually, I got fed up with the stress and the toxic environment and almost left without another job lined up. Then, as soon as I told my manager I was leaving, they offered me a 20% increase, which I accepted.

But here’s the twist – I’ve just been offered the same position again, with a 40% raise from my updated salary. The perks are also much better (health insurance, yearly round-trip flight, better basic salary aligned with the market). The job is hybrid, but the commute is going to be around 3.5-4 extra hours a day (I live 3 mins away from my current job), which cuts into the overall benefit. It’s still a 25% increase in net pay after factoring in travel costs (shared with my friend), but I’ve also got a more supportive, structured work environment, which is something I’ve been missing here.

I love my colleagues here, but the company culture is toxic, and I’m just not learning or growing as much as I should be. I’ve been carrying a huge project lately, and I think my boss is just desperate to keep me around. 

Its a hard decision to make because I know I’ll end up with a similar salary anyway and with more hours per weeks,although they’re partly commute, but the new job offers the potential for personal and professional growth, and that’s a big deal.

1ios2it,"Career Advice for My 16-Year-Old Niece (Senior High Strand, Study Abroad, and Future Career Paths)","Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some career advice for my 16-year-old niece, who’s about to enter senior high school. She’s trying to decide between the Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS) strand and the Arts and Design strand.

A little about her: She’s passionate about design, marketing, and psychology. She enjoys hands-on, creative work, but she struggles to express her creativity and turn her ideas into reality. She’s also very emotionally intelligent and loves helping people, which is why psychology interests her. But she’s worried it could be too emotionally draining as a long-term career. She’s exploring marketing, but mainly because it could pair well with design for things like branding or digital marketing.

Her big goal is to study abroad on a scholarship (our family can’t afford international tuition) and eventually live and work in Europe. If she goes with the Arts and Design track, she’d love to attend a design-focused university or college and explore fields like graphic design, UX/UI design, media, or visual communication.

We recently looked through the World Economic Forum (WEF) Future of Jobs Report 2025, which highlights some important trends. The report shows that careers in AI, engineering, and technology-related fields are projected to grow rapidly due to advancements in automation and digitalization. UX/UI design is also listed among the rising fields, as companies focus on creating better digital experiences. Meanwhile, traditional graphic design roles are becoming less in demand due to automation and AI-driven design tools.

We’d love some advice on a few things: Which strand between HUMSS or Arts and Design would better prepare her for these future career paths? Are there other career options related to design, marketing, or psychology that might be worth exploring? We’re also curious about which fields are currently in demand in Europe, especially those that can offer stable, long-term opportunities. Finally, if anyone has advice on preparing for scholarships or building a strong portfolio for creative fields, we’d be grateful for your insights.

I’m 23, working an entry-level finance job, which I initially thought would be my dream career after 6 years in hospitality and retail. However, I now feel constantly stressed, anxious, and miserable. Even with a hybrid schedule, just 3 days in the office leave me drained, and I’ve cried a few times because of the work environment. The office itself and the people aren’t bad, and the benefits are great, but I don’t feel a connection with my coworkers, and I’m not a fan of the office politics and overall culture.

I’ve come to realise there’s no perfect “dream job,” but I want to make work more meaningful. I’m really tired of the 9-5 grind with monotonous tasks and constant stress.

I've worked in retail for all of my professional career(27 now) I have only worked for the one company, joining at entry level and working my way up to store manager. 

I feel like I have very much come to the point where I want to move out of retail now with the usual reasons being poor work/life balance and just generally permanent burnout to name a few.

I have been looking at what I could potentially move into but mostly finding that I'm being blocked by missing qualifications or id be taking too much of a pay cut and wouldn't be enough to live on. 

I'm sure there are allot of similar stories on there like this but if anyone has and advice or what they did to move on with their career it would be great to hear.

1iopn8z,Need help figuring out what I want to study and what career to pursue.,"Title.

19 year old here, I got medical leave from the mandatory military service in my country, meaning I essentially get a 2-3 year timeskip over all of my other friends and everyone else in my age group who has to go through the military.

Naturally, given all this time, the idea is to now look to pursue higher education in a University - though I don't know what I would like to do.  
  
**For some background**     

* I've finished High School recently with the equivalent of *Summa Cum Laude*, as well as majoring in Comp Sci and Physics. 
* I would say Tech is the closest thing to my heart if I had to point out a general direction, seeing as through my whole teenage years I was always involved with computers, whether through hobbies or through Comp Sci in school.
* I’m very organized and numbers-oriented in the way I approach things. Whether it’s something as simple as tracking my caloric intake on a daily basis, or scheduling everything meticulously, I naturally gravitate toward structured, data-driven thinking.
* With this being said, I'm at a place where I can't point at one *single* degree and say ""that's the one"".     I feel there are so many options for career paths, such that I don’t have a clear vision of where I want to end up career-wise.



# What’s Holding Me Back?

1. **The Commitment & Intensity of University** – Throughout school, I never had to study too hard to succeed, so I’m a bit wary of jumping into a highly demanding degree without knowing if I’ll actually enjoy it.
2. **Fear of Choosing the Wrong Path** – I don’t want to invest years into a degree only to realize it’s not for me.

I know that **no choice is ever permanent**, and people switch fields all the time, but I’d love to hear from those who have been in a similar situation:

* How did you figure out what to study?
* Any advice on narrowing down options?
* If you studied something in Tech (like CS, Data Science, etc.), how did you know it was the right fit?

Thanks in advance for any insights!

1iopgrt,How to best leverage this growth opportunity?,"I work in IT in the restaurant industry. Worked my way up from being a server and I don't have a degree, just a drive to constantly learn new things. I've changed roles roughly every 2 years from being promoted and sometimes laterally for a new challenge. I'm at the 2 year mark in my current role without a clear direction of what's next for me, so I've expressed to my supervisor the desire to learn something new. I've dabbled in SQL and Splunk but those haven't panned out into something more. This week my supervisor has told me that they want me to learn robotic process automation to figure out how we can leverage it. We have used it a bit but I believe we paid outside engineers to do it, so rather than keep paying outside people, they want me to learn it and figure out how to use it. I'm definitely going to do it because I want the challenge and to get trained on something totally new to expand my skillset. 

Here is my question - how do I leverage this opportunity most strategically for myself? I looked up the salary for a RPA engineer and the average salary is already in line with what I make. This training will be on top of my regular job, but I'm not on any specific deadline. Obviously I know the point of automation is to create efficiencies, which is something I'm good at (and why they they think I'd be a good fit for this - I've streamlined my current role to the point where I have the bandwidth for a new project). But once I start doing it, how do I make sure to get credit for it and potentially a raise or promotion? I've never had a project like this dropped in my lap and I want to make the most of it!

1iop2f2,(Analysis paralysis) 28M. What should i do?,"Hey guys,

I have a 3-year degree in architecture, and during these years, I ran my own business. (Not architecture related)But things are rough now, and I can’t handle the instability anymore. I have little to no savings, and I don’t want to struggle forever.

I’m from Europe, so tuition is almost free, but I need to make the right move because:
	•	If I go back for another 3-year degree, it HAS to be worth it. I’d be 31 with no experience, and in Europe, past 31, hiring gets harder (it’s not like the US).
	•	If I get a 1-year master’s in a different field, I could start applying for entry-level jobs at 29. Not sure how much that helps since it wouldn’t be related to architecture.
	•	Or I could just start applying for random entry-level jobs now (sales, business development, etc.), but I don’t want to end up in a dead-end role.

I need a path, not just a paycheck. I come from nothing, and I can’t afford to waste time on a job that won’t eventually provide me with a decent life and a house.

Architecture is not viable anymore. To get licensed, I’d need another 2 years of university, and even then, architects here earn minimum wage for a decade before anything improves. Working 12-hour days for peanuts isn’t worth it.
I’m scared. I can’t sleep at nights and i keep beating myself up for the mistakes and bad calculations that i’ve made for myself. I have the brain capacity to work hard and smart but this time i fucked it up and can’t make a choice anymore. And on top of that there’s the fear of getting a job that i won’t enjoy or that i won’t be good at.
I like talking to people but i also like being left on my own type jobs. I’m that jack of all trades that can’t find a path because my focus is on the end goal : money and decent status.",Confident_You_1082,3,1.0,1,1739469375,2025-02-13 17:56:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iop2f2/analysis_paralysis_28m_what_should_i_do/,2,2025
1ioown3,Feeling Lost After Graduating with an Accounting Degree – What Are My Options?,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 22-year-old Korean who just graduated with a bachelor’s degree in accounting, and I’m feeling really lost about my future. I originally considered continuing my studies, but I don’t think a master’s in accounting makes much sense unless I’m planning to pursue a PhD, which I’m not. So, I’d prefer to start working—but I don’t have any relevant experience in my field yet, and I’m struggling to figure out my next steps.

I’m also worried that I chose a major that’s a bit restricting. I don’t find traditional accounting roles particularly exciting, and I’m not sure what other career paths I could take with my degree. I did a year as an exchange student in Germany and loved it, so I’ve been thinking about moving there or possibly the US, but I have no idea what my best options are for entering the job market—especially without experience.

I’d really appreciate any advice on:

* Alternative career paths where my degree might be useful
* How to gain experience and make myself a more competitive job candidate
* Any certifications or additional skills that might open up better opportunities
* General guidance on how to navigate the early career phase when feeling stuck

1iooscg,"Was a high-paid editor, now looking to pivot with no college degree","I've had many jobs over the years, and up until recently struggled to make decent money. I got very lucky when someone posted a job offer in a Facebook group I'm in. I became a very well-paid copy editor and fact-checker for a few major publishers. I was making six figures as a freelancer, and although I was stressed out and absolutely buried in work that had me at my desk for 12+ hours a day, I was grateful for the income.

Unfortunately, Google completely upended the industry and there were mass layoffs across the board. Since I freelanced, I wasn't laid off, but the company I worked for went on a publishing pause until further notice. So I'm pretty much in limbo because there are thousands upon thousands of people who were laid off around the holidays, and there really aren't many jobs available for us.

While it seems like a smart move to consider other career options, not having a college degree pretty much eliminates me from any automated resume-scanning software. My hopes of getting a new job through LinkedIn, Indeed, and other job boards are pretty low. 

I do have one potential opportunity in the works, but it's a 2 hour commute because they want a hybrid schedule of 3 days in office. If anyone has any advice for schmoozing a company about full time remote, advice is welcome!

I'm just feeling a bit lost right now and am not sure where to even begin to get back on track.

1ioojac,New manager role wasn’t as I expected,"Hey all. A few months ago I switched to a new company where I was supposed to be the manager of a team. It was an exciting opportunity and the director gave me the impression that I would have a large latitude to manage my team independently. I came from another managerial position, but I viewed the new position as a bit of a step up.

When I arrived though, I found out that all of the experienced workers in the group were getting transferred to other departments, and the only remaining experienced worker was getting promoted to be an equivalent manager to me, but we were both supposed to find a way to manage together. They split the group up so we focused on slightly different areas, but not by much.

The job is very technical and with no experienced members still left on my team, we have been struggling to continue the workload we were assigned, but we have found a way to do it.

With sharing the role like this, any little thing that I would like to do I have to work with the other co-manager, who is very resistant to doing anything differently. I am learning that the director is spending more and more time with the other co-manager and I am getting cut out of decisions about my own group.

I found out later that before I was hired, that the director wanted to promote the other experienced workers as the sole manager before, but was rejected because she didn’t have enough experience.

1ioogpq,Career Advice Needed: Future Proofing my Tech Career,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a bit of my career journey so far and seek some genuine advice on what skills and roles I should focus on for the future.

I have a **bachelor’s and master’s degree in computer science**, both with **very good grades**. During my master’s, I worked as a **research intern** for 4 months, coding in **Python**.

After graduating, I started my career as a **data engineer** and worked for **1.5 years**. Unfortunately, I had to leave that role when the project contract ended. Since then, I’ve been **actively searching for a new role**—both in **software development** and **data engineering**—but it has been **almost 6 months without success**.

During this time, I’ve started reflecting on the future of tech jobs. With **AI and automation evolving rapidly**, I feel the roles I’m targeting might soon become outdated.

I love working hard and **learning new skills**. I’m **open to pivoting** to roles that will be **booming in the future**. I’m ready to do **certifications, online courses, or any training** necessary to make this switch.

**My question is:**

1. **What roles/positions will be in high demand in the next 5–10 years?**
2. **Which technologies, skills, or areas (e.g., AI, ML, data science, cloud, cybersecurity, etc.) should I focus on to future-proof my career?**
3. **How should I plan my learning path and career transition?**

1ioo49f,Do you follow up phone call negotiations around new job with email or not?,"TLDR; Verbally negotiated salary offer over phone with HR Lead, overthinking now as to whether i should follow up phonecall with an email, or just let things sit to next week. I’ve asked for 5k more than offer. 


I (M32, Married, own our own home and no kids yet) - was asked to interview with a local global engineering firm after applying directly. 

Due to being lowballed previously with local firms - I picked up the phone and said to the HR lead - I would be looking for in the region of 65k base (that would be my rock bottom but happy with it also) so as not to waste anyones time. Any higher and I believe they would have been put off

She responded saying 60-65k is fine (I have this in email from her) - which I was really shocked at as i live in a rural area and salaries wouldn't be great.

Did interview with director, line manager & HR lead last friday, almost one week ago - went brilliant, probably one of the best interviews i've ever done - and I think it was reciprocated on their side, they were very impressed.

3 days later they issue an email of offer in writing (not the official contract of employment docs just yet) at 60k. Typical company tactics I know.

I picked up the phone yesterday and said - my current salary is 65k, i generally dont move unless its for an increase bla bla and was looking closer to 70 as ive asked peers in rival firms in industry what this role would pay and it checks out. 

She explained that with gender pay gap reporting the lady i was replacing was on a lower salary so they had to be careful . I politely understood but said my absolute rock bottom is 65, i couldnt go any lower to take on the role.

HR lead explained that director is off until monday (next week) and she will get back then. I hate when these things drag out. There are a ton of other benefits - option to buy shares, healthcare, great leave etc, option of 2 days WFH (Ulster based) .

I'm just wondering if i should reinforce our negotiations with a follow up email before monday to strengthen my argument / showcase my value? Or am i overthinking it, maybe better to just leave it until monday and take it from there? I saw they had the same role up with a recruiter, would that be a good argument to say ive already saved you their fee?

FYI i really want the job. Its only 15 mins drive from me, hours are 40 per week. Whereas currently im on a higher salary but i have to commute 2.5-3hrs one way once a week with an overnight stay, all at my own expense. I do 3 WFH and 2 in office. I have been looking for the right role since july 2024 and this one ticks all the boxes. 

I'm being impatient but i hate things dragging out - I can't wait to hand in my notice at my current firm but i definitely won't do that until i receive official offer through!

1ionlr2,**The Job Offer Dilemma: Stability vs. Perks & The Juggle of Motherhood**,"
The past six months at my current job have been a rollercoaster. Layoffs, mismanagement, a federal investigation, and a 10% pay cut for me and my colleagues have created a chaotic and uncertain environment.  

**The Search for Greener Pastures**
Faced with this instability, I started looking for a new job and recently received an offer with a significant pay increase. However, the new role comes with fewer vacation days, less holiday time, and a daily commute. My current job is fully remote with fantastic PTO, which as a new mom, has been invaluable in helping me manage childcare and household duties, even with the support of family. 

**The Counteroffer**
Just as I was contemplating the pros and cons of the new offer, my current company discovered I was considering leaving. The very next day, they surprised me with a pay raise matching the offer I had received. 

**The Dilemma**
Now, I'm torn. My current job offers the pay I desire, excellent PTO, and the ability to work from home exclusively - a huge plus as a first-time mom with a newborn. But it's also the same company that cut my pay and has been unstable for the past six months. The new job offers stability and a higher salary but with fewer perks and a commute, which would complicate childcare and household responsibilities. 

**Seeking Security**
I've reached out to my current company to discuss a contractual agreement that would prevent them from docking my pay again in the future. If they're unwilling to agree to this, I'm leaning towards accepting the new job despite the sacrifices.

**Is it the Right Move?**
I'm still unsure if leaving a job with great benefits and a pay raise for a less flexible role with a commute is the right decision. While the higher pay and stability are tempting, I'm worried I'll regret leaving behind the perks of my current position, especially the flexibility that is so crucial as a new mom.  

**What would you do in this situation?**

1iomh6n,Advice on the next move due to spouse illness. I could really use some solid honest guidance.,"I need some advice. I lost my job 4 months ago. Two weeks after that, my husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. We are very fortunate in that I had a good severance package which ends next week, he has short term disability which ends in May. His cobra insurance is only $400 a month. We are in the U.S.

My dilemma is that I am not sure how to handle the job search right now. Our savings will take is through 6 months, but we have a LOT of new expenses. I was earning significantly higher wages, my husband was making decent pay, but short term disability will not sustain us long term. I am really worried about depleting our savings.

I am utterly stuck as to what to do. I was managing a remote team and my job was eliminated. I have been trying for 6 months to find remote work (i knew the job loss was coming). I have two potential in office jobs, but my husband's health is declining quickly and I worry about leaving him alone for too long.

A variety of reasons led to me doing this. I submitted to a number of jobs and have been called for interviews with a few of them. At the time I submitted my resume and had the first round of interviews, I was still employed. I was let go from my previous company a week and a half ago. I had a Teams interview with the CFO for the third round of interviews yesterday. He casually asked if I am still with my former company to which I replied that I was recently laid off. He then asked why I felt I was on the wrong side of things, which caught me off guard and I gave him a brief answer that the CFO wanted to slowly restructure the team and bring in his own people. We then moved onto other questions. 

Was it the right call to tell him this? I have read and heard differing opinions on this - some suggest you don't say anything at all. Others suggest you should only say something if asked. Others suggest you should share this sort of update with the prospective employer without being asked or prompted.

1iokevz,Why will coworkers at my jobs start telling me to do things like chores/tasks but not do it to anyone else?,"
every job Ive had recently there will be a coworker that will start telling me to do tasks/chores and telling me what to do…
It will be another coworker I work closely with, they won’t be a manager this- one girl she's the receptionist she was nice to me at first and treated me normally at first & everything was fine, she was really friendly and close with everyone. Then randomly one day she starts telling me to do little chores and tasks that are like cleaning for her, like she will see a chore that needs to be done and instead of just doing something she sees needs to be done she will just start asking me to do it. She only did this to me, I’ve never seen her say this to anyone else. This same thing was happening to me at another job I was at except the girl was very hostile and rude/ a bully about it and she wasn’t a manager. The thing is it's not like I don't do anything, I actually always am cleaning up around the place, I don't stand around and not do anything. I was assisting at this job and she would do this while I was standing there helping the stylist or sometimes I would walk to the back to do something and she would start doing it then. I feel like she saw herself as above me in some way or is kind of trying to walk over me by doing this. Every day at the end of our shift we all have to do one chore before leaving, I always just do a chore without like announcing it or saying anything to anyone, like I'll just do it. Nobody including her has ever asked or told someone else to clean or do anything. Sometimes there's less people and I'll do two or more. There was this one time where there were only a few of us there including her, I did like 3 maybe 4 chores that day. I cleaned like half the place before leaving. I didn't see her really cleaning anything... after cleaning she said ""do you mind doing the dishes and putting them away"". Also she was there the whole time and saw me cleaning everything. I didn't know what to say to her/ how to say no without causing a problem so I just smiled and said ""ok!"" and nicely did it. She only did one chore that day. She kept doing this multiple times it would be during the day and at the end of the day. But she never did this to anyone else. 

I sometimes tell other people about it to see what they think and every time they will get defensive and say “I think she just needs help cleaning” “I think she just needs help” 

Also I don’t know if this meant anything but after doing what she said I just left, went to the back room without saying anything to her and I noticed right after I came in she walked in really fast after me, like speed walking almost like she was following me. She didn’t say or do anything she just got her stuff but was looking at me. but I just thought it was odd. Shes started doing this thing more often it’s almost all the time now, just telling me to do little chores when I’m always cleaning or doing something, not like I’m just standing there not doing anything. But she will disguise it as being ‘nice’ about it like she will ask “do you mind doing the dishes then putting everything away” instead of “do the dishes and put them away.” Another thing was other people were using color bowls and not putting it away or leaving color or lightener out after using it, I wouldn’t be using lighter all morning and it would be sitting out and she would tell me I have to be cleaning up after myself even though it wasn’t me. Why do people at jobs keep doing this to only me? Also it’s recently been brought to my attention that I look WAY younger than I am. Multiple people at this job have commented on it and said the same thing, that they thought I was maybe 18-20 years old when I’m 26 (twenty six). I’m just now starting to think that maybe the reason for this behavior is because they think I’m the youngest there so that’s why they treat me this way but I’m not sure.

1iokcjs,Co worker raised their voice at me,"Hi all.

I have been working at my job for a while now and have made friends with a few coworkers (we actively hang out after work). 

I was recently promoted and occasionally need to ask for help. I asked my coworker/friend for help, which they said sure.

I was very stressed, since I was on a deadline for something, so this could explain why I was having trouble figuring something out. I explained what I did and my coworker proceeded to tell me what I was doing was wrong, the dates I were using were wrong, etc etc. I showed them that I was not wrong. They were saying this in a specific tone, like I was an idiot. 

I could tell they were frustrated helping me, almost annoyed, so I kept saying its fine, I will do it myself, thanks for the help but I will just figure it out, etc and then they raised their voice at me and then made a fist, like they were wanting to hit something or me.

They wouldn't walk away, so I sat there freaking out and they kept raising their voice at me. 

They apologize, but I don't feel comfortable around them anymore, especially not asking for help, and we work in a small office. What would you do in this situation? I don't want to speak to them anymore.

I have a specific area of expertise and experience and I’m not sure if this limits me from being able to work for another company doing the same job. 

Also to top it off, I asked for a raise because I took on extra job duties and my boss responded by telling me he highly recommends I look for a new job. Does this make the non compete even valid? And I already know he’s not someone I want to work for, so I already know what I need to do.

When I interviewed, I was told the position was free because the previous person wanted to move back to where they lived before. I even met this person at an industry event and all seemed ok. Turns out I’m the 5^(th) person in my role in 10 years; and the toxicity here is out of control! People are ostracized for being vocal about issues, something I have had numerous conversations with my boss about. There is always an excuse for why the ostracized behavior was acceptable in each situation. My boss keeps telling me to be vocal, because I was hired for my expertise and my knowledge is needed to help improve things. Well, I took my bosses advice and that had the reaction I feared. My colleagues have started to exclude me from projects I have a shared  
responsibility in and started gossiping about me. How do I know this? Because vendors and cross-functional partners are forwarding me the communications. So, I’ve talked to my boss, I’m documenting everything and sent the CYA email.

1iofkxe,"Stable IT job, good pay—but the boredom is driving me insane","I work in IT as a systems engineer and recently changed jobs after spending five years at a large corporation. I had something of a lead role there, and my input was valued. My team had a strong reputation, and we were given a lot of freedom—maybe even too much. At some point, we overwhelmed ourselves by pushing too much change too quickly. Eventually, some of my best colleagues left, the environment became increasingly toxic, and I decided it was time to move on.

Now, I’m working for a bank in a similar position, but the experience is vastly different. The legal processes and policies are restrictive, and I’m confined to one area without much visibility into the broader infrastructure. Initially, I was relieved—the workload was lighter, and for the first time in years, I haven’t had to work overtime. I work fully remote, and aside from a few meetings each day, there’s almost nothing to do. I spend most of my time reading documentation and studying for certifications—entirely by choice.

From what I’ve observed, my colleagues are in the same boat, though they’ve gotten good at masking it. My team lead reassured me that I’m actually doing more than most, which is baffling. Other departments seem to be in a similar state, and some employees are already considering leaving. The job pays well, and the company is stable. As a father of three, I get a lot more time with my family—often finishing work by 3 PM with no questions asked. But despite all of that, I feel completely useless. There’s no challenge, no sense of accomplishment, and no real goals to strive for.

Yesterday, a headhunter reached out on LinkedIn—something that happens regularly—but this time, the opportunity intrigued me. It’s a small, agile software company with big clients, and they’re offering a lead role after two years. It sounds far more engaging than what I’m doing now. The catch? The team is much younger (average age under 30), and the company has a high turnover rate of 2–3 years.

Logically, sticking with my current job makes the most sense for my family. I’ve changed jobs several times in the past, and I don’t want my resume to look like I’m constantly job-hopping. But at the same time, I feel like I’m compromising my work ethic just to fit into this organization’s culture. I don't know how long I can keep doing that. On the other hand, I’ve had jobs that burned me out, and I never want to go back to that.

1iof4nh,Issues with coworker,So... Recently I have had a issue for awhile with a coworker. I been at my job over 25 years. I'm the supposed manager. But honestly I feel it is just a title and really doesn't mean much there. But that's a different issue. Over a year ago this person started and I helped him adjust and eased him into the job. I was absolutely accommodating and stuck up for him and vouched for him. We were always friendly. Out of nowhere he decided to ignore me. And has been doing it for awhile. When I talk to him he just is very cold. While he is completely opposite with others. I have tried to be friendly. But now I have completely abandoned that. And will no longer acknowledge him. So when we work together it's awkward to say the least. I have asked the owner of I can give up my day working with him. But I was told no. but just last night I was walking towards a cooler as he was walking the opposite way. He clearly seen me and swung the door open hitting me. It was not hard or anything. But clearly intentional. I said whoa excuse me. And he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. Now I feel like this is going to escalate because I'm not letting this go. I have never done anything like that to him. But now. Now it's going to be a real issue. I know how I will get. So I guess my question is is there anything else I can do.

1ioepcn,Should I start looking for a new job or stay with my current company?,"I joined my current company as a trainee a few months ago. The training period lasts for one year, after which they may offer me a full-time position based on my performance.

However, there are a few things that concern me:
	•	Full-time employees here have a non-negotiable 90-day notice period, which feels too long. If I accept the offer, this could make switching jobs later more difficult.
	•	The salary isn’t great, and I’m unsure if it will be worth it in the long run.
	•	If I leave right after my training, future employers might see my short tenure as a red flag and question my reliability.
	•	On the other hand, I’ve seen layoffs and terminations happening around me. What if I decline the offer, join another company after my training, and get laid off within a few months? That could hurt my credibility even more.

I feel stuck between these choices and unsure about the best move for my career. Should I start looking for new opportunities now, or should I stay and take the risk?

1iodzng,Cybersecurity VS Finance,"– Which Path Offers the Best Long-Term Opportunity?

I’m 17 and currently in high school, taking dual enrollment classes in cybersecurity. By the time I graduate, I’ll have a career study certificate and the option to take the CompTIA Security+ and A+ certifications. I also have a strong passion for finance—I’ve been trading stocks since I was 13 and made a decent amount of money, especially during the GameStop/AMC era.

Right now, I’m torn between two career paths:
	1.	Cybersecurity Route – Attend a two-year community college using my existing credits, then transfer to a four-year university for IT. This would set me up for a cybersecurity career, which seems stable, high-paying, and in demand.
	2.	Finance Route – Go straight to a four-year university for finance, aiming to break into hedge fund management or private equity. I know this path is highly competitive, but the potential financial upside and influence are massive.

I’m very ambitious and want to build wealth while making a real impact in the world. My biggest questions:
	•	Which path has the best balance of financial upside and career stability?
	•	For those in cybersecurity, how easy is it to transition into finance later if I change my mind?
	•	For those in finance, would a cybersecurity background give me an edge in hedge funds, PE, or fintech?
	•	If you were in my position, what would you do and why?

I’d love to hear from people who’ve been in either industry. Any insights would be greatly appreciated 😄",Top-Phone-4524,1,1.0,0,1739432571,2025-02-13 07:42:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iodzng/cybersecurity_vs_finance/,2,2025
1iodyxz,Incoming promotion is a pay cut... what should I do? (moving from hourly to salary),"I work at a tech company as a project manager of sorts, and I've been fighting for a promotion for 2 years, and it seems I'm finally about it get it. I just learned from someone else that got the same promotion that it involves going from hourly to salary, which ended up being a pay cut due to the amount of OT he did (similar to the amount I do). This person just decided to cut back to a hard 40 hours, which seems to work for him. Problem for me is that I just took a new assignment across many timezones that will essentially demand OT. I also don't mind working late in the evenings I have available, I find myself much more productive with these large chunks of time than the normal 30-60 minutes I have between meetings. 

Basically I would need a 20% raise with this promotion just to make the same amount as the previous year. I learned this promotion normally only comes with a 10% increase. I don't imagine I'll be able to negotiate for a higher rate, because it seems they've gotten away with this with other people, and I imagine if they do it for me they'll feel there's a precedent that they'll have to go rectify with the others. 

Other piece of context, I'm remote and I just moved to a significantly more expensive area, partially because I was anticipating this promotion and a decent pay bump. 

  
So it seems my options are

1. Reject the promotion, remain hourly, and ask for a raise to the top of my pay band, which will be about a 7% raise. This would also come with me accepting my upward mobility at this company is essentially done (I'm not even sure they will accept this)

2. Go salary, go to a hard 40 hours, and risk my relationships with my new manager (for my new assignment) and losing the reputation I have of being a top performer, probably also sacrificing my upward mobility

3. Try to get another offer elsewhere and use it as leverage to get a higher pay rate

4. Argue for the additional raise on top of the promotion, to an undetermined amount of success (I'll probably be doing this anyway)

So my question is: am I missing anything? What would you do? Do I have any recourse? Is there any precedent out there that would help convince my company this is wrong and needs to be fixed? 

  
Thanks in advance folks",sauce_box_,2,0.7599999904632568,9,1739432476,2025-02-13 07:41:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iodyxz/incoming_promotion_is_a_pay_cut_what_should_i_do/,2,2025

1iodctv,HR was talking shit about me to in-office workers,"Deleting this later just in case. 

Our firm only has one HR person and the old HR person is aging out and is now only processing payroll every other week and is likely leaving the firm altogether this year. It took weeks of interviews to hire a new HR person and they only came onto the firm maybe 4-5 months ago. 

I work in accounting and my supervisor told me in writing to keep tax documents just in case but that we most likely wouldn't need them for whatever reason--I don't handle the taxes but I'm assuming maybe everything is digital or something. The in-office people handling the mail sent us emails for each client/vendor that mailed us a tax document and put it in a rubberband. I put these tax documents in the box where all of the old, already scanned checks are that would be shredded 3 months from now. 

Apparently, this new HR person came into the office and according to a co-worker freaked out about the tax documents being in the accounting box and was talking badly about me, specifically, to my co-workers. No idea what she said as I wasn't there.

Should I even tell my supervisor or should I just let it blow over? 

A lot of my co-workers don't like her and I wouldn't be suprised if the higher ups didn't like her either and this was the final straw to find a new HR person again. I feel like this was crazy unprofessional and weird because I'm just doing what my supervisor told me to do.

At the same time, I don't care for work drama. Sure, I'm only 25 but also I'm fucking 25. This isn't high school and if you're going to gossip about someone then it shouldn't be loudly or in front of 5 other co-workers about something so small as moving documents from one cabinet to another.

1iocwib,"5 months into job, still making stupid and basic mistakes in report revision","Hi everyone, for context i work as environmental scientist at a small consulting firm. I've been writing reports for project site visits for a while now but with these last batch of projects ive just been messing these reports a lot.

These reports are for the client to know what the expected scope of work is and what was observed on site. i messed up a lot of details, there are a pile of inconsistincies which when i look back at the report, I cant believe I missed. These were pointed out by the general manager who received the report after my project manager asked him to review it.

I cant help but feel as though my project manager is very disappointed in me especially since this is my 2nd time reviewing this specific report. The general manager had valid concerns, a lot of the mistakes are so stupid its actually embarassing that i sent this out. For example, in the table it says x is 80sqft but in the appendix it says the same thing is 90sqft. Additionally the report mentions plaster even though there was no plaster ( i thought i had removed mention of it from the entire report but i missed it). Part of me thinks I sent out an older version of the file, which in of itself is a problem!!!

It hasnt been partially busy so i shouldve taken my time reviewing it, but im just so embarassed by making so many silly mistakes i feel like it makes me look careless. 

How do i get better at reviewing mistakes and inconsistencies in reports? Im still in my probation period and want to keep my job 😭😭😭 i feel more awful because my pm is always so patient with me when hes hard on everyone else. I feel like i dont deserve it.

1iocv30,"Boss crossed a line, using my personal life against me","I am a manager, and have been having problems with my boss (our director).

Side note for some context, my wife and I are about to have our first baby. 

I have been unhappy at work over the last six months or so. I have been very upfront and transparent with my boss about this. Over the course of the six months, if there is an issue that is bothering me, I’ll bring it up to him. None of these issues I have had have been resolved, leading to more unhappiness. FWIW, I recently found out that this is not an isolated incident, and other team members are also having their issues go unresolved. 

We got on the topic of my general unhappiness the other day, and he said he felt like my unhappiness was due to our upcoming life change and the stress of having a baby. Truth is, that couldn’t be farther from the truth. I told him that us having a baby is the happiness I have needed and has kept me going. 

My thinking though.. how DARE he say that? How dare he bring up something so sacred to me that has nothing to do with work, and use that to try to get the target off his back? I’m unhappy because he has done nothing to try to make me happy at work and feel like I am a valued member of the team, and that my issues I have aren’t worth being resolved. 

I cannot work for this man who (in my opinion) is so disgusting to try to use this against me. My hang up though is that I really love the company I work for and am very passionate about what I do. I don’t want to leave my job, but also I do not even want to be around that scum.

I know I am a valuable asset to the company because our president has told me he believes my future involves continuing to climb up the leadership ladder, and that I am exactly the type of person he wants on his team. 

I am nervous about going to HR just out of fear of retaliation since I am about to be gone on paternity leave. Curious your thoughts on how to proceed.

1iocoex,Transitioning to office from retail. Constructive feedbacks pls!,"*this might be a long post pls dont mind me*

Hi everyone, I’ve been working in the retail industry since 16 years old. Im 26 this year. 

Unfortunately i do not hold any position as i job hop every 1-2 years to gain different kind of experience. One eg was working in a cat hotel and I got promoted to supervisor but only lasted there for 3-4 months after getting the role because the pay did not justify. 

I managed to get into 2 office jobs a few years back - telecom & customer service and now that i think back, the telecom sector would be a great start for me but i’m one that easily give up just bcos I don’t like the environment, resigned and went back to retail. Same shit for the customer service job. Went back to retail, the company im currently working at. 

I only have college certificate whereby a lot of companies might not take as it’s considered the lowest in my country. 

I also have other experiences, i helped out my brother in law wedding company and that’s where i found my niche. I would like to be somewhere in the event industry. 

I was able to pursue a part time diploma end of 2024 but had to deferred because there’s baby otw this year and would like to focus on my health, plus working retail and doing school was quite draining. 

Now im thinking to transition to office, again, probably somewhere in 2026 and would like to mentally prep myself super early. I’m looking at admin/receptionist for a start, what can i say or upsell myself? (Before moving to event industry) Considering i might continue taking my diploma within that year because i would like to upgrade myself. 

I wouldn’t want to be in retail anymore because i would like some flexibility for myself and my future family. 

But, my husband told me to either get the role in my current company and stay a bit longer or just be a normal retail associate. What i know and want is just flexibility bcos im getting tired in retail. Even tho the idea of getting a role is tempting, that part of me has died LOL. 

I would like to add, a few people around me told me that if I do want to be in the event industry I don’t need a certificate for it and more to experience. As much as there’s some truth, i want and need that diploma as a safety net.

1ioc0kg,Can you become an AI developer by self studying in 6 months?,"Hello,

Recently I've been thinking about taking a course to work as an AI Developer but I want to be 100% sure before diving into it, considering it will take (at least) a few months.

I do have basic web development (self-studying HTML, JS & React, not working) experience so with enough pracice I can pick up basic Python in a few months. Some details that might make a difference are that I'd be applying for remote work on USA and Europe-based companies, while being in South America. And second, a good amount of the Developers and Engineers I've seen in platforms like LikedIn are based in those places and/or have formal University education, in some cases extensive.

I've been wanting to make a career change from sales (already remote for US-based companies) but didn't want to dive into webdev anymore since it doesn't feel fulfulling nor very possible to get into considering how the job market looks from outside (mostly pros sharing their inside view of it).

The question is, can I learn enough in online courses like IBM's or Microsoft's on Coursera.com to get a well paid, future-proof junior level job from South America this same year?

then i went through some family issues and ended up having to move out on my own..and of course that comes with rent and a whole lot of other things.
i have now saved up enough to keep me by to go to school again, but i just can’t seem to pick something..
my absolute dream is to be a paramedic but i am very discouraged and worried that if i can’t even pass these classes i have no business going near a person who needs AID…. i’ve always kind of been a hands on learner tho, whereas the pre health course was just the theory of medial sciences and once i was successful in that i would’ve moved on to the paramedics course which is what i believe id do well in!
at this point though i just want to have enough money to travel and live life. i want some type of post secondary diploma under my arm and a job that pays decently that i wont have to suffer through. i’m really struggling with what to do here.. should i try the pre health course again but with a tutor this time ?:(
the paramedics course is very competitive here in canada and that’s why it’s really so discouraging.. if anyone has any advice whatsoever when it comes to picking a career path please help! i don’t want to settle for a job where i am not making any difference in the world or not helping anyone whatsoever.

1io9uux,Can I negotiate a 50k salary with no experience?,"Can I negotiate a 50k salary with no experience?

A little backstory: I’ve worked at my current job for 3 years. I moved from kennel tech to vet tech to lead vet tech in those years. I started out making $12/hr and now I make $17/hr. I have no educational background and only have my GED but I’m a hard worker, all my coworkers know this.


Recently applied for a Development Coordinator position at the same company and was offered it at 45k/year or $23/hr. I accepted. But now I’m wishing that I negotiated to $50k/yr because this job is going to be ALOT and very stressful and I think that would make me feel better about it, if I was making more money. 

Technically I already agreed to a 45k salary verbally but no contract was signed & no offer letter was sent out yet so I’m wondering if I can go back and ask for a negotiation before my pay is set in stone? Would this make me look bad? Should I just accept the 45k and move on?

_________________________________________

If you believe that I SHOULD go for it, could you please read and judge the negotiation email I’ve written to send to my manager: 

Hello {Manager}

First off I’d like to say thank you for extending an offer to me for the Development Coordinator role and giving me the ability to continue contributing to {Company} in a new capacity. Having worked here for the past three years, I have developed a deep passion for the shelter’s work and a strong commitment to the animals. 
As I transition into this new role, I am excited to take on the additional responsibilities and challenges it presents. However, after giving it lots of thoughtful consideration & doing some market research, I was wondering if it would be possible to revisit my offered salary before you finish drawing up the offer letter & before my pay is officially set in stone?
Given my three years of hands-on experience with the organization, along with my knowledge of the shelter's operations and my dedication to its success, I would be thrilled if you’d consider my request for a $50,000 annual salary.
While I recognize that I do not have prior experience/knowledge in development coordination, I believe my time spent at {Company} helps to demonstrate my ability to adapt and grow into this new role. Over the years, I have gained insights into our programs and operations, and I believe I can leverage this knowledge to excel in the new position.
I truly value the opportunity to advance my career with the development team and I am eager to make meaningful contributions to you all. I believe that this adjustment would better reflect the level of responsibility I will be taking on and the value I will bring to the organization.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am looking forward to working together to achieve many goals. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. 
Warmest regards,
{My Name}✨

1io9rvx,About to be Let go - What do you wish you had known before being terminated?,"Found out recently that my organization will be undergoing heavy layoffs over the next few weeks. I felt very fortunate for the heads up, but It was a pretty doom and gloom meeting in which it was suggested the vast majority of employees would be let go. It's unclear if I will be one of these employees but I am planning as if I will be one. My resume and LinkedIn are up to date and I'm starting the job search now (even if I'm one of the few they keep on board, I'm not sure I want to stick around for a dying company). Some things I'm curious about:

* Anything I should have prepared for when ""the talk"" comes?
* Other than prepping my resume and starting a job search what else should I be doing right now before I get let go?
* What are general expectations of severance (been with the company for \~3 years)
* Should I ask about severance or would that mark me for termination?

Generally, I'm just nervous and scared (single father) without any safety net. What other things do you wish you had known before you were fired or let go?

For those of you who have lost your job and quickly found a new one in the last \~6 months, what worked for you in the job search? what didn't work?",inkwell14,1,1.0,2,1739416720,2025-02-13 03:18:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io9rvx/about_to_be_let_go_what_do_you_wish_you_had_known/,2,2025
1io9bct,How to break the ice with boss,"My manager keeps a daunting distance. I don’t know how to break the ice and get to know each other better. 

I’m out of ideas trying to get him to trust me more and I’m tired of how boring our 1:1s have become. 
I want meaningful conversations with him because I think he’s awesome and I want to do better work and get a promotion. 

So I joined this new job a few weeks ago. Manager gives me a lot of autonomy. There’s very little in depth conversations going on. I feel like I’m looking for more collaboration with him. 

How do I go about that? 

More importantly, I think he’s awesome because from another coworker I found out that my manager used to be a professional musician. I think we have a lot in common and can be good buddies / friends somewhat. He’s close to a lot of other coworkers. 

Our team went to a dinner recently but my manager seemed very reserved. I tried talking to him. While he mostly responded nicely, he made zero effort on continuing the conversation. Every time, he just turns and leaves immediately to talk to someone else. 

Is it because he finds me repulsive or he’s naturally proud as a musician?

Help me out there. 

Signed, an introvert looking to do awesome work and looking to build better professional relationship with my manager.

1io8v11,I gave them an ultimatum and they came back to me with an offer,"I've been working at this company for 1.5 years now. They took a gamble on me at the beginning because I didn't have much experience but they saw the potential which is why they paid me an entry level wage. However, i've grown exponentially in this role to the point where i am extremely integrated. I carry the heavy responsibility of all of the creative intelligence of their products. Without me there is no product to sell and they will not make half or more of the revenue as they project next year. 

they give small increase raises every year, but not substantial enough to make a difference. I've asked multiple times to have a conversation about a raise but they have asked me to be patient and wait, while piling on more and more work with no additional compensation. My team consists of 2 people and  now the other person quit, so I am the sole stakeholder for their key revenue driver. I gave them an ultimatum basically saying I will not work more if I am not compensated and gave them a number that I believe I deserve for the work I am doing and what they have paid people in my position previously. I also gave them a timeline in which I want to see this happen because time and time again they tell me to be patient but nothing happens. I am willing to quit and have the funds to be unemployed, but i personally would rather not do that. 

  
clearly they know my value because they came back to me with 2 offers. first offer is to do the job i am right now and they will hire someone else but the pay is significantly less than what I proposed. second offer is close to what i proposed but i will also have to take on the work of the person who left but i will get additional help. they told me they cannot give me the raise until 2 months later but i will still be doing the work of 2 people until then. 

i'm leaning more towards the higher offer because i'm going to have to do the work regardless and if i take the lower number it will take me years to get where i want to be. however i'm kinda confused about what to do about waiting for the pay. they could just hire someone behind my back and then fire me, but then again it takes a lot of money to hire and fire someone especially since i have grown so much in the role and i know exactly how the company works.  At the same time, it's weird for them to say that they can't pay me until 2 months later especially when im doing the work now. What should i do?

1io8t3f,Leaving my current job off of my resume?,"Okay, its not like i'm in that toxic a job and they're not doing anything illegal. I have been stuck in a job about the last year that really is not a good fit for where I want my career path to grow, and I'm starting to feel like its making my current pivot a lot more difficult when I put it on my resume (I know job market, tech layoffs and other external factors are contributors as well, but that's not an issue I can personally solve at this time), I like trying on a lot of different hats and right I'm a elementary teacher right with a provisional license. Found out I really don't enjoy it and have been trying to pivot since about Oct but coming up empty. 

There are a variety of factors that led me to my current position, and not having a clear path on my resume is probably one of my bigger hurdles at the moment in beating through the ATS/HR/Hiring manager gate, but you might be able to find others. tried posting to r/resumes with a copy a while back and all I got was crickets, so if you want to take a gander and see for yourself I would be more than grateful. **It feels like I'm in a catch-22: taking my current job off my resume leaves a year long gap since my graduation, and leaving it on doesn't add benefit to aligning my resume to the positions I'm applying for (see questions below for more specifics on the positions). Wondering what would be the best method for me to deal with my current position on my resume?** I mean I'm also trying to solve the big life/career questions (what should I do, where do i fit in career wise, next steps etc.) but those are optional questions I'm in search of advice for. Main question is in bold, second question is not. There will be a refined bullet list on the bottom with all my questions better worded if you cant to scroll down. 

\*\*\**feel free to read a little about my background if you want. It's borderline word vomit, but might give you some more context on my predicament if you're interested in helping me workshop my second more open ended question in this post. I'm always interested in hearing other ideas/directions if you have something, or if you're interested in more specifics I can happily answer, but you can skip to my main questions if I'm already starting to lose you*\*\*\*

I departed from my last relevant capitalist position in 2022 and I decided to finish my degree (BS in anthropology.. ya I know it's not really an ""in demand"" major and some people might think its actually BS, but I only had a year left and I like exploring how people and communities work, so fuck me right haha). 

I have 10 years experience managing state-wide promotional projects as an LLC contractor, 3 years working customer experience and inbound sales for an eCom company during the pandemic (survival job my LLC's contracts weren't renewed), was just hired on as a marketing manager intern that was supposed to convert to full time then the companies niche cratered post-pandemic 2022 so the offer was never extended. While I in the MM position-ship i did a very provocative needs analysis for the company, and found out from some people I knew after I left it contributed to a restructuring of the orgs marketing strategy and organization. 

\*\*I would not say marketing is a particular field i thrive in, I loath social media (except reddit I guess) but i'm pretty good at figuring out how a project should get done, and finding the right people to make it happen... I also like asking questions and solving problems \*\*

They offered to transfer me back to my old position, but it had been destroying my mental health, and I decided to quit because I had pretty great savings and it was a bucket list goal of mine to finish my degree.  

Went back to school, and got my last couple credits by joining a research lab in summer 2023 as a paid field research assistant and helped coordinate and execute data collection strategies and population recruiting for an international project in the Oceania and East Asia. Got to travel and meet new people and really see the research process from the academic side, but had to come back to reality at some point i guess. 

Got back home and was a bit conflicted on going onto postgrad education to academic research, or get a job. figured it would be smart to have a more refined skill niche, but i'm an opportunist and I tried to do both and see which would manifest better options. Got a couple interviews in 23'-24' for project coordinator/manager positions, and customer experience roles, but didn't make it far or I got ghosted after a couple rounds (I know my job interview skills could use refinement, and I have been working on it. I've found I'm better at asking questions than answering them in a job environment).

 It was getting to the end of 23' and I figured I needed to get money coming in, so i friend suggested I look into teaching while I waited to hear back from my grad school apps. Seemed like a decent idea to get some classroom experience if I wanted to get TA funding for grad school, so I went with it. Grabbed a temp license and found a job surprisingly quick. I got accepted into a couple grad programs I applied to, but the funding package was not as promised (the only thing dumber then going for a social science post grad is to pay out of pocket/take loans for one is what my PI told me) so i didn't go. Really shook me to be honest. 

A couple months of self-doubt/depression, and a therapist later, I'm here in 2025. I'm still on the fence between immediate career path and academia (less reactionary and more methodical in my approach I might add, I don't want to end up with the same outcomes as I did with my Bachelors), but I find I am getting way less interview invitations than last year and I'm trying to design a solution. I am upskilling to make myself more competitive (going for a PMI certification, and looking into others to refine my career path better since i'm not in school currently), but I also have noticed a sharp drop in application responses when i started adding my teaching position to my resume. I'm wondering if since i started adding that on I became unacceptably unfocused (even though I already look pretty unfocused before I took the job) to hiring teams, is the job market really that bad, or is there something else I'm missing? It's gotten to the point that i'm having my therapist read through my resume I'm at such a loss, and that brings me here infodumping on a bunch of strangers to try and get answers. 

  
\*\*\*\* End of Word Vomit \*\*\*\*

  
**Specific Questions That Can Probably be Answered Without Reading the Word Vomit**

1. Should I take out my teaching position/ current job off my resume as I keep applying? I'm looking for more project manager/coordinator roles and market research type positions for full time work. 
2. I'm also looking into certifications that could potentially make me more competitive for these positions, and was wondering if anyone had suggestions on others I should look at that would aid the job search (already looking at Agile, Tableau, Qualtrics (I already have experience from coursework and evaluation analysis during my internship, but might look better to have something official)), Atlassian or some other PM software (I mostly used Wrike during my Marketing manager internship) but that also don't cost a semester at a university to snag, 

I am definitely looking for help on the other broader career advice questions, and if you want to take a stab at them I'm all ears. If you had recommendations for career advisors/mentors or resources for someone in my position that aren't ""guru's"" or snakeoil salesmen I would be eternally grateful as well. I've taken every career test and have spent way to much time analyzing alternatives that some sage advice in any form would be appreciated.

1io7d2n,I can't find a Purpose,"I'm a recent graduate who majored in Finance and International Business but was pursuing the pre-med track. When I began college, I wanted to be a doctor but I was worried I'd end up pigeon-holed into a biology degree that I wouldn't know what to do with if I wasn't accepted. So I studied Finance as a backup because my parents were business professionals and they encouraged the field. So I went my 4 years of college without a business internship or anything. Instead, I spent my summers studying abroad, shadowing doctors, and preparing for the MCAT. After graduation, I took a gap year to gain more medical experience while applying to medical school yet during this gap year I slowly realized I lacked the passion and mental strength for medicine to commit to it for the rest of my life. I just don't live and breathe it like others do. Every job I worked made me realize that while I love people, I can't stand to see them in pain and be the one they look to for help. The stress is entirely unhealthy for me and genuinely had those close to me concerned. Because of this and despite being accepted into medical school, I've decided not to pursue it. Now, as I look at jobs in Finance I realize I can't secure typical analyst roles that my friends have as I lack the internship experience. The same goes for Law School and MBA programs. I simply lack the experience and appropriate referrers. My grades are fine, I had a 3.8 Overall, a 3.9 Business, and a 3.6 Science. I also scored well on the MCAT, particularly on the critical analysis section. But none of that hard work seems to matter anymore.

I know that I want to go back to school and pursue a graduate degree but in order to do so I need experience in either law or business. Yet because of said lack of experience, I'm struggling to get these positions. It all feels like a catch-22. I just feel very lost right now and I don't know what direction to pursue with my career. Everyone around me (family and friends) says that I'm going about this the right way, trying different things, and figuring out what my purpose is but it just doesn't FEEL right. I want to KNOW. I want to be where my friends are, working a 9-5, making money, and living my life.

I would love any advice from others on what positions to seek given my background or how best to approach the next phase of my life from those who have found their purposes (or even fellow seekers like me).

1io78d9,pip and grief,"
Hi everyone - I had two devastating personal losses Q4 of last year. I took a week off for the first loss, nothing was offered or available for the second. This year has understandably been difficult and I have tried to be transparent with my manager. I broke down last week to my director and said how I was struggling with my manager piling up my workload and dealing with affairs for one of the losses. This week my director and head of the company pulled me for a meeting to put me on a PIP due to poor performance last week. (3 months following first loss, 1 month from second). The terms were rather vague and harsh - two weeks to perform at my peak or go on leave with no guarantee of a job or go on leave next week with no guarantee of job. They made sure to tell me yes, I have been through a lot, but others have had it worse. They came back the next day and apologized saying that was harsh and would work to establish more fair terms.

1io70t7,PIP and Grief,"Hi everyone - I had two devastating personal losses Q4 of last year. I took a week off for the first loss, nothing was offered or available for the second. This year has understandably been difficult and I have tried to be transparent with my manager. I broke down last week to my director and said how I was struggling with my manager piling up my workload and dealing with affairs for one of the losses. This week my director and head of the company pulled me for a meeting to put me on a PIP due to poor performance last week. (3 months following first loss, 1 month from second). The terms were rather vague and harsh - two weeks to perform at my peak or go on leave with no guarantee of a job or go on leave next week with no guarantee of job. They made sure to tell me yes, I have been through a lot, but others have had it worse. They came back the next day and apologized saying that was harsh and would work to establish more fair terms. On a personal level, I feel it’s best to take the time to heal from the loss and find something better suited for me. I guess my question is - is this Callous? Crazy?

However, it seems I am being selected for travel to other locations. And seemingly very soon (2-3 weeks)

I suffer from a panic disorder that doesn't impair my ability to work normally thankfully so i do not like to consider myself disabled. But travel is going to be a major agitator. 

Because travel was not in the job description I did not disclose because there are no issues with the work I do.

Do I just tell my supervisor now? I really can't afford to lose this job so soon after taking it up after leaving another.

1io6gv4,Career options,"To make a really long story short I am a prior Journeyman lineman who had a baby last year and decided I was tired of the constant call outs and travel. I made a career move to a system operator for a local CO- OP and took a huge pay cut.

As a lineman I made around 103k a year

As a system operator I make about 80k a year

Anyways I absolutely hate my schedule the schedule I was hired in on I didn’t mind but they recently changed it and I hate it. The schedule changed weekly and all my time off requests get declined unless I can get someone to swap shifts or cover it. Long term in 5 years I’ll be back at that 100k range and my insurance is free and we have opportunities for a 5-10% bonus yearly. Just hate my schedule.

I’ve been studying for a NERC RC cert and go test in two weeks, I have a conditional offer as long as I pass the jobs mine.

Starting pay is 120k a year with average COL raise of 4-6% a year and a yearly bonus of 20k
Has the best retirement plan out of my options 


Or I have a opportunity to go back to being a lineman/ Troubleman which starting pay would be 112k year with no on call and no weekends just storms or having to stay over to catch calls
It has opportunity for 2-5% COL raises and 5-10% bonus

Or something I’ve really been wanting to get into just can’t get over the pay is I have an opportunity with a fire department locally that I would love to go to .

Pay after recruit school is 56k with a 5% lay bump after 6 months of recruit school for FAO cert and a 10% pay increase for paramedic license which will take about a year after recruit school then they do yearly COL raises as well. Was told once I had my paramedic cert (so about 2 1/2 years in) I’d be around 70-75k and at 3 year mark could test for sgt and puts me at about 85k anyways it has the best benefits out of all options and has been something I’ve always been interested just always let the money sway my mind.

1io5oyi,How badly did I mess up with this new internal job?,"Hi,

I work for a large company and recently applied for a new position internally. I interviewed for this position and it went well. I was aware that I was supposed to inform my current manager that I was interviewing for a new position. It did state that in writing.

I was going to tell my my manager, but I honestly was afraid how I would be treated potentially if I did not get the other position. So I decided I would not say anything unless I got an offer.

Well, they are preparing me an offer and they sent an email to my manager. He was very caught off guard (rightfully so). I guess I am just wondering how to make things right.. I don't want to leave on a bad note.

Also another concern: do you think my current manager will tell my new manager that I did not inform them that I was interviewing for the position? I am afraid It will make me look bad to my new manager? Is that a valid concern or am I just worrying too much?",_realityTVtrash_,1,0.6700000166893005,13,1739404619,2025-02-12 23:56:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io5oyi/how_badly_did_i_mess_up_with_this_new_internal_job/,2,2025
1io5jgx,WFH job in jeopardy because of ActivTrak,"Posting using an old throwaway so this isn't linked to my main.

I work for a midsize (1300+ employees) company that sells things. My position is 100% WFH with 0 expectation to be in-office, ever. My department handles internal customer service requests for our sales people. On average, I answer about 90 emails a day from a shared inbox. Over the last 5 years I've been in this position, I have taken on several projects to streamline our work flow, automate some processes, and have implemented ideas to make our department more efficient. I have created numerous SOPs and maintain our department's training materials.

Last week during my weekly one-on-one with my manager, she mentioned that ActivTrak shows that I am in the bottom rank for time spent actively working. It shows I work, on average, 6.5 hours a day. The other members on my team sometimes work over 9 hours per day. My manager said there is nothing wrong with the amount of work I'm doing; I outpace my peers in resolving items, I take on extra-difficult tasks that no one else can resolve, and I'm the go-to person for handling entire departments' requests. She said that despite my good work, it looks like I'm not doing enough because of what ActivTrak shows.

The thing is, I'm pretty woefully underpaid for the type of work I'm doing and the amount of work I'm doing. I live in a HCOL area, and my salary is about 75% of what I could make if I found a similar job in my area. I only make up 30% of my family's household income, but we still need my salary to get by. I continually reply for other jobs, but I don't have a Bachelor's degree, so that makes me a less attractive candidate. I am working on completing my Bachelor's degree in a related field, and should be finished by 2027. But in the meantime, I need this job to get by.

When we were told last year that they were installing ActivTrak on everyone's machines, I was vocally opposed to it. I fundamentally believe that output should be measured by what we accomplish, not how often our mouses move. Especially with salaried, knowledge-based positions. Obviously, I don't have a lot of authority to make decisions for the entire company, and they went along with the ActiveTrak thing anyway. It just sucks to know that my efforts are being diminished by the amount of time my butt is in my seat.

I told my manager I would work on getting my ActivTrak hours up, but in truth, I'm pissed that this is even a conversation. I feel like I am putting in more effort than what I'm being paid for, and now I'm being asked to do even more. I'm always available when someone calls or pings me out of the blue. I'm an active participant in meetings, and I even answer emails on my phone after-hours in emergencies. How can I make it look like I'm more active on my computer, without actually doing more work?",Internal_Cap_268,11,0.7200000286102295,47,1739404181,2025-02-12 23:49:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io5jgx/wfh_job_in_jeopardy_because_of_activtrak/,2,2025

1io4vhf,How to address a toxic work dynamic with my manager without getting emotional or defensive?,"I have a meeting with my manager tomorrow to address some concerns I have about our working relationship. Lately, I’ve felt like they want me to fail, don’t have my back, and aren’t supporting me. It's affected my confidence and I want to bring it up constructively.

Some specific issues:

* They’ve made comments about my attitude, but the reality is that I’m just more subdued and not outwardly expressive. They’ve acknowledged they have no issues with my work ethic, but are concerned about how fulfilled I am - which I see as a way of getting me to admit I don't enjoy my job to then use against me.
* They recently hear a comment I made out of context, assumed the worst without verifying it, and confronted me about it. I have since found the comment on Teams and want to address it with them as its so far from the truth. In a small team where these things spread and can impact perceptions, this kind of thing can damage my reputation. BTW after I told them it was out of context (before I found the exact comment, they made no effort to walk back their statement)
* I feel like they don’t support me and are waiting for me to make mistakes instead of helping me grow, which is making me hesitant and second-guess myself. I feel this runs counter to his desire for me to be more pro-active, confident and willing to take ownership of things.

I want this to be a professional, collaborative conversation rather than an emotional or accusatory one. How do I approach this in a way that keeps the conversation productive? How do I stay calm and avoid getting defensive if they push back? Any advice on framing things in a way that encourages a better working relationship rather than escalating tensions?

Can provide more context if needed but I didn't want to make the post overly long. 

Would love to hear from anyone who has had to navigate a difficult conversation like this with a manager. Thanks in advance!",roryb1313,1,1.0,0,1739402348,2025-02-12 23:19:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io4vhf/how_to_address_a_toxic_work_dynamic_with_my/,2,2025
1io4gyn,I’m Thinking Of Quitting Today - No Job Lined Up Though,"Hey everyone, I’ve written about my situation before on here about 2 months ago (please look at my post history for details) and I think I’ve about had it. It’s honestly really difficult to even motivate myself to work anymore. My last straw now is that my boss’s boss is refusing to reimburse me for traveling to the office for in-person work that couldn’t be done remotely - I am a remote worker. It was about a 2 hour and a half commute and was expected to work a full working day (8-9 hours). I didn’t have a place to stay and had to get a motel. I had to stay 2 nights. I tried getting reimbursed, but he’s refusing to accept despite bringing up that reimbursement is in the company’s handbook. 

I tried ringing in HR and they told me I should speak with him… I know I can fight this further since I am in a reimbursement state here in the US. But I’m honestly just done. I hate this place, I have no support anywhere here, but I don’t have a job lined up. I’ve been applying but haven’t gotten a bite yet. I’m trying my best to soldier on, but this is getting demoralizing and it’s been getting harder to sleep. Especially since I’m expected to go in-person again to get more work done. Should I just quit?

The funniest thing is that both of us are going to SF, California, for our next internship, so we literally have nothing to do. We are bored out of our minds.

1io48vs,Should I tell my boss I'm leaving?,"I know the general consensus is no, absolutely not. However, I believe my case may be a bit different.

  
I (18F) work for a small family owned toy business in Australia. There's maybe 15 people working here total. My boss owns 3 different sub-companies, and I do most of the admin and customer service work for the biggest one. Recently I've decided to pursue other opportunities.

  
My dream career is in healthcare (paramedic specifically) and I have interviews scheduled at 2 different hospitals to do casual admin work there. Even if I don't get either job, I'm still planning to leave this one as I start Uni soon and need the flexibility (this job is full time). Obviously, working in a hospital would be incredible for me.

  
I want to tell my boss because they really gave me a chance here. I was hired fresh out of high school with not much experience at all, but they took the time to train me and it's because of that I have the skills I need to work elsewhere.

  
Leaving with short notice would really screw not only my boss over, but also my coworker as well. She does a lot of work for the other two companies, and me leaving would push all my work onto her, when she's already pretty overworked. I don't want to leave before they find someone to take over for me.

  
My boss is super nice and I really doubt they'd fire me for leaving, especially since they kind of need me. I have no hard feelings towards any of them and I want to help as much as I can. This isn't a million dollar business that can recover easily, they're very small.

I got this current customer service job out of mostly pure luck fresh out of high school, and it's absolutely skyrocketed my credibility, experience and professional development. My boss is super nice and very understanding. I'm asking because I think just putting in a 2 week notice after waiting for an offer would blindside them a lot. I do a lot here and it would take quite a bit to find someone to replace me, so I'm wondering in this specific circumstance it might be better to let them know before I have an offer in hand.

  
Generally I would wait, and planned to originally. But I've realised that leaving with shorter notice would also screw over my coworker completely.

I recently moved jobs to another pharma firm . The one i worked for was very organised , the culture was great and there was good learning. I moved because i got passed on for a promotion , my reporting changed from finance director to a senior accountant. The lady i was put under didnt have half the information I did. She was just 2 years into the company where as I was 6. The reason she was chosen can be that I am just 31 and she was 43. It was not just that my reporting changed, she was difficult and there were no prospects for me in near future in terms of money or position for atleast next 3 years

Anyway, long story short I made a jump for 30% hike and better bonus for the same title. I wanted to stick to same industry since perks are good.

I joined 3 months back and I have been hating it ever since. The work is so disorganised. There is no pure accounting or system in place. Its just expenses and approvals with paper work.

1io34o4,I am about to give up on a promising career.,"Hello everyone.

I really need to take thin off my chest. So buckle up.

I started sudying computer science in 2019. I got into a good uni from my country.
I did it cause math and coding were one of my favorite subjects in school. 
It was a decision that surprised everyone. I was never the kind of person that fits the “IT  guy” description. I was a very outgoing and talkative child. Apart from video games ocasionally,  I never enjoyed spending my time in front of a screen or solving puzzles.
All my collegues assumed Law or political sciences would have been a better choice.

Once I started college I was determined to get ahead of all my peers and I haven’t looked back for a second. I worked my ass off to become a better developer. I did it mainly out of pure ambition, to feed my ego.
I thiked all the boxes. A part time from the 2nd year, a Master’s at a very prestigious european university, a full time job abroad right after that, at a big company. (worked there for almost 2 years now)

But I am not in a good place right now. I feel homesick and I want to return to my country. I feel I am wasting my precious youth living abroad, far from my friends and family.
A couple of years ago there were great opportunities in my country. The IT sector was thriving and so many companies were coming. After 2023 however the situation changed completely. There’s no need to discuss the reasons for it here, but so you can get an idea I’ll tell you this. I’ve applied for the last 2 months for probably more than 100 jobs and I only managed to get an online assesment. In contrast, I applied to Google for a position abroad and the recruiter contacted me right away.

Even if I find a job, I feel I can’t be in this field forever. The more time passes, the less I enjoy it. The bigger the company, the heavier is the feeling that what I do is useless for everyone except some big corporations that make more money using the product I develop. + A.I. will eventually take my job.
I already told my manager I want to leave in a couple of months. This week I am supposed to hand in the resignation letter. In 2 months I am supposed to let my landlord know if I’ll extend my stay.

I have a backup plan A. Go into pilot school.
And a plan B, going to law school. My mom will support me whatever I choose. She can afford to help me and I am grateful for that.

Thanks if you managed to read everything. What do you think? Am I overreacting? Did anyone gave up on a promising career to pursue something else?

1io23xm,Is a Master's in Finance & Economics Worth It for Maximizing Income?,"Hey everyone,

I'm considering pursuing a master's in finance and economics but wanted to get some input before committing. My main goal is money.  I don’t care much about what I do, as long as I can earn as much as possible while working in an office or, preferably, from home.

A bit about me:

* **23M**
* **Current role:** Senior Payroll Specialist at a big firm, managing payroll for over 20k employees
* **Experience:** 3 years in payroll (2 years as senior, 1 year as junior)
* **Education:** Bachelor's in Criminology + 9-month CIPP Advanced Payroll Technician course

I’m trying to figure out if a Master’s in Finance & Economics would be a good move for my goal or if there are better alternatives. I’m open to anything that leads to high-paying remote or office-based jobs—whether that’s staying in payroll, moving into fintech, quant finance, consulting, or something else entirely.

Would this degree open up significantly better opportunities, or would I be better off going another route (e.g., CFA, tech, accounting, etc.)? Anyone who’s gone down a similar path—what would you recommend?

1io1f2t,Glitched out,"I am an executive in corporate America and just had a call with a client and a peer. I was uncomfortable with the complicated message that we had to share with the client, and stumbled over my words. My “peer” on the call is someone who I have to work with but has shown is out to take me down as we have competed for roles in the past. I was fearful of communicating the wrong message to the client and this individual would try and reach out to my senior leader to complain about me, so this made me second guess every word I said.

1io0p56,Thinking about making a change,"For years, I've worked in manual labor jobs, bouncing between various roles like a hotel maintenance assistant, janitor, laundry attendant, cook, and dishwasher. Most of my experience has been hands-on, doing jobs that involve fixing things, cleaning up, or helping out in some way. It's what I know. It's what I've been good at. And for a long time, I never thought much about stepping outside of this world.

But lately, I’ve been grappling with the idea of changing careers, particularly into tech. It's been a conflict brewing inside me. I’ve always viewed technology as more of a hobby—something I enjoyed tinkering with on the side. But now I’m starting to see that maybe this field is where I should head if I want to build a future, grow my wealth, and get out of this cycle of just making ends meet.

The problem? My current pay. I make $11.08 an hour. For someone who’s worked in manual labor jobs for years, that's a tough pill to swallow when I start thinking about long-term goals like buying a house, paying off debt, or just securing a better life for myself. I’ve been stuck in a rut, not because I’m not working hard, but because my pay just isn't going to get me where I want to go.

And then there’s the looming question: Should I really change careers? The tech field feels so different from what I’ve known. I’ve worked hands-on with technology—fixing old systems, modding devices, tinkering with video game consoles. But the idea of going into something like full-stack development or automation seems like a huge jump. It's almost intimidating. There's the learning curve, the uncertainty, the fear of failure.

At the same time, I know I can't ignore the fact that tech is a growing industry with higher salaries, more job security, and opportunities that I simply can’t get in the manual labor world. Cloud development, automation, and AI are all major players in today’s job market. So why shouldn’t I dive in? The problem is, I've always considered tech as a hobby, and I’m not sure if it’s really something I can turn into a full-time career. Will I be good enough? Can I learn the skills I need to succeed?

And then there’s the matter of being sociable or outgoing, something that I struggle with. In manual labor, I’ve mostly been able to stay in the background, working quietly and getting the job done without needing to interact with people too much. But in tech, I hear that networking, working with teams, and being social can help you advance. I’m just not sure I have that in me.

But I can't ignore the fact that tech jobs are some of the highest-paying jobs out there, and they offer benefits like remote work, flexible hours, and job stability. And the truth is, my current job, while steady, is replaceable. Automation is already creeping into fields like custodial work, and robots are slowly taking over tasks I used to do. So, if I don’t start thinking about the future, I might find myself in a position where I have no job at all, let alone the wealth I need to secure my future.

It’s a tough decision. Part of me feels like I'm giving up on something I've known for years, but another part of me knows this could be the stepping stone I need to escape the cycle I'm in. Maybe it’s time to take that leap and pursue something that can give me the financial stability and job security I’m looking for.

But I’m still torn. Can I really make it in tech? Would I be happy doing it? Is it too late for me to shift gears?

For now, I’m exploring the possibility. I’ve started looking at certifications and programs that could help me learn the ropes, like the IBM Full Stack Cloud Developer certification. It’s an online course that could give me the skills I need to start working in cloud development and automation. But is that really the right move for me?

I’d love to hear from anyone who's made a similar shift. How did you overcome the fear and doubt of changing careers? Was it worth it? Would you recommend it? Because right now, I’m at a crossroads, and I need to figure out if this leap into tech is the right choice for me.",Individual_Sun1935,2,1.0,2,1739391704,2025-02-12 20:21:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io0p56/thinking_about_making_a_change/,2,2025
1io0hn4,Coworker Keeps Deleting My Work and Taking Credit for It,"I’ve been dealing with a really frustrating situation at work, and I don’t know what to do next. My coworker has been deleting my work and redoing it under her name. I first noticed this when I saw that some entries I had made in our accounting software were missing, and when I asked her about it, she made a weak excuse. I reported it to my supervisor and manager, and they were angry because they had checked my work before and confirmed she deleted it. They said they’d keep an eye on her, and my supervisor planned to talk to her without mentioning my name.

However, I don’t feel like that’s enough because I don’t trust her anymore. She has also:
1️⃣ Once stopped me from reporting a mistake to our supervisor, saying we should “check first.” A minute later, she sent the exact message I was about to send, making it seem like she found the issue.
2️⃣ Tried to convince me that transactions I had already marked in an Excel file were missing when they weren’t, making me second-guess my work.
3️⃣ Responded to an email from our manager in a way that made it seem like I and another coworker ignored a task, when in reality, she had already done it and forgot.

On top of all this, she has a habit of lying about random things unrelated to work, which makes her even less trustworthy. She also keeps making comments about how she “should be a senior accountant” but is only a junior because the company is small. It feels like she’s trying to position herself for a promotion at any cost, even if it means taking credit for others’ work.

Additionally, for the past two weeks, I’ve been doing all the bookkeeping work and reconciliations while she takes forever on simple tasks. We have a daily reconciliation task that takes 20 minutes, but she drags it out for hours on purpose while I do everything else. She also talks loudly on the phone (just the two of us in the office) and leaves early on Fridays, they let her go because she has a doctor’s appointment she must  go, but I’ve overheard her on the phone saying that she’s going for a laser appointment or going straight home to clean after doctor, how is that even fair to others when she's not even sick what she has.

It’s especially frustrating because she gets paid more than me, even though she has stated in her interview that she has only one year of experience.

This feels like intentional sabotage, and I can’t go to work feeling anxious every day, wondering what she’ll change or erase next. I like my job, but I believe what she did is unforgivable. The CFO told me that he will keep her under his watch and our supervisor said she will speak to her, but is this enough? I can't just go to work and pretend like nothing happened. I only told the CFO and supervisor about the first 3 points, not the rest.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? Is it fair to just let her get away with just a talk? We're not in school anymore",Environmental_Lie541,50,0.8999999761581421,75,1739391178,2025-02-12 20:12:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1io0hn4/coworker_keeps_deleting_my_work_and_taking_credit/,2,2025
1inztex,"RN - mid-40's, considering career change","I welcome any and all advice. I've been working various jobs as a nurse for over a decade. Over the last two years, I've experienced a worsening health issue that means I cannot easily lift, twist, bend, etc. Working a shift usually leads to me being bedridden the next day. I am working in a low-paying job that I'm not passionate about, but mostly works around these issues. I will likely never be able to do a job that requires me to participate in patient transfers, etc. ever again. I loved my work in the ER, but physically that is an impossibility for me now.

I will likely be getting two separate spinal surgeries over the course of this year. I won't be able to work for at least 6 months. During that time, I'd like to do something to either benefit my current career (possibly get certifications enabling me to do clinical documentation work or the like), or something totally different (considering project management certification). Ideally in the future, I'd like a job where I can work remotely. I'm very structured, dependable and organized. I think it would kill my soul to become involved in the mess that is the US privatized health insurance disaster, so that's probably out.

1inz52e,"After 8 years part time contractor, I'm applying for a full time salary from $100k -> $150k. Too high? Too low? Anything missing?","Hi, I'm a software developer working remotely on the west coast (OR) with an agency all over the US (owner is east coast). The agency has 15-30 employees, most are contractors/freelancers except a few salary people in the management positions. I'm not sure the exact number since I only work with part of the team.

The problem with my current position is that my workload fluctuates. Last year I had **about 3 months with no work** and ended the year **over-booked** and projects were late. Because of the downtime at the agency, I fill in the blanks by doing work on the side. When I get work at the agency again, sometimes it conflicts with the side work I took on, hence easily becoming over-booked (and burnt out!!).

So I casually mentioned to the owner that if I had a full time salary I would basically be able to quit all of those side projects and focus on the business. The owner was **noticeably excited** about this, perhaps because of the conflicting schedule causing problems lately, and they requested I send them a proposal by the end of the month.

**(The new position)**

My previous role was simply a developer, being provided with a list of tasks, without having to do too much communication or management of my own.

The owner explained in addition to a full time salary, they would like me to take on **additional management responsibilities**. Basically to be involved in the project planning process, more specifically to work between the existing project managers and existing developers and bridge the gap. I would break down projects and identify what software and API is needed, create mockups and workflow diagrams, and design the infrastructure for websites and other apps. They would also like me to delegate tasks to other developers, though I'm unsure if that means I'll become a full project manager or if it will just be for a specific set of tasks.

**(Old position rates, slightly adjusted for anonymity)**

My hourly rate as a freelancer: \~$75/hr

Average hours logged per week at the agency: \~22 (part time)

My total income for the agency last year: \~$80,000

My total income including side projects last year: \~$100,000

**(New salary)**

Hours per week: 30 (+9 vs last year, almost **50% increase**, I'm considering this full time though it is NOT 40 hours)

Desired Salary: $150,000 (almost **50% increase** here too)

Benefits Requested:

* Health Insurance: \~$6500 (if they don't include health insurance, add this to the salary. Should I specifically include or exclude this, or leave it as optional? Maybe it helps to be precise.)
* Paid Time Off: 4 Weeks (@ 30 hr/week = 120 hrs)
* Overtime, holiday pay, bonuses, retirement: None

Concerns:

* Rate does not reflect new responsibility: My proposal is to work almost 50% more hours per week for almost 50% more income than last year. However, the owner wants me to have additional management type of responsibilities. I don't know the value of these skills, especially when combined.
* Additional Hours: I also need to provide availability in mornings, evenings, or weekends, in special situations. I'm not sure how to account for that. For example some businesses need to launch a website on Saturday for whatever reason. I have even launched websites at 1-3am in the past, but that's rare.
* What should my title be? We currently don't have ""senior/lead developers"" at the company. All of the developers are ""kind of"" equal. Currently considering titles like: Technical lead, Technical manager, or maybe I should just go for Lead developer or Senior developer?
* What sort of start date should I include? It doesn't really matter to me and I'm tempted to just put ASAP. But it might make sense to put 1-2 months to finish existing projects first.

**(Conclusion)**

I feel like the new salary I will be proposing is too low for the new responsibilities. At the same time, I feel it's too high compared to my previous role. I thought $100k last year was pretty good, is $150k being greedy?

I know the agency made >$1M in profit in one year (several years ago) but I have no real insight as to what the current profit is, if that number was before or after payroll, and I have no idea what other employees are getting paid. Except once by accident I found another developer charges $65/hr which is lower than my developer rate, but the developer was also newer and less experienced.

The last thing I can add is that the owner owns several businesses that work together, and this is just one branch of those businesses. But my new position is sort of in-between these business and I will be working with more than one team.

I was hoping someone could give me some more insight or suggestions. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks!",dimatuo,0,0.5,1,1739387888,2025-02-12 19:18:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1inz52e/after_8_years_part_time_contractor_im_applying/,2,2025

1inyyh3,Stuck waiting to hear about a promotion,"A recent promotion opened up on my team. The person who was in the role before me took a promotion themselves and called me the next day saying I'm pretty much the favorite to move into his role. As he said ""there is one other person they are even considering, but he has so many red flags, it's yours to be had"". My current boss told me immediately the position was opening and he thought I should go for it, and everyone on my team has directly said they want me in the role. I've been in my industry for 15 years, and I am highly regarded by people both in my company and outside of it. I am considered a top level employee and my boss, bosses boss and all my coworkers express that routinely. My boss has recently even said, before this role opened up, that he saw me going places here. 

Needless to say when they put out the req for the job I applied immediately. Did my interview and nailed it. My boss even called me after and said as much.  It's been 2 weeks and nothing. They are still ""waiting to finish interviewing others""

This delay has me kinda nervous. That plus the fact my boss pretty much stated he doesn't know if he can afford to take me out of the field, he relies on me too much and, not to sound too egotistical, I'm too good at my job. He pretty much knows he can send me into any customer and he doesn't have to worry about it or anything happening.

I'm worried that I'm going to be screwed over because they can't afford to lose me and it would be hard and take a long time to replace me. The only other 2 people I know interested have huge red flags. One has personality clashes with alot of people, has been passed over for this very promotion before in a different region and has burned alot of bridges, he took a job requiring relocation to Texas. Moved there for about 3 months, decided he didn't like it and just moved away and made himself a remote employee. The other person is terrible with paperwork and is known to take huge shortcuts on jobs. He does have more experience with our CRM, but that's about it. Both of these people though have been at the company much longer than I have.

I'm I wrong to be worried? Is it worth sticking around if I'm passed over, when everything appears to show me being the most qualified and best candidate?

My senior colleague has been diagnosed with cancer and has remained working while actively receiving treatment. I want to support him as best I can and have been absorbing the workload on days that he’s out of office for treatment. That has been no issue and I’m happy to do it. The issue is, some days I feel like his mood dictates how my day goes. If he’s having a bad day, it often leads to my work being nitpicked apart (we have different ways of approaching some tasks with the same end result). Or I if need to reach out to someone else with questions because he is not in the office and can’t answer my questions, I get told I am reaching out to the wrong person and to not reach out to x, reach out to y. The next week it’ll be reach out to y not x, you’re approaching things wrong. There’s a general theme of criticism about nearly anything I do, even down to my wording in emails. Has anyone experienced a similar situation? I want to be supportive of my colleague as best I can, but it is hard some days when I feel like I have to walk on eggshells. I’ve started to feel intense dread at night and in the morning when I wake up before work because I’m afraid of what I’ll get criticized for next.

1inxxnv,AI Master's Grad (No PhD) – What Should I Do?,"Hey everyone,

I’m feeling a bit lost career-wise and could really use some advice.

I have a BSc in Computer Science and a Master’s in AI from well-regarded universities. I also have about a year of experience as a Data Scientist. Now, I’m looking for my next job, but I’m struggling with direction.

I initially wanted to work in AI/ML at a top-tier company, but it seems like most big tech firms require a PhD for those roles (which I don’t have). I’d like to work somewhere that has a strong reputation and will help accelerate my career—so ideally not a small IT firm in a random town.

The problem is that I’m not sure where I fit in. Although I have solid technical skills, I don’t know if I should double down on AI/ML, pivot into software engineering, or look at other fields like quant, product, or something else entirely. Money is also an important factor for me (although experience is more important than money).

If you’ve been in a similar situation, how did you navigate it? What roles or industries would you recommend for someone with my background? Would really appreciate any insights!

1inxl89,Economics major looking for career advice,"
Relevant information: I’m Canadian, I’ve lived in the GTA my whole life and I’m currently a first year BA Hons Econ major. As versatile as economics is, it’s kinda backfiring on me because I’m having trouble picking a field I’m interested in where I can apply the skills my degree is gonna give me.

Data analysis is interesting but I’d have to go to grad school to really take my career to the next level/become a data scientist. I do plan to get a masters degree but I’d like to get work experience first in my field before I commit to specializing in it. I don’t really want to work in tech because while I’m okay at coding, I don’t want to be competing with CS majors and honestly all the layoffs are terrifying. 

I’ve been suggested management consulting but I don’t even know what that is. I don’t mind working in finance but “high finance” is also not a realistic possibility, since I don’t go to Schulich/Rotman/Ivey/any name brand business school, and also my location would be an issue (I think Toronto has the highest concentration of CFAs in the world.)

I’m here for advice on the possible career paths I can take; very very vaguely, I’m interested in working with numbers and/or in administration. I’d like to decide on this early on so I can take relevant courses or tack on a minor (I’ve been considering Statistics, Marketing, Comms or Poli Sci) relevant to the field I wanna work in once I graduate. Realistically I won’t be making 6 figures even a couple years out of college and I’m okay with that. I just want something where the possibility of making 6 figures with a masters degree exists.

1inxd6b,Have I ruined my hiring chances?,"Hi all!

I recently interviewed at the financial tech company Stripe. I met with 5 different hiring managers who were all hiring on their teams. I did fantastic on the written/technical assignment and during 4/5 of the interviews. However, one interview was off. I had a slightly hard time answering their questions and they seemed like they really did not want to be there and it threw me off a bit. It wasn't a terrible interview, but merely okay.

I was wondering if anyone has experience interviewing or working at stripe and could tell me how they make their hiring decisions. Is one not stellar interview going to cut me off completely? Or will my other great interviews and stellar written assignment possibly save me?

1inwvp6,Need Advice on My Career Situation - Feeling Lost,"Hi, mandatory first post here, and English is not my first language, so forgive any mistakes. Also, this is a throwaway account.

So, I work for an organization that has a branch in my home country and headquarters in the U.S. I started out working for the in-country team, then last year, I got promoted to the HQ team. My previous supervisor (basically the main boss of the in-country branch) has been a huge mentor to me throughout my career.

A few weeks ago, I was offered an update to my position with added responsibilities. My mentor advised me to negotiate for a raise and promotion, which I did. The result? They gave me not even a 2% raise, with no promotion, despite piling more work onto my plate. This made me seriously question my value at the company and whether I should stay.

My mentor then suggested I push harder—specifically, to tell them I had another job offer with a certain salary and see if they would match it. I followed through with that, and the conversation escalated to the point where I had to say I’d leave if they didn’t meet my demand. And well as I expected they straight-up said they couldn’t match it and asked me what my potential end date would be. To mend this and meantime make things worse for, my supervisor then asked me to send an email clarifying that it was a “misunderstanding"" and I am leaning towards staying with the company.

Now I feel completely embarrassed. My ego is bruised, and I don’t know what to make of this situation. I’m in my early 20s, and this role is objectively great for someone at my level—but at the same time, I feel undervalued. I don’t know how to face my mentor, what to think about my future at this company, or where to go from here.

I could really use some advice. How do I navigate this?

1inwto4,Advice on Lengthy Interview Process,"I work in education and am looking to transition into a new field.

I applied for a Recruiting Coordinator role at a tech company in early January. About a week later, I had an initial phone screen. During that conversation, I was invited to complete the next step in the process—a practical recruiting coordinator challenge. I completed the challenge and then the following Wednesday, I was invited to the next stage, which involved three back-to-back 45-minute interviews with different members of the recruiting team.

A few days after completing those interviews, I received this update:

“The team really enjoyed getting to know you, and we'd like to continue the conversation. Based on your previous interviews, we think you could also be a strong fit for a Recruiter role. I'll share more details about that position for you to review. If you're interested, we’d like the next two interviews to focus on that role and how your skills align with it. This won’t impact your consideration for the Recruiting Coordinator position—we’ll be able to determine the best path forward after these next conversations.""

I agreed to move forward with the additional interviews. My recruiter explained that I’d have two 45-minute sessions:

1. One focused on the recruiter role, covering strengths and weaknesses.
2. One centered around a sourcing exercise.

The interviews were originally scheduled for Monday, but one had to be postponed because the interviewer was sick. I completed the sourcing exercise interview, and the other was rescheduled for Wednesday.

Today, the coordinator reached out again to let me know that they’d also like to set up a 30-minute conversation with “one of the business leads”

I wasn’t expecting this and don’t have any details on who this person is or why they’d be involved in my interview process. This will also be my 8th interview in the process.

Is this a normal part of hiring in tech? Could it be a positive sign, or does it suggest uncertainty about where I fit?

1invkrb,Feeling lost in your career or job? A career plan might be the answer...,"I'm sure you've all heard it ""you can all only improve what you measure"", and in order to measure something you need to have a rough idea of what ""good"" or ""success"" looks like. That's where a career plan can come in handy. Having a career plan is less about the actual plan itself and more about the act of planning and taking time to think intentionally about your career, as the thought that goes into it helps you achieve clarity and gives you sense of where you are in relation to where you want to be. Some other benefits include (not an exhaustive list)

* **Clarifies Your Goals**: Set clear, actionable objectives to measure progress.
* **Identifies Opportunities**: Research industries and organizations to find roles that align with your skills and interests.

1invgxu,Now a PhD. Got nowhere 3 years later.,"So the situation is pretty straightforward. Please do not judge, I'm looking for tips or advice, not life lessons.

First off I am autistic and 35 years old. I live in the EU. Studies have been really hard and taken a long time. This being said I climbed the Everest and planted the flag. I'm officially a PhD for 3 years +.

I haven't exactly a poor level, I've had grants and a prize, given talks at conferences, and have nearly published ~ 20 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters so far. I should add that I have had diverse research interests. But my profile and/or my approach seem to be an issue nonetheless.

Since then I have sent very literally hundreds of applications, in academia (research/teaching) but also anywhere that I thought could be in demand for my particular set of skills.

I am a historian of international relations. History is not absolutely necessary, even though I'll keep researching and publishing as a hobby if my career finally takes off and takes me somewhere else. It helps with IR in any setting, though, I have found.

I should add that I never stopped working, as such. In fact, I might be working more now than ever before. I work for think tanks, do free work for journals and associations, give interviews, publish in media and scientific journals. 

Obviously I need this to finally get somewhere and get a proper income (I currently live on a handicap allowance). I can't stand the situation. But I'm positive I will burn out in any position that doesn't fit who I am and what I'm capable of, hence my specific job research so far.

I've reached out to multiple professionals in very different fields, always with the same disappointing results. I've been promised jobs that never materialized and given advice that I had already been enacting. 

Anyone here has any fresh ideas? Thanks in advance.",Zealousideal-Ad2895,0,0.5,3,1739379112,2025-02-12 16:51:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1invgxu/now_a_phd_got_nowhere_3_years_later/,2,2025

1inv63d,"Considering Leaving My High-Paying, Competitive Job for a Smaller Firm with Better Work/Life Balance – Advice Needed","Hey everyone! ’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. I'm currently at a large global firm in NYC (I commute from NJ), and while I love the work and the career opportunities, I’m debating whether it’s time to leave for a smaller firm that offers a much better work/life balance.

**Current Firm:**

**Pros:**

*   Amazing benefits (5 months paid maternity leave, unlimited PTO).
*   Strong network of colleagues and clients.
*   High pay and growth opportunities.
*   Solid experience and credibility.

**Cons:**

*   NYC-based, so my commute is rough (12-minute drive to the train station, 30-minute train ride, and 15-minute walk to the office).
*   The role is demanding, and I often work after hours and weekends to prep presentations, which leads to a lot of burnout.
*   I just had a baby (he's 12 weeks old) and with my current schedule, I’ll barely seeing him. I’ll be out of the house from 7am to 6pm, and he’s asleep by 7:30pm, so I’d really struggle to find quality time with him.

**Smaller Firm:**

**Pros:**

*   Only a 20-minute commute by car and onsite parking.
*   2 days in office, 3 days remote.
*   A chill work culture (the recruiter bragged about no after-6pm emails).
*   The work/life balance is great, and I would be able to spend more time with my family.

**Cons:**

*   Only 14 days PTO in the first year, increasing to 19 days after that.
*   6 weeks of 100% paid maternity leave (not as generous as my current role).
*   The firm is smaller, so I’m worried about fewer growth opportunities and potentially getting bored.

Do I leave my current job with amazing benefits to go to a smaller firm for better work/life balance, but with fewer benefits? I’m really torn because I know I’ll be burnt out staying at my current firm, but I also don’t want to leave behind the fantastic opportunities and network I’ve built. I’m also concerned that the smaller firm might not have the same level of excitement or opportunities as the larger firm. For what it's worth, I am a 27 year old female. 

What do you all think? Should I take the leap for better work/life balance, or stay for the benefits and career growth at my current company? Any advice or similar experiences would be really helpful!

1inuxzn,"Mid 40’s w/No Degree, Large Gap in Work: What to Do","So, the title basically says it. I never went to school because I came from a McDonalds franchise family. (Had one of the first few stores opened) I started working cleaning the lobby when I was 8 (it was the family business and they could have me do that) and I was the GM of a store by 17. I didn’t know any better and it was kind of built into me that food service is what I should be doing the rest of my life. I didn’t really go to school because of this fact. I hated it but never said anything because I didn’t know better. By the time I was in my 30’s, I ended up with a medical situation right about the time my first child was born. My wife was working well and I took the opportunity to be the stay at home dad. Now, close to 15 years later, all three of my kids are finally in school for the entire day and I do t know what to do with myself. My medical situation gave me some weird neurological issues and “learning” can sometimes be difficult. It will most likely take at least 6 years for any kind of college programs. This would put me into my 50’s to get a degree. I am at a huge loss.

The interviewer seem to really like me and even admitted that I looked like a perfect candidate and that they will call me soon regarding their decision. My concern, is if they do decide to give me a job offer, it would mean that I will get paid $4 less than what I'm making now. This is an entry level position so it's understandable that I'll be paid less. This job seems nice but it has low pay and I'm unsure if they offer benefits like my current job... I'm already living paycheck-to paycheck so I'm unsure if I should risk it. Accoridng to them, I'll start at $15 an hour and if they like me in the next 3 months, that the pay will increase (unsure of how much). I think this is a good opportunity, as it is a job that closely aligns with my degree.

So my cons for this position is the low pay, chances are that I won't get benefits, small company so there's limited promotions and advancement in the company.

Pros are that it's a job that closely aligns to my degree, closer to home, company seems chill and very nice, chances to improve on my skills to be able to get a high raise or help me find a better position...

I also have two school-aged kids and a spouse that travels frequently for work, being gone from anywhere to 1-4 nights a week. Sometimes back to back weeks. 

I have a good middle management position, working from home with a decent salary. It’s stable, but I’m just not happy. A big part of me wants to quit so I can focus on my health, recover from burnout, and figure out what’s next. But another part of me feels like I should just suck it up and keep going.

I have been applying to other roles both within my industry and out. I’ve had a lot of interviews but no offers. Sometimes I get excited about the role, but then I start doubting myself and my ability. I don’t know if I could go back to work in office full time. But I also worry about working from home 100%. Wondering if going back to the office would actually help. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you decide what to do? Any advice or perspective would be greatly appreciated.

Last week, on February 3, I submitted an application for the position of VC analyst.

When they gave the assignment, the email with it said they “plan to promptly review submissions and invite a limited number of candidates to interviews later in the week.”

Last Thursday (February 6th), I did not receive an email to schedule an appointment.

I just received this email:

“Thanks, (My Name)-confirming receipt, we'll be in touch. “

I followed up with them today.

Is this a bad sign? I don’t know whether they are behind on the hiring process or I merely didn’t get the interview.

I just got promoted to my current position in August","Been with the company for 4 years, promoted to Supervisor in August under this Manager. They are leaving in April for a new department and this would be a lateral move for me with no pay increase. I am not overly career ambitious, enjoy keeping a work smart not hard mentality as much as possible and employ an 80/20 rule for myself with energy expenditure towards my job. Give them 80% effort everyday to prevent burnout and keep 20% on reserve when I need to shine. Just to give you an idea of how I approach my career and what I might be looking for.

Pros include potentially earlier work hours as I am currently the closing supe in my dept and a smaller team which should make my day to day easier. Mngr says this should be a ""highly visible"" position that would be great experience for me to gain opportunities to move up in the future (typical corpo spiel but ofc no guarantees or timelines). They have historically been a good person to learn from and develop under. 

Cons, more training is required once transferred and there is more liability in this dept so likely more hoops generally. The team while smaller works more directly with the clients and the leadership team is expected to do a portion of their week working what their team does so this would mean more hands on work for me as well.

1inrrn0,Is It True?,"Freelance writing offers flexibility, but does it truly provide freedom? After over five years in academic writing, I’ve seen both sides. On one hand, I set my own schedule, choose my clients, and work from anywhere. On the other, inconsistent income, demanding deadlines, and the constant search for new projects can make freelancing feel like a never-ending hustle.

Some say freelancing is the ultimate escape from the 9-to-5 grind, while others feel trapped by financial uncertainty and long hours. Has freelancing truly given you more freedom, or has it just redefined what freedom means to you?

1inrika,Mechanical Engineer: Masters in Data Analytics ?,"
Hey y’all!

I am currently a Mechanical Engineer in the semiconductor industry and am considering a career switch. To be more specified, I am an Equipment engineer so I basically oversee a fleet of equipment that aids in the chip making process. While I have some interest in what I do, I lately have found a great interesting in coding. I have completed CS50, CS50P and currently taking CS50W and I am enjoying the challenges. At work I have also created projects that implemented the coding skills I have learned over the years: I have created a dashboard using Perl, SQL, JavaScript/HTML that pulls information from a data base and displays it on a webpage, all in one place which is convenient for me, since I had to look multiple places for the same piece of information.

Another project I just completed was basically making another webpage that pulled data from an excel file and rendered it as a webpage depending on what the user clicked on. This was using python/django. This project was also interesting/ fun for me and I’m curious to try more projects like that at work. However I haven’t really looked at other jobs for job hopping and I feel I need to get the most out of my job if I end up staying for a few more years. Which is why I’m considering getting a Masters degree. My job will cover it , so I would just have to work full time while I complete the program if I do it.

- I am not interested enough in getting a Masters in Mechancial Engineering.
- Computer science would be my top choice, however when I look at programs, the pre req classes to get in the program would take me about a year or 2 to complete so I don’t think that’s practical considering I don’t want to be in school for too long lol.
- I considered Data science, however after looking online , it seems it is very statistics and math heavy and it is a more specialized field. So it seems the more practical option would be Data Analytics ?

I have been watching videos and it seems like Data Scientists mainly do Data Analysts work anyways so I wonder if the Data Analytics Masters would make the most sense. 

What do y’all think ? I still debate what I should go for but I just know in the future I would want my career involve coding similar what I explained in my projects, or also being able to automate things that everyone else around me manually does.",Youngreezy305,2,1.0,0,1739369037,2025-02-12 14:03:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1inrika/mechanical_engineer_masters_in_data_analytics/,2,2025

It involves money, close enough to my salary and nearly deducted from me (I'm a fresh grad, 2 months at work and on probationary btw), but thankfully, the manager solved it by submitting another report to the head office, which I hope they will approve, or they're gonna charge me for it :((. IM INDEPENDENTLY LIVING ALONE AWAY FROM MY PARENTS AND HOMETOWN. I'm about to lose myself and cry out loud when they told me about that mistake. Even before, small mistakes give me anxiety and always come to my mind that they will not regularize me when the evaluation comes in the 3rd month. I always apologize for my mistakes and promise that it will not happen again. Oh god, please help me with this one.

1inqvd9,Change entirely or stick to something I am really not sure about?,"I feel lost. I’m in the final year of my bachelors in psychology, which I chose haphazardly due to circumstances that made just leaving my country to go study somewhere else a much bigger priority than what I would be doing with my life afterwards. Before that, I had taken the math and physics branch in highschool, wanting to become an engineer or a physicist. Won’t go too into detail but I burnt out extremely hard and ended up ditching those plans in favour of leaving the abusive situation I was in and maybe helping others who had been in such situations someday. 

Long story short, psychology was not what I expected. I’ve been looking at jobs that would be more hands-on since I was halfway through my first year. The country I’ve moved to is also very strict about their requirements; I would have to speak the language perfectly if I wanted to ever be a therapist, which part of me still wants. It’s not looking like it’s an option here though and I can’t afford to go anywhere else. 

Here are my options:

a) Apply to a research masters and go into epidemiology, try to find a decently paying job in English outside academia (I hate academia). This will take 2 years and is a bit of a risk in regard to employment - do I do a PhD after? Who is that paid for by? Where can I even work? - That kind of thing.

b) Take a risk and go to a HBO university (more practice than research oriented, technically equivalent to a university but may be seen as less by some, or in other countries) to take up mechanical engineering. This will take 3 years and from what I’ve heard I’ll have a job practically guaranteed after - or at least I’ll have done many internships and will have connections to companies. 

I don’t know whether to hold on to the dreams I had back when I was a teenager trying to figure out how combustion engines worked, or to let go and try my hardest to get a decently paying job with what I’ve got right now (which might be even more difficult since I’m looking for jobs in English and research jobs are scarce to begin with). I’m super burnt out and I feel like I’m running out of time even though I’m only 20. But I don’t really have anybody to guide me through this, my family isn’t very helpful.

I’m not sure if this is the right forum for this but ah well. I really want to be a forensic specialist - specially with the AFP ( Australian Federal Police) or even work for the ASIO one day. But I’m having a bit of trouble with my degree. 

So when I came to uni in 2021 , I studied Criminology - which I loved but quickly figured out that it didn’t make me very employable . So I switched into a bachelor of Science (honours) - majoring in Biochemistry and Genetics. But recently I’ve been given the opportunity to instead switch into science/law - the only issue is that it extends my time at uni by 2.5 years - and it means I’ll have to drop back to one major. Would changing hinder my changes ? Or would it just make me more desirable for that type of job?  I’d love to hear from people who have been through similar things! 

I love law and criminology too - and honestly plan on going back to uni to study them if I don’t do it now - it’s just what order to do them in if that makes sense ?

1inosbv,Feeling super insecure in my role,"Hi all, first time poster on this thread. 

As the title says, I've started this year feeling very insecure and worried about my future at my company.

High-level summary is that my company have been doing some rounds of redundancies and although our team has been safe so far, I'm worried that I could be next. 

This is partly because (to reasons outside of my control) my products (I'm somewhat of a product specialist) have been hit badly by negative sales / market and hence I haven't had as much new business coming my way. I help out on other projects but it feels a bit like the elephant in the room - even though I am helping out other team members and working on other products, it's clear that I don't really have much to do on my designated area, which from a 'who shall we get rid of next' is super worrying, as it wouldn't take much to be thrown under the bus. 

Furthermore, from a personnel POV, I don't know but I don't feel like I'm on super good terms with certain team members. I missed the Xmas party due to sickness, yet I feel since coming back in the new year a bit of coldness to me - I am not sure if it is the Christmas party and whether this sensation is real or imagined but instinctively I feel things are a bit off. Like I'm not particularly in their 'good books'. Perhaps I am seen as somewhat of a loner or haven't bothered enough. I don't know exactly. But I can feel it somehow.

This week, I saw my manager and a more senior colleague go off into what looked like a hush-hush meeting and then with another colleague but no meeting was arranged with me. It could be unrelated to me but with everything going on my mind has become neurotic. 

It feels a bit like 'crunch time'. With bonuses / compensation convos imminent, I feel like I would know quite soon (I imagine if I get news of what my bonus / pay rise would be, then it's unlikely I would be made redundant in the near-term). So I guess the pressure is building a bit and added to this where my manager's performance comments which touched my product area being slow and that I needed to 'consider my role and development in the future', would seemed a little cold. Like what does 'consider my role' mean, that could definitely be taken one of two ways. 

It's tough as when I started this job 3 years ago, in a team of 6 give or take, only 1 team member from then is remaining. I feel like the newer members have bonded more with each other whilst my original team members, who I was closer with have now left. Weird how these cycles work I think. I do think a lot of this is about personal relationships - somehow I feel I have lost rapport with manager / senior colleague and that has a huge impact....

I guess I wanted to ask people what their advice would be in this situation and how do I know if I am just being neurotic or whether my stock has really fallen and I should consider leaving?

1innp2a,Confused,"I work for a fintech, in their satellite office. I was referred to this job by an executive from HQ. 

I've been unhappy since day one because of the culture in the satellite office. Plus everyone seems very political and always in competition. 

The last bit for me was when my colleague got promoted because he knows more execs, has leverage and is good at building relationships (I was told this by the MD who was my boss, but I now report to this colleague who got promoted). In fairness, he is smart, knows how yo push ppl under the bus, and has been in the company since day 0, I just didn't like how it was handled by the MD.

Today I got a call from the MD because my manager is away. He discussed 2 things:
1) The founders PA emailed him complaining, I don't know, because the founder was here a few weeks ago and he was supposed to meet me and 2 others. He ended up cancelling at the last minute because the MD had told him that we were all busy with a client launch, which wasn't true because I wasn't involved. I emailed the PA and I said that it was unfortunate that it had been cancelled, specially since not everyone was involved in the launch. She didn't like this and informed the MD...

2) a few weeks ago I messaged the Exec that had referred me for this role, I've been wanting to work with AI for a while and I asked him if that team had been set up yet and if there was an opportunity for me, given that I'm almost about to wrap up a launch and will be free. He told me to go for it and told me who to speak to. I had this mini interview and they were happy for me to join. I then went back to my manager (colleague that got promoted) and told him about this opportunity, he told me to speak to the MD, I did. He said no. 
In my call today, the MD said that I was self promoting myself and that we needed to be team players. He said our office is not doing well financially and that we will need to do sales soon (I'm in tech consulting) and he didn't like the fact that I went behind asking the Exec, that I should've gone to him or my manager first. 

Just to be clear, 2 happened before 1. 

Am I screwed? I dont understand if they aren't doing well financially why not just let me go to the other team? I'm not challenged enough. 
In my working career, I've never done 1 before, but I'm just tired of their BS. I thought the PA will actually come back to me but clearly I was wrong!

1inm9yw,What pathway should I take to become an airline pilot? (sorry for the long write),"Hi everyone, l'm a high school senior from Ontario, CA (Class of 2025) who wants to become an airline pilot in the future. Although, my mind is all over the place. Graduation is in May and I still don't know which path to take. I don't know whether I should go to a 4 year university that offers flight school training, or go to community college then transfer to a 4 year and get a degree in something else (dont know what to get a degree in, but prefer not to get a aviation degree in case my medical were to be revoked or I fail) while doing flight training at a ""mom and pop"" flight school as I earn money for flight training. I could also do accelerated programs like ATP but the reason I want to get a bachelors degree is because my end goal is to end up as an airline pilot for Delta Airlines and I'm assuming Delta Airlines is very competitive and would prefer a bachelors than having no degree at all (If I'm wrong please let me know, it would be helpful!) Also If there's any better recommended flight paths I could take please let me know thank you! But basically I feel bad because I've known since the day my dad surprised me with a discovery flight for my 16th birthday that I wanted to become an airline pilot and l've done some research but even still with months away from graduating I've been over decisive on which path to take to the airlines and it would be helpful to have advice from experienced aviators before I take a final pathway/decision towards my future with no regrets or doubts. If you have any questions please let me know, thank you guys! **( i tried posting this to the aviation/flying community but it got taken down so ill try it here)** 

**Chaffey College or Mt.Sac College (2 year community colleges)**  
My high school has a partnership with Chaffey College where we can have 2 years free of school, free tuition, free student parking, free everything we just need to do 20 hours of community service. The A&P associates degree captures my interest, although its not a 4 year degree but it does really seem interesting and it's in the aviation field. It would be nice to have that experience on my resume, would this degree still be convincing to Delta? I can simultaneously attend Chaffey College and pay as I go to a cheap flight school to get all my certs and ratings quicker. Although Chaffey College does not have a flight school.

In contrast, **Mt.Sac** offers a Commercial Flight associates degree, a A&P associates degree as well and it's flight school does not require you to major in commercial flight, you can be majoring for a A&P degree while being enrolled in its flight school, its rentals hours are cheap but you do need to reapply for membership each semester and maintain strict expectations which I hope I can meet, it's program also has a thing where you can checkout a headset for the semester (instead of having to buy one) and return it once the semester is over basically loaning it for the time you're scheduled to have flight training. Although, it does not have free tuition, free parking and etc but I think FAFSA should cover for it.

**4 Year University pathway:** The only 4 Year Uni I'm considering is California Baptist University as it is a 40 minute commute and I received financial aid (I will attach my financial aid offer below) but fafsa does not cover flight training and cbu's additional flight labs are more than and even with financial aid I would still be having to pay 4k

**CBU’S FAFSA Aid offer:**  
I would have to pay around 4-5k every semester, (**I don't intend on living on campus anymore**) plus the additional flight training costs, written exams, flight hour costs, l'm not sure how CBUs payment plans work but I know I would have to take out loans to pay flight training costs and CBU is offering me a subsidized and unsubsidized loan and I would prefer to just take the subsidized loan than the unsubsidized loan, what do you guys think? Are there any loans you guys would recommend me?

1inlq2s,"Career nomad, now unemployed, entrepreneurial dreams","34M employed in various jobs tried a few different careers, which I didn't enjoy mostly because they interfered too much with time off or were a mismatch for my introvert INTJ personality. Thought I'd ask for some advice. Been unemployed for 6 months now haven't been able to secure any work, despite employment counselling. 6 months ago my fiance and I moved from Vancouver to smaller community in interior BC in search of better worklife balance from our management jobs as well as lower cost of living. We tried to find different jobs in Vancouver area first for a couple years but nothing came up. So we jumped on a nice job opportunity for my fiance in the beautiful Interior with the intention of spending more quality time together and settling down. I've always had a good professional record, generally got promoted even though I was unfulfilled by the work. Essentially i faked it to build my resume and climb the ladder. I know many have this experience in corporate workplace, left feeling used. My last role was a regional operations manager, team of 60, which I did for 4 years and received fair pay/benefits had a nice relationship with everyone at the company and was told i was liked. After 10 years of managing people in hotels and other low skillled service industries I couldn't escape the feeling that I am not fulfilling my potential; adding value, feeling my work is meaningful or earning enough to start a family. Although I want to work the thought of doing a job that I have no joy in depresses me and my therapist says its a very bad idea for me. I am intelligent/logical but not academic I was thinking to transition to being a project manager so took Project Management classes in the evening for the last year but ended up hitting a roadblock in getting certified as needed more work experience in the industry, but no one would hire me in the support roles. Now I'm doing part time courses learning how to start a business. Ultimately, I'd love to be my own boss working in a job mostly alone, that has a sense of accomplishment, i get energised by earning good money, I'm not an empath or people person. I don't mind going back to school for 1 year, already have a degree in business/tourism. I thought about sales but hate being disingenuous.

1inlaof,How do I get into food safety (as a career)? Or any other advice for a microbio grad?,"I have a BS in Microbiology, and graduated in June, but realized I will likely need to go for MLS certification (post bacc route) or find another career. I do not have much lab experience and no research experience as I was already working part time while attending uni, and only briefly worked as a lab assistant (but never did any important microbiology work). 

I've been working at my grocery store since I first attended college to pay for uni and bills, and am familiar with the routine Ecolab/Food Health Inspector visits. They're usually very busy when they come by so I don't get a chance to ask them about their career. 

I became interested in food safety after watching the Ecolab and the Health Inspector come by, and my own experience in keeping my kiosk clean, but I don't know how relevant my degree would be. I saw there are food safety managers positions nearby me for other grocery stores, but they're all senior level who require food safety experience. But I'm confused as to what that experience looks like and keywords for entry level jobs in the field. 

Basically these were my options 

* Work overnight shifts at non-medical labs to gain experience for a few years
* Attend a post-bacc program for medical lab science (probably take on more debt and require savings, and probably no income)
* Food safety...?

I feel utterly lost in my life, like I wasted all my time in college for nothing. I felt pressured by my mom to attend college immediately, but at the same time she couldn't afford to put me through college, so I was often working 20-30 hours a week during school to help pay for uni and the bills. I am scared my lack of experience will make my degree worthless and I should just go back to school, because at least the MLS program will make sure I gain relevant experience and train me to pass certification, but that would mean more debt/financial strain. 

My mom is in a better financial position now, so she thinks she can help support me during the MLS program, but I am not sure how true that will hold up anymore.

1injas0,Feeling Stuck in My Legal Career – Seeking Advice on Career Growth & Negotiation,"Hi everyone,

I’m a young professional working in the legal field as a court reporter. My background is in politics and law, and my long-term goal has always been to attend law school. I’ve worked in government through internships and regular employment, so I have some experience in the public sector as well.

Currently, I’m working part-time—not by choice, but because my employer limits full-time positions as a cost-saving measure. My hours are tied to court operations, making my schedule unreliable. Full-time roles are highly competitive, and while my senior colleagues (who have high school diplomas) have secured them, the younger full-timers tend to have university degrees or relevant college programs.

I’ve genuinely enjoyed the learning experience, but I’m starting to feel stuck. My pay isn’t enough to save for school, and I feel underutilized in my role. While my colleagues are nice, I often struggle to connect with them, whereas I find it much easier to talk to the lawyers.

I want to improve my working conditions and salary but don’t know how to negotiate strategically. I’m also actively seeking mentorship to help me navigate my next steps.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you move forward? Any advice on career growth, salary negotiation, or transitioning into more substantial roles in the legal field would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

P.S. My mother has always been strongly against my desire to pursue law. She sees me as a very creative person and worries that I’ll waste my potential, ending up joyless and stuck in a rigid career. The more adults I talk to, the more I find who are deeply dissatisfied with their career choices, some even regretful. It’s unsettling.

The thing is, I love to plan—law has been my plan. I intentionally sought out work in the legal field before committing to law school, wanting to be sure before investing time and money into a degree. But now, standing at this crossroads, I’m starting to question everything.

I don’t want to chase prestige at the cost of happiness. I want to do meaningful work, work that I enjoy, work that challenges me without draining me. But if not law, then what? And if law is the right path, how do I navigate it in a way that aligns with who I am?",freshbakedbread444,1,1.0,0,1739336397,2025-02-12 04:59:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1injas0/feeling_stuck_in_my_legal_career_seeking_advice/,2,2025

1iniw8l,I’ve been offered a lower wage than my predecessor. How do I negotiate a higher salary?,"I’ve been seconded into my role for the last 18 months while my predecessor and mentor works on another project. During this secondment my wage has remained the same except for our annual merit increases. I’ve been earning £39,000 plus a guaranteed £8k bonus. I’ve been perfectly happy with this until now as this career change was exactly what I wanted. 

My predecessor has now moved into a new role and I’ve been offered the role full time. The trouble I’m having is this: I know my predecessor was earning £53k two years ago and I’ve been offered just under £52k. 

If I apply that same wage to myself and then increase this based on my own last two merit reviews (5.8% and 6%) this would take me closer to £60k. While on secondment I’ve also been awarded employee of the year, so I know I’m doing the job to a very high standard and I get nothing but great feedback on my work. 

My boss has advised me the methodology she used to reach her offer: 10% on my basic salary and adding on the bonus. Am I wrong to think it’s unfair to use my current salary at all when it’s a completely different role? Surely the offer should be based on the role itself and what the company currently think it is worth, not what they’re paying for an unrelated role?

He gave me a verbal offer and wanted to know how I felt about it. I said that the only thing was that this position would be a 10k pay cut, and would be located in a more expensive city. To combat this, I asked if the salary could be bumped by 5K. He said he would take it to the team and inquire. 

I received the official offer and the salary listed is the original lower salary. He never explicitly mentioned that the request was denied (not sure if that would happen anyways) but has said to let him know if I have any concerns or questions.

Should I ask about the salary increase one more time? Or leave it be?

I will likely take the job either way, as I am unhappy at my current job, but closing the gap between the 2 salary’s would definitely make me feel more certain about the decision.

Everything), and this should lead to full time employment after college. A year before landing my internship, I got a campus job that’s part time, but unfortunately I still have to commute to work as I don’t live on campus anymore. It’s a 24/7 coverage job, so my shifts are normally one weekend day per week. Between my other job and school, that leaves me with only one day off per week, basically year round. Worse, recently the weekend shifts have had their hours cut, so I’m only walking away with like $70 for the day, which doesn’t feel worth it when adding in the commute, waking up early, and the mental capacity of splitting attention between two completely different jobs. The job has been really good to me and I’ve kept it as a back up financial security option, but recently I’ve been getting called in during times that disrupt time with family, and I’ve been getting burnt out only having one day off per week.

1infkaf,I feel like I'm working not to grow but to stay. Should I consider getting another job?,"Hi, I've been working as a software engineer for the last 2 years in my current job. My starter position was as a ""Junior"" but since my team was small I'd be doing everything when it came to projects (which from my previous experiences were not Junior-like things). At first my mentality was ""Oh, I'm learning a lot, and from everything this is a good opportunity"", the pay was okay but back then I really thought I'd eventually get a raise.

Foward to 5 months ago, at my  performance review my boss talked to me about the possibility of my position getting eliminated, since upper management was doing budget cuts (my performance result was excellent). Right after that as a way to give me visibility I was giving support to some other dev team, mind you they worked with a technology that I was not familiar with (and they knew), but I made the extra effort to learn quick in order to give results and seem valuable to this other team I was also supporting.

Foward to a month ago, I'm let know that my position was eliminated (as well as several other from my team), but specifically with me they wanted to keep me within the company, so they offered me to go with another dev team (which is a 100 times better than the first one, and they have many people, and are well structured, etc...) but they did not have a position for me there, so what they did is, in the meantime they put me in the system as if I'm a Data Analyst (I'm getting the same payment) while they are pushing to create a new position in the team for me to be in. I truly believe they are going to get the new position open, cuz I've seen that happening before.

Thing is, with this new ""movement"" I've been working with 3 different teams and in all of them I have to adapt really fast in order to give results fast, and be seen as valuable. I'm tired, I've been giving my 110% just to prove that I'm good, but It feels like I'm always overdoing just to stay and not to grow in the company, or at least in payment. MIND YOU at this new position my workload is bigger than before.

For more context, besides this I love my job, I get to learn a lot of things, I like the work culture, I like what we do, etc etc etc... My silver linning is that once they give me the new position, they are gonna offer me a raise, but low key they might not...

I honestly just want some external opinion to know am I being entitled, is this like normal to happen at work ? Shall I try to speak up or just get another job ?

TL;DR: I've been working and giving expected results, been trough 3 different teams, not a single pay raise, and at this point it feels like I'm working to just keep my job rather than to grow, even tho I'm doing my 110%...",catus752,4,1.0,5,1739324344,2025-02-12 01:39:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1infkaf/i_feel_like_im_working_not_to_grow_but_to_stay/,2,2025

1inezv2,Can you help me pick a major and/or future career?,"I am currently a 19 year old freshman in college (in my second semester) majoring in biology. I have thought a lot about what I want to do in the future but have always struggled in deciding what is best for me. I have always dreamt of working with animals, then thought about nursing, and now I just chose a major that would work for either one. I am having a hard time deciding what career to plan for and work towards and I would love some help and guidance. I am not extremely picky with careers, I just want something that I can do with a bachelors degree or very minimal additional education (after the bachelors degree). For example, I would be open to doing an accelerated nursing program, or other programs that take under 2 years. I am interested in jobs in animal care/conservation, ecology, and the medical field, but am open to any other ideas! I know that animal care jobs do not pay very well and are hard to find with just a bachelors degree which is why I am thinking more about the medical field (but I am still not sure). I am an introvert that loves being at home, but I know that working from home might not be possible for me, and I am totally okay with that! 

Here are some skills I have that can be considered:
- I work well in stressful environments 
- I do not get disturbed or disgusted easily 
- I work well alone and with others 
- I am very good at organizing and making plans 
- I have very good time management skills 

Here are a few things I would like in a future career (these are things that would be nice to have but not necessarily required):
- Good work life balance, having some days off every week and vacation time 
- Job stability
- Average or better pay (I do not want an extravagant life, just to live comfortably and to afford a small home or apartment)
- Being able to find work that I do not have to travel far for

Again, I am open to anything! I am also open to possibly changing my major since I am still in the beginning of my college career. And I would love to hear from people who work in the fields I mentioned (animal care, biology, and medical field) to see how they feel about their jobs! Thanks for everyone who took the time to read this and I am sorry for the length! 😅",rita_0314,1,1.0,0,1739322708,2025-02-12 01:11:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1inezv2/can_you_help_me_pick_a_major_andor_future_career/,2,2025

1ineh1d,Secretly finding another job in a small industry when my boss knows everyone (plus helped me get my visa),"I've been at a startup for the past 5 years. They underpay me and treat me like crap and I told them 3 years ago I was interested in exploring another area of the industry (which they encourage me to do on the side and even connected me with some people in their field who I could ask for advice).

I moved to the city where their HQ are based which I needed a visa for. I would say all of my work at said startup has enabled me to get that visa so I feel slightly indebted to them. Technically the visa runs 3 years but I am not tied down to this company and could leave any time. I told myself I would wait it out for a year and then just say I can't make ends meet with the salary they are paying me. Which is true, it's below average for the city I live in. I just didn't want to be like ""hi, thanks for the visa, bye"" and burn a bridge because my bosses know nearly everyone in this industry.

I just moved here a week ago and saw a job for a position that while not at my favorite company or in the favorite corner of my industry, has a really attractive salary. I know she knows the people working in the leadership there though and am worried it will get back to her if I apply.

I feel like recruiting companies aren't sworn to secrecy so maybe I should wait it out a bit longer because I feel paranoid it will get back to her and then that will look bad. I don't want to burn the bridge with them because they know so many people and I fear they would blacklist me. Any advice on whether or not to take the risk and apply to that job?

1indmsb,Looking for sales opportunity,"
Hey all

I’ve been looking to transfer into a new sales role and could use some direction. I’ve been selling appliances B2C for about 2 and a half years now, and while its an entry level gig, I’ve consistently done above average. I understand selling on a fundamental level. I am great with people as well! Getting strangers to open up is one of my strengths, as I can generally connect with just about anybody. 

That said, I’m ready for something different. I would like to get out of retail and get a real sales job. I’ve found that the retail environment is pretty toxic. I kinda just want to find something where I’m sort’ve left alone to just utilize the skills I have. I don’t cold call in my current role-just take walk-ins or ups. However, I’ve gotten many repeats, and lots of great reviews and complements which always feels nice 😊.  I’ve made about $50,000 in straight commissions (we are on a draw) which isn’t quite top performing, but it’s decent for me right now. 

I’m really wanting to find a remote sales role with a base salary, not just straight commission. Ideally, I’d like to find a role where I close inbound prequalified leads rather than doing heavy prospecting or cold calling. 

Any recommendations on industries, companies, or positions that fit this? I do greatly appreciate any insight, and honestly.

1ind5om,Laid off as a corporate paralegal—looking for job search advice and resources,"Hi all,

I was hoping to get some advice on my current situation. I recently lost my job as a corporate paralegal at an international spirits company in NYC. The company implemented major cost-cutting initiatives, and unfortunately, the (small) legal team was not spared.

Some of my responsibilities included corporate governance, contract management and review, annual filings, and trademark renewals. Apart from LinkedIn, does anyone have any resources they’d recommend? I’m open to working with temp agencies as well, especially until I find something more permanent. I know the market isn’t ideal at the moment, but I’m hoping something opens up.

Looking at what’s available right now makes me realize that my résumé lacks significant litigation experience. It’s a bit of a blow since there seem to be more opportunities in that area.

1incy7x,Need some advice,"Need some guidance

I’m a 22 year old guy who’s been working at my company for around two and a half years. This is my first job so I wasn’t sure on what to expect but bloody hell I’m sure this is not how it’s suppose to be working.

So I work at my current company in the IT department as a support technician, and the department has recently gotten two new guys, our manager has refused to give them proper training in terms of desktop support, network administration or anything of the sort, forcing them to do network cabling, while I on the other hand am forced to assist 300+ employees across five different locations.
The guys openly expressed their willingness to learn support etc, however the manager refused to train them often brushing things off as “there’s not enough time”, “I’m too busy”, or “I’ve already explained this”

So long story short I ended up going to HR and he was forced to compile documentation on troubleshooting steps and configurations (which was never done before in the department, we were an IT department with zero documentation). He tells me straight up out of frustration that he’ll never teach us everything he knows to prevent us from ever replacing me, and forces me to do the documentation, whilst he slaps his name on it and takes it up to the bosses.

Again this is my first job and this is just a little peek into what or how he behaves, there’s multiple instances in which he takes credit for others work, refuses to take accountability or responsibility unless it’s positive, steals ideas, overloads us in terms of work, sets unreasonable deadlines so on and so forth

With that in mind, I wanted to get your blessing about the phrasing and (lack of) risk. I'm happy to put up with a 1% risk of the offer being randomly rescinded, but I don't wanna negotiate if there's like a 5% risk. I think my asks are fair and reasonable, but I wanted to check with you to make sure.

Context, the job description didn't list the pay and I was forced to write it in the application, so I said 80-100K a year. Recruiter confirmed that and then told me on the phone 60-80 and I'm like, fine. Then after all the rounds, I guess the recruiter made a mistake somewhere or something with the range? Anyways, offer came in at 95. That of course is pretty good for my original range and excellent for what I was primed to expect, which is what's giving me pause to negotiate further.

1inbprd,Should I pursue my dream ?,"
Hello everyone, I have a problem and I desperately need help. 
Last summer, I tried to enter medical school. It was a competitive exam (I don’t really know how to say it in English,sorry haha). I didn’t study enough because lots of things happened during summer break so obliviously I failed it. Since I couldn’t get in, I chose to pursue pharmaceuticals science instead and I am currently in my second semester of university. 
However,I still keep thinking about medicine and every time someone mentions it I feel a deep sense of regret to not have studied enough. 
I know I’m not a bad student but I always let good opportunities go by because I’m scared of failure. 
I have shared my wish to try it again with my parents but they aren’t really supportive, my dad said that being a doctor isn’t a good life. I agree and I know it is a lot of work. 
Here’s my thing , should i try to get into medicine or dentistry ?
On the one hand medicine is something that i dream of but the studies are 9 years long so im scared to not have the opportunity of having a family or feeling like I’ve lost most of my life studying ?
On the other hand dentistry is shorter (5years) and would at least give me some proximity with patients but it is harder to get into.
It is the same exam but with different scores to get in. 
Since I already tried the exam last year this year is my last chance , what should I do ?

1inbmmb,"Wanting to accept Full Time Job offer, but I am leaving for PT school in August guaranteed","Hello good people of reddit,

I have just received my first full time offer for a job within my major (Exercise Science ) after 5 years of working part time and internship roles in my field (I have been a College S&C coach, in addition to roles outside my field like being the world's greatest pizza delivery guy, plasma donator, and instacart shopper extraordinaire to help survive financially). Graduated in '21 with undergrad and '22 with masters. To say I am excited is an understatement, there is a however the issue of me starting PhysioTherapy school in 6 months from now...

So let's paint my current situation, the companies, and my current options and I will let you all know which decision I am going to go with at the end.

I recently moved to a new state in November of 2024, my expenses are piling up faster than what I can save. I am doing side jobs like instacart and plasma donations, and luckily I have a roommate so we have been able to split the costs, but I am surviving and not thriving (everything going towards rent, necessities, and for the first time ever I have accumulated some credit card debt) and cannot sustain this current employment/financial situation much longer.

After interviewing for 3 months with Company A and doubts about the full time position even being able to be implemented due to changes in management, I have finally received notification the role is approved and the offer is being extended to me. This is a career change for me as this role is in the corporate fitness industry working with business employees and not college athletes, but regardless I feel competent in being able to perform the duties of the job successfully. Now this is where my good ole fashion conscience is coming in and making me feel not very bueno. I was not transparent in my interview of intending to start PT school in August of this year (as at the time of my first interview for Company A in late November of 2024, I was not accepted into any PT programs yet so I didn't feel like mentioning it as nothing was guaranteed in response to the infamous ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" question, but that changed when I was accepted into a program a month later in December that starts in August) and now I am starting to have some internal strife going on in not informing this company about the recent changes in my life.

So let's talk about the companies and what's being offered.

**Company A and 2 opportunities**. Company A is involved in the corporate fitness industry and has offered me 2 positions after a 3 month interview process and they are as follows:

**1)** Full Time Salaried Position as a Fitness Professional (\~ 52k ) providing personal training services in addition to managing/overseeing a fitness facility within a business corporation. 

**2)** Part Time Personal Trainer where pay varies depending on session, 10-20 hours a week (18-57 a session)

**Company B and 1 opportunity:** 

**1)** I take a full time driver/mover position for a moving company here in the area that is $20 an hour and feel no guilt leaving behind when I start PT school come August. 

For me personally, I see the best option is to take the full time offer as it will help improve my current situation the most. I'll just deal with the repercussions in July when I tell them I am going to quit for PT School. I know how corporations and universities work as they view employees as expendable so deep down I know not too feel bad about the situation.

So my questions to you my fellow good redditors is what is the best approach when the time comes for informing my employer that I will be leaving in July to start PT school in the most professional manner? And do you think I am being foolish in taking the full time role knowing that I will be starting PT school come August?

1inbh0e,Looking for online part-time program options while I’m on maternity leave 🇨🇦,"Any Canadians here? 

I’m currently on an 18 month mat leave and moving out of my family home (partner and I have recently split). I don’t want to go back to my previous job, it involves pretty frequent travel and with 3 kids I can’t do that anymore. I worked as an account coordinator and mainly worked in corporate events. Previously, I worked as a retail manager for 15 years. I’m looking to further my education (online, part-time) and I’m interested in either law or HR. Are there any other sectors I should be looking into? Project management is something I’m familiar with so this is also a possibility. I’d like to work a hybrid position (WFH a few days a week) once I’m done my mat leave to help offset the costs of daycare. 

The schools I’ve been looking at are Durham College, George Brown and Humber College. Any other good options? Im local to the GTA but open to all of Canada since it’s online.

Any advice is appreciated! ",Distinct-Art9107,1,1.0,0,1739313054,2025-02-11 22:30:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1inbh0e/looking_for_online_parttime_program_options_while/,2,2025
1inbbri,Need advice - resume; very odd career change circumstances,"So I completed a first bachelor's degree in religious research as a result of having a heart attack/out of body experience. That took about 4 years (2018/2021). I was also working full time doing water tower welding and some other positions. I had a serious injury incident, followed by a surgery that did nothing to address the issue. After horrible issues with the V.A., university of Maryland medical and even John Hopkins, I found out I had undiagnosed severe nerve damage - my rhomboid and serratus no longer work. I found out I would have to change careers or chose to have my should rebuilt every several years.

  
The surgery that followed my first degree required several months of recovery. Having realized my new physical limitations, I was going to have make a career adjustment. I went back to the same school to pursue a comp sci degree only to realize how much of a joke large portions of the school was. 

I then went to another school, currently attending university of Maryland. Pursuing second bachelor's degree in comp sci and really enjoying it. 

  
So my issue is that the majority of my work history involves skills I've been forced to put down. Additionally, I really have no interest in those skills and am loving tech but due to the fact that I was at school for about 4 years, then had surgery, then had severe covid, and then starting going back to school, I'm having trouble figuring out how to best work up a resume. I'm 40. 

So in short school:

2018-2021: degree 1/water tower welding/residential repairs/residential and industrial painting/mechanical work in warehouses

some of 2021: realized the school I was attending did not meet my standards for the tech degree

 most of 2021: surgery, horrible covid, basically spent time investigating and not working much living on the stupid high pay I got from welding

2023-present: UM comp sci major.

  
scattered throughout this time, while in school, I did some temp warehouse work and gig work. There were a couple of short terms jobs for various reasons. I tried doing an hour/hour-and-a-half commute for one job...yeah no way that was not sustainable. Tried working for amazon DSP only to find out it is legal human exploitation (will not use amazon prime after seeing how exploitative and disgusting it is but that's another conversation)

As far as how to explain the situation regarding cover letters, resumes, etc. I hear different things. I also live in an area with shit opportunity. When I do find something I truly want it is highly likely I will have to move. That's fine, but right now, I cannot afford the time to do long commutes with school and work. 



Does anyone have any guidance regarding resumes for a situation such as mine? Not sure what I should and should not put, and how I should explain my situation. Specifically, my resume would target decent jobs that allow me to work and go to school or applications for internships. 

I honestly feel like I'm starting over. The majority of the skills I've developed are very physical and not an option. Other skills involve sales, management. These are skills that I find utterly repulsive in and of themselves, but would be happy to apply them in lager context that I enjoy (say, tech?)

1inb41n,Mentor keeps bothering me to change my route,"Hi guys, so this might seem like a rant so I apologize for that. I am in a huge dilemma right now. I am right now in college almost finishing up my prerequisites for nursing. I was talking to my mentor on how I don't really like dealing with poop and sometimes can't stand vomit. Ever since I told him that he has been bugging me non-stop on how I should change my major into something less clinical in science. 

Now I understand what I am putting myself in. I know nursing is such a rough job but I still choose it because I like to make an impact on others, my passion for science and the money. I am very reluctant to go to graduate school because I cannot afford it at all. I grew up in a low income household so I am completely against majoring into something where I can not afford basic stuff. I know people who gets a higher degree like master or doctorate makes an affordable living most of the time. But for me the thing is I don't know what's going to happen in the future. What if I can't go to graduate school for some reason, then what? I am stuck with a bachelors degree in biology that's paying me the same amount as if I work in fast food. 

  
It's honestly annoys me whenever my mentor does this. I know he means well and I told him that I might not do bedside nursing but he still insist on me becoming a biologist or chemist. I don't have a problem with either of those majors it's just that I am going to be in school for a longer time. More time = more money. I am poor my mother didn't have no college fund for me. When I explained this to him he said that I can get a scholarship or people in graduate school don't really pay with loans they do it with scholarships.

1inaqjm,Should I take it?,"Hello all. I’m struggling with a career decision. I’ve been with my company for 7 years. They are a small family owned company, and gave me my first real job out of college. Over the past 2 years, things have been going a little downhill with the company. The owners decided to open a new office in another state, and they all moved there. At first things were fine, we all collaberated and got what we needed to done without feeling like they ever left. However, things started going downhill a few months after leaving. We have a few employees and we are overworked because my boss takes on new clients constantly without the man power to cover all these accounts. Slowly we started to become 2 different offices. Our office takes on the world load while their workload stays calm. We expressed how we need more people, and they hired family members to help out without properly training them, leaving us with fixing mistakes and issues that they should be taking care of. If we need a day off or if we wanna take vacation we come back totally backed up with work because no one knows enough to take over temporarily while we are gone so we question whether or not to take time off. Meanwhile they are constantly taking vacation time leaving us with their work and phone calls. Just this week they are all taking a vacation to Florida without discussing who’s doing what. It happens all the time, because they are constantly taking time off. I get paid well for the field I’m in, but I do feel overwhelmed by the work load and constantly picking up the slack for others. 
We recently lost 3 employees over this. And they were great people with massive accounts so their accounts had to be divided with other people, leaving us to fix problems for people who are not properly trained in the state they moved to, family members and such. 
The perks of my job is that yes I could take time off, I could make up my time without using vacation or person time if I wanted to. They’re very family friendly, they have a family first mentality. They give annual raises decent holiday bonuses every year. And even though they are sinking us with work, they do feel like my second family because I’ve been there for so long.
I was offered a job today for a huge corporation. It’s not a huge pay increase but I have the ability to work from home. And the job seems straight forward. I have a fear of change. I’m used to having a flexible job with the perks I mentioned above. I would only be making 4K more a year. But it’s steady job with growth opprotunities if I wanted. My ex coworkers work for this company and they say they love it. But I can’t get over this nagging fear that I will regret my decision if I decide to take this job. I just don’t know the future of my current company. They could easily close our office. The office itself has issues, leaky roofs, mice, always something breaking, I have a fear of them getting tired of constantly spending money to fix things and they just decide to close. It doesn’t feel very steady anymore, even though they assure me that it’ll never happen (the office closing) but there are constant problems with accounts as well, to the point where our clients will take their business elsewhere. So I’m struggling with my decision as to whether or not I should take this job, mostly because I do not know what to expect from such a big corporation with over 50,000 workers worldwide.

1in9t4d,"How do you get past the permanent state of anxiety, stress and paranoia created by a toxic ex-boss?","I joined my current role in August 2023 in a newly-built department/team started in Jan 2023. The VP was hired in Jan 2023 and the Director - my immediate boss (now ex-boss) and the subject of this post - was subsequently hired in March 2023. The goal was for the 2 of them to build out and develop the team, create frameworks and processes, make it a mature and sophisticated function etc.

Right after I joined in Aug 2023, I discovered that there was some tension between the VP - I'll call him S- and the Director, my boss - I'll call her J. Pretty much from the beginning, J would constantly keep telling me that S was an obstacle for her to be able to do her job properly, doesn't provide her with any support or backup, doesn't stand up for her etc. In addition, J claimed that S had no idea how to actually perform in the role. 

This just got worse and worse over the months I was there. J would constantly complain to us, her direct reports, about how bad S was. At one point, in Dec 2023, she even tried to get rid of J by submitting an anonymous complaint to our ethics committee about some side projects S was doing, which she claimed were a conflict of interest. Nothing came out of it though.

J got steadily more and more unhinged as the months went on. In early 2024, she started to become convinced that S was trying to get rid of her. She told us that S disliked her, and our specific team (S oversees 3 different teams), and that he wants to get rid of all of us. She would constantly tell us that our jobs are not safe, and she was the only one standing between us and S getting rid of our team. 

She eventually stopped our team communications on MS Teams because she was convinced that IT was listening in on us. She would only call us on WhatsApp, and only do so after work hours. She would constantly call me, multiple times every week after hours, and complain to me about how much S sucked, all the things wrong with the company, and how we were all living on borrowed time. Not even kidding - she would do this multiple times a week. 

In March 2024, she had her performance review with S, which did not go well. She flipped out and complained to the CEO and the HR VP, and asked them to conduct a review on S, claiming he was retaliating against her. 

Around this time, her behaviour got crazier and crazier. I was on vacation in March, and she would be sending me LinkedIn and Indeed job postings *while I was on vacation*, telling me to apply because my job may be in jeopardy. She also started to go behind S's back and started talking to VPs in our parent company, trying to convince them to let her report to them instead of S. She seemed to have some kind of antagonistic relationship with multiple people within the organization. 

She kept telling us that we needed to b away from S by the end of 2024 or our jobs would be in jeopardy. throughout all this, the personal calls and WhatsApp team calls where she ranted, vented and complained continued unabated. 

It all came to a head in July 2024, when one day S gathered us all in a meeting and told us that J was no longer with the organization. I was terrified at first because J had put the idea in my head that our whole team was in danger. But our initial meetings with S went perfectly fine - he told us that it would be business as usual, we would get a new Director soon, and whatever happened between him and J had nothing to do with us. 

I still spent the next few months in a state of anxiety and worry, not knowing exactly what would happen. But...nothing happened. It indeed was business as usual and what's more, I discovered that J was lying through her teeth about S, the VP. He was much, much more knowledgable, supportive and easygoing than she had made it seem, and I started to find myself really enjoying working for him.

Fast-forward to the present day now, 8 months since J was fired. I had my annual performance review recently, and it went really well. We have a great new Director and the team is progressing swimmingly.

All the same...there are still times when I feel that same sense of dread, anxiety and stress, that my job actually isn't safe, and that I could be laid off at any moment. There has been zero indications of this though - our team has grown, there has been no layoffs, and I am busier than ever with important projects and deliverables. 

How do I get past this? Any advice?",keepfighting90,3,0.800000011920929,0,1739308907,2025-02-11 21:21:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1in9t4d/how_do_you_get_past_the_permanent_state_of/,2,2025

Majority of my experience is in customer service and sales which I found to be soul sucking and was miserable even though money was good.

Accounting, while probably pretty boring, seems to be a very stable and well paying career path which is mostly what I’m after.

Last week I was inviting her and other department to a conversation and instead of accepting / reaching out to me with her questions she shoot a giant  disturbing email blaming me I don't give her enough time to prepare for answering questions, then after my calm explanation that her team won't be questioned and furthermore we are going to  meet to explain blockers, she joined the meeting and every time she heard new requests shared by another team, she was interrupting and asking if that team communicated their request with me and I just forgot to share. Because of her ""comments"" even my current manager though I really forgot to communicate something that in reality was never requested before.

I am shocked because of her behavior and never been in such a situation. While being on that team I was respected and never had others crossing my personal boundaries. What are my options for providing her a feedback that will result in avoiding similar situations? No one from my current team wants to work with her team because they had the same problems when she was failing the deadline and blaming others, but with me - looks like she crossed the line. I am much younger professional than majority of the company, and there are no feedback mechanisms I can use other then complaining to my current manager, who's hearing the same problems from 3 different employees and can't do anything with her behavior.

1in6e90,How can I progress with a background in Cost Estimation? Anyone ever find a business job they actually liked?,"I graduated with a B.S. in Supply Chain at the end of 2022, and have been working as a Product Cost Estimator for a defense and military technology contractor for just over 2 years now. However, at my job there is no defined path for me to grow. 

I feel stuck because I am not sure I even like cost estimation and I am not entirely interested in Supply Chain functions like procurement, inventory management, demand planning, etc. anymore.

Tbh, I don’t even know if I like corporate life at all. I work in a highly corporate environment now and it freaking blows. The required in person hours to just sit in meeting after meeting, complete tasks in a fraction of the time just to sit around and look like you are working (and if you keep saying you have capacity, the company will just keep giving you more and more without increasing your compensation). 

I am looking to move for a pay raise, a change in industry, and hopefully to find what I like to do, but I am afraid all I will end up learning is that all corpo jobs just suck. I have been applying to some DoD civilian positions and some in the Oil and Gas industry but I am afraid all the jobs will just be the same. 

But also I am afraid my experience as a cost estimator doesn’t really translate to anything else.

1in63xm,29 and still lost. How can I make a career pivot?,"Hi everyone! First-time poster here, looking for some advice. I was born and raised in southern Spain. Since I was a kid, I always excelled in studying and learning—I’ve only ever failed one exam in my entire life. But despite that, I feel lost at 29, still trying to figure out my place in this world.

I moved to Madrid at 18 to pursue a dual bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Relations. Back then, I was full of ambition, aiming for a big corporate career. I interned as an auditor at EY, completed a government-funded MBA, and took a role at the Spanish Embassy in Thailand for a year. Then I spent 2 years in Colombia in business development for an IoT company, followed by nearly 2 more years in Saudi Arabia doing BD in the engineering sector.

Now, after 4 years in business development, I feel stuck. I never imagined myself spending my days chasing leads, making cold calls, and following up endlessly. The work doesn’t challenge me intellectually, and as soon as I lose interest, I start looking for a way out. I feel like I missed a crucial window to build real, valuable skills while working abroad.

I’m naturally curious and passionate about learning. I’ve been studying SQL, Power BI, Python, and financial modeling on Coursera and recently passed CFA Level I. I’m driven to make a career change into either finance (ideally investment) or business analytics, where I can apply these skills.

Since November, I’ve been applying to all kinds of roles (even internships just for the sake of learning and starting from scratch) but haven’t received a single interview. I’ve customized every application and reached out to recruiters, but the “entry-level” jobs all demand experience that feels impossible to gain without years of preparation.

I’m at a point where I feel exhausted, not from working hard, but from not being given a chance to prove my value. I’m really valuable but feel useless due to this “years of experience paradigm”. I’m hoping to hear advice from anyone who has faced a similar situation or has insights on how to make this pivot.

1in5poq,Anyone in sales?,"I'm aware that there have been numerous similar posts here asking essentially the same thing, but I'm mostly venting.

I'm a recent college graduate (B.S. Biology) looking to break into a role in med or pharma sales. This has been the goal for quite some time now and I'm determined to make it there one way or the other. I have 5+ years experience in hospitality management and 3+ working as clerical staff for a chain of clinics (6 to be exact) owned by a hospital for numerous MDs, DOs, NP-Cs etc. and I believe that my background in science as well as skills honed in my years in the work force make me a pretty good fit for the role.

I recently applied and made it through two rounds of interviews for a small, privately owned pharma company who promoted an opportunity for entry level candidates to gain experience in the medical sales force (The base salary was a mere $30K. Like I said- ENTRY LEVEL.) | believe that I nailed the interview and was optimistic that I would receive a job offer. The interviewer spoke to me about what my day to day would look like, how training would go (told me to be prepared to fly out of state for a week to undergo part of the training), and discussed the benefits of the position with me as if I was already being offered the job. To be honest, the last half of the interview seemed to be him trying to sell me on taking the position rather than me trying to promote myself as a candidate.

Flash forward to almost two weeks from the interview date and I get the call from the interviewer notifying me that I was not selected for the position. I was told that my resume and interview were great and that the only reason the hired candidate was selected was because they had previous pharma sales experience. (He did mention that he would be keeping my resume and that I had lots of potential. I'm not sure if I should feel hopeful due to that or if he was only being polite.)

In brief, I applied for an entry level medical device sales position a week later, made it through the screening interview and was offered a second interview but was called before that interview to be told that the position was being filled by another candidate who, again, had prior experience in med sales. Do you understand my frustration? The words ""entry level"" were literally in the title of the position on the recruiting site.

Why are so many of these ""entry level"" opportunities being flooded with experienced candidates? I cannot imagine being a seasoned drug/med rep and applying for a position with such a low base salary. Additionally, where is one to truly find the opportunity to gain experience as an entry level employee when it appears you need prior experience to land even these positions!? I greatly appreciate and welcome any and all advice on steps to take towards breaking into this line of work from an experienced group such as this one. Are there any resume building opportunities or stepping stone jobs that would help me in securing my desired role?

1in5o4l,Failed Drugs Test,"Hi all,

I'm looking for some advice please.
On the Friday just gone i failed a drugs test at work for cannabis.

I work as a field service engineer.

As I got to work and realised a drugs test was happening I immediately went to my managing director and confessed I used the previous weekend.

I continued to take the test which I failed. They then sent me and two other memebers of staff home pending further investigation for the same reason. Failed drugs test on cannabis. 

One hour after being back home i recieved a call from my operations manager that stating that I can return to work, and that i will be having a meeting with HR on Tuesday to recieve a written warning.

So I returned to work on Monday and Tuesday, been out driving the company vans and completed jobs. 

I then come in to have my 'meeting with HR' there was no HR present in this meeting. Just my operations manager stating that they are going to suspend me pending further test results from the lab.

Our HR lady only comes in once a week. I'm assuming she works for multiple companies, she is very shoddy at best at her job.

Now I don't understand how I have been allowed to return to work, attend jobs and drive the company vehicle with them knowing I have cannabis in my system. Only for them to turn around and suspend me after completing work for the last two days.

My other concern in that one member of staff did not turn up to the office that day and was given a heads up that there will be a drugs test. This has happened to this individual for the last 3 drug tests. Another member of staff just straight up refused a drugs test and nothing was said to him.

Now I know that certain individuals have been looked after in this regard by either their managers or the operations manager. And I'm pretty sure I can get proof.
My current operations manager was my team leader over a year ago and he and the then ops manager both covered for me by sending me out to work before the tester arrived.

I know I'm more that likely going to lose my job, however I can't help but think that my company have breached some sort of rule by allowing me and both other members to return to work knowing we have cannabis in our system.
And also the favouritism of certain individuals who have 'missed' this drugs test the last 3 occasions.

I just really want to know do I have any leg to stand on and fight for my job regarding this. Or is it now up to the gods to decide my fate?

1in5lvr,Any Advice?,"Hello! I need some advice so I am 23 years old I honestly don't know what I want to do with my life. I feel like a loser.

I did dietary aid and cna but ending up quitting because they wanted me to work full time while going to school.

1in5krh,Which job to choose?,"Hey guys!

In the past, I worked as a programmer and and after that as sales representative, but after few years, I’d like to return—at least partially to the IT field.

The thing is, I got accepted for two positions. Problem now is that I now have to choose between them, and well… and I’m pretty indecisive, haha 😆

Position 1:

User and Technical Support Specialist for a small company (\~10 employees).

The company specializes in fuel management systems, attendance tracking, GPS monitoring of corporate vehicles, and similar technologies.

Position 2:

LMS Consultant for a relatively larger company (70-80 employees).

This company focuses solely on software solutions across various , both private and public sectors. My role would specifically involve e-learning software.

  
1)Since it’s a small company, it seems that the position involves multiple roles. One would be handling customer communication, managing the company’s application, creating/editing documentation for apps, automating internal processes, and a little programming.

2)Set up LMS for our customers. Design solutions tailored to the client. Participate in the creation of offers. Communicate proactively with customers. Keep the client’s LMS up to date. Install additional plugins. Install LMS . Depending on taste, also train, develop, etc.

My Dilemma:

The first company offers a significantly higher salary compared to the second one.

However, I’m aware that the second position likely has better long-term career growth opportunities than technical support. However, I can imagine myself in both positions.

So my question: What do you think? Which offer would you choose? Which field do you see as having more potential for the future?",Cheap_Rub_3424,2,1.0,2,1739298614,2025-02-11 18:30:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1in5krh/which_job_to_choose/,2,2025
1in5f28,When to ask for raise,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in the process of finishing my BS that I have been doing online for the past few years. I will be done at the end of May, which seems like the normal point at which I should ask to discuss a raise. However, we do our compensation discussions with raises, annual bonuses, RSUs, etc. at the beginning of March every year, so in about 3 weeks. Even though I will not officially have the degree yet, I will be 100% getting it less than 3 months later.

My question is if I should consider bringing this up in March during the compensation discussion in hopes of a larger raise instead of waiting until June when I have the degree in hand. Or, should I keep it under wraps until it is done? Or, should I plant the seed that I will be asking to have another discussion in a few months?

Other details in case anyone is wondering:
- The degree is in a related field to what I do for work.
- There’s no chance I don’t finish or fail my last courses. I have done very well in all my classes and have a high GPA.
- I have a good relationship with my management and am not afraid of having the conversation.
- My company/managers did not require a degree for my role, but nearly all equivalent roles require a degree. I got my current job based off of related military work experience.
- They know I have been working on my degree but I have not discussed my progress with them.

1in51fj,How would you handle this situation?,"Sorry this is a bit long but I need to provide context and background. TIA!

Back in 2022, I was looking around for a new job. Interviewed with someone and we really hit it off. Problem was, what they were looking for was multiple levels lower than what I was capable of. We actually stayed in contact multiple times because, while I was at a much higher level than what they could really afford, they were doing their best to accommodate my expectations. A bit of an unusual situation, but like I said, we really saw eye to eye on so many things and I guess I made a really good impression.

Fast forward a couple weeks, and the hiring manager from that company referred me to someone they knew in the same field who they were close with. This new hiring manager was looking to kickstart a team in the field I work. Next thing I know, I'm having a two hour phone conversation with this new person and exchanging emails back and forth. They were in the process of getting final approvals for the team and they were upfront there's no timeline although they wanted to do it ASAP. The conversation kind of died off and I just assumed it was never going to happen. I wasn't bitter or upset or felt used at all, they were genuinely nice and interesting people trying to figure stuff out.

Shortly after that died off, I was interviewing with a different company and ultimately accepted a job and have been really, really happy here. Best job I've ever had.

Well, last week I received an email out of the blue from the second hiring manager stating basically, ""Hey finally got that job posted! I hope you're still interested please let me know when if you apply and I'll reach out to the recruiter directly."" I checked the job posting, and sure as shit, it was based off of all those convos we had. I mean even the specific language in there was exactly what I discussed with them. It was the exact job I was hoping for so I applied and let them know. For additional context, the application was done through Workday. In the application, they had a ""desired salary"" field which was mandatory, of course, so I put in mid-range value of $225k with the hyphen ""-negotiable"" in it. These fields are dumb as hell and really pigeonhole you, but unfortunately I had to put something in there.

Today I received an email from the recruiter that said, effectively, this job tops out at $160k, with a 25% bonus ""potential"" and 15% equity RSU grant which vests over three years.

The role is a high level leadership role, not VP level but still high. The salary range for this position is between $200k to $275K. There's a massive difference there. Not to mention, it's a huge publicly traded company, and this ain't my first rodeo with public companies, so I know equity can be a huge boon to total comp. But 15% is a joke. This email floored me because of the disparity in what I thought was going to be a commensurate comp package and where they are. Oh, and did I mention, I haven't even interviewed with anyone yet? I'm extremely certain if I responded with ""ok that sounds good"" I would go through some dog and pony show and be given the job. I wouldn't bet my life on it, but there's no doubt in my mind it would happen.

Having said all that, I have no freakin clue where to go from here. This job would be a lateral move in terms of total comp, but a two level promotion in terms of title. I'm not chasing titles at all, but they do have an impact on the evolution of one's career and earning power, so that can't be ignored.

 Because of this i realised that if i got an actual job that sustained me and futreproofed me that teasing can be on the side as i only trade 6pm aest anyways.
 note that i quit uni in the first place was because not only was it demotivating failing the course, uni debt however small of an issue was still an issue, job market competition, and not knowing wha to ultimately do whilst speedrunning 3 courses in a year and a quarter are all reasons i quit .
i’m now about to turn 21 and with whatever time i have left want advice to see what i can do.

I recently managed to get out, and I really enjoyed what i was doing. I lucked into the job, I had no experience in the industry, and I wasn't even there for 3 months before things went south. The company decided to restructure and everyone on my shift was out of a job without any notice. Now I can't find anything, not even kitchen work. Temp agencies haven't been all that useful as of late. I tried working with a career counsellor, and their only suggestion was to do all of the same online career tests that i find nyself doing at least once a year, but none of the results ever spark even mild curiosity to learn more about them. I'm finding the same with any ideas that I generate on my own. I'm at a total loss here and feel stuck. I've felt stuck for years, and all of my attempts to get unstuck have failed.

I'd like to retrain for something else, but I can't afford schooling. The few programs available in Ontario seem to be for women, youth, and newcomers to the country/province. And the ones that I can find that aren't, I don't qualify for. I don't really have much of a network to reach out to. I'm usually pretty distant with coworkers, so i rarely get anyone's contact info and its just as rare that I give out mine, or accept friend requests on social media - i barely use those apps as it is. I don't have many friends i can go to either, I lost most of them when my marriage ended. I don't really have ""family"" either, I'm estranged from my relatives, so no help there either. Even AI was a pretty useless tool in this situation.

Here are the concerns: 
1. My current job is of an Admin. I took this job only as a temporary job so I have something while I look for better job opportunities. I believe I am slightly overqualified for this job. 
2. I’ve been in my current job for 4 months and they told me they will support me in the Green card Process. My current supervisor seems happy with my work. 
3. This new job opening seems perfect for my education and experience. However, I am worried they might see me as nothing more than an administrator.

I don’t know what the right move is. I want to grow in my career and feel like I am in a job that suits my educational background. But I also don’t want to risk anything, specially my green card, if I get rejected for this position.

1in26ya,Psychotherapy or OT career advice,"I am 26, from the UK, and I achieved my undergrad psychology with sociology degree a couple of years ago. Since then my focus hasn’t been a career, instead I have worked a variety of jobs and travelled as much as possible. I am now reaching a point where I’d like to progress into a career. The paths I feel most drawn to are Psychotherapy and Occupational Therapy. I have worked as an assistant in a variety of healthcare settings which I’ve always enjoyed as I got to experience specialities without committing to years of training, however this limits my opportunities for progression. 

Psychotherapy has long been a top option for me. I am fascinated by how we nativgate our inner an outer worlds. I also have great interpersonal skills and have become well practiced in navigating difficult and emotionally charged conversations, which I find so rewarding. Lastly I have also been lucky enough to have received great therapy and the prospect of providing this for others is exciting. However the emotional weight and responsibility of this path is daunting. 

My latest job was an an OT and Physio assistant. Contributing to people’s empowerment through recovery and disability was incredibly rewarding. However I was disheartened when time and money constraints lead to a hospital discharge conveyor belt feeling.  

My main concerns with committing to any career is monotony (I know an element of this is unavoidable), therefore a career with variability, novelty, and progression is important for it to be sustainable for me.

I know jobs can be romanticised and therefore I would really value the opinions and insights of Psychotherapist and Occupational Therapists (training, new, and seasoned) ideally in the UK. Things like advantages, disadvantages, things to consider before taking the leap, and opportunities for progression. 

I really appreciate any thoughts on this. ",Humble-Trouble3420,2,1.0,0,1739290312,2025-02-11 16:11:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1in26ya/psychotherapy_or_ot_career_advice/,2,2025

I'm having trouble finding work in Ontario, Mississauga area. I've lived here my whole life, 38 years, in the GTA and never had such difficulty getting an interview, let alone a job.

* I recently got my **Security Guard license** and applied to every position and company, but only received rejection emails and 1 video interview.
* I have 3 years experience working **Technical Support** roles over the phone, but these roles seem to have disappeared.
* I have a **Social Service Worker** College diploma as well, but haven't heard from anyone.
* I've tried **no-skills** and **no-experience** jobs as well. Costco, Walmart, grocery stores, hotels, Pepsi, etc.
* I've worked with *Employment Agencies* but they seem to be overwhelmed. They helped ""clean up"" my resume but otherwise did not provide any job search strategies or resources.
* I have several years experience working with **Older Adults**, and other roles.

I'm really not sure what to do. It is a very difficult market, and I feel like I'm not getting anywhere.

I was talking to the assistant manager and she said I have a good case to sit down with the store manager and negotiate a decent raise more in produce manager territory. 

Other than that I know I can go to competition  and get what I'm looking for for pay with my experience but I'd rather not leave here.

1imynks,"Career change: is it ""too late"" for tech and/or finance?","TLDR: 34m, married with 2yo, BA in Philosophy (3.7 GPA), lifelong restaurant worker with management experience. I want to pivot to finance or tech (data analyst or cybersecurity). Are those job markets really that oversaturated right now? Is it the entire job market? Will my restaurant experience (leadership, problem solving, budget management, data-driven decision making) help set me apart from other entry level candidates? Should I just stick with my ""safe"" job that I (mostly) hate, but has potential for upward mobility?

The long story: I've been in the restaurant industry for 16 years (minus a couple years off running my own health coaching business and activism); the last 3 years in full-time management. The money isn't terrible (65k, my wife also makes 65k) but it isn't great. If I stay in food and beverage, I will have opportunities to move into senior leadership and make more money; but I'm burnt out and ready for a new career, preferably one with more financial upside.

I really excelled at math as a kid (AP Calc 1&2 and AP Stats in high school), but I pivoted to liberal arts in college. I'd really like to get into a career that can get me back into using the math/analytic part of my brain, which leads me to tech/finance. I see mixed opinions on the job market. Some say they are way oversaturated with mass layoffs. Some say these fields have the best career outlooks moving into the future. 

I'm interested in Cybersecurity, but I've been looking hard at Data Analysis in particular. I like that it has a broader range of applications and fields, but also a potential pathway into financial analysis, which I already know I enjoy. I just started a Udemy course on Financial Modeling and Valuation in Excel. Afterwards I plan to take some free beginner Cybersecurity courses. This is mostly just to gauge my interest in each field and help make a decision on what to pursue.

1imvu1n,Will I get rejected if I can’t start on the employer’s preferred date?,"I recently had an interview for an internship where everything seemed to go okay (4 managers were there for an INTERN), but the employer asked if I could start much earlier than I had planned. I told them the earliest I can start is July but preferably August or September (due to my post-grad university commitments), but they seemed to prefer someone who could begin in March or April ""due to budget reasons"". They were impressed by my resumé and language-skills.

They didn’t explicitly say I was out of the running, but at the end they also didn’t ask if I had any final questions or mention when they’d get back to me, or anything like that, which makes me think they’ve already moved on. They said an earlier start date is because of ""budget-reasons"" (if they don't use their budget for internships fully this year, they won't get the same amount next year. Typical government.). I would be a government employee.

I’m wondering:

* How much does a later start date really hurt my chances?
* Would they take a less qualified candidate just because they can start earlier?

1imvc4k,Internship with a startup in Italy,"**Hello everyone,**

I'm 25 years old and I live in Bologna. I'm about to graduate with a master's degree in media and marketing, and I recently came across a job posting on LinkedIn from this startup. They're looking for someone to handle digital marketing and communication, including running ad campaigns and managing their WordPress website.

I actually had an interview yesterday, and the environment seemed young—maybe *too* young. From what I gathered, I would be pretty much on my own in this role. There were also a few moments where they said things like *""We're looking for someone with obsession and hunger because obsession beats talent""* or *""It's not out of malice if you end up working alone, it's just that everyone here is trying not to drown in their own pile of tasks.""*

I get that it's a startup, I really do. And honestly, a full-time job in Bologna for €750 a month, with the possibility of a permanent contract (even with the rising cost of everything), is still a decent way to start. This is what's available. Despite the LinkedIn post only being up for half a day (don't ask me why), there were already 51 applicants.

I've been ""working"" for years in a nonprofit back home as a social media manager, content creator, and event organizer—handling everything from contracts to hospitality. So I know what it's like to be in an environment where everyone focuses on their own tasks. But trying to fill such a huge gap (their socials are completely inactive and lacking any initiatives) as someone new to the team, where the expectation seems to be that I’ll have a senior-level skillset, doesn’t seem very realistic.

The interview gave me a good impression, but I also got the feeling that I could easily burn out, not knowing where to start or just being afraid of making mistakes that could create even more problems for the company. I have a lot of ideas, but it would be safer for both me and the company (which is looking for a *junior* figure) if they also brought in a senior to guide me. However, from what I understood, they've never really considered investing in this area until now, which surprises me a bit—although, willing or not, they've still managed to make a name for themselves without much marketing, since it's a really solid tech startup.

What do you think? Do you have any advice for me? Should I just accept that this is the standard situation and push through without being too afraid of making mistakes?

**P.S.** Please don’t judge me if my questions sound silly—I just want an honest discussion! Thanks so much to anyone who replies. 😊",FlounderCultural7368,2,1.0,1,1739268595,2025-02-11 10:09:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imvc4k/internship_with_a_startup_in_italy/,2,2025

1imuwas,"24, F, Australia - stuck in a rut & would love some outside advice or perspective","I’d love some advice on my situation—what would you do in my position? I’m open to all thoughts and suggestions, even differing opinions.

After finishing high school, I wasn’t sure what career path I wanted to take, but I knew I wanted to go to university. So, like many others, I chose a general degree - business. Even throughout uni, I never felt strongly drawn to any particular subject.

Fast forward five years post-graduation, I’ve had two careers - first in Human Resources, now in Marketing. Both have been fine, but neither feels fulfilling. I feel stuck in a rut, and I’m struggling to figure out my next step. Honestly, I don’t think the traditional corporate world is for me. I need something more hands-on and fast-paced.

Before corporate life, I worked a variety of jobs - movie theatres, cafes, kids’ parties, bartending, and supervising at a pub. I’ve always thrived in dynamic, people-focused environments. Sitting behind a desk all day was a major adjustment, and while I’ve adapted, it’s made work feel repetitive and unexciting.

That being said, my business degree gives me the flexibility to pivot into something new. I’ve considered roles like sales, which are more interactive, but I’ve always struggled with having too many career interests and no clear frontrunner.

A few areas I’ve been drawn to:
	•	Medical field (but nothing too trauma-related - surgery, heavy blood, and exposed bone aren’t for me)
	•	Operations & logistics - fast-paced, varied, and not just sitting at a desk all day
	•	Police, Army, or Air Force - structured, high-energy, and purposeful
	•	Real estate sales - high earning potential, people-focused, and a mix of field and office work

Some of my strengths include project management, problem-solving, handling pressure efficiently, stakeholder management, and adaptability. As a person, I’m independent, always willing to help, and naturally curious. I want to be successful, but boredom and lack of stimulation have drained my motivation.

My ideal career:
	•	More hands-on than a traditional desk job
	•	High-paying with strong financial potential
	•	People-focused - I thrive in roles where I can interact, engage, and build relationships with others
	•	Work-life balance - whether that’s structured flexibility or periods of intense work followed by extended breaks

I’m open to going back to uni if it leads to something meaningful, but I hesitate to commit to years of study without knowing if I’ll truly enjoy the career.

From an outside perspective, what do you think?",Anamaraxo,1,1.0,0,1739266550,2025-02-11 09:35:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imuwas/24_f_australia_stuck_in_a_rut_would_love_some/,2,2025

I’m currently a first-year student studying **Cardiac Technology** in India, and I’m trying to get a clearer idea of the career prospects in this field. Specifically, I’m curious about the following:

1. **Salary Expectations**: What is the typical salary range for a cardiac technologist with a bachelor’s degree? How does this change with experience or additional certifications?
2. **Working Abroad**:
   * What are the opportunities for cardiac technologists to work abroad, particularly in countries like the UK, US, or Canada?
   * What steps or certifications are required to qualify for jobs in these countries?
   * Are there any recommended study or work programs that can help me move abroad after my degree?

1imus13,"When asking for a raise, should you anchor to a specific amount or just let them make the first offer?","**TL;DR: I know when negotiating a salary for a new job, you don't want to ""anchor"" by being the first to mention a number. Is that also the case when negotiating a raise, or is it generally better to ask for a specific number?**

My wife is an Athletic Director and she has been at a Grades 6-12 private school for over 15 years. She is a valuable part of the school, and she loves it, but she is underpaid compared to the market.

She put together a list of 4 comps; all current job openings. She plans to show this to her boss when they meet:

School 1 - Director of Athletics

* Salary $165-180K
* 24 sports (11 MS, 13 HS)
* Has their own athletic facilities

School 2 - Director of Athletics

* Salary $100-150K
* 28 sports (10 MS, 18 HS)
* Has their own athletic facilities

School 3 - Associate Athletic Director, PE Teacher (essentially MS AD)

* Salary $80-140K
* 14 sports (7 MS, 7 HS)
* MS has their own athletic facilities
* HS does not have their own athletic facilities (they just started the HS two years ago)

School 4 - Middle School Athletic Director, PE Teacher

* Salary $52-96K
* 24 sports (9 MS, 15 HS)
* Has their own athletic facilities

Current School - Middle School and High School Athletic Director

* Current Salary $98,134
* 18 sports (8 MS, 10 HS)
* Does not have their own athletic facilities 

As you can see, she is essentially earning a Middle School Athletic Director's salary, while acting as a MS and HS AD (with twice as many teams as a MS AD), and while a big part of her job is reserving gym and field space around town, because they don't have their own facilities!

Two more things... to be fair, while the number of sports teams is similar, the enrollment at her school is significantly less than the other 4 comps (but we are not putting that in the comp sheet!). 

* School 1: 422 students
* School 2: 636 students
* School 3: 341 students
* School 4: 668 students
* Current School: 130 students

Also unfortunately, due to declining enrollment, the school is not doing so well financially. So even if her boss agrees that she is underpaid, there might not be many funds to allocate toward her raise.

Ok now for the questions:

1. Should she ask for a certain amount, like $140K? Or should she just put the comp sheet in front of her boss, show that she is underpaid, and ask to be given a raise ""to bring me up to market rate"" or something like that, instead of naming a figure first? I know about ""anchoring"" and typically when negotiating a new job salary, you don't want to mention the first number. But is that also the case when negotiating a raise?

2. What do you think is a fair number to ask for, given the comps? 

Thank you in advance!

PS Preemptively, some of you might say that she should just apply for and take one of those other jobs. She loves her school, and would prefer to stay where she is and get a raise. A couple of notes about each:

School 1 - Commute would be really terrible, likely an hour each way in traffic. Also it's an all girls school, so our boys wouldn't be able to go there (they would get a significant employee discount at her current school.) But I'm encouraging her to apply and go through the interviewing process anyway.

School 2 - Even farther away; not really an option

School 3 - She's thinking about applying for this one, as it's a lot closer than her current school. It would be a step down to a MS AD role, but she'd likely get the top of the salary range (or more), so it would be more money than she's currently making. 

School 4 - Doesn't really make sense to take a step down and a pay cut",pfbounce,1,1.0,0,1739265982,2025-02-11 09:26:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imus13/when_asking_for_a_raise_should_you_anchor_to_a/,2,2025

1imtx7q,Really just trying to come up with options,"Sorry if this comes out sounding like a sob story; this year has been off to a rough start. My wife and I have both lost our jobs. The gas station I worked at was sold on New Year's Eve, and the whole staff was fired. I got an interview and promise of a job at Wingstop the next day, but a number of issues kept coming up - managers getting fired and such. 

It took over a month for me to finally be put on the schedule. I got two days of training before the busiest day of the year, Superbowl Sunday, and the district manager fired me when I expressed my confusion and anxiety. So now, rather than spending the last month looking for a job, I've been left twiddling my thumbs with nothing to show for it.

I'll be 37 this year. I've worked in call centers, gas stations, and fast food places my whole life. My longest job was 3 years at Bush's Chicken as a cook, so my work history isn't exactly flattering. 

I've learned I don't do well in the call center environment - good at customer service, just not so much on the phones. After this experience with Wingstop, the thought of food service makes me more than a little anxious. I'll work another gas station if I have to, but with my wife out of work now, too, I'm hoping I can find something above minimum wage. I've thought about things like construction. I actually worked at the Tesla factory in Austin for a few months, but I'm just not in good enough physical shape for that kind of work.

I'm about a semester short of a Bachelor's degree in IT/system design with nothing but a little over $60k in debt to show for it. I'm good with computers. I'm good with people. I can be organized and efficient, and I enjoy learning and solving problems. My Myers-Briggs type is INTJ; I make calculated decisions and like to fix things. There's never a place for any of this on a job application, though.

TL;DR

With all that being said, I just don't know what else I can do. I know there are other jobs out there, but I don't know what to look for. Any ""dream job"" I can think of is way beyond my reach at this point, and the ones I can think to just go out and apply for (i.e. gas stations) probably won't pay enough to support my family.

1imsbmp,Don’t really enjoy my career/job (biostatistics) and wondering where to go from here,"Hi, I don’t know if I’m going through a quarter-life crisis or what, but I’d appreciate some guidance and advice!

I have a background in public health and am working as a biostatistician at a large company. I don’t know if I dislike the work, but I frankly don’t love my team - I was never properly trained, so I still feel so lost a few years into my job. I enjoy cleaning and analyzing data in SAS, but I feel like I don’t understand the basics of the work we do. Even though I can crunch the numbers, I don’t feel confident speaking to what the analyses entail. When I ask for guidance, I’m told to just do what I’m assigned and to worry about “understanding” later, but later never comes around.

That said, because of my experience in my current role, I don’t feel confident that I could be successful pursuing this path as a biostatistician. I would naturally want to advance in my career (i.e., step into more senior level roles), but I don’t feel qualified.

I’m debating if I want to pivot into a tangential career path (where would I even go from here?) or if I should seek a more senior-level biostatistics role elsewhere. I do think I enjoy the programming part of my job more than thinking about the analyses, so maybe something like data science? But I feel like those types of roles require more hard skills and programming knowledge beyond SAS, so it feels difficult to pivot into that.

Are there careers that folks pivoted into from biostatistics that they enjoyed more? I actually wanted to do more epidemiological work when I was in school, but admittedly it‘s hard to find roles that offer pay that’s competitive, especially given the numbers I see in the biostatistics field.

Any advice and guidance would be greatly appreciated!",anotherthrowaway030,1,1.0,0,1739255145,2025-02-11 06:25:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imsbmp/dont_really_enjoy_my_careerjob_biostatistics_and/,2,2025
1imsawq,23M lost and don’t know what to do in my life,"Hey guys to preface, I’m 23 and have my degree in computer science, I’ve applied to programming and software engineering no bs left and right and used to be a decent programmer. Since January of last year I’ve been working random jobs that are completely unrelated to my field and the degree I have, and they’ve made me feel nothing but depressed to say the least and I come back so tired from being on my feet all day that I go to sleep. Then on my one day off per week I’m finding myself unable to get out of bed and extremely demotivated and depressed, I used to be a huge gym fanatic and now even the gym doesn’t bring me happiness like it used to.

I really don’t even know if I want to work in tech anymore, I’ve applied to a bunch of IT positions that aren’t really software engineering positions and have some experience in IT support as well, and still haven’t landed a job. I don’t know what to do, should I go back to school and get into something healthcare related? I was looking into becoming a radiography technician, is it still a thriving field with decent job opportunities? Or do you guys suggest something else? I’m sorry I don’t mean to make it sound like I’m crying and moaning about how sucky life is but I really don’t know who else to go to and I have a wife who I love and I want to be the best husband possible for her and start a family with her one day and I don’t see that happening if I don’t figure out life.

1imqse2,How to deal with difficult coworkers?,"Our manager left at the start of the year and our company has been searching for a replacement. Coworkers that were kept in check because they didn't want to get into hot water with the manager (for bullying, aggression, rudeness, etc. towards other coworkers) no longer have any real checks. There is a new director but he's been here for only 6 months and doesn't fully understand what's happening. My immediate team is made up of 2 other engineers and me. One coworker is very smart (probably has a genius IQ), has been there longest, and and knows how the entire system works better than anyone else. The other coworker is an expert in his area. I joined last and was told to treat my two other coworkers like managers/experts and should ask them questions. I have been doing that but the fact is that they are not my managers. If I underperform there are no consequences because neither one is really responsible for my performance. As a result I am now basically their punching bag. If they're having a bad day they can take it out on me--by nitpicking my work, putting me down, snapping at everything I say, and making my life miserable. The guy with the high IQ expects others to understand things as fast as he does. Both nitpick my work incessantly and sometimes I feel like they nitpick just for the hell of it. Sometimes I think the high IQ coworker views me as a threat. He seems to dislike it when I speak up at meetings when I feel like I have something to contribute. I think the second coworker is insecure and overcompensates by dismissing others' abilities (he talked about a machine learning today and said ""I think I am the only one on our team who is knowledgeable about this topic, right?"") He conveniently forgot that I also have experience in this area.

How would you deal with them? My job pays decent and has a lot of job security.

1imp2c6,can favoritism be reported at work?,"I am not sure how to approach this situation professionally; I don't wanna let my personal feelings dictate how I react.

a little bit of background information, there were about 5 to 6 people working on this site, depending on the day. I and the lead have worked there the longest, I have worked there longer, but since I am not a full-time employee, I don't get to be a lead.

Then some people left, and a few got hired, including one person who is the lead's friend out side of work. Because of that, I have noticed some unfairness some employees were being treated. For example, the lead and her friend would hang out/""work"" in the break room while other employees were working. I also noticed her friend would have a superior attitude where he would give orders to other employees because the lead is his friend

One big issue that really upsets me is how all the other employees get left out when it comes to decision-making. It doesn't matter how much we ""discuss"", the lead would only listen to her friend and ignore all other people's opinions. I remember that one time where I and another employee were working on our project, we already discussed and set up everything, but the lead would just say ""No, we are doing it this way"" (the way the lead and her friend wanted), there were also many instances where my say didn't matter, they could change whatever they wanted. I am also not communicated with when there are changes or updates, and I often get blamed for not doing the correct thing, whereas the friend could do whatever he can without getting blamed. 

Because I have worked there longer and know how to stand up for myself (sometimes), I feel so sad for the newer employees when the friend orders them around, like, they are all on the same level, I don't get how he gets to give orders.

I am not sure how this is something that could be reported to the manager?",lifesuxorfun,2,1.0,4,1739243937,2025-02-11 03:18:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imp2c6/can_favoritism_be_reported_at_work/,2,2025
1imovtw,Behaviour change after family diagnosed with illness,"I have been with my company for 3 years.
My manager has been amazing and his wife works on our team as well.
In the past year I became close with her. We talked work things, random life things and when we saw each other at the retreat, we were so close.
So I always felt that I got along with them both well. Of course he is always my manager at the end of the day. But it was a good professional relationship with him and I would say a friendship, workplace of course, with his wife.

Well my life became serious as my parent has been diagnosed with the C word. It became serious fast. Bad news after bad news.

My manager knows some, not full but the basics. What I was able to mention as I was emotional and didn’t want to say everything. His wife knows a bit but I never fully told her but I asked my manager to please tell her as I couldn’t. 
They are the only two at work that know. At least that I told. 

However, maybe I’m overthinking. But I feel they both changed.
In the last three weeks, his wife/my coworker has not messaged me. We used to catch up maybe 2-3 times a week. So it’s a change for me. I don’t understand.
Then my manager seems different. Like he barely messages me now. Before it was a “how are you? How was your weekend?” And now it’s barely that. He can go two or three days without acknowledging me. 

And during a meeting a month ago, he stated they are going to make hard choices in the coming months, meaning laying off people.
This made me anxious and tbh it was during a day where everything was already making me spiral. So that was the icing on the cake. I called him after and directly asked if my job was at risk. Maybe stupid but I was in a bad state. 

Anyways, I am just not sure how to process their changed behaviour. Maybe I’m overthinking.
But it makes me not want to mention this to anyone else at work because I don’t want anyone to change towards me. And I feel my job is at risk and that’s why they changed. 

TLDR; serious illness in my family, manager and his wife/my coworker behaviour changed. I don’t recall saying or doing anything to create a change. I might be overthinking and spiralling but scared to mention it to anyone else as I don’t want anyone else to change towards me. And feel maybe their change is either because of the illness and they don’t know what to say or how to act or my job is at risk.

1imop0q,how do i move into this new role without too much anxiety,"I recently just got a new job, and my last one that I worked at for four years was ridiculously toxic. I'm pretty much sure I will have workplace trauma for a while - I was one of the youngest people there (in my 30s) but I was pretty much the adult of the whole company - owners never cared about anything behind the scenes so everyone got away with the most immoral crazy behavior, customers were treated worse than you can ever imagine, and I was ridiculously ostracized and bullied by managers or coworkers. And, this was just a customer service job lol 

*I work hard, I can show up on time, I've done so well that I've trained co-workers (who were sent  by managers to replace me) with a smile on my face and good-faith attitude... but...*

I already have generalized anxiety, and that alone is enough for me to handle...but now I'm also scared because...there was a lot of environmental habits and emotional abusive patterns from my last job that will need to reshaped or broken.....

\- my last company didn't have a point system for being late / calling out / etc. (while I only ever had to call out on emergencies, I'm used to people leaving early during their shift, coming in late, having to beg for a day off while other people got all the time off in the world....)

\- co-workers and managers making shortcuts with absolutely everything - broken websites and system admin programs, transaction processing, etc. and getting away with it...no matter how many complaints could be made about something not working, we always just had to make it work however we could...

\- I always wore several hats wherever I worked at my last job, so I trained myself on everything and am not sure if I don't know how to ask for help and not be seen as weak

\- I have a history of being myself (hardworking, friendly, nerdy, etc.) and getting regularly ostracized or bullied by managers who gaslit me into being my friend only to abuse their authority.....*among many, MANY other issues and challenges*

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to emotionall and mentally prepare or move out of a toxic workplace environment, even if it is a book, podcast, youtube, recommendation. I want to re-learn how to trust myself, trust co-workers (at least have emotional and mental boundaries), and trust the process of starting over. Any advice would be great! Thanks.

1imo9cc,Do I need a reality check?,"Hey, I’m 28 and currently working as a senior engineer in cyber security for a large institution in London with a salary over £100k + bonus. I don’t have any technical background and pretty much worked my way through the ranks to where I am today. 

The issue I find is that the industry just doesn’t fulfil me, and as a result I find most of the time I’m generally not as interested in the field as some of my colleagues who live, breathe and sleep technology. 

I get by just fine, I’m always commended for my work but I can’t help but feel like there’s a piece missing somewhere. Maybe a touch of imposter syndrome from having come up through an unconventional route, I’m not sure. 

I realise that this may come off as contentious, I’m extremely grateful to have the job and opportunities that I have, but now I feel locked in to this field, as no other field really pays this well without a lot of eduction and retraining.

 I know it’s not ‘all’ about the money, but in the absence of any other direction I’ve just kind of stuck with it. 

So do I need a reality check? Would love some wisdom here. ",thelackingoutage,1,1.0,0,1739241538,2025-02-11 02:38:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imo9cc/do_i_need_a_reality_check/,2,2025
1imnwur,Stuck Between Two Jobs – Need Advice,"I’m currently debating between two job options and could really use some outside perspective. A bit about me—I value stability, a slow-paced work environment, and flexibility. I don’t particularly enjoy work and prefer to keep stress to a minimum. That said, I also have financial goals, so compensation is a factor.

Here are the two options:

Job A (Current Job)

Pros:

Easy work, no real stress
Boss is super chill
Flexible schedule, can work from home 2-3 days a week
Total commute: ~6 hours per week

Cons:

No real promotion or career growth
Not learning anything new
Pay is okay but nothing special
Job B (Potential New Job)

Pros:

Higher pay
Learning new things, potential to grow in advanced technologies
More career growth opportunities

Cons:

Commute increases to ~12 hours per week
Work is fast-paced and challenging
Steep learning curve, harder to adapt

I like the idea of making more money and growing my skill set, but I also don’t want to burn out. The longer commute and faster pace worry me, especially since I’m not someone who enjoys high-pressure environments. On the other hand, I don’t want to feel stuck in a dead-end role forever.

Would love to hear from people who have faced a similar decision. What would you do in my situation?

1imnd2e,Is it worth my time and $$ to attend a tech institute or UTI ??,"Is UTI worth it to learn heavy diesel and welding OR 
a school like ITT technology institute to learn computers worth the years of my life and the $$??

I’ve always wanted to work on large diesel engines like very large. The type that power oil platforms or on the remote oil pumping sites. I’ve heard the oil industry pays top dollar (100k+  starting salary).  Or possibly the railroad industry? I’m currently 44 and I’m single now and I sold my house and most my large possessions. so I’m not tied down to any location.  Since I’m not 18 fresh outa high school anymore 2 years of schooling is a lot of my life now and I’m trying to make alot of money from the start again 100k+ .  Unfortunately I donot have a college degree and Ive been an in-home salesman for most of my “career”.  I don’t have a ton of auto or diesel experience but I am very mechanically inclined and very good with computers( the hardware side I build my own PCs. I donot know coding at all)

I have always wanted to be able to build my own car like a 60s muscle car. I most likely could right now with all the info online. But I’d like to be ASE certified. Agsin in heavy diesel. And I figure I’d learn welding while I’m at it. 

Should I waste 2-years to be certified at UTI in heavy diesel / possibly auto too and take the welding course after the diesel. I can afford to pay the tuition outa pocket so I won’t have debt when I finish but I will be out $50K+ once I’m finished. 

I would also consider going to school for computers either coding side or something similar I haven’t looked into it what so ever. I know their is a tech school fir computers near me also. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
I know UTI post Covid is now only 3-hours a day 5 days a week in the school doing the lab. The hands on stuff. Then they do 3 hours a day at home online for the class work. I donot know how I will like this yet. Pre covid it was 6 hours daily at the school in a classroom or in the lab.

1immuv7,How reasonable is it to request a June start date?,"Hi all!

I’m currently in the final rounds of interviews for a talent role at a large tech company. However, I’m currently employed as a middle school assistant principal, which means I’m committed to the school calendar through the end of the school year. If I receive an offer, I would ideally want to start in early to mid-June (around June 9th or June 16th).

In my first interview, I *think* I may have mentioned a potential start date of late May to mid-June, but I honestly can’t remember for sure. That said, I have been very transparent throughout the process about my current role and my commitment to finishing out the school year. Despite this, they have continued to express strong interest in me—in fact, they even started considering me for a more senior role than the one I originally applied for.

So far, I’ve had six interviews and received positive feedback at every stage. My final interview is this Wednesday, and if I were to receive an offer, I assume it would come within the next two weeks.

This is a dream opportunity for me—$30K more than my current salary (not including stock options and a signing bonus) and exactly the kind of work-life balance I’m looking for (2 days remote, 3 days in office, great PTO, and paid holidays). However, I am 100% committed to my school and would not feel comfortable leaving before the end of the school year.

How reasonable would it be to formally request a start date of June 9th or June 16th? Is this a common ask, or could it be a dealbreaker?

Would love to hear from anyone who has navigated a similar situation!",VirtualCucumber9,1,0.6700000166893005,16,1739236952,2025-02-11 01:22:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1immuv7/how_reasonable_is_it_to_request_a_june_start_date/,2,2025
1immp5t,Will be passed over for future promotion opportunity,"I’ve been at my company almost three years now and between the work I’ve done, my skillset and qualifications (degrees), I thought I’d be up next for a promotion, but after speaking to my supervisor she basically made it clear that’s not in the sights for me.

My company has a rule that you have to be in your role for 1 year before being promoted, but I’ve seen that rule not apply when the person getting the promotion is someone management already had their sights on for it. When I applied for my job, a bachelor’s degree was one of the requirements, and my supervisor hired her friend who not only doesn’t have a bachelor’s, but no degree at all. Her resume listed her high school diploma and she’s in her 40s I think. This year will make it a year since she’s been with the company and in her role, and three years since I’ve been with the company.

It’s kind of frustrating thinking I’ll be passed over for a senior analyst role by someone who has a high school diploma meanwhile I have a bachelors, masters, and been with the company longer. When I discussed this with my supervisor, she made it seem as if my view is one sided and I could be doing more but am not. Meanwhile, this is the same supervisor who has told me a couple times I’ve taken on more than my fair share. 

Anyone been in a similar position? I’m thinking I should just start looking elsewhere. I feel like my supervisor wants me to go above and beyond for a promotion that’s not going to happen when she seemingly hinted at the her friend “outperforming” the rest of us.  I’m confident corporate politics plays a role in this. I thought my supervisor and I had a good relationship, but this situation has made me lose respect for her and has negatively impacted my morale.",bbySaffie,0,0.5,2,1739236493,2025-02-11 01:14:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1immp5t/will_be_passed_over_for_future_promotion/,2,2025

1immjqz,Should I stick to STEM or switch?,"Hello everyone. So long story short: Im 22 years old, and I graduated with a BS  back in august 2024. Right before graduation I had a pretty clear idea about what I’m gonna do next, but 6 months down the line, I have hit a wall and now I’m all confused and unsure. 

My major was in mathematics while my specialisation has been in Data Science. During my college days, I grew a nag for machine learning and definitely aspired to make a career out of it. However, at the same time, somehow I ended with a couple internships and a part time job in HR and Talent Management at different firms and also fell in love with that. My corporate exposure left me wanting to pursue a more business centric career path like Operations or HR. So midway, I started to consider dropping my plans for an immediate masters and rather invest a couple of years in the industry for experience, followed by an executive masters in business management or something along that line. Since I was still conflicted if I wanna go for ML/DS or HR, I decided to leave it on fate (by which i mean wherever I’d get a job first).

After graduating I landed a job as an HR Trainee but I resigned 5 months into it after realising that I haven’t really enjoyed switching from STEM all that much. Besides, the opportunity I had offered little potential for growth. What I didn’t realise was that despite my experience, getting this one role was a big coincidence and most other companies have rejected my HR portfolio on account of the fact that I do not have a degree in HR or BBA. So getting back to HR will likely not be possible without an MBA, incase I feel conflicted again about the whole stem vs corporate debate.

I haven’t faired well in the job market for Data either though as even entry level roles in my country are requiring significant experience (3-4 years) and skill levels that cannot be achieved through project work alone. Despite my portfolio and grades, most firms are interested in skillsets that cannot be mastered without actual industrial exposure.

Now I have these four questions circling my mind all the time:

1. Do i start an MBA and stick to HR? 
2. Keep trying for another HR role first despite the fact that I have low chances due to my irrelevant education background?
3. Invest getting an MS in AI or DS for better career ops in the field?
4. Keep on trying to land a job as a data analyst or ML engineer since an MS might not be a guarantor of better employment opportunities and i can rather spend the time and resources on learning the skills through courses offered online. 

I need serious advice from people who’ve been through similar circumstances or can offer any guidance in light of their own experiences.

1imlfl3,"Should my next career move be consulting, DS, or another tech role?","Throwaway because my field is really small.

Some background: I got a PhD, did a postdoc, and worked for about 3 years as a data scientist working in my niche field - which I love. 

I currently work as a consultant in the same niche field. I've been in this role for two years and have been promoted once. I like a lot about my job-- my team, the benefits, the resources & support. I don't love client work, though, so for the last year or so, I've been working more with internal development. This also means there's no upward trajectory for me at my firm.

But incoming revenue is slowing down, and the utility of internal development is facing scrutiny. It's creating a really stressful atmosphere on our team.I'm also facing challenges in finding opportunities to work with clients because clients don't need my technical expertise.  If I want to stay at this job, I'd probably have to work on projects that I'm not an expert in and not really passionate about - and I've learned since I've started that I don't even really like client work (mainly sales, self-promotion, and the competitive atmosphere that comes with a slowdown of revenue). 

Now, I actually really miss working as a DS or in tech. I also felt like I had more job security as a DS since I could easily get a job outside of my niche field.

So this is where I could use some advice. What should I pursue?

As much as I miss tech, I'm not really interested in creating cutting-edge ML. Plus, because I haven't worked in DS for so long, I'm really rusty on ML and basic software engineering principles. Does that mean I should avoid going back into DS? I like software engineering, creating data & analysis pipelines, applying complex statistical methods, etc. - all for a direct customer or client application. 

Ideally, I would also like to stay in my niche field... though, unfortunately, job opportunities in my field are slim at best right now, unless I want to stay in consulting--which won't improve my technical skills. 



Do I stay in consulting for the sake of staying in my wheelhouse, or do I move into a general DS role, and possibly at lower pay because I basically ""took a break"" from DS?

Is what I learned from consulting even useful for a DS role or another tech job that I just don't know about? 

Do I just have a ""the grass is greener"" attitude and need to just wait it out in consulting, despite a lack of upward trajectory?",petite_pear529,1,1.0,0,1739232830,2025-02-11 00:13:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imlfl3/should_my_next_career_move_be_consulting_ds_or/,2,2025

I want to jump into regular work again, but I haven't had any success finding marketing work, which has me looking for other alternatives.

1imi3wl,Should I take this job for experience? Weighing the pros and cons of a move.,"Hey everyone, I’m 20 years old, currently studying IT (about a third of the way through my degree) and looking to build up more experience in the field. Right now, I’m working a warehouse job that pays $16/hour (around $550 a week after taxes), but I feel like it’s pretty much a dead-end position with no growth opportunities.

I’ve been offered a new role at a small, UK-based company, where I’d be doing about 80% tech support for their door hardware products (which is not directly IT but still tech-related) and 20% warehouse work. The pay is $20/hour, or roughly $680 a week after taxes. However, the catch is the 45-minute commute each way, which will cost me around $300 a month in gas. I’d be spending about 40 hours a week on travel alone, which is a big factor to consider.

The company is small—only three people at the local office—but they plan to expand. There might be an opportunity to grow into more IT-related roles as the company develops, but that’s not guaranteed. I have a Course Career certification, but that’s about all I have in terms of formal qualifications for the field right now.

So, my question is: Is it worth it to take this new job for the experience, despite the commute and gas costs? Would the tech support experience be valuable enough to make it worth leaving my current job (which is only 10 minutes away)?

There might be an opportunity to grow into more IT-related roles as the company develops, but that’s not guaranteed. I have a Course Career certification, but that’s about all I have in terms of formal qualifications for the field right now.

So, my question is: Is it worth it to take this new job for the experience, despite the commute and gas costs? Would the tech support experience be valuable enough to make it worth leaving my current job (which is only 10 minutes away)? Or should I stay where I am, keep working, and focus on self-teaching IT while finishing my degree?

I’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve been in a similar situation!

1imh5dy,"Pip at first corporate job, nerves and confidence is shot","Hello all, 

So started first corporate job about 10 months ago, passed probation and my 6 months with fine feedback, but admittedly I find the job difficult, it’s fast paced, detailed orientated and in an area I didn’t have much background in. 

Had to do a report and everybody told me not to stress, and I worked hard to get a mini draft in which my boss said was a strong start with some missing bits, which I planned to address. But, the deadline changed meaning my draft was needed to be worked on by everyone, which I felt terrible for and my boss was annoyed by the holes missing, and I should have picked up on it - and I took responsibility for. I get stressed and flustered which makes me make silly mistakes. 

Anyway, today my boss said I’d have more structured mentoring and I had two months to address my work planning and issues with making mistakes on key events/data/etc. they are generally nice people and I just feel like a huge screw up as this is my first job after all my studies, and I work hard (my boss noted this too). I am panicking that 1) I can’t get it together, so then I’m fired and that pretty much ruins my career before it starts. My boss said if it is revolved it would be removed. 

So I guess I’m looking for guidance; should I try and improve over the next two months to get it removed? Or is it a death sentence for sure? My nerves are already fried, Would this mark on my record stop me getting work? Ofc if I get fired I know that is worse for my career. So do I wait it out and try my best or leave early? Honestly I feel besides myself as I’ve never had issues picking things up before until now, and I just feel scared and like a screw up.

1imgr8n,"Rejected from grad school, what is the best move from here?","Hi there. I am 20f, graduated summa cum laude with a degree in communications when I was turned 19 and worked mostly customer service/ food service jobs. Took time off last year figuring out where to go when I realized I didn't really want to go into social media marketing or marketing in general. I was very young when I started college and had no idea what I wanted so just picked communications as a general degree (I was 17). I figured it out when I started volunteering at the crisis hotline and decided I wanted to go into psychology (clinical mental health counseling as a start, then ideally go for a psychology doctorate later on). 

The issue is I have been rejected from graduate school for the masters programs I applied to, and I'm currently too young and maybe too inexperienced to get any jobs relevant to the field currently. I am not really sure where to go from here and pretty lost. I figure I'll apply again next year and get certified in trauma informed yoga teaching in the meantime (I'm a military spouse who would like to offer veterans on base free yoga sessions for coping with PTSD; this is ultimately who I'd like to focus on serving as a psychologist).

So I suppose my question is what jobs would help me to gain more experience in the field or more general what jobs would help me to build the skills I need to eventually pursue this as a career pre-graduate studies? I'm still actively volunteering, but it's flexible and I mainly do it late nights when they are busiest. Any advice is welcome, thank you in advance.

I have been in a company since four months, and I am not at all passionate about the missions. The ambiance feels off and my manager is micromanaging me, watching all my moves and he wants to have updates on my work every 2 hours.

I was supposed to finish the trial period on Friday but my manager wants to renew it because he said that I do not report to him enough. 

I really want to leave because I don’t see the point of using my energy to do things I don’t specially like and to receive useless pressure from him. (at this point just having one interaction with him can ruin my day).

The issue is that I am not 100% sure of what to do next, and I am currently living at my parents and I am afraid of this period in which I would be staying mostly at home applying for jobs.
But also, and with this current job, I cannot telework and I am so exhausted that I do not have the time to apply for anything else.

I am a person who can NOT do complicated math, and cannot memorize long words, patterns or sentences either. What I can do in the other hand is understand. I am pretty logical, and I think I have a lot of common sense, which """"""""clever"""""""""" people tend to lack these days.  I have my own ideas of life, and always had them growing up. I've been called mature and capable of dealing with harder situations since my childhood.

 (Oh yeah and the school system absolutely sucks, people are sorted behind unfair numbers, like the Chinese social credit lol). 

Speaking of unfairness....  I hate injustice, and always stood up against it. I have debating skills, and ""winning"" isn't my first priority, but getting to a point  is. (I am an ENTP) I love helping people, and my  only motivation in life is to be useful to myself and to others. I also am interested in geography, cultures and politics. I can deal with computer work too, I am easily self taught in that field.

  
I can speak 3 languages fluently (Turkish, English , Hungarian) and spent some time with teaching myself Russian and Azerbaijani.

I would love it if I had some freedom, and was able to edit my own work schedule, and it would be absolutely amazing if I could also work from afar at times (You know, I don't really want the  """"wake up, work, eat, sleep, repeat"""" type of life.)

1imdab8,I swapped to Education in stagnant jobs market,"
If you've got a degree or work expertise in a specialist field, and are a bit lost career-wise, do you know you can get paid to teach (11 to 18) or lecture (16+) and your skills would be valued, great holidays (11 weeks) and a good salary and pension?
 
I swapped from working in the Media industry to FE Teaching and it's been brilliant. Great career if you've got kids. 

Also great career if you are young and want to travel on the International Schools circuit, pay no tax in some countries and get free/cheap accommodation working abroad. 

Two routes are: 

1)Bursaries of 29k to train for school teaching in some subjects. Obviously once you've trained you can swap sectors to FE or move abroad and teach. Research teacher training Bursaries. 


2) FE Teaching. You don't need a degree. They value work expertise. Colleges need lecturers in trades and professional skills and will pay you immediately to teach / train. Research FE training on Goverment website. Contact your local colleges. 

I can see a lot of people on here depressed about the stagnant jobs market. So I just wanted to flag this up. I've loved working in FE education for 20+ years. It's a lot of fun and very rewarding.

I need your advice, how beneficial will taking this program be to my career? Should I consider other options like CFA or just taking analytics courses on the side? (SQL, Python, Tableu, PowerBI) How did you guys get into this field?

 Any advice would be so appreciated! Thank you guys",Bluebubbles20,1,1.0,0,1739210169,2025-02-10 17:56:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1imcbjw/should_i_do_my_masters_in_business_analytics_or/,2,2025
1imbnaf,Grieving and job searching,"Hi, would love to get advice if possible, I just started a new job in November (client facing, consulting where I have to juggle multiple clients and be ""on"" pretty much every day). My father passed away in mid December and the firm was super nice, gave me paid time off through mid Jan even though I was so new to the company.

Coming back to work I have no motivation at all and everyone has been super accommodating and doesn't press me for stuff but I also know I'm running behind on deliverables and tasks and not operating where I was when I joined the firm. My dad's passing has put things into perspective for me and I just want a chill 9-5 in industry now (currently my billable goal is 45+). I was initially going to try to passively look for the new role while just trying to get by in my current one, but given my lack of motivation and low chargeable hours and also that I don't have clients of my own yet that I have to own the relationship for, should I:

1. Go on unpaid Leave of Absence, try to look for a new job and just try to quit during said LOA if it pans out? 

2. Look for a new job and stay underperforming to continue collecting a paycheck and see if they say anything?

I think ultimately people at my current firm would understand if I wanted to quit after the passing of my dad because this job is not low stress, but it's the fear of letting people down (since my leaving or staying adds more to their plate regardless) that is making it hard for me to decide what to do. I'm still grieving but I do have bills to pay (however I could go prob 1-2 months with unpaid leave) don't know how to do. I know ideally you shouldn't make major decisions while still grieving but tbh I feel when I first joined I kind of knew I wasn't happy here so perhaps this is a road to a new beginning?

I already know in the grand scheme of things this will just be a blip in my career so will likely try to leave ASAP, just looking for the best way to do it.

ALSO - while interviewing, should I disclose to hiring managers if they ask why I want to leave the firm so soon? (due to experiencing a major life event of parent passing, looking to move to a position that I see as more long-term for myself now?) Or should I avoid mentioning the loss of a parent part?

1imb570,30M London 8 YOE. Feeling lost and under pressure to pivot to high salary career path. Any advice?,"Hit 30 and feeling lost. What to do? MBA? Switch Industries?

I am 30M living in London, with an undergrad degree in Business and Economics from a good university. Have worked in the energy & start-up world for the last 8 years. I have worked at 3 companies, all in various, generalist roles around supporting and working with start-ups. No specific skillset so to speak. My salary has hovered between £50-60K on each role. Currently on £50K. 

Since turning 30 I am feeling incredibly stuck and lots of pressure. I have not been able to find my career groove or path – I thought I would naturally slip into this and get promoted and find my way. But an unfortunately redundancy in my second role and working in organisations that are not based on “up or out” style of promotions, I have not been able to move up the seniority ladder. 

I need to earn more (quite a lot more) to be able to build a life where I can own a property and earn/support a family.  When looking for new roles I am not even sure what type of positions I would be a fit for and what box I fit in/who would hire me. Especially for roles that are +£60K. 

I am wondering if an MBA will be something that will change my profile and help me level up and get to that next level.  The problem is I don’t know if I can afford it, or if taking on the debt makes sense. I have about £20K in savings but hoping to get married and put a downpayment on a house soon. Taking on £100K in debt sounds pretty stressful! 

Basically this feels like my chance to go for it and take on a lot of debt and take a big swing. If I don’t, I just don’t see a pathway for me to get into more executive positions where the salaries are +£100K. Unless there is another way that I am not seeing.  
Otherwise it's a total career pivot into finance perhaps? Or start-up investing(have some experience in this?)

1imasl0,Stuck Between University and Business—Which Path Should I Take for My Future?,"I’m 19M Pakistani, just started my BSc Business Informatics in Hungary on scholarship. But now, I’m stuck in a dilemma and need some real advice.

My family can’t support me financially, so I have to figure things out on my own. In 2.5 years, I’ll be able to get a Spanish residence permit somehow. I’ll need to rent and eventually buy an apartment for myself and my future family, and I’ll also have to support my extended family. I need money. I have dreams, like visiting different countries. I like America and want to go there once I have enough money. I know I’ll have to live in Spain for  years, and I don’t want to go back to my home country. Eventually, I plan to start my own business because I don’t like the 9-to-5 lifestyle.

My Two Options:

1. Stick with my BI Bachelor degree. Degree will complete in the start of 2028. The field is completely new to me, so I’ll have to put in a lot of effort. I’d have to start with entry-level jobs, switch companies and roles over time to become an IT consultant or tech sales professional or project manager or director. After years of struggle, I might be able to open my own business. I also don’t want to do a Master’s because i think it would delay everything—earning money, buying a home, a car, my marriage. I’m not sure about job opportunities in Spain after graduation, so if anyone has insights, let me know. It feels like a long and uncertain path, but if things go well, it could have a good payoff.

2. Drop out and start working with my relatives in Pladur (drywall/plasterboard business) in Spain. I’ll have to learn everything from scratch, starting from the labor stage, and it’s hard work. In my opinion, I could get skilled in about three years. After that, with enough money and experience, I’d start my own firm, like my relatives did, and contract with home-building companies. I’d also hire some workers to handle the labor. Maybe one day, I’d even open my own construction firm. I also think I’d start making money sooner rather than later.

If I start working, I can put in the effort in both fields, but I need to choose which one to focus on. If anyone has seen a similar story or has personal experience, I’d really appreciate your advice. Any general advice or perspectives that resonate with my situation—please do share.

moving forward now she will say things like can you look after x and make sure she has work, can you monitor the queue, etc. stuff i already do and she is not in charge of for the other staff or myself. i am not sure what to do here and am considering leaving, for now i have just been ignoring her. my boss otherwise always takes my word on things and has my back. i would love to shift her to another team and let them handle it appropriately or see if she can grow but she still has no goals or any former education she is still figuring out some of the basics 3 or 4 years in

I have two bachelors degrees - one in mathematics and one in accounting. For three-four years (2021-2024) I was in financial compliance investigations and data analysis. About a year ago (Q2 2024) I took a new job as a business analyst for a bank and have been working closely with the executive team designing monthly performance dashboards. While I enjoy the work and company I work for, I am looking for a new role (even if it’s a short term contract) - my family and I live in a rural community with not the best healthcare. Additionally, over the past few months there has been a shooting at our intersection, people have stolen stuff from our porch, and someone has tried to break into our house.

I currently work at a medium sized private tech company in their finance department, we've had several rounds of layoffs and more are definitely coming, but my job seems safe. I work fully remote, can work anywhere in the world, and travel often to take advantage of this. I make $130K and am supposed to get an annual $20K bonus, but this has not been paid out the last three years. The biggest thing keeping me here is that I honestly only work about 2 hours a day. With the turbulence in the company though I doubt I would ever be able to be promoted and we have not had any raises in a few years. I also have 5 direct reports, who are mostly great, but I know they are all looking for other jobs too due to the companies struggles.

After a long interview process, Company B a large public tech company offered me a job. It's a reduction in title (who cares) but a $170K salary, $30K annual bonus, and $25K signing bonus. More money than I ever thought I would make in my life after a rough upbringing. This job would be 3 days a week in office, about a 45 minute commute for me by train and walking. I have friends that work here and the job is respectful about not bothering you after 5 or on weekends, but it is a tough and competitive 40 hour a week environment. There would be a lot of room for growth at this firm as my skillset is unique and I am joining a young team. This job would have no direct reports.

About me, I'm engaged, mid 30s, own a small home I am currently trying to sell, I don't have a car, we've got no pets, kids are definitely in our future though.

1im7jdx,Leave a great job at home to move abroad without a job?,"Hi everyone,

Not sure what I’m looking for here—maybe just some wisdom, advice, or opinions.

A bit about me: I graduated from college last year and have been working at an international bank in a management associate program ever since. It’s a great bank, great role, great benefits, great compensation, etc. I’m learning a lot, given opportunities to grow, and I’m on track to build a solid career. It seems like the ideal situation for someone starting out, and honestly, I can’t think of a better role to be in for myself at this stage.

For context, I live and work in Singapore, where I’ve grown up my whole life. For those unfamiliar, it’s a small city-state in Asia—highly developed, high cost of living, strong economy, and a major financial hub (kind of like the London of Asia).

I live at home with my parents because renting here is extremely expensive, and culturally, most people live at home until they get married. Financially, living at home makes sense—I don’t pay rent, and food is mostly covered when I’m with my parents. I have a neutral-to-positive relationship with them and see my close friends regularly. So from a financial and social standpoint, things are stable

However, I’m a lesbian, and dating in Singapore is… hard. Firstly its not really a “liberal” city, it’s not a very open type of place and same sex marriage is ILLEGAL. Additionally the dating pool is small, and the societal mentality here is quite rigid and conformist. While Singapore presents itself as diverse, a lot of things that wouldn’t be tolerated in cities like London, NYC, or Amsterdam are accepted here. For instance, its a really radicalised society in a sense that people place a great emphasis on your race when interacting with you socially (dating as well) and as a minority it feels like I’m viewed for my skin colour than who I am as a person. It’s not horrible but it’s no London. I feel like this country isn’t for me in the long run—it doesn’t allow me to fully grow into who I want to be and doesn’t have the social and personal opportunities for myself.

Because of the university I graduated from, I qualify for a two-year visa to the UK that doesn’t require employer sponsorship. This is a rare opportunity to move abroad relatively easily. But the UK job market is crap right now, and I’ve already tried applying to jobs from Singapore, only to get rejected because I’m not in the country or because I lack a permanent right to work. Also, I’ve visited London many times and have few people I know living there so I’m aware of life there as well. 

The biggest dilemma: If I move, I’ll be leaving behind a very good job that sets me up for long-term career success. I did not come from a wealthy family—we were lower-middle class at best—and everything I have now is the result of me working incredibly hard. The financial stability and career trajectory I have in Singapore aren’t easy to walk away from.

I feel like I have two choices:
	1.	Take the gamble—move to the UK, leave everything behind, and try to find a job (which may not be as good as my current one, given visa limitations). I’m afraid I will have to settle for a shit job that brings career suicide.
	2.	Stay in Singapore, build 2-3 years of experience, and then try to move when I have more leverage.


I think maybe I know that the second option makes more sense logically. But if so, how do I build the mental resilience to continue in this path without feeling like I’m wasting my precious youth away in a place that doesn’t fit me—when I know there’s so much better out there?

How do I stop feeling like my current life is so boring, like I’m just in a constant waiting mode before my real life can start?

How do I find joy and meaning in this period of my life?

1im708x,Advice Needed: A PIP & A Mutual Separation,"For the last 6 months I've been randomly reassigned from strategic hiring to high volume non strategy hiring to cover someone who went on matt leave they refused to replace.

Over the course of this time I haven't been very successful with actual hires straddling a couple here and there but it's a highly volatile environment with high turnover and hiring managers often rejecting candidates. This is well known in the business there is a very low conversion rate on this team and even when you find the best candidate its a 50% chance they'll make it through.

Having said that my activity has always remained high, additionally I have reviewed profiles with my manager and stakeholders and no additional feedback can be provided on what else I can do here.

Last month the head of my dept (above my manager) mandated I make 5 hires happen in 30 days or I get put on a PIP. I increased my activity more than ever (again no one can give me any additional insight on what else to do to find success) but the dept head says he doesn't care about effort if the outcome isn't there.

A month has passed and now it looks like Im actually getting on the PIP with 30 days that if Im not successful will lead to termination and they have also offered a mutual seperation.

The dept head also stated even if I'm successful out of this PIP I should be moving to high volume hiring permanently till I'm able to prove myself and find my way back to strategy hiring (Where I have always been highly successful) 

This feels very punitive and like I'm being set up to fail. Any advice on if I should take the mutual separation ? What's the actual impact of a termination on my career (I'm in Ontario)

1im58ia,Should I leave Tim Hortons for a job at Lexus as a future College student?,"I currently work at Tim Hortons, and to be honest, it sucks. The pay is the same as jobs at places like New York Fries or Best Buy, but the workload is way heavier. On top of that, there’s this stereotype that all Tim Hortons employees are rude or racist (I’m white, but people are rude to me anyway). Some customers treat us like we’re their personal servants, except for the regulars who are actually nice.

Recently, one of my customers offered me a job at Lexus as a greeter. The pay is the same, but it could be my way out of Tim Hortons, and since I’m starting college next September to study automotive technician, it seems like a step in the right direction. I also volunteer at a mechanic shop just to learn more about the trade.

My only concern is job security. If I switch to Lexus now and they don’t allow me to work weekends once college starts, I could end up losing both jobs. Would it be smarter to stay at Tim Hortons for now, or should I take the risk and make the switch?( college starts next September)

The interview was amazing as we all got on well and seemed aligned on many things. Afterward they bought me a standard personality assessment online (the big 5) and seemed happy with my results. 

A few days later I received the offer. It was substantially lower than I expected, lower than what I receive now while I would also need to travel further and work longer hours. They threw in some other suggestions such as giving me a travel allowance and played with the possibility of funding the second year of my MBA. I was taken aback and finally revealed my current package to them (note, I am a medical receptionist at the moment).

I believe i was tactful in how I communicated this to them and explained that I cannot justify accepting the proposed package outline as it would not support my current responsibilities or match up to my current package. I also expressed my admiration for their company and gratefulness for the opportunity. It was in essence a rejection letter. Negotiation was not a hopeful affair as I would have had to somehow negotiate for them to double their offer.

The CEO reached out to me again saying that he likes the way I communicated the situation to them. He would still like to invest in me and asked me for some time to process the information I shared.

When do I follow up on this if at all and is there something else I can do in this situation as I really liked the company and the prospect of holding that seat?",Intelligent-Power199,1,1.0,2,1739190846,2025-02-10 12:34:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1im532s/is_there_something_i_should_do_while_waiting_for/,2,2025
1im5292,What should I do?,"I need your input on the notice period
The role I entered was for Content Writer, and I have been with the company for almost four months now. However, my manager pushed me into a few projects (it was challenging, and I’m not blaming anyone, but I do blame the timeline they set, which forced me to work until 2 AM after I went to my room). They pushed me in a few projects where at one point, it was obvious that the role they offered me as a content writer was no more related. They gave outreach task, and this task requires atleast 2 hours of work. But my manager manipulated (THE WORST PART is that I very well knew he was manipulating, but I had to act like nothing has happened for the sake of prolonging in this work) me that he can do this in 20 minutes, so I couldn't do the 2 hours task. So I had to complete this in the A.M. 
Now, in my fourth month, I’m sleep-deprived and low on energy. I’ve decided to quit. My question is, how long can I serve the notice period?""",Aware-Story6605,2,1.0,0,1739190760,2025-02-10 12:32:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1im5292/what_should_i_do/,2,2025

1im4856,Where else to find a job when you've applied for everything on Indeed?,"Been looking for a job for about a month & a half and I feel like I've already applied to most jobs in my area that are the type of job I want. I have a relatively broad spectrum of what I'd want, I'm mainly just looking for something office based.

I've been applying to mostly admin roles, but even things like accounts assistant, document controller, bookkeeper, etc. I've even applied to some receptionist roles which isn't really what I want but it's similar enough & I'm getting desperate as I'm unemployed.

Most of my previous jobs are not really related to what I'm applying for so I think that's a problem, but I really want to stop working in hospitality/similar. The jobs I've had are bartender, server, housekeeper & housekeeping supervisor, nursery assistant, pharmacy assistant & transcriptionist. I think transcriptionist is the only one that really relates to what I'm looking for, but that was 3 jobs ago & I worked there less than a year. Pharmacy assistant was my most recent job & I only worked there for 3 months 🤦

Just don't know where else to look now & feeling stuck. I've applied to over 100 jobs and am mostly hearing nothing but have had about 15 no's as well. I was having a look at Reed but a lot of the jobs seemed scammy or fake. Are there any other job boards that are as reliable as Indeed?

1im4829,Career advice for a burnt out IT worker?,"Hello everyone, thanks for reading!

So for some context, I live in  the US, southern FL, have complete visual impairment, and worked in the IT sector for at least a decade and a half. Mostly freelance, a couple corporate jobs, and an abundance of free tech support for family/friends.



  I no longer wish to work in the IT sector full stop, at this point the burnout is unreal. I am currently in my mid 30s, with around 30k in savings. Training/school is definitely an option, remote would be convenient but is not mandatory.



I would prefer to pass the sales industry onto the next brave soul.



  I don't currently have many useful skills outside IT to work with here, but I will give you all what I can for any recommendations for potential new career paths.



  I love the idea of small electronics tinkering, have wanted to pursue something related to small electronics engineering/building, think stuff like the Raspberry pi etc. My legendary inability to perform simple mathematics could be cause for concern.



  Time in the kitchen cooking simple meals is a favorite pastime of mine, but I  definitely think that could be expanded on through some education. Ever since I was a young teenager, the idea of being a chef, or a musician on a cruise ship/private boat has captivated me.



  I will also tell you that I love doing  research for people in my community, ranging from software to fit their needs, to researching real estate and property rules, regulations, and permitting in certain counties, a new computer for a user's specific needs, staying on top of the latest scams usually for the elderly, the list goes on. I don't exactly know what kind of title/job description you would apply to this task, research consultant?



  Carpentry definitely sounds like something I could get into with my lack of vision, I'd probably just need to find a brave enough soul who I could learn from?

I figure there will always be need for the working hands of a carpenter, plus carpentry sort of runs in  the family :)



  I've tried for the greater part of 3 months now to get into entry-level or tier II tech support customer service jobs. Have managed one interview that lead nowhere, will keep trying though.



  Even though I lack the big, expensive qualifications for it, sound design/podcast editing is probably what I do best, I do have some sound libraries listed on vendor websites but at my level it doesn't pay much if anything. Not dismissing it in fact I'd love to further my progress in it if possible, but right now it does not pay well enough to pay the bills.



  As of now this is all I've got, would really appreciate some guidance/advice for a change in career.

Will do my best to respond quickly, thanks again for reading!",Fluid-Matter-9312,2,1.0,0,1739187790,2025-02-10 11:43:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1im4829/career_advice_for_a_burnt_out_it_worker/,2,2025
1im3tvy,Stable Corporate or Start-Up,"I'm a software engineer based in London. I work for a large multinational company. The team is great, the product is cool, but it's fairly tedious work that I don't find enormously challenging. Promotions seem to rely on grinding away and the higher-ups just seem to endlessly sit in meetings all day.

I've been offered a role with a very early-stage start-up; the salary is double my current one, and they'd have runway for roughly 18 months from the point at which I'd be able to join. They're working in what seems to be pretty cutting-edge tech, and have what seems to be a credible looking team.

If this were 2 years ago, I'd YOLO and give it a go. However, I've just taken on a mortgage and the job insecurity (or rather, perceived job insecurity -- obviously there's nothing stopping the large company I'm currently a part of remorselessly laying people off to pay dividends to shareholders) makes me a little jittery.  Furthermore, I'd end up with a CV which would contain two consecutive one year stints, which I suspect renders me a little unappealing to new roles should I need to look elsewhere if the start-up is liquidated. 

I really have no idea what to do. I'm getting increasingly nervous (and cynical/ pessimistic) about software engineering roles going the way of the dinosaur as AI becomes more capable, so not sure whether I'm tending towards being more risk averse since it seems prudent to climb the corporate ladder as quickly as possible to insulate myself from the upcoming purges.

So my current job is enforcing contracts on work training costs, that we either work for three years after a training or pay the cost back if we quit (it's 3 times my current monthly pay per training). We have three trainings a year, and if i sign it, it's enforceable as of last week's training. I am middle management, and everyone in the company takes loans because of how bad the pay is.

for a while I've wanted to do business because my older sister graduated for business but I'm worried that I won't be employed or even make it into college

Im a junior in highschool with a kinda shitty gpa (2.6 unweighted, 3.1 weighted) so the thought of university scares me because I doubt I'd even make it in and if I did I feel I'd be in debt forever

So I've been looking into trades since my dad does them and they look like an easier thing to get into even though they're physically demanding and I'm on the skinnier size, I'm willing to put the effort in to become stronger so I don't really hurt myself

but I know that risk still comes with it so I've been thinking about going to community college then maybe transferring to university after 2 years in hope of obtaining a business administration degree, and going to trade school likely for welding/plumbing/electrical so that once I'm old enough I can use my degree to help my dad and I start our own business in the trades and if I hurt myself I can hopefully put the degree to use

I don't need to be rich or anything but my dream is to start my own family and be a good dad of two kids in a nice home, then I can croak happy

still I'm worried about picking the wrong choice but as of now that's the plan, please give me any useful advice",Itchy-Length-5148,6,0.8799999952316284,20,1739174398,2025-02-10 07:59:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1im13o4/im_going_and_i_dont_wanna_fail_in_life/,2,2025
1im0pn0,Giving an ultimatum - Raise or I quit,"I've been working at this company for almost 2 years at this point. Initially when i first got the job i barely had any experience because this was a new path i decided to go with after college that i did not study in. I was giving an entry level salary because of my lack of experience. last feb i was given an ultimatum where it was either take a demotion or get fired. they told me the demotion was because they were reinvesting dollars into a different source of revenue from within the company and away from my team. however, this obviously didn't happen. i still have the same amount of work if not more than before and do the job of 3 people. there are also other hats that i wear within the company that are important and only replaceable by hiring multiple other people.

my team consists of me and a coordinator, but i am responsible for basically all of the creative and product development. without me there is no product to sell. management at this company is also horrible, even though they told me i would have less work, this was a tactic to manipulate me into doing more work for less pay, knowing that i would pick to be demoted. i have been asking for a raise, title change, and promotion for over 8 months which is met with extreme resistance and asking me for patience while other teams have been hiring multiple people. 

my team has also surprised the overall company by continuing to be the key revenue driver even though they look money away from us. they are clearly reinvesting money into the inventory but not to the team itself. the coordinator is also quitting due to mental health issues from my company, not because they have a job lined up but simply because they cannot handle the torment. 

Right now i believe i have some leverage over the company and i am also at my wits end with this company. because the coordinator is leaving, it means that all of the responsibility of their major key revenue driver is reliant on me alone and if i do not ask for a raise they will for sure not offer it but still ask me to do the work of the person who left. I am thinking of giving them an ultimatum of almost 40% increase raise and a title change or i will leave. i believe this is a fair ask because i am being paid well under the market rate for the job i do. they also paid 2 people the amount im asking each before and i am only one person now. 

they also tend to drag their feet on these things, so my ultimatum comes with a timeline. they have a week to decide yes or no and the increase must be reflected in my following paycheck. if they say no i will for sure quit. im at the end of my rope and i simply can't keep doing the work of a multi person team for the amount i'm making. the management team also tends to react with emotion over rational thought. 

I'm just generally wondering what everyone thinks about this plan/the chances of them saying yes to this ultimatum. either way i will still be looking for another job but am willing to quit if they say no.

1ilzn4j,25M Feeling lost and left behind in life. No real idea what I want to do for a career. Messed up big time during years 18 to present day. Need to course correct. Have no idea what to do. HELP!!!,"Alright, this is gonna be a long one, so just buckle up here.

  
So, I really have no idea how to explain this, but here it goes.

  
I'm 25 years old, and I feel as if I have no real direction or chance of making it anymore in life due to the choices that I've made in my critical years. 

  
Let me preface this.

  
From the age of 18 to now, I have made one bad decision after another due to having no guidance or support from anyone in my life. From the time I was 18, I had already been in and out of rehab/mental facilities 10 times. Struggled with addiction and severe mental health issues. Dropped out of high school senior year. Got my GED with BARELY PASSING SCORES (and I mean, 1 point over the requirement passing.) And then, with the G.I bill I received from my Dad who passed in the war in 03, I decided that I wanted to go to Full Sail University and study Creative Writing for Entertainment and then got a Certificate in Marketing. 

  
All throughout college, I didn't study, read any of the books or material, or really do any work. I just BS'd my way through Uni, made no real connections or friends, spent all my time sneaking into bars and chasing girls and living off the 5k allowance I was getting from the V.A, DFAS, and Disability. 

  
So flashforward to now. I have severely made critical and devastating errors in my life. I blew through all my savings because I didn't understand the value of money, took out a Sallie Mae loan to go back to college and obtain a Cybersecurity degree. (Dropped out after I failed coding class 6 times.) Struggled with Xanax addiction, had 2 brushes with death, survived a long term relationship ending, and all this time I have worked what my parents call ""High School Jobs"" meaning Food service, customer service, and retail. All of which I never had for more than a few months and left those jobs on bad terms. I can't even get a job at McDonald's or Wal-Mart.

  
I have no real marketable skills, besides writing and editing and english related skills due to my time in college with my degree. As well as marketing. My chronic health issues also get in the way of work. I have nearly 100k in debt across all accounts, no savings, and really no direction to go.

  
I've thought about trade school but can't afford it. I thought about the military but might be disqualified due to mental illness and chronic health issues (as well as I checked the ASVAB sample questions and failed each practice test) and really my work experience is pretty pathetic for a 25 year old male in current state America.

  
So my question remains as this: Is there really any hope or chance of a course correction for a guy like me in modern day? Or is it pretty much over?",TheWrittenVagabond,1,1.0,3,1739168169,2025-02-10 06:16:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilzn4j/25m_feeling_lost_and_left_behind_in_life_no_real/,2,2025

1ilzcjv,I have no idea what I’m doing!,"Basically I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I (20 M) am a second semester sophomore in college and I realized in December, that what I was majoring in was not for me. I was studying graphic design and marketing, but after 3 semesters of working my self to the bone, feeling miserable, and having no school/life balance despite everything I tried, l've realized that that I was trying to fit myself into a career instead of choosing something that fit me.

The mass production of art took away everything I loved about it, creating under the stress of making a livelihood, and constantly sell my ideas and designs during all stages to a client was NOT for me. Art and design has been my passion and favorite hobby for all of my life, and when researching what the career entailed it seemed perfect for me. But sadly it took 3 semesters to realize it was not.

I was so gung ho about graphic design since my sophomore year of high school and thought I was so lucky to know what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, so I didn't really look into other jobs/careers. Now I'm completely lost to what I want to do. I'm very type A and basically planned my future around being a graphic designer, and now for the first time I'm truly so lost. I don't know if I can afford career counseling and my school doesn't seem to have the best options to help me either.

I feel like all my other interests need a masters degree (which is something I can't really afford) and since l'm already going to be a year + behind, that would only push me back even further. It's that or they aren't in very lucrative fields and have a small/ dwindling job market. All I get when I look up options for jobs are stuff in the CS and finance world, which I am not interested in and are not in my skill set. That and the fact that I do not want to work in any kind of art or design or do something that involves me having to sell something, is literally all I know right now. If anyone has any advice or idk encouragement, please let me know. Anything would help me at this point.

1ilyxhl,Second counter offer dilemma,"5.5 years ago, I had to relocate and take a salary cut because I needed a job. I accepted a role that paid 84K, even though it was below market standards. After two years, I had to fight my way to get a raise since I was being paid less than others with less experience. Eventually, my salary increased to 115K.

For the next two years, I had no further growth, so I started looking for other jobs. When I got an offer from another company, I resigned. My employer countered with a salary increase to 150K, which I accepted because it was a fair pay for the extra work I was doing outside my job title.

After 1.5 years, I got a raise from 150K to 162K. While it’s a decent increase, I still feel I’m underpaid for the work I do. So, I explored other options and got an offer for 192K. I’m sure my current employer will match this offer, but I might try to push them to counter with 220K just to screw with them as this is a bit above average salary for my role. If they do, I would be tempted to stay, but I’m also scared that accepting a second counteroffer may not be a good idea in the long run.



*TL;DR: Took a pay cut to 84K, fought to get it raised to 115K, then accepted counter 150K after resigning. Now at 162K but got a 192K offer elsewhere. Might push my employer to counter with 220K, but unsure if staying after second counter is the right move.*",FewScarcity4063,2,1.0,0,1739165508,2025-02-10 05:31:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilyxhl/second_counter_offer_dilemma/,2,2025

1ilxy14,Career aptitude tests tell me to get job and degree I already have,"I’m 35F and I’ve taken a few different career aptitude tests recently and I keep getting the same few results: Art Director, Journalist, Graphic Designer, Bar Manager, Restauranteur

I’ve been working in restaurants for 15 years now and I’ve been a bar manager for about 7 of those. I’ve wanted out of the restaurant industry for a while. In 2020 when all the restaurants were closed due to COVID, I got a Bachelors in Strategic Communications/Journalism where I studied art direction and graphic design. Since graduating in 2022, I’ve sent resumes to thousands of jobs and only received back a handful of “no thanks” responses. I’ve never even gotten an interview.

I went to college in my 30s and never did an internship because I worked full time. My experience is all restaurant management with a brief year-long stint as a Brand Developer for a major beer company before the pandemic rendered that job obsolete. I’ve reworked my resume dozens of times, I’ve lied, I told the truth, I did all the ATS scanning tricks under the sun and gained nothing. It makes me feel extremely lost, like my 70k degree and experience is worthless, and I desperately want to change my life but can’t. 

I’ve considered a few different avenues: 
-Lean completely in and just open my own bar and/or restaurant 
-Go back to school and pivot my degree to something more STEM-y
-Fill any extra time and spend any extra money I have for online certifications for digital marketing/graphic design/social media/etc to make up for lack of internships on my resume 
- Take the cliche restaurant manager path and become a realtor or do insurance sales
-Wild card option: join the military as a communications officer
-a secret option not yet discovered

I’m open to anything really. I’m leaning towards the online certifications but I’m worried they may not be worth the time/money. I’m also a sommelier and could get my next level of wine certification which would open up some wine sales or corporate wine jobs.

1ilxjty,"Career change out of welding, feeling stuck","How do I make a career change from welding?

I’m 25, I am a journeyman welder. I’ve been welding since I was 18 and aside from briefly working fast food, it’s the only real job I’ve had.  I turned to welding early on because it was a way for me to avoid going into debt for college and make money early on.

I did pretty good for myself early on, but in the back of my mind I feel like I made a big mistake. I’m starting to see a very bleak future in front on me and I’m starting to get worried. 

Where I live I will never be able to afford a house on my wage, and it’s depressing seeing the older guys I work with. Most of them live in RVs, have terrible injuries and will be working until they die. 

I want to transition into a different career, and branch out before I am stuck as a welder. I’m worried about how other companies would view me given that all the jobs I’ve worked have been in the same field. 

I see tons of questions asking about white collar transitioning to blue collar, but not the other way around. I just feel stuck and don’t know how to proceed. 

Would love to hear some advice from you guys. ",ImperatorMakarov,3,1.0,2,1739160670,2025-02-10 04:11:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilxjty/career_change_out_of_welding_feeling_stuck/,2,2025
1ilx9n2,Stay at current job or accept new position given the circumstances?,"Stay at current job or accept offer from other company given the circumstance?

**Current Job & Situation**
- $108k salary, 8% 401k match, decent health insurance, excellent PTO, healthcare non-profit
- 1 promotion in the 7 years I’ve been there (manager to director)
- frequently stressed due to constant change, overwhelming workload, significant cultural shift, and insinuations that my department is on its way out 
- $1200/month mortgage (2.6% interest rate) in northeast Florida making COL extremely affordable 
- Spouse starting new job in 2 weeks with the city government (moderate income, I’d firmly remain “breadwinner”)
- Living in same city as my spouse’s family 

**Prospective Job & Future Situation**
- Sales job selling medical devices aligned with my experience (current employer including my department uses their products)
- New job offered me $105k base salary with $35k commission, annual max of $4k match towards 401k, significantly less PTO, remote with the exception of in-person meetings with clients and conference attendance. 
- I rejected this initial offer due to requirement to relocate to NY/NJ which will result in my mortgage payment doubling at the very least. 
- Hiring manager reached out a couple months later stating that I am still truly the best candidate, and he’s received flexibility with the salary. He asked me to consider and to give him a number that I would agree to and be willing to accept the offer immediately. 
- I’m considering asking $120k base plus the $35k commission. 
- My family lives in NY/NJ, so we’d move from being close to his family (we have been for past 10 years) to being close to mine

Considering concerns for the future with current job/department and lack of growth, I believe a job change makes sense. The HCOL leaves me apprehensive, coupled with guilt about having him give up the new job and leave his family. Plus, I’m currently able to max out 401k and IRA contributions, which may change with new job. 

Any guidance or insights would be highly appreciated.",Sam9745,1,1.0,14,1739159712,2025-02-10 03:55:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilx9n2/stay_at_current_job_or_accept_new_position_given/,2,2025
1ilwf9e,Was I wrong for reporting my manager to hr,"I started a part time retail job a month ago. In the first week I made a big mistake that was not completely my fault so I wasn’t fired but my manager got told off by her boss as I wasn’t trained properly. After this mistake my manager has been quite hostile towards me trying to find any small mistake I could do to try to point it on me and get me fired. It’s been quite horrible honestly I am being scrutinised at all times by her and have bad anxiety that I will mess up again. Other than this she has made unprofessional comments towards me etc. Therefore today I asked my assistant a manger if she could send me the details for HR as I didn’t know them, she asked me for what reason, which I replied it was a private matter and then she never replied or supplied me with the details. Therefore I found them myself and sent a long letter making a formal complaint about my managers treatment of me and also I resigned. I resigned because I cannot deal with this bullying treatment and I know my manager is compiling a list of minor mistakes which I have made (I am literally a new employee so that is normal) which any other employee doesn’t get reported on, just so she can try to get me fired so I may as well do it myself.

1ilw7b6,"Mistreated at work, need to leave for mental health","Hi everyone, I’m not going to spare every single detail because I don’t want certain people to come across this, but I’m fed up at my workplace.

I have two medical conditions, both are invisible but are medically diagnosed. I have surgery coming up for one of them. The other makes me extremely fatigued, dizzy and flustered when I’m having a flare up. 

Well, a few months ago I was called into a meeting, and was presented with a huge booklet of things about my “character” that the boss ultimately doesn’t like. My character, integrity, medical conditions and even allergies were questioned. I was asked things like “do you actually have this condition, or are you exaggerating to relate with people and fit in”. I was even asked to bring a medical certificate to acknowledge a deadly allergy I have. 

The reason behind this interrogation, was because on my lunch break I was expressing to a colleague how I disliked dishonesty (current bf has been caught in quite a bit of lies) and was telling this colleague how when I was a teenager I used to lie a lot to my parents and one day I woke up from it and decided I don’t want to lie about who I am anymore and changed. Bear in mind this is around 10 years ago now and I’ve since grown from that, and live as authentically as I can. I’m very open about mental health struggles or the effects of my chronic illnesses. Anyways, boss overhears a snippet of the conversation that I used to lie a lot in the past. And now thinks I’m a compulsive liar, even mentioned how usually children that felt neglected develop this as a coping mechanism, almost trying to diagnose and dissect me! So this is how they came to the conclusion that everything I say must be a lie. During this meeting, I broke down. I felt like I was being ripped apart for very real struggles I have. I also have anxiety and panic attacks, which led me to have a huge panic attack throughout the whole meeting. Afterwards, I had to return to work and wipe away the tears for the rest of my shift.

Ever since this, I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I feel as though colleagues turned on me assuming I’m this horrible person that lies about medical conditions. It even made me question myself and if I’m exaggerating, to where I’ve gone back to my GP to ask for clarification on my diagnosis. Any advice would be appreciated ",nelzden2727,0,0.5,13,1739156201,2025-02-10 02:56:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilw7b6/mistreated_at_work_need_to_leave_for_mental_health/,2,2025

1ilto6k,Choosing between two offers: From BI Developer to Data Engineer or BI Analyst?,"Hi, I’ve been working for nearly 1.5 year as a BI Developer mostly using Power BI and SQL. Also have some basic experience with SSIS.

At the moment I just left my job and have two different job offers: Data Engineer and BI Analyst (both in IT consulting companies and both offers pay basically the same).

Data engineer

This role that is being offered to me is mainly using SQL Server and Power BI. This will mostly be about the back end part (so no dashboards) with Microsoft technologies, Fabric, Azure, using ETL tools like SSIS. Also might be using some financial/macroeconomic knowledge in these projects, which seems fine to me. This role won’t involve functional/client interaction.

This role would be pretty new to me, since I was not so focused on the back end part in my previous job, so I might have the chance of learning new stuff and also see if I like the tasks.

BI Analyst

This role is a more similar to what I did in my previous job. It will mostly focus on the front end part of BI, but also using SQL and maybe getting certified in other data and BI tools. Moreover, later on I might have the opportunity to transition to other data roles in the same company by request (this was told to me more than once by different people during interviews). In fact, I will work closely with other data roles. Also in time the growth within this company might be more about project management and leading teams without abbadoning completely the tech part, since the team will be tech focused.

————————-

At the moment I am more inclined to choose the data engineer role, since I want to develop my skills in the back end part of the data projects, focusing on ETL, data flows, etc. Also this will imply getting out of my comfort zone, since is a pretty new role to me and I am still not sure if I might like all the tasks/activities. I am also a bit worried about the fact that this is mostly focused on the Microsoft tech, so later on if I might want to change I would have to choose a company that does the same with the same Microsoft tools.

In the BI analyst role I would feel more confident since it is strictly BI which is a field I already have experience in and I know what to expect. Moreoever if I get tired of the activities and want to change there might be the possibility to transition to other data roles in the same company but just not right straight away (maybe one or two years from now). However, I feel a bit tired of the front end part of BI and would like to develop broader skills in the data field.

So now I am having a hard time decinding between the two. Maybe I could prioritize learning new skills in the data engineering job and see if I like it or instead focus strictly on BI analyst for now and later on move to a more back end/data engineer role when I feel like it (just don’t know I will have the chance to transition again to a data engineer role).",TheExplorer_3,1,1.0,3,1739147568,2025-02-10 00:32:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilto6k/choosing_between_two_offers_from_bi_developer_to/,2,2025
1ilsr62,Limited scope for advancement - do I need to move on to move up?,"I've been in my current role for three years.  In a senior sales role, as an individual contributor.  I've done really well, averaging over $1m in sales per year.  I love the job, it's fully remote, I have a great team and like my manager.

However I'm conscious that I'm not progressing.  My manager probably makes less than me some years but he'll have a much higher base salary, and have a bonus based on the success of the team.  It's also a stepping stone to executive level, where I want to be by my 50s.

My employer does have a career development program, but the company structure is fairly flat.  It goes me, my boss (GM), VP, CXX.  So it's like, in order for me to advance, my boss needs to, and his boss needs to.  I don't foresee that happening any time soon.

So I think I know the answer which is that I'll need to find a vacancy elsewhere if I want to move up to that next level.

1ilrtui,Low pay for skilled work,"This is more just a rant than anything but any advice or similar experiences would be great to hear.

Just some backstory: I got a part-time job, two days a week alongside my studies in a completely different field. I'm studying Linguistics and I work at a chain budget opticians in my town as an optical assistant. Initially I loved this job - the customers and staff are friendly and the job is pretty interesting.

Despite this, I can't help but think that all the things I have to do each day and learn is overwhelming considering I'm being paid just 10p over minimum wage.

Some things I have to do on a standard work day are:

- advise customers on frames based on their specific prescription
- use the complicated system to create orders, collect orders off, book customers in, move appointments etc
- work out the best deal for the customer with the wide range of different in store deals, vouchers, promotions, frame prices, lense prices and add ons
- operate the clinic machines, such as the one that takes the OCT scan
- measure customers pupil distance accurately without ever being formally taught how to do it
- advice on complex lenses such as varifocals and the differing prices and deals that come with them
- complete NHS triage forms with people in person and over the phone in the case of an emergency
- order in new lenses/frames for children with broken or lost glasses

And that's not even explaining the very complicated and gruelling process you have to go through to complete each of these tasks which feels excessive.

Every day is so busy and I feel like I'm focusing more on this job than my actual degree and it's causing me stress but in terms of work environment this might be one of the best jobs I've ever had. I worry that if I throw my hat in I'll just get something worse and regret my decision to leave.

1ilr7ah,"“Well, that shouldn’t happen.”","
Prior to 2020, telecommuting was nonexistent at my current employer, and in post-pandemic 2021, all corporate employees were required to come back into the office. Fortunately, they allowed a hybrid schedule, but there were limitations; you could only WFH 2 days of the week and it could not be on a Monday or Friday.

I have maintained my schedule pretty consistently since then, but as an 11 year employee, I felt I had earned leadership’s trust and only on some occasion (2-3 adjustments per 4-5 months) would change around my WFH days (still only WFH T, W, or Th) to accommodate… life, like deliveries, home maintenance, S/Os travel so I can care for our doggos. 

In 2023, I changed teams but stayed in the same department and I felt that even with new responsibilities, I excelled in my new role. In 2024, I took on some workload of 3 other people: 1 direct report of mine who quit and I was informed we would not backfill, 1 who was let go unexpectedly, and the 3rd who was on maternity leave. 

Last week, I changed my WFH day to help accommodate ..life, and swapped Tues & Thurs.  So on Tues, when I was at home , the Director of the dept. inquired where I was and my supervisor informed him, “she switched WFH days this week” to which he responded, “well that shouldn’t happen.” 

Friday, I had my performance review where I was provided this feedback and insight that leadership “watches when I’m in the office” even though I work late to make up any lost time or if there are large projects with tight deadlines. 

I’m over here flabbergasted that an employee who worked for an org for over a decade can’t flex a day or two here and there to create a work/life balance, and to make things even worse, will be getting a whole 1% raise. 

It’s time to quit, right? I feel very taken advantage of. ",ChampagneSupernova03,5,0.8600000143051147,5,1739140331,2025-02-09 22:32:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilr7ah/well_that_shouldnt_happen/,2,2025

I was not able to land any internships or co-ops. Although I did have a lot of clubs/volunteering American RedCross/hackathon/ Retail Pharmacy experience (7 years out of highschool+lead tech). 

I do extremely well in interviews and have only ever received really good feedback but just lack experience for whichever role I apply for. 


I lost faith in coding/SWE jobs pretty quickly and aimed for CyberSec jobs but the experience requirements on those are like 5x the SWE jobs. I went for some IT support jobs but haven’t been able to land any as they seem to want 3 years of experience and are super specific.


Anyways, I landed an indefinite contract job at a pharmaceutical company. IT/SWE is pretty much out of the window. Corporate Compliance/Logistics/Case Management is pretty much what my role does now. The program seems to be growing rapidly and the job seems very secure but I still feel like they could outsource or replace us any moment for people willing to take a lower pay. 

I would love to work at the Pharmaceutical Company but it seems very difficult to get in from a contract role (They require abundant experience 5-10 year experience for many roles) There is some upwards mobility as a supervisor but they’re hiring one soon and I doubt they’ll have an opening for it soon. They only hired me because of my 7 overall years experience in retail pharmacy.

I was thinking of getting an MBA and trying to go for a pharmaceutical sales type role within that company as i would be an internal hire + referred so i would be up to bat pretty much 100% of the time. 


Not sure if that’s the right play as MBAs are very expensive and the while the job is secure there’s always a 5% chance i could get laid off with no warning.

That job was decent but dosent make me a lot of money to get a new apartment and pay for expenses now of days unless I triple save so I got a new offer at a school based clinic and I’m so nervous. 

Bear with me this will be long:

At the after school program I worked with people I now call best friends so it made me sad to leave think about leaving. I’m super sad and scared. I’m going into a new environment and new schedule.

Another reason I was okay with leaving was because working and being responsible for kids was stressful and taxing. I’ve been there for almost 4 years.

I’m not used to waking up early everyday so please any tips on routine and feeling good each day. 

I won’t get many days off or breaks as my other job. With the after school program we would get a ton of breaks off with the kids. This one almost never closes.

Whenever I have extremely long days I feel numb and can dissociate. What can help me not do this and just push through? 

This job has me going in between two different sites. I hope I have at least a private area for lunch for some peace.

I hope to not fall into depression which I have before I had my after school job. I don’t want to fall into any sad or depressive states not being able to work with my friends anymore.


Please please give me any advice on this new journey of being in an adult job. I’m 26 so I feel like at some point this has to happen. This job is also more fitted with my career path of being a clinical social worker after my degree. 


I start tomorrow and I already feel anxiety and sadness creeping in which are feelings I dealt with on and off. Also I did try a diff job a few months ago without leaving my after school program one and it was so bad so I’m traumatized from that.


This new job dosent leave room for me to stay at the after school so I’m giving it my all. ",EmotionalBag3066,1,1.0,0,1739134987,2025-02-09 21:03:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilp4kb/new_job_advice_long_help_on_maintaining_change/,2,2025
1ilp36w,To accept counter offer or no?,"I’m in a senior leadership role and have been at my current employer 10 months. A few months back, a former boss reached out to come work for her. I engaged and ended up getting an offer. A few day later, that same former boss called me to tell me candidly she’s not super happy, the company isn’t doing well, and the job is going to change a bit from what we talked about. I told her I wasn’t interested with the new information, and she said she felt relieved and understood. Next day, she called and took it all back, saying she told the CRO I wasn’t coming and the CRO wanted her to make sure I still came - that the role didn’t need to change and they’d do whatever it takes to get me over there. I ultimately decided to go and signed the offer. 

Gave my notice to my current employer on Monday and while shocked and upset, they understood. We announced to the team Tuesday and my plan was to leave in ~3 weeks. On Wednesday, my current boss approached me and asked me to stay - offering a counter offer to give me a major title and pay bump. My gut keeps replaying my former bosses true thoughts on her company, as well as that I really wasn’t looking / don’t “hate” my current job / employer.

Everyone says don’t accept a counter offer - but I’m seriously rethinking now. Only hard part will be telling my former boss I’m not coming over after signing the offer, as well as announcing to the team I’m actually not leaving. 

Any advice? Will trust forever be broken or is that an old school mindset? I’m worried what my team may think when they hear I’m actually not leaving. Regardless of the optics of it all, my gut is telling me to stay.",Juliapete,2,1.0,5,1739134892,2025-02-09 21:01:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilp36w/to_accept_counter_offer_or_no/,2,2025
1ilp0tq,Graduating Soon – How to Transition into Tech for Higher Salary & Fund Engineering Studies?,"I am a soon-to-be 4-year university graduate (Spring 2025 graduate) with a mixed urban planning and public policy degree (Community and Regional Development) with a Technology Management minor and would like to change pathways (non-government) by entering into the field of technology for a higher salary. I also have an Associate’s degree in Public Policy and Business.

Eventually, I would like to have a Master’s in Engineering. However, I need time between now (before graduation) and after graduation (1-2 years) to take the lower division requirements and prepare for the GRE. Transitioning from a Bachelor’s in non-engineering into a Master’s in Engineering is challenging. I may need to get a second Bachelor’s in Engineering.

I have access to a year of edX in which I take courses for SQL, Tableau, Power BI, etc. hopefully to meet the requirements for data analyst, data scientist, and business analyst roles quickly before graduation.

I am also co-enrolled in Biomedical Equipment Technology (as a Biomedical Equipment Technician) at a community college with an expected graduation date of spring 2026 for the program.

At the same time, I am also taking as many math, physics, computer science, etc. courses at a community college and if possible at my current university.

What kind of technology and business roles (with higher salaries) should I look for? How can I become more qualified when I am making this transition?

I need to 100% independently financially support myself after graduation while taking engineering courses to get a second Bachelor’s or Master’s in Engineering.

I would like to hear your suggestions, recommendations, etc. on a game plan.

1ilo3if,Should I Take the Job??,"3 days ago, my stepdad came to me with a full time job offer at his company. He runs a small general contracting company and he is a one man show on the business side (he has one worker for manual labor). He wants me to learn the ropes of the company (manual labor included) while increasing my responsibilities in the business side (sales, marketing, strategy).

I love the idea of this offer. I’d learn a lot about entrepreneurialism. I’d be able to seek projects that I believe will add business value. I love the idea of improving things. I could live at home which is great because I could STACK $$.

But there is one caveat - I am not too sure I genuinely enjoy spending time with him. I worked on a project with him that was out of state for 3 weeks. We spent a lot of time together and he kinda wears me out. In many ways, it’s either his way or the highway. I feel a little tense around him because he is intimidating when he gets upset. He is extremely confrontational and slightly insensitive. Coupled with the fact that I may be a little insecure and loving guy, he is a little extreme for me. He also talks A LOT and I am a great listener…except it wears me out because he talks about things that he wants to talk about most of the time and I really cannot add to the conversation so I just listen to him. I absolutely love connecting with people on deep levels and this relationship doesn’t seem like it will provide this satisfaction. 

But the money is great and it is a cool opportunity!!

**Given that my success depends solely on him teaching me everything and spending a lot of time with him, should I take the risk and work with him (hoping it isn’t as bad as I think it will be)?** Hoping that my interest for the work will outweigh me not liking him a lot on a personal level. Hoping that us connecting over business will provide some sort of substance to our relationship? **Or should I work in corporate where I can find people I connect with more but make less money and maybe not be too interested in the work?** Even though it would mean a lot more job searching, interviews, and it would probably take a handful of weeks to get something (but not struggling financially rn).",FrostyBlackberry5191,2,1.0,25,1739132353,2025-02-09 20:19:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ilo3if/should_i_take_the_job/,2,2025

1ilmgt5,Will I regret turning this job offer down?,"Hi there, wondering if I can get some advice on a job offer I've received please. 

I currently work in local government and work for one of the councils that's been accepted for devolution, so in the next couple of years the organisation will cease to exist. There's talk of redundancies from next year onwards.

Overall, I really like my job. Mostly nice people, interesting work, I also work from home 4 out of 5 days a week, which really fits in with my lifestyle. However, there is a lack of progression and so over the last 6 months or so I've applied for the occasional job. So far, I haven't been shortlisted for any.

A few weeks ago, I applied for one which sounded really good, interesting work, and a decent salary (£6k pay rise). I was really shocked when I managed to get offered an interview! I looked back at the job advert and realised that the mention of remote working was vague - 'flexibility to carry out some work remotely' so I decided to enquire about the hybrid working policy and was advised to discuss this at the interview.

Fast forward to now, I've been offered the job, but when I tried to negotiate and formalise the home working aspect in the contract, they have said this isn't possible due to it being a new role. When we discussed this verbally at the interview, I was told they are open to working towards a 3/2 split, with three days in the office, but this would depend on how quickly I embed into the role. However, they've since said they need to understand the impact that home working will have on productivity. 

I've worked out my travel costs and the time it would take to travel (approx £150 a month, and 1hr each way, assuming there are no delays on the roads). I realise now that this is a significant expense, but adding to that is the time I would lose each day. 

My gut feeling is that this isn't the right role for me, as I do worry that the culture won't support any home working and this is important to me, even if it was a 3/2 split (three days in office, two at home). But with potential redundancies on the horizon, am I a fool to let an opportunity like this pass me by?

However, I'm getting extremely tired of my job and my rate of pay and I am desperate to move up in the world and do something I don't hate for a change before I'm too old.

Is there some sort of certificate that would be good for swapping careers or even starting one that doesn't take 6 years and cost an arm and a leg? I'm interested in tech as I love solving problems and building PCs, but I don't know what the job market looks like for that.

1ilkbzg,Should I change careers from Digital Marketing or stay in the field and build on it?,"Hi Reddit, 

I (F35) have been struggling for some time to find the right career for me. I wore many hats - from a government officer to a marketing coordinator. Since I travelled a lot in my 20s, and always changed careers and started from the bottom, I feel like I haven't been able to learn anything on the expert/niche level. 

For the past 4 years, I have been freelancing as a digital marketer but burnt out and would like to go back to a stable job, which I'd like (with a possibility of hybrid/remote). I would like to work in a bigger company, where I can learn all the structures and processes ( I always worked at small businesses). 

All the career quizzes I took point to the role in communications/marketing/event management (ENFP type), the thing is I feel that the industry is so saturated, often low-pay and nearly impossible now to get a job at (at least in Canada). 

I would like to learn a new skill that would get me more employable, but not sure, which one to choose. I've been doing some PM courses, but it seems to be a saturated field as well. I am not the best on the tech side, but was thinking if learning Salesforce might help. Basically trying to decide, what the next best move is. I am a very quick learner and could learn pretty much anything if I wanted to. I just don't know where to put my energy to. 

I was thinking Salesforce, Hubspot, Figma, Project Management tools/PMP. Would any of those certifications get me more employable? Would like to think a long-term solution.

I was hired right after my PhD as an engineer to manufacture the company's product - which is nanotech-focused so sometimes does require my PhD (physics). But as our company grows, we need more and more of our medical devices for clinicial trials, testing, verification etc. Now I spend 90% of my time just churning out these products.

I am about to take a week off to visit programs, which is not an issue since I have tons of PTO available.

1ilh5vn,Should I take this job?,"I am currently Director of Operations at a small boutique personal training gym. There are many reasons I want to leave:

1. I hate one of the owners. I think he is an asshole and pretending to like him is exhausting. Im starting to get tired of the other owner too.  
2. I am not happy with th job anymore - mostly managing people. I do not enjoy being needed for every little thing by everyone. I would like to find a job where I can just do my work and not be constantly interrupted or distracted.  
3. The company is doing very poorly financially and the 2 owners have talked about possible pay-cuts and also seem to put a lot of pressure on me to figure out how to make more money.

There are other reasons but those are the main ones. I just hired a career coach to help me figure out a possible new job for myself because I am at a loss for something I would actually be interested in. I took a couple of her career assessments and still not crazy about the results it came up with.

I have slowly been researching other jobs when one fell into my lap. A client at my work is looking for a new executive assistant and I met with him about the role. He is an entrepreneur with 4 main businesses. It sounds like I would help when needed with the businesses but also be a personal assistant, such as booking travel, shopping, maintaining his home, etc. Some of it sounds very simple while some of the things related to the businesses sound difficult and to be honest it scares me that I wouldn't meet his expectations.

I also worry about the work hours. When I asked him what the hours would be, he did not have an exact answer. He said maybe 8/9-5. Then he also mentioned there would be times where he might need to text me at 8pm and take care of something for him or gave an example that if its the weekend and he is leaving for a business trip and noticed a leak in his house, I would take care of that while he is away for the weekend. 

I definitely don't like the idea of being ""on-call"" for him. But he offered me more money than my current job and there would definitely be more room for growth and opportunities with him, whereas my current job is almost going backwards with taking away benefits and talking about pay-cuts.

I don't think I'd necessarily be happier but my mental health is getting really bad at my current job and maybe a change (good or bad) could help? I'm also afraid that I won't have another opportunity for a while. My job search was a very slow process before this happened. And a big part of me feels desperate to get out.

I don't know what to do and am looking for advice. Thank you in advance.

1ilf65b,What can I do with an English MA and college teaching/tutoring experience?,"I adjunct at a local university and work in the writing center. I love what I do, but there are no opportunities for full-time work here, and I am capped at around 20 hours a week between all of my state's colleges and universities.

I apply to full-time English Instructor roles whenever they pop up at the community colleges, but they are extremely competitive and many applicants have PhDs. I have tried to pad my CV by giving guest lectures, moderating panels and serving on curriculum committees, but I haven't he any luck.

Due to this lack of opportunity, I am looking to transition out of higher ed. Which industries/roles might my skills translate to?

My previous roles before teaching literature and supervising the writing center were: front desk manager, installation merchandiser, sales consultant (single-coverage, high-end retail store), digital content intern.

1ileljz,"(19M) deeply interested in history and geopolitics but studying CS in college,open to Economics and the MBA","a bit of background:



im from india and im studying comp science in my university. though im quite indifferent about this subject. i only major in it because of the vast opportunities available to me and not because of personal interest. I find myself deeply vested in indian and european history, to the point where i spend hours reading about it. I want to immigrate to the west, with the intention of obtaining  a work visa and only work for a few years there. however because of the general anti immigrant sentiment around the globe, im quite hesitant. I really want to pursue a masters in the MBA or maybe Economics, because those fields highly interest me. I only mentioned my in history because i hope to be enlightened about opportunities pertaining to my rather unique background. 

My only questions are these:

1) is it worth it to immigrate to the UK or the USA? i personally feel the age of immigration is over. Though i might be a bit to radical on that, can someone living there vouch for me?

2) if your answer to question one is no, what do you think about the future of data science? especially in a country like india which is so heavily reliant on its service sector. do you think the recent developments in ai can replace this industry?

tldr: i want to study the mba or economics in the uk or the usa. however, due to recent sentiments about immigration in those respective countries, im quite skeptical.

If I don’t go, will I always wonder what this new opportunity holds and if the current job gets cut or becomes even more toxic will I wish I had gone?

From the get go they wanted a lower notice period (mine was 90 days) and kept pushing me to negotitate with HR and they would bear the buyout.
Received the offer last Monday directly from the company HR who again pushed for a lower notice.
On Tuesday morning, I spoke to the new job’s HR and told them I would resign today and attempt to negotiate the notice. I sent a formal acceptance e-mail. That same day, I resigned at Old Job, a very lucrative position where I was highly valued, even the Deputy CFO called to offer me a higher package, which I declined. I negotiated the notice down to 45 days with the rest being bought out.
I communicated this to the New Job HR on Wednesday. 
Thereafter, it’s been radio silence from the New Job HR. They have not communicated at all on the buyout or the joining date or even confirmed my acceptance over mail or message. The pre-employment medical tests are scheduled for next Saturday (i.e. Feb 15th).
Today, the New Job HR messaged to say the New Manager would call to speak to me (no date or time specified).
I am now worried I have resigned from a well paying stable job without any confirmations (despite the offer and acceptance being over e-mail and documented).

I’m a final-year Psychology undergrad, and I need some guidance on choosing the right Master’s specialization. My goal is to land a high-paying job right after my degree, with opportunities for long-term salary growth. I thrive in roles that involve communication, networking, leadership, and organizational skills.

I’m currently torn between two paths:
	1.	Counseling Psychology: I know this field is often associated with therapy and individual counseling. But is it possible to use counseling skills in business or organizational settings? Could it be applied in areas like employee well-being, leadership coaching, or organizational development?
	2.	Organizational Psychology (or HRDM): This seems like a natural fit for my skill set, but I’m unsure how promising the job prospects are in India or the UAE in terms of growth and salary.

Geographic Preferences:
I’m planning to work in the Asian subcontinent, India, or the GCC region (UAE included).

Education Preferences:
I’m considering doing my Master’s in the UK, but I wonder if there’s a major advantage compared to getting a degree from India. If the difference isn’t significant, I might choose India and focus on reputable universities like Christ for programs in Counseling Psychology or HRDM.

I’d love to hear from anyone who has experience in these fields or insights into the job market. Can counseling psychology be leveraged in business, or is organizational psychology the better bet for someone like me?

During this time, I learned and contributed to every part of the business. While the company grew significantly, with an expanding team and profits, my paychecks didn’t reflect that growth. In fact, they were so insignificant it almost felt like a crime. I couldn't fight the fight as I needed the flexibility due to child care situation. However, newer managers were unethical and difficult to work with, and I could no longer tolerate it. A change became inevitable, and I eventually found a role in hospital administration. Although the pay isn't substantial, I enjoy the work. However, the growth opportunities are almost non existent in my niche role.

I’ve always been passionate about child psychology and would be interested in working in this field. 

However, I am in my late 30s, and with family commitments, pursuing a full degree in psychology isn't financially, emotionally  or physically feasible. I’m constantly seeking ways to pivot into this field with the experience I’ve gained. I am open to part time learning while working. What are some ways I can transition into psychology (aside clinic administration) with my background?

I think I’ve had enough and actively searching for my next role. I am Gen Z and since graduating in 2022, I have not found a job that is suited for me. But I know for sure that this is just not a great fit. 

My manager is extremely passive aggressive and condescending. Constantly throwing jabs and making commentary about peoples working style. And also useless commentary at work. Recently, they called someone uninspiring. This person was sharing their career journey on a townhall company call. That comment was made in our teams chat. And she said this is not very helpful for the purposes of a town hall (the highlighting employees career portion) and said she’s going to hop off the call.

I felt so uncomfortable at that comment because 1) this person sharing their story was a POC 2) a manager shouldn’t be making comments like that in a teams chat with junior team members. And isn’t the point of a company town hall is to highlight business wins, employees accomplishments, etc?? Like you are just being a mean person!

I used to think managers were suppose to be mentors and hold professionalism at the forefront. But this makes me feel so uncomfortable, it’s giving mean girl energy. I know what a great manager is, as my previous manager in my previous role was literally the embodiment of a great manager… but she left shortly after. Idk … am I being sensitive ? Or me picking up on these comments from my manager is just me being observant of red flags. No one seems to notice them, but I do. Maybe it’s a cultural thing since I am the only POC on a team of white folks.

1il27ih,How do I ask for less responsibility at work?,"Hello!

I am in a bit of a weird situation here.

I don’t want to give too many details but basically I applied for this entry level job at as an administrator. It is my first job straight out of college and it was so hard to find something in this crazy job market.

I got the job and showed up to my first day only to find out I was actually selected for another job title (was never told until then) that involved much more responsibility. 

Big red flag but I cannot afford to lose this job so I went through the training and tried to take on the challenge.

I have been there for 3 months now and I am drowning. This company is insanely small (less than 10 employees) and my manager actually manages two departments.

Ever since I started she has been focusing on the other department since she is the only one in it and I am effectively the only one working in my department.

The workload is not crazy, but I am faced with challenging decisions every single day that I am just not comfortable taking. 

I had not received any feedback whatsoever despite me asking several times, until last week I finally made a huge huge oversight and I found out I am supposed to take on even more responsibility that my manager just never told me about.

I am contemplating leaving because this is all too much for me, but I genuinely enjoy the job- I just don’t feel ready to manage the whole fucking department. I also know that it would look really bad on my cv if I left after 3 months at my first job.

I really don’t know how to approach the situation without my superiors thinking badly of me, but I cannot keep doing this. I have horrible anxiety and I can NEVER stop thinking about work and how incompetent I am.

1il1wph,Help choosing between 2 jobs as someone with ADHD,"I(26f) am trying to choose between being a floral designer or cake decorator. 
For some background I am very introverted/quiet and have had retail/warehouse jobs and 2 food service jobs which I hated. 
I have a big artistic side in general and since I love cakes and flowers I would like to pursue one of these jobs while I work on other goals. 
The thing is my ADHD can be debilitating and affects my memory. So I’m trying to go with the option that is less involved/technical and would have less for me to have to remember. 


A small flower shop by me is ‘help wanted’ for part time floral designers. It seems chill because it doesn’t look like it gets busy. 
I love flowers but don’t garden or take care of plants myself and I’m scared that I would have to have a lot of technical knowledge about plant science and have trouble memorizing all the plant/flower names and types. And it’s one of those things where I can’t tell if that’s just something you learn in training and it gets easier or you have to already know a lot. 
The cake decorating job is at my local grocery store. With that, I’m more worried about bitchy customers getting mad at me if I do something wrong or having unrealistic expectations and I guess it just generally being more work? I don’t have professional cake decorating experience either so im also wondering if it’s a thing where the training will make me get the hang of it.

1il0sbz,Torn between two job offers: the familiar research analyst role or the unfamiliar research manager role. Agency side vs Primary research firm. Advice?,"I'm unsure as to which job to pick after two lengthy application processes. My experience/career is in advertising agencies - as an analyst. Several industries but largely Video Games.

Both jobs are in Video Gaming, which I love, and both have strengths and weaknesses. What's your take?

Job A:
- Agency side Senior research analyst. Been freelancing for them for a few weeks already, I like the work and like the people.
- Great pay for the position.
- Work with top gaming clients on researching promotional efforts, social media, etc.
- The work is familiar but fresh. Is technically a step ""up"" as it's a ""senior"" analyst. But not a huge leap or change from my old job (except higher level clients and pay.)

Job B:
- Senior Research Manager for a primary research firm, also in Video Games, also with top clients.
- I like the people so far but have less a feel for them because I haven't been freelancing for them.
- VERY interesting work. More focus groups, surveys. Where Job A is research how to better advertise to gamers this research is more about how to design better games.
- Pay is just ok. Mediocre for senior management. Job A pays 10-15% more and doesn't involve management at all.

Job B seems like a better long term career move: being senior management, getting into richer/more diverse research projects, etc. But I really like the people at Job A, which is offering significantly more pay for what is more familiar work and honestly less responsibility (despite being a move up from my old job, albeit not nearly as dramatic as a move to Job B would be.) And while the work for Job B is more interesting, it's also more unfamiliar. And Job A's work IS still enjoyable for me, but it isn't wildly diversifying my skill set.

While I have a liking to finance, numbers, excel, etc, it’s not my true passion.

I’m also big into detailing, and I take pride in saying that my cars have never been in an automatic machine wash. I do it all myself.

Basically I took a software engineering internship that’s unpaid at a startup company that has no HR or anything. I don’t want to get to deep into why I’m leaving it early but basically the CEO told me I was going to receive mentorship from industry professionals and learn new things. However, it’s just a bunch of other interns like me and we are getting a bunch of coding tasks given to us every week with deadlines. This is not what I had in mind and I’m going to leave after a couple of more weeks. I have already been here 2 months. So the advice I need is should I ask for some signed letter from the CEO that confirms I worked at this startup from the day I onboarded to my last day. I’m asking because since it’s unpaid and it has no HR department how will a future background check verify I worked here. As far as I know it’s just this CEO and a bunch of unpaid interns like me. What if he decides to lie and say I never worked here? I did do some valuable things while I have been here so I want to put it on my resume. Do you guys think I should ask for a signed letter by the CEO verifying my employment for future reference? Or am I overthinking it and should I not bother and just tell them I’m leaving. And if someone also has advice on what type of excuse I should give to leave. I was thinking I’m just going to tell the CEO I got another opportunity I can’t pass up.

I didn't focus on development skills in college, and now I realize QA isn't the long-term career path I want. I'd like to transition into a dev role, but my DSA and dev skills are currently weak.

I'm considering two options:

Job + Self-Study: I could continue working in QA while intensively studying DSA and dev skills. My goal would be to land a dev job within six months, even if it means starting at a lower salary (e.g., intern or junior role).  My concern is how much I can realistically improve my skills while working full-time, and what the long-term salary implications might be.

GATE + Master's: I could leave my QA job to prepare for the GATE exam and apply for a Master's program at a good IIT or NIT. This would give me a stronger CS foundation and the brand name advantage, but it means two years with no income.

My primary goal is maximizing long-term career growth and earning potential in software development.  I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of gaining experience quickly (Option 1) versus building a stronger foundation and leveraging the IIT/NIT brand (Option 2).

Given my current situation (one year in QA, limited DSA/dev skills), which path would you recommend for the best long-term outcome?

1iktb2e,[UK] I need advice,"Hello, 
I need advice - I work in IT as first line support analyst. A position has became available on second line, and I fit perfectly for that role. Instead my manager is looking at getting a contractor in, and has told everyone I'm not technical enough. Even though I've passed all my exams and apprenticeships he's put me on. I don't know how much I can prove myself. I can't help but think it's because I'm the only female on the team, but I'm not sure. 
I don't know if I should write him an email, go into a meeting with him or what not. Previous meetings I've had with him, he's told me that he will never put me on second line or make me first line leader because I want to become a Power Bi data analyst. But there's not a job position for a power bi data analyst available in my company yet, and won't be for a year or two.

1ikrv2t,Feeling neutral after being let go...normal?,"Hi, 

I (<30M) currently work as an M&A associate at one of Canada's largest national law firms (Seven sisters) in Montreal (2021 bar year). 

This year, despite great yearly evaluation reviews, I was told that I was being let go. I am not sure how it is in other markets, but M&A activity has been at dramatic lows and pretty much everyone at the firm has had not much work to do since August. The firm also made the mistake in the last two years of hiring way too many people in the M&A department. Headcount too big, not enough work to go around.

To my surprise, when I was told I was being let go, I didn't feel much of anything and I'm trying to make sense of it. Reality is that I have been thinking about leaving the firm for about 8 months now because there hasn't been enough work for anyone and I didn't want my development to be affected. I even took the opportunity back in December to enroll for the CFA Level 1 exam since I had too much time on my hands. 

I guess that one reason I am not too stressed is that I have a very good relationship with the entire team and my group head told me that I'll be on the payroll for the next few months until I lock in my next job, meaning there is no looming financial stress in the short-term. Maybe that along with the fact I was already considering leaving explains why I don't feel really sad about it?

I'd expect to be feeling sad, angry, disappointed, etc. Instead, I'm just like ""Hm, ok. I guess that's the nudge I needed to really look at my options on the market and find something better."" Will those feelings come later?

As you can see, I'm very confused with how I've processed this and would be curious to hear about others' experiences.

1ikr8im,Private Banking: early age and location,"Hello everyone :) 

M25, I'm from Italy, I currently live in Luxembourg where I work in Portfolio Management; my life plan is to move in Montecarlo and work in finance. 

I received an offer to work in an Italian private bank. I would like to ask you a few things regarding this. 

If I start working in italy as a PB, i know I will have to work as an independent professional (Partita IVA), become a Chartered Financial advisor in Italy (national exam required) and build myself a client base. 

Given that I don't see myself living in italy in the future, 

1. how easy is it to shift your clients to another private bank, in another country, in the future? 

2. if I moved to Monaco (montecarlo), would I need to take nother charterholder exam to be a financial advisor there? 

3. are there legal requirements further obstacles to the mobility of a private banker which I might be missing? 

4. do you have any opinion or career advice regarding Portfolio management VS Private Banking

1ikqkec,What should I do next?,"Hello everybody, 
I hope you are all doing well. I'm just here to humbly ask for some guidance on some next steps I should take. I have a bachelors in Psychology and I've thought about going forward with getting a masters. I initially wanted to become a therapist because of personal experiences. However, I started to consider the medical field towards the end of my schooling. Upon advice from someone at the nursing department, I did a stint as a CNA for some time. 

 I found the work to be rewarding, but incredibly draining mentally. Someone had actually died on me my first week of the job. I decided nursing wasn't the best path so I looked into becoming a radiology technician. I asked people in the field questions and did research on the field and it looks to be a good fit. It's not bedside, so I won't have to deal with the emotional strife I was dealing with. Also, some programs I've looked at seem to already have some courses checked off due to my bachelor's. And it seems to be fairly lucrative.  Plus, the medical field generally seems recession proof for the most part. 
I'm just wanting to see if this path is plausible. 

Also, I'd greatly appreciate if anybody in a similar context can reply. I'd be profusely grateful to hear people's experiences to corroborate or argue against what I should do. Thank you to any that reply. ",Shango1208,1,1.0,1,1739030697,2025-02-08 16:04:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ikqkec/what_should_i_do_next/,2,2025
1ikpzpa,"32 Years Old, 4 Years as a Data Engineer – Should I Go Back to College?","Hey everyone! I’d really appreciate some advice on this career dilemma I’m facing. Here's a bit about me:

I’m 32 years old and currently work as a data engineer consultant.

I didn’t finish college but I have 4 years of experience in data engineering.

I make more money than many experienced professionals with master's degrees in my country (not in the US but working for a US based company).

I only have a technical degree, which I earned in my 20s after starting and dropping out of several college programs because of family situations.

Despite being happy with my current job and career progress, I’ve been thinking about going back to college to earn a bachelor’s degree. I’m considering either Computer Systems Engineering or Business Administration since both align with my field and future growth.

My concern is: Is it worth it to go back to college at 32, or should I focus on certifications instead?

My main reasons for wanting a degree are:

1. I feel that without a bachelor’s degree, I may not be taken seriously for senior or leadership roles despite my experience.

2. Long-term, I might want to move to a different country, where I’m not sure how much a degree will matter for work permits and career growth.

On the other hand, degrees are time-consuming and expensive, and certifications (like azure DE, snowflake, DBT) could be faster and in my field highly beneficial.

If you’ve been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to approach this decision, I’d love to hear your thoughts!

My concerns: what if the culture/leadership/growth development is not as great? Also. There is a chance a leadership role (level under manager) may be created on my current team in the next year or so.

1ikpah6,Feeling under qualified?,"I've been working in a pretty niche field for about 3 years, and I ended up here by essentially being in the right place at the right time and having a decent reputation within my previous company. I do not have the relevant schooling that nearly everyone in this field does, but I am slowly working towards a bachelor's degree. 

On linkedin I am being consistently pinged for jobs in big name companies and national laboratories and I just feel ridiculously under qualified when they're searching for a 4 year degree at a minimum, with master's and doctorate's being preferred. Coming into my current position and my last has been very intimidating, being the only person in these labs without a degree. I have this fear I'll be ""found out"" or that I will make a fool out of myself over something ""obvious"", even though I feel like I do my job well. I ended up withdrawing my candidacy for an engineering position due my anxieties regarding this. 

I don't know if I just need to put my head down and finish the schooling so I can get past this, or if this is just a case of imposter syndrome I need to kick?

1iko6ko,Transitioning career.. and gender,"Hi there, I'm looking for some advice if anyone has any, as I get anxious when I think about this, especially at night.

I'm 24 and I work in a warehouse assistant role with a small team. Picking and packing orders, operating a forklift, ordering consumables (tape, cardboard cartons etc), driving a van to deliver orders to customers, using a personal company email to communicate with customers. I'm also responsible for ensuring biosecurity procedures are followed by myself and my coworkers when imported containers are unloaded, which I have specific training for.  
I've been at this job for a few years, I've learnt a lot working here and taken on a lot of responsibility since I started (I was initially just picking and packing.)  
  
While this job has served me well in a lot of ways, I do want to leave it at some point. I've realized over the past couple of years that I am transgender, I want to be woman. This revelation has caused my mental health to nosedive, and I've reached the stage of acceptance where I realize that if I don't transition in some way, things aren't going to end well for me. I'm pretty confident that transition wouldn't pan out well in my current workplace, so I'll need to leave.

Which brings me to my next challenge, which is, I don't want to do this kind of physical work forever. I would much prefer to do something where I'm sitting in front of a computer all day, honestly. I enjoy the part of my job when I'm at my desk, sending emails or making spreadsheets (probably 20% of my job).  
  
Problem is, I really don't know what kind of positions I should go for, and I'm limited in my options purely because I don't know what to look for. I have no clue at all. While I have no problem taking an entry level position, I really want to move up and earn more, and I feel like I have what it takes to excel if I can find a path that's right for me. I just need to get a better idea of what's actually out there. I'm afraid that transition will make this a lot harder, and I may be forced to work entry-level jobs forever.

I like the *idea* of programming, I've tried to learn it from home a handful of times, but I've found the math involved to be overwhelming. I don't want to say it definitely isn't for me, but I haven't had much luck with it.

I know this is a lot, but if you have any advice I'd really appreciate it. Thank you so much.",Lumpy_Shame9413,0,0.3799999952316284,10,1739024170,2025-02-08 14:16:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iko6ko/transitioning_career_and_gender/,2,2025
1iknubq,Conflicted thoughts after leaving my job,"I've been in my role at my company (""Company A"") for a little over 2 years, but I've been at the company for a little under 5  years. Last month I started looking casually for new work and found something with a different company (""Company B"") very quickly. I just put in my notice this week.

The reason I left  Company A was because I was finding that I felt kind of bored and underutilized; I did not do very much work and often there were even weeks where I was pretty much doing nothing, not talking to anyone, etc. When I would talk to my boss about it he would basically say that business was slow and would express apprehension about the org's future. A mix of the boredom from the pace of the work/anxiety about long term prospects at the company (the longer I stay, the more seniority I get on paper, but then I'm not really building equivalent experience to back up that seniority) caused me to look elsewhere.

The move to Company B is basically a lateral move. It's a small salary increase and a much bigger company (think Fortune 100). 

I know I'll probably enjoy the new job once it starts but this whole situation has me kind of questioning my own work ethic and perspective towards the workforce. A big part of me is wondering whether it would have been better to just wait things out at my current job, because now I have to learn a whole new workforce again, a new role, and hope that this company doesn't experience the same issues as the last one. Current job was also talking about transitioning other work to me in Q1 but the job offer came in fast.

I am worried that my anxiety and potentially unrealistic expectations are what's causing me to job hop more so than career ambitions. What do you guys think? I feel like all jobs have slow times, all companies (especially in this market) can get into rough shape, and me chasing some kind of job where I'm full engaged and motivated all the time is ultimately going to lead me into burnout. I'm even wondering if I'm just not cut out for professional work at this point.

What do you guys think? When do you think it's time to leave a job vs stick it out? I'm already committed to the new job with Company B at this point, so no turning back, but my goal is to go into this position in a few weeks with a clear mind and an idea of how I want to position myself in the workforce going forward.",acid_police,1,1.0,2,1739023134,2025-02-08 13:58:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iknubq/conflicted_thoughts_after_leaving_my_job/,2,2025
1iknswi,Go for the Promotion or Wait it Out?,"I work in a company that has a very strong promote from within culture.  There's a deep seated expectation that ""high performers"" will take on a new role every 1.5 to 3 years.  If not, one is considered ""stagnating"" and thus taken off the list of ""high performers.""  I'm putting these things in quotes, but there really is a list of high performers at my location, and I know that our corporate division upkeeps a list from every location in our division.

I'm about 19 months into my current role.  It was a fairly large switch for me as I moved not just into a higher level management role, but also into a new function.  It was a stretch for me to get this position, and I've been learning every day for the last 19 months.  I still don't feel I've learned all I can from this role, and my original expectation was that I'd be riding out all 3 years of this role to learn as much as possible before moving to a new position.

Last week, rather unexpectedly, the person in a role that is one of two possible logical next steps from my current role, left the company.  Of the two roles that I'd look at next, this is my less favorable choice, but my boss came to me and told me to ""strongly consider"" applying for the role.  This isn't a mandate, but it's not something I can just ignore.  Shortly after that, our divisional corporate HR rep reached out to me and also suggested I would be a good fit for this role.  Again, still not a mandate, but the signs are strong that clearly I'm the favorite for this position.  If the functional manager of this role suggests I apply (and I have a meeting with him next week), then that's basically a mandate, but we'll see what comes of that meeting.

Here's the thing: it will certainly mean more money.  This would be the first position I took with a bonus structure as well.  It's hard to say no to a higher salary and the chance of a bonus.  However, I know the reason the last person left the role, and it's because this is an absolutely thankless role.  The department this role heads is in complete disarray from years of mismanagement and turnover in this role.  The organization at large treats this department poorly, which doesn't help with the turnover.  There's a lot of work that needs to be done here, and my knowledge of the department isn't quite what I'd want it to be to step into this level of leadership.  On the other, other hand, I've actually found that leadership is something I've got a bit of a knack for and something this department sorely lacks.  I don't know that I need to be the person who knows the most about the department so long as I can retain some of the very talented people who currently work in this department and perhaps expand the team by one or two to help even out the workload. Retention becomes a problem because one or two of the most talented people in the department will also be vying for this position and will likely be put out if I get selected over them, but I know that neither is in contention for the role because they have not shown strong leadership skills when put into leadership roles in the past.

Also important to consider: the other role I'd be a good fit for, and would prefer over this one, will likely vacate later this year.  The person currently in that role is approaching 2 years and thus will be getting pressure in the next year to move along, leaving the role I'd prefer open in my current location, likely around the time I'd be coming to my 2 year mark as well.  If I wait, I'll get 4-6 more months in my current position to learn more and a shot at the role I'd prefer.  If I wait, though, I may upset the people who are expecting me to apply for the current role and thus hurt my chances of getting any new roles at my current location.

One final thing to consider: the company I work for is global and has a lot of locations throughout North America that I could reasonably do either of these roles.  I was not actually expecting that my next role would be at my current location, and as such my wife and I were discussing the possibility of moving.  I've never been super keen on the idea as we have young kids and both of our families live in our current area, but I have to admit there's a certain allure to the idea of getting away from where I grew up.  If I pass on the current role, I may lose my chance at another role in my current location, but that won't necessarily remove the possibility of a role at another location later this year or early next year.

TL;DR: I've got the chance to take a promotion, but I'm not sure it's what I want and I'm struggling with making a decision.  Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.",booknerd381,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1739023006,2025-02-08 13:56:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iknswi/go_for_the_promotion_or_wait_it_out/,2,2025
1ikno87,Doing a job that does not yet exist,"Hello everyone!

I think it's pretty clear from the title: how do you do a job that doesn't exist?
My point starts with what I like to do and what I am prepared for, so I think it will be useful to set out my skills first:
I have an MA in Philosophy, with a mixed course of study where I have accumulated university credits in clinical psychology, psychodynamics, philosophy all and specifically logic, philosophy of mind and epistemology. In addition, I have two postgraduate courses in statistics and Bayesian statistics. I am a PhD candidate as a decision theorist (in practice, behavioural economics), but I am not sure about the academic path because my goal from the beginning was not academic but pragmatic: to consult on rational decision-making, i.e. to help people make better decisions by learning how to do it autonomously, making more or less holistic use of every branch of knowledge to do so. It sounds obvious, but a few mental processes pass between a good decision and a bad decision, and decisions overlap and influence each other over time in complex ways that I cannot explain here (I have written two theses on the subject). The problem is that this job does not exist, and the academy heavily discourages me from leaving the academy to take this step, which leads me to a struggle in solitude that becomes wearisome after a while. Any kind of advice is welcome and I will answer any questions that come my way.

Hi everyone, I have a friend who needs advice on career changes and a potential career coach/headhunting advice. She graduated with a bachelors in educational studies (no clinical/teaching portion) during COVID, unfortunately and it was really tough to get her career going since then.

She's looking for a career pivot for a job that will keep her on her feet/active and something 9-5. What are some ways she can utilize her degree without teaching? She's finding it difficult to stay motivated and was wondering if there's any programs or career coaches that can help her. Or any potential careers she can look into.

Thanks so much in advance!",originalgimchi,2,1.0,2,1739018751,2025-02-08 12:45:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ikmhtx/any_ideas_for_my_friend_who_wants_a_career_change/,2,2025

- CYBERSECURITY

1ikmdxq,19M that wants to take a risk this Summer,"Hi all, asking for your advice.

**Some context:**

I'm a Mathematics student at the University of Edinburgh (1st year of 3). All of my Spring Week applications to bulge-bracket financial firms failed, and I still don't have any work secured for this Summer.

I started a company last semester (my first semester of uni) which ultimately failed but taught me a lot. Now I'm building the biggest student-lead start-up community at the university.

I initially thought I wanted to work in finance, but that has now become my backup plan. I want to go all in on building something that people want, and my skillset needs improvement to get there.

I'm thinking I want to get a sales internship this summer to build my sales skills. Specifically in the U.S. because frankly that's where all the opportunity seems to be these days. I want it to be something where I actually develop my sales skills and bolster my resume for a finance internship in Summer 2026. Ideally a fast-paced start-up, but I feel like there aren't many of those looking for summer interns.

My resume is: a remote internship at a PE firm, the company I co-founded, expected first-class in Maths, triple A\* in A-Levels.

Am I going about this correctly? As a maths student, is a sales internship a smart move? How would you go about it if you were in my situation.

Much appreciated.",borgsant,1,1.0,1,1739018372,2025-02-08 12:39:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ikmdxq/19m_that_wants_to_take_a_risk_this_summer/,2,2025
1ikmda0,Poor performance review with poor explanations,"During my recent performance review, my boss went through some positives and some constructive criticism. I am all for constructive criticism but what was said I didn’t believe to be true. When questions, responses were weak and didn’t have solid explanations.

Moving on to the final rating (which determines bonus) and it supposed to reflect your personal performance, I was given a lower rating than from my previous 2 bosses. Telling her that I was surprised and asked for explanation she cites (1) since I have my direct report a higher review (which she had challenged me on) that they essentially had to make up for the deficit somewhere. (2) it was hard for her to rate me bc she was only my boss for half the year and (3) it was a bad year for the company so there was “pressure” for lower reviews. I will note that there are also ratings for group and company performance, which are also factored into your bonus calculations.

After this conversation, she initiated conversation to actually retroactively increase my direct reports bonus for the past 2 years because their target (included in their offer letter) was lower than the rest of the team. There was approval for this almost instantly. This makes me question said “budget”.

I’ve started looking for a new job, but wondering if I say anything to my boss or my bosses boss, who I have a good relationship with.

My boss is a women and so am I. Everyone else is male, and I feel that she actually treats me differently and I am unsure why.",ElderberryBusiness92,1,1.0,10,1739018302,2025-02-08 12:38:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ikmda0/poor_performance_review_with_poor_explanations/,2,2025

I'm an interior designer and 3D visualizer looking to start freelancing, I'm trying to decide between taking on outsourced projects or seeking remote contract positions, and I'd love to get some advice from those with experience.

1iklqwg,How to best fight for headcount?,"The company I work for has informed me that they’d like to reduce 1/3 of my team’s headcount. The reasoning being that two years ago, there was a period when my team operated on similar resources for six months or so. According to the company, that’s enough proof that my team is overstaffed. 

What the company fails to see is that unofficially, internal resources from other departments were assigned to help me on top of their own responsibilities. I also worked extensive hours, driving myself on the verge of burnout. Then I was promoted to a manager, filled the seats in my team and we’ve been delivering results ever since. There has not been any changes (in terms of systems and responsibilities) that would allow us to work more efficiently. Quite the opposite. Another argument was that because my team isn’t really doing OT, we got enough resources. You know why that is? Because us managers were told to avoid OT whenever possible since it costs money. And I help my team to prioritize accordingly and encourage them to maintain a healthy WLB. 

I’m devastated. It appears that the company incentivizes us to miss deadlines and work inefficiently. I can fill my teams’ calendars with useless internal meetings and assign them more tasks, but I’ve tried to protect them from the burnout I experienced. 

Any ideas how to best argue my case in a corporate setting? I work in the field of finance. ",Unusual_Jellyfish224,1,1.0,7,1739015965,2025-02-08 11:59:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iklqwg/how_to_best_fight_for_headcount/,2,2025
1iklcma,"Is it worth taking a $7 an hour pay cut for better hours, better commute and benefits?","The job I currently work pays $35 an hour and is a contract position. The job is easy enough and I like the people, but the hours and complete lack of benefits is starting to stress me out. I drive an hour to an hour and a half home every day and my shifts are 4 hours on Thursdays and 12 hour shifts Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I don’t get health insurance through this job (I’m on my partners and pay $250 just for myself). I don’t have PTO or sick time so whenever anything happens my paycheck is screwed. This month has been a nightmare with the company having to close for snowstorms and holidays that I don’t get paid for. With my schedule being on the weekends and getting paid weekly there isn’t any way for me to make up time if these things happen or if I was to ever be sick. Not to mention the fact that my partner works the complete opposite shift of me so we don’t have days off together anymore. I see him often enough because he works from home, but he’s still working. 

Now as for the new job, it pays $28 an hour. Offers 3 weeks of PTO, 2 weeks of sick time, 401K, health insurance that would only cost me about $70 a month, is only a half hour away, does yearly 10% bonuses and also does yearly raises anywhere from 3-10% based on performance (I’m just going to always assume raises will be on the lower end with companies). The people there are amazing and I’ve seen great reviews of the company online. I just don’t know 100% whether it’s worth all of these pros if I already have so many bills to pay off. I’d still be able to pay them with this job but it would be cutting it a lot closer. Thoughts?

1ikkgqc,"M24, already tired of corporate life","I've been working for almost 3 years as a data engineer (more specialized in ETL for those who know). I have been with 2 companies, and so far I enjoy my current job. The team and leadership are awesome, the work-life balance is great. 

I work at a very big tech multinational, but my job doesn't pay very much since I live in a third-world country (the company has an office here). Can't complain, it's enough for me to live comfortably, but I'm saving very little money. 

Honestly I have never been passionate about my career or the field I'm in, but I tolerate it enough to make it my job right now. I can already feel I'm slowly getting tired of corporate life, pointless meetings, and office jobs. 

What I want to achieve, is one of the following 2 positions:

1) Finding a job that actually makes me passionate. Currently, my jobs is to work on automating the flow of operational data to stakeholders, in order to help them performance. I enjoy the work most of the time, but it lacks real purpose to me. I would rather use these skills towards something that actually matters to me, not just to display sales numbers on a screen. Problem is, I'm from a third world country and my passport is pretty much useless. If I want to work in Europe or the US, I need to be sponsored and go through a long and pretty hopeless immigration process.

2) Finding a job that's remote, and allows me to work anywhere in the world. I would be willing to sacrifice having a job I'm passionate about, if it means having total geographical freedom. The country I live in is a very unstable one, so having the option of living anywhere would be great. As mentioned earlier, I can't easily go live in the western world, but I would love having the option to spend a few months in different countries that are easier to go to (south east Asia, Africa, balkans etc).

I would be open to pretty much any field where I have a chance of getting a job. I tried looking around for remote jobs that ask for my skills but they're pretty niche and I haven't had much luck (I'm specialized in Talend ETL). But ultimately if I'm able to completely change careers and move away from tech and corporate life, I'll be fine with it.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

1ikjqt0,Three Months at my First Postgrad Job and I Don’t Know How to Recover from my Incompetence,"I finished my master’s degree last summer with good grades and got hired by a family friend in November. My mental health was always very fragile and within two weeks, I suffered from anxiety. I visited psychiatrists, was put on antidepressants which greatly affected my already bad concentration and memory, stopped and resumed the treatment, got diagnosed with ADHD and started being on Ritalin on top of the antidepressants.



During all that time, my work was below standards. I made many mistakes, felt unsure about most things and starting with my antidepressant withdrawal, avoided (even easy!) tasks altogether because of sudden intense fear. I explained my condition to my boss and offered to end the employment, but she was very kind and told me that I can avoid the tasks that trigger me until I feel better. Next week I’m on sick leave to get my shit together.



However, I left a very incompetent impression on my coworkers. Due to my degree, I have a higher position than most of them but so far I have shown way less skills as they were all able to do the tasks that I avoided. Most of them have been very supportive to my face but I also overheard one subordinate mocking my abilities in the break room. The knowledge that they saw me at my most incompetent makes me ashamed  
(I have a past of social phobia). I also feel guilty since an employer without a personal connection to me would have probably kicked me out for my performance.



What should I do? Should I tell one of them about my anxiety disorder so that they know the root of my underperformance? Should I just focus on improvement so that hopefully, in a year they change their opinion? Should I speak privately with the employee that mocked me?  I don't think that my mental health entirely justifies my underperformance. I don't want to seem like I'm looking for excuses and lack accountability but part of me also wishes to tell them that the past few months don't define my abilities.

1ikhrut,Boss Holding Me Back from Moving into my new job title after 2 months,"I’m 32 yo and have been working at my company for over two years. In that time, I’ve consistently met every deadline, performed my role efficiently, and established myself as one of the company’s top performers.

A couple of months ago, I applied for an internal position that would allow me to WFH and I came highly recommended—even my current boss gave me a glowing review to the hiring manager. I was offered the job with a $15,000 salary increase, and I was excited for the transition.

But here’s the problem: 2 months have passed, and I still haven’t moved into my new role. My boss has dragged his feet with the hiring process and I have had to do his work while he went on vacation. Also, another person I worked with put in his resignation a week after I got my promotion and my boss has since hired someone to replace him.

My current boss has made excuse after excuse for delaying my transition: (he stated he needs to make sure his office is properly staffed, he claims it’s hard to find candidates to interview for my job, he even insists that I have to train my replacement)

I had no issue helping with the transition, but it’s been 2 months and there are 2 other people who do the same thing I do in my department who could handle the training. Plus, my new role is complex and requires its own onboarding process. To make things even easier, I took the initiative to create a full tutorial with videos and slides to train my replacement.

Now after waiting two months, my boss finally hired someone, and they’re set to start on Monday. I was under the impression that Friday was my last day in my current position, but just five minutes before I was about to leave, my boss came over to tell me that I’d still be responsible for my current duties until the new person is fully trained—which I have to do myself. Only then, he said, would he let my new boss know that I’m ready to transition and start paying me my salary increase.

At this point, I’m beyond frustrated. I’m tired of working for this man, and honestly, I’m at the point where I want to leave the company altogether. Any feedback is appreciated.

But here I am, stuck at the same salary, having learned almost nothing from my manager. The only thing keeping me going is that my role somewhat aligns with my long-term goals.

My manager, on the other hand, has played the game well. Her entire focus is on impressing leadership, and it’s clearly working—she’s been promoted twice in these two years. Meanwhile, I’ve stayed at the same level. But the thing is, I’m not even upset about the lack of promotions. From day one, I made it clear to my manager that I don’t care much about titles—I care about my earnings and skill development. And neither of those have improved.

The only real ""skill"" I’ve picked up is how to craft emails that sound good to leadership. But that’s hardly something I’d call meaningful growth. Unlike my manager, I don’t obsess over how leadership perceives me. What matters to me is the impact I make on clients/customers—because that’s what actually moves the needle in the real world.

Hello Everyone, I'm working in Infosys from last 5 years. Their I worked on 2 projects both are support projects. one was Informatica cloud and other is ADF.

my Informatica project was over last year and currently working on ADF project but that also I'm just monitoring most of the time. Its no difficult job once 

you get to know the flow. It will be hardly 2-3 hrs of job everyday same thing. Apart from my work I got addicted to YouTube videos and used to watch videos 2-3 hrs

daily that also random videos. Now this was my biggest mistake as I got comfortable in this routine that I did not think of studying some other tech and 

this I used to realize whenever one of my friends used to switch to another company with handsome packages. I used to study about IICS and SQL for my job interview

but this used to stay only for a week or two. After this again my normal comfortable routine used to hit and I used to forget about my switch. this cycle repeats

whenever someone from my circle switches the company. But now I know that Its a high time to make a change and I know that I am fully awaken about this, I am confused BETWEEN

so many things. 

I called one of my friends who is now working in Data Engineering role in Service based and asked If I should switch on my IICS (more than 3 YOE) role or ADF (1 YOE). 

He suggested that only ADF will not allow recruiters to see your resume better to sharpen your IICS and SQL along with Snowflake and than go to market for switch.



Now I am very much not sure because either my CV is not showing any skills (as I worked on Support project throughout my 5 YOE) or IICS is not having any scope. (I thing the 1st one is correct).

I just want some guidance/advice or any thing that can make my still career at least move a little. And since my company is same from last 5, my package is also 

very less (Infosys you see :( ).



I want advise on

\-If I should study on IICS and SQL, Snowflake and go for the interview

\-Should I learn ADF and other tech like pyspark etc. which will help me in career and job switch (this is a lengthy process that is why I do not want to go here)

\-Should I study something else and see..



Guide me please.

1ikbsf1,"47, From Design to Trucking","
I’m investigating a big career change from design/branding to LTL trucking for more stability and flexibility. 

My plan is to get my CDL, start with P&D or daytime linehaul (no overnights), and use trucking as a financial safety net while taking only the design projects I want.

Looking for advice from anyone who has made a similar switch or is in trucking. 

Questions:
1. How was the transition? Anything unexpected?
2. Any regrets or things you wish you knew?
3. How hard is it to get a daytime schedule early on?
4. Is the job physically tough if you’re not in great shape?
5. Do you still feel like you have a work/life balance?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s done this or has tips. 

Appreciate any insights! ",bob_estes,1,1.0,1,1738978825,2025-02-08 01:40:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ikbsf1/47_from_design_to_trucking/,2,2025

The job in France offers immediate, experience in modern manufacturing but is temporary and tied to a regional project with SMEs, whereas the master’s requires a larger investment (especially financially) but promises deeper expertise and potentially broader opportunities.

1ik8u45,Took 40% Pay Cut for Gov Job - Now what?,"I(33F)’m and recently made the jump from the private sector to public after spending nine years in supply chain within the tech industry. My last job became overwhelmingly stressful, and after the company laid off 40% of its employees, I knew it was time to go. I had always been curious about government work, so I took an eight-month contract with a municipal organization in Canada to gain experience.

Now, four months in, I’m questioning whether this was the right move. From day one, I felt disengaged—my manager forgot I was starting, onboarding was nonexistent, and the work culture has been frustrating. Collaboration is minimal, there’s passive-aggressive behavior, and things move painfully slow. A project that would take a week in the private sector took a full month just to get approvals. Maybe this is just how the public sector operates, but the inefficiency has been shocking.

The financial hit has also been tough. I took a 40% pay cut, thinking of it as an investment in public sector experience. But as a contract employee, I have no benefits, no pension, no vacation, and no sick days. The pay cut alone has been stressful enough that I’ve had to take on side jobs just to make ends meet.

Now, I have a potential opportunity to return to the private sector in a manager role—which would mean more responsibility and leadership opportunities. The salary would match what I previously earned (or slightly more), and the benefits are solid, including RRSP matching—though it’s not the same as a government pension. The dilemma: Do I take the offer and regain financial stability, or finish my contract and try to leverage this experience for a better public sector role?

Public sector job security is appealing, especially given economic uncertainty, but my experience so far makes me wonder if this is just how things are or if I landed in a particularly slow-moving organization. Meanwhile, private sector work is fast-paced, rewarding, and pays better—but can also be unstable.

Would love to hear from others who’ve been in a similar position—what would you do? ",wjddls3636,0,0.28999999165534973,15,1738970460,2025-02-07 23:21:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ik8u45/took_40_pay_cut_for_gov_job_now_what/,2,2025

1ik86b5,Am I overreacting?,"So, here is a summary of what has happened for the past few years. 

A few years ago, my boss told me she wanted me promoted eventually to s position we will call ""technical leader"". She said it was on par with assistant manager, but that the actual assistant manager handles the people side of things and the technical leader handles all of the technical details. I was very excited about this.

Last year, I started to press more on when that promotion might happen. I have been with this company for 12 years and have had the exact same job title the entire time (responsibilities increased though, with a moderate pay increase, mostly cost of living). She (my boss) said of course this should happen soon. 

After pressing more a few months later, she said that what she meant was not an actual official promotion or change in job title, but actually allowing me to do the work of that position. No extra pay.

It turns out that the position never existed, and that she never had her managers or HR's buyoff on this. Even then, I pressed her on when I would be able to prove myself and actually at least do the job without the promotion. She told me I could start soon after training. 

After I completed the training, she then told me I would likely not be able to do the work for another 4 years. Apparently, I would be too busy with the work in the role I am currently in. But she told me I was being groomed for assistant manager once that position opened up (currently held by someone who has 10 years to retirement).

While this was going on, I was busting my butt going above and beyond. Even working hours off the clock to keep the department afloat. I also volunteered for several responsibilities nobody else wanted.

I ended up pressing her further, only to be told several times that ""everyone is replaceable"". Which is code for ""you are not important and stop bringing this up"". 

I stayed a little while longer to get paid parental leave. But now that leave is ending, and I think I need to look for a new job. I don't think she did this on purpose, but I feel lied to and strung along with her promises of a promotion and more responsibility. Most of the rest of my department is nearing retirement. I am in my mid-30's and according to her, one of her top employees.

The whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth. I feel very disrespected and unwelcome now. I have started looking for other jobs.

1ik7j9h,Internship Scam or Missed Opportunity?,"Hello, I am a Master's student at a reputable university abroad. I graduated the bachelor in my home country, which was a 4 year engineering school. So this is my 5th year and a half of study, while I have also completed 2 years of internships/entry level programming jobs.

I was looking for another internship as a graduation thesis. Therefore, just working there while doing the final thesis for the Master's. I had 4 options, from which I choose a company that seemed to be a big company with a reputable name within the industry. After the interview, I have asked about the salary and was told it is a good one, but cannot say exactly. I took it for granted, as was expecting 700-1000 euros?

After a month, I receive the announcement, I was chosen for the internship. The condition for me to take the internship was to move to a different city, which I said in the interview. I refuse the other companies, and wait for the contract.

I get the contract - 500 euros. For me, it was lower than expected. Made me feel extremely undervalued - I remind you, I am studying a Master's with couple of entry jobs jobs of experience. I could perhaps get a real job but was interested in this thesis.

I move, I spend 1800 for this move. I get to the first day of the job, still didn't finish unpacking.

I like what is happening, feel interested in the topic, but felt it was so much pressure on me to speak with the whole building. I was asked to present myself in the first days repeatedly to a couple of different departments within multiple countries. I was asked also to do my initial work the same day. I was like on a roller coaster. I have announced that this pace is a bit too fast, as I also have moved a day before and had the final exams couple of days before that as well. I was interested in researching the topic and gaining more knowledge, while also communicating with my colleagues but not for this much time at once.

On Wednesday, I ask the Manager if the allowance of 500 euros could be risen, as it is on the lower margin, and I would have to have an additional job to sustain myself (500 for 40h/w). I get a promise to ask further. 

On Thursday, I am interested in a topic I wanted to discuss with a more experienced person there. I am introduced by someone within the department, and was about to ask my questions. The supervisor steps in and introduces me himself ""This is X, she is our intern, maybe you can teach her some things?"". Where I reply: ""Yes, this is my domain of study. I have this knowledge X, Y, Z, I would like to ask you about A, B, C."" The supervisor was in a different domain, so not his expertise. Then it was like he was belittling me, addressing me as this ""intern"", ""show her maybe a tool that we use"", but in a very belittling way. I also told him that I have asked about the 500 euros allowance to be risen, and he told me ""But this is a very good salary!"". I felt belittled even more. Remind you, this is an expensive country within Europe. The minimum salary is around 2500 euros. Also, there is no insurance I will get the money for commuting back, rounding at 240 euros per month, so the allowance would be more 260 euros. Also, this is with an expectation to be at work from 9 until 5, so on the clock as a normal employee.

The next day, at the end of the week, now, Friday, I am told I can no longer work here, as I do not fit in.

My questions are:

\- What is this pace to provide the on-boarding for the student of only couple of hours, and then expect so much of him.

\- Why would you make a foreign student move across the country to fire him after 5 days?

\- Why the low salary, why was I requested to be happy with it?

\- I feel like it was not a good fit indeed, but why did they make me feel so replaceable, so cheap? Why no respect for the ""intern""?

1ik71pf,Should I quit my job for an unpaid program abroad?,"Hi everyone, hope I’m posting in the right space.

I have been at my current company for about 1 year 2 months and came upon an opportunity to do a 3 month program abroad August - November 2025. 

My current job is in my field of interest (sustainability)and I’ve been learning a lot, coworkers are nice, remote, pay is $65K for my first job out of college (class of 2023). I definitely see how my day to day isn’t filled with what I’d like to be doing in my field, but I’d still say a great first job out of college. 

I got offered a very cool opportunity abroad in Europe that involves my interests in both sustainability and art. It’s not a certificate or even corporate skill enhancing program or anything. More like an alternative schooling type of program that focuses on sustainability and art lectures, workshops, hiking, etc. I should have around $40K in savings come August 2025, the time of the program which costs around $5k for room/board and food. 

Should I leave my job for a program that I actually would be paying to do? It seems like such a cool opportunity to take advantage at my age when I don’t have bills or debt and any other responsibilities besides my job. I’m just nervous because of how hard everyone has been saying it is to get a job. 

I’ve been thinking, maybe I ask my boss if it’s possible to come back if I’m only gone for 3 months but honestly not sure if I’d want to be in the same position coming up on 2 years there which seems like a good point to get a new position or go to a new company anyways.

Thoughts?

I stayed this long because I loved the work culture, the people, and the projects I was working on. However, the company’s culture has changed dramatically over the past year.

We’ve had ongoing layoffs since September, and recently, our CEO hinted at expecting employees to work 10–11 hours a day, five days a week, with no extra compensation—essentially, only those who “live to work” should stay. I have no interest in working those hours, but with the current job market, I’m worried that if I lose my job, I won’t find another opportunity with similar pay and benefits. Our company has a history of quarterly and yearly layoffs and restructurings.

This past September, the company offered a **Voluntary Exit Program (VEP)**, and 30% of employees took it. Afterward, they fired another 10% of the remaining workforce. Many teams, including mine, were restructured, and I was placed under a new team/manager. My new team consists of 10 people—6 of whom have worked together for a while and are very close. I joined along with 4 other new team members. The team feels cliquey, and it’s been hard to integrate.

My manager and I recently had a **quarterly review**, where he told me to take on more visible work and offer help to my team members since I’m in a senior role. He also advised me to always ask for more work if I finish tasks early. I’ve been following this advice, and while he seems genuine in meetings, his actions tell a different story.

* When I ask for more work, he either doesn’t give me much or assigns me long, drawn-out tasks. Meanwhile, one coworker, who joined the team at the same time as me, constantly takes on extra work, including some of mine. My manager regularly assigns priority defects to this coworker and another team member, often skipping me entirely. If there are 3–5 priority defects, they get them all, while I might get one—sometimes none.
* I’ve tried reaching out to my manager via direct messages for input on my defect findings, but he never responds. At a standup, he was surprised to learn I had already posted my findings.
* My manager also expects me to document my work so others can ""cover for me"" if I’m out, yet when I ask for help, even for simple questions, my requests are ignored or deprioritized.
* if he assigns work to my coworkers he expects me to talk to him and tell him I can take up those tasks if I can do it better/faster

This week, during my **annual review**, my manager slipped up and revealed that two bottom performers will be cut. He said it’s ""not our fault"" since we’re new to the team but basically implied that I might be one of them.

At this point, I don’t know if I should keep trying so hard to stay at this job when it’s clear I’m not being valued. The signs suggest I could be next in line for layoffs. If my manager already has me in mind as an ""offering,"" is it even worth trying to change his perception? If I want to fight for my position, how should I approach changing his mind?

**TL;DR**: I got moved to a new team in a company that’s become more cutthroat, with frequent layoffs. My manager doesn’t seem to value me and hinted that I might be on the chopping block.

1ik6fr0,CME @TUdelft or Real Estate @ESCP?,"I've recently got offers from TU Delft and ESCP business school for their MSc in Construction Management and Engineering (CME) and MSc in Real Estate, 2025 entry. Right now I am a practicing Architect from South Asia with almost 4 years of professional experience, hence I applied to Unis where I could shift into a career in construction either as a project manager or in real estate development.

Personally, I am someone who is well endowed with technical knowledge, the only aim is to invest in a better work-life balance after my masters in a better environment, where I wish most discriminations or politics are comparatively lower than I'm facing now..... hence my dilemma with both these opportunities. I also believe that I'd receive a positive response from NUS Singapore for their MSc real estate management program as well. What would be a better option in the long term? I am not 100 percent sure about the career options and long-term conditions after a real estate MSc, since I have no contacts that can provide insight in the long run..... especially with the present economic situation in the UK. What should I weigh on both and consider the most?

I really appreciate any help you can provide. Also, I'm planning on using a student loan for my grad school, if it's valid for suggestions.

FYI, I am a female if it is needed to be considered. The main reason for my interest in moving to a different direction is to gain a better/healthy work-life balance, and better social benefits/healthcare/ROI on taxes, moving to a place considerably safer both in law and socially where I could walk home without anxiety eating me up as it does now in at my workplace.

1ik5jyp,Stuck between two career options.,"Hey everyone. I graduated highschool last year and now I'm faced with the choice between careers.

I am interested in both the auto electrical field as well as a career in procurement. Since my dad has been working with vehicles since he was a kid, naturally I helped him whenever he was working on one of the cars(he fixes, maintains and service all our cars himself). My dad has handed a lot of the work on the electrical components and some other things on the cars over to me when I was a kid and to this day. Some of the things he just lets me help with though. I do enjoy it, sometimes he does observe at what I'm doing to make sure I'm doing whatever I'm doing correctly. He has taught me a lot about cars, engines, how they work, how to fix different things on a car etc. 

On the other hand there is procurement, another thing my dad suggested to me. He said that since I'm a very analytical person, tends to pay attention to detail, negotiation etc. that a career in something like procurement or something similar would be a great career to pursue. The reason he suggested procurement specifically was because he has a good friend in that field who can help me if I were to go after it. His friend also said that it could suit me well since he knows me well. I will be able to enroll in college or university if that is something that I'd need for the career I will choose. 

In both areas I would be able to get a good start, my dad is in the mining industry, he's in a management position so if I were to pursue the auto electrical field he could get me in that direction in the mining industry or trucking industry, whichever I choose. If I were to pursue the procurement, I could also get a job there. 

Another field I was interested in when I was younger was logistics. I haven't lost interest in it, it just slipped away. I would still consider it as a choice but it does not seem as likely as the other two. My aunt is also a logistics manager.

From someone who knows, what would be the better choice in terms of career progression, salary potential, job market and so on. I would also appreciate any suggestions on anything similar that's similar to these. 
 
After talking to my dad about this then, he told me that it's not something I should be rushing as I'm likely gonna do whatever I pick for the rest of my life and it's something that I have to decide on with consideration.",Alternative_Pop372,3,1.0,1,1738961987,2025-02-07 20:59:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ik5jyp/stuck_between_two_career_options/,2,2025
1ik5eus,Living with multiple mental illnesses and struggled academically. Do I have a chance?,"Hello, I’m graduating high school this year and it’s got me thinking. Before I get into it I think my context or background is important. I had a rough childhood, and had to focus on survival more than anything for the most part. I’ve now this year been diagnosed with a few disorders besides my diagnosis of significant ADHD I got prior to moving out. That being depression, CPTSD, anxiety, a “panic disorder” and mild ocd. I’ve been an independent minor for a year, living with a friend since my parents failed me and Ive been doing everything by myself.
Since I moved out of my mothers, my grades have gone up significantly and I’ve been trial and erroring medications to find one to help me with my adhd for my heavy forgetfulness, motivation and focusing issues. As well as an anti anxiety to make me feel just happier and stable. 
I really hate to ramble about all my issues but I have to bring them up here cause they all have disadvantaged me my whole life. 

I was very good at Social studies (history and politics) and was average in science and language arts, although I took the highest classes for them available cause I could pass them, with 60’s roughly. (I should add, Alberta has the hardest/best education system in Canada) Math was the only class im currently retaking to try and get a higher level of it as I took the lowest math needed to graduate previously but now regret that.

1ik40js,"Career advice BI, Data Science, BM","I need some advice on my study path and career direction.

I took a career test that described me as Investigative (81%) and Enterprising (68%), meaning I enjoy deep thinking, problem-solving, and leadership. Originally, I was interested in data science and machine learning, but after diving in, I realized the heavy programming and math made it less appealing. However, I still enjoy data analysis and statistics, so I started looking for a more business-focused path.

In Sweden, there aren’t pure data science bachelor’s degrees, only computer science programs with some data courses, which isn’t exactly what I want. That led me to explore Business Intelligence (BI), Business Management, and Economics as alternatives. BI seems like a great balance of data and business, while Business Management and Economics focus more on strategy and decision-making. There are also shorter two-year BI programs that include internships, offering a quicker route into the field but without a full bachelor’s degree.

I’m trying to figure out the best path forward. If I choose a degree in BI, Business, or Economics, would it still be possible to pursue a master’s in Data Science later? Are the 2-year BI programs valuable long-term, or would a full bachelor’s degree be the better choice? Given my interests, what degree would best prepare me for roles like BI Analyst, Business Analyst, Strategy Manager, or Financial Analyst?

I'm only a few years into my career, this new position is a big change and would be a ton of training for me to be prepared to handle this position.  I know I can learn and do it, but I don't think I want it.  Upper management came to me and offered me an interview because I showed interest months ago.

I turned it down, we don't talk as much now.  That is a factor of why I don't want this position.  The main reason is because I wouldn't enjoy it and it's not what I want, even if she wasn't the manager.  I am scared that I'm making a mistake in my career by not trying to get this position.  I just know I wouldn't enjoy the work and having to report to that specific manager would be awkward every day.  I don't want that.

1ik0u6x,"[Advice] My boyfriend (32M) has been unemployed for 3 months, and it’s really affecting him. How can I support him and help him find better job opportunities?","My boyfriend (32M) and I (31F) have been together for four months. When we met, he had just started a new job as a data analyst, and he was really excited about it. But as time went on, he realized he didn’t like the work culture—he was being micromanaged and felt really restricted. After a month, he submitted what was supposed to be an anonymous review of his manager’s performance, and two days later, he was fired.

That was three months ago, and he’s been struggling to find a new job ever since. He’s really frustrated, and I can see that it’s taking a toll on him. We had a lot of plans together that we’ve had to cancel, and we can’t really go out or do much. He’s trying his best—he’s modified his resume with better keywords, taken courses to get certified in different areas, and has tons of certifications that qualify him for the job. The issue is that he doesn’t have a college degree, but he’s gotten his previous positions through sheer skill and experience.

Right now, he’s at the point where he doesn’t really want to do much. He applies, waits by his email, and constantly questions what he’s doing wrong. He’s had three interviews so far, but no responses. I know he’s doing everything he can, but it’s hard seeing him like this. I’m trying my best to support him without adding any pressure, and I fully understand his position, but I just don’t know what else I can do.

1ijy7av,I lost my promotion to my younger coworker I trained,"Hi,

I’ve been waiting 3 weeks to hear back to see if I got this promotion. Immediately after my interview which went really well, my boss privately messaged me saying “I think that went great!”. I accidentally walked in on my coworkers interview as she thought I left already and was doing it at her desk- right next to mine, and it sounded like mine went way better. During my interview I spoke until the last minute and afterward everyone seemed to be treating me as though I got it. However, my coworkers interview seemed like they were done 10 minutes before the scheduled time and even as I heard her answering questions they were vague responses opposed to my very pointed detailed ones. She’s going for her masters in this field, and our VP obviously likes her better, but I feel very slighted and disappointed. I’ve been working here much longer than she and I’ve gone above and beyond for this company. To make matters worse (in my head) she lives with her parents and doesn’t pay any rent meanwhile I’m living paycheck to paycheck. I don’t have anything lined up and this makes me want to quit on the spot without notice. It seems like my VP kind of overrode my bosses decision and I’m stuck paying for it. This job pays minimum wage essentially + benefits, it’s reputable so I want to stick it out until my lease is up so I can move and make a career change. But I’m frustrated because I’ve already trained her and now I’ll need to train her more for the position that I feel I should’ve gotten. To add to the frustration, there will be a new hire that I will have to train as well. I’ve already trained 2 coworkers (including her) and now it will be 3. I’ve voiced in multiple meetings that I’m financially struggling and would love to stay here, but it’s clear this company could care less about their employees, given it was built from slave labor and continues to abuse labor laws in other countries by outsourcing work. I just really needed to vent but I’m curious to hear any perspectives as this just put me in a horrible mood. Should I quit with notice? Without? And just find another job?

1ijx97o,How to Move Forward After Review,"Our company has a weird yearly review process where you can solicit feedback from anyone you’ve worked with but also people can send unsolicited feedback on you. This all gets collated and reviewed by your manager/upper management. (IMO it kind of encourages a tattle-tale culture).

A coworker I worked with on a project gave unsolicited feedback to my manager saying that I was bad at forecasting, did duplicate work, and that I offended a client so badly they told him they didn’t work with me again.

I was shocked because I’ve never had bad feedback from people at this company. The fact is, we disagreed about forecasting because this person kept dabbling in my file; I did duplicate work because the client had someone on their side do the same work I was doing; and the client took my short email as being rude. They also said I was badmouthing the client when in reality everyone on the project was upset with them.

I’m most angry by not being told any of this during the project when I could’ve addressed this with my coworker and cleared up any misunderstanding with them and the client.

I feel like I was thrown under the bus and the like someone just punched me out of the blue.

1ijwosz,Informational Interview with Competitor?,"Hi all, I work in a real-estate niche within consulting - not a very small industry, but there are maybe a dozen players. I work for a very small company, and there are much larger ones. 

I am connected on LinkedIn with a VP at one of our competitors (despite no personal connection), who is ~10-15 years my senior and their career path has followed one route I am considering (a successful exit to industry in a strategy role, and then a re-entrance to consulting). I’d really like to hear about their career path and get their thoughts on an ‘exit’, if they are open to it.

One reservation I have about reaching out is that they are a direct competitor in our niche- it’s unlikely that it would get back to my employer if we spoke, but I worry about the conversation being misidentified by either the person I’d like to speak with or my employer, if they found out we spoke. I work with a lot of confidential real estate projects and have a laundry list of nonpublic things I can’t talk about, as well as our company’s processes. 

As long as I don’t discuss confidential things, and strictly keep to career advice (which is my goal), do you think it’s okay to go ahead and reach out? 

I understand this is a hyperspecific question (and I’m being nonspecific because this is an anonymous account). Thanks for your help!

1ijth9s,Seeking Feedback: A Platform Connecting Certified Professionals with Clients.,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently researching a startup idea and would appreciate insights from both professionals and potential clients.

The concept is a platform that connects **certified professionals** (such as CAs, doctors, dietitians, and consultants) with clients through **secure video consultations**. Its goal is to streamline the process of expanding professionals' reach while ensuring clients have access to trusted experts.

# Key Features:

**Verified Professionals** – Only certified experts are onboarded to ensure credibility.  
**Secure & Convenient Payments** – Transactions are handled through the platform for reliability and trust.  
**Flexible Scheduling** – Professionals can set their availability and consultation fees.  
**Marketing & Client Acquisition Support** – We simplify the process by connecting professionals with potential clients.

# Seeking Your Input:

1️. If you are a **certified professional**, would a platform like this help you grow your business? What challenges do you currently face when acquiring clients?  
2️. As a **client**, would you trust and book professionals through video consultations? What factors would make you feel more secure?  
3️. What features would be essential for making such a platform valuable and user-friendly?  
4️. Are there any existing platforms you’ve used for similar services? What do you like or dislike about them?

I’d greatly appreciate any feedback, whether positive or critical. Your insights will help refine this concept before moving forward.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Thank you in advance.",Medium_Departure7663,1,1.0,0,1738929894,2025-02-07 12:04:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ijth9s/seeking_feedback_a_platform_connecting_certified/,2,2025
1ijtfvg,Help - How to continue?,"Hi all. M26 in search of advice.

After completing my MSc in Management Engineering - Data Analytics, I started working as an IT Auditor in Big4 in my country, in January 2023, without having a clue of what it was. I then moved to Zurich in August '24, and changed Big4 to continue as IT Auditor. The hope was to gain independence, earn more and move in with my girlfriend.

Unfortunately, after months I don't feel well.

\- Work hours have worsened a lot compared to where I came from due to company/swiss culture;

\- I am still alone as my GF still has not found anything;

\- I cannot stand working as much as we do for something that I do not care about. I find external IT audit for financial reporting lifeless, not bringing added value to the client which you are working for. I would much rather pursue something like data analytics, for which I studied, but I am unsure of where to start and the market here seems to not have junior opportunities for a non-german speaker.

I have had nausea and anxiety for several weeks in December, and now it's coming back again every time I receive big workloads in this job.

Also, I don't care about going up the ladder and earning crazy amounts. My current salary is 83k chf, and since I have a very modest lifestyle, it is more than enough for me. I would just like to do something I like more, or to do a job which lets me have a good WLB, as the current situation is taking a toll on my mental and phisical health.

Is there anyone who could suggest something?

1ijsest,Need advice on rebuilding my career,"

I've been feeling horrible about my stagnant lifestyle. 

I am a 2022 BCA graduate from Chennai and I worked two internships as a junior dev (the first one was in Chennai for 20 days and the other in Surat, Gujarat (where my parents stay) for 2 months where I mostly learned JavaScript)
I didn't finish both the internships due to reasons I can't mention here because it'll be TMI. But the first one was because of my family not being supportive about me staying away from home and the second one was because I fell gravely ill and the boss thought it was best to kick me out. 

It's been two years since my last offline internship. Last year this time I joined a 6 month certification course for MERN stack development in Chennai, and I put it on hold after a month, as my family needed me back in Gujarat. 

In Gujarat, I did not join any course or work on developing my technical skills. I did not even work on any skill that could help me financially.
 I was only undergoing brainrot and then I also got on bumble and hinge hoping to find someone compatible and escape the suffocating grip of my family and possibly have a career and a supportive husband. 
My family is of conservative orthodox muslim background and there are a lot of restrictions imposed on the womenfolk. We're usually not allowed to step out alone. We're not given the freedom to choose our spouse.
My parents have been looking for alliances for me since two years now and they'd get me married as soon as they find someone who ticks all their boxes. 
I have tried various dating apps to no avail. On the dating apps whenever someone asks me what I do for a living, I say I am a budding freelancer while in reality I don't know shit about development. I am a liability to my parents and I'm only falling deeper into the shameful pit of being a nobody. 

I tried freelancing as a content writer for two months but it got super exhausting and they refused to pay me as I hadn't met their unrealistic goals. I got out of it and never tried freelancing again. 

Later, my brother asked me to build a website for his business and I did. Using chatgpt. My brother would ask me to make changes every now and then. At one point I myself couldn't understand the code. But I kept acting like I understood everything and I was capable of making a good website. Its been more than six months since I started working on that project and now I feel totally lost.
I've forgotten most of the concepts of web development. My brother got to know that I've only worked on the front end so far and is asking me about the backend and questions I don't know answers to. 

Now I am back in Chennai and I am planning to re join the certification course. Finish it this time for good and get my shit back on track.

While I'm contemplating joining the course, I sometimes wonder if I should get myself into the corporate world after all the trauma my family had put me through when I started out, only to possibly relive it all over again by my future in-laws through an arranged marraige setting.

 I also have an eye condition called lattice degeneration which makes me rethink my career choice sometimes. 

And then with all the AI progressing its way, will the job of a software developer still stay intact? Will I lose my job after working so hard for it? 

I also feel like I'll forget all about it once things get convenient enough for me to procrastinate working on myself and finding reasons to blame it on my family to avoid the accountability and guilt that comes with doing nothing. But I really really want to get it together this time.

How do I work on myself?

How do people become successful and have an undying resolution to work on themselves?.

Has anyone been through such a situation and are living their best days?

1ijr8ej,Career Advice??,"Hi everyone,

I'm at a crossroads in my career and need some guidance on choosing between three tech paths: AI/ML Engineering, Data Science and Cloud/DevOps Engineering.  
I know three roles are a lot but after a bit of research  
A bit about my background:

* I am a Indian I have a solid foundation in computer science with experience
* I've dabbled in projects involving machine learning and ai the hardest thing is math
* I enjoy problem-solving and learning new technologies, but I’m not sure which area aligns best with my long-term interests and market demand.

Here are a few questions I have for the community:

1. **Career Outlook & Demand:** Which of these fields do you see as having the most promising growth and job stability in the next 5–10 years?
2. **Skill Development:** How do the day-to-day responsibilities differ among these roles? What specific skills should I focus on if I decide to pivot in one direction?
3. **Work Environment:** For those currently in these roles, how do you find the work-life balance and overall job satisfaction? And if you could start over would you do it again?
4. **Transition Tips:** If you’ve transitioned between any of these fields, what resources or strategies helped you the most?",dhstwbwtsii,1,1.0,0,1738920746,2025-02-07 09:32:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ijr8ej/career_advice/,2,2025

1ijql7n,Am I being unprofessional?,"Hi everyone, 

 I'm a university grad student searching for jobs right now. Recently came across a posting on linkedin and applied thinking that I could be screened. 

After I did this I thought it would be a good idea to connect with people working in the role and ask them for tips regarding the interview (Idk why) I was mostly aiming for a student who got in through this path as well, but I ended up sending the following message to one of the professionals working there( i realised later that they didnt get in through grad intake). 

They didn't reply and I think it may be because I was being unprofessional or too transactional. I'll learn from this but I wanted an honest opinion on if & how out of line I was. A good reason they didnt respond could also be theres tons of resources for prep on youtube. I actually finished interviewing with the company and expect to be selected.

Here's the message:

Hi Name, 

Thank you for connecting! I noticed that you're a Position at XYZ and I was hoping to ask for your help regarding the interview process.

I’ve recently applied for the graduate intake for the same position and would greatly appreciate any details you can share about the types of questions that might be asked and what the role itself is like.

Also, if you’re aware of any current job openings, I’d be grateful for any information. I completely understand if you're unable to share specific details, but any guidance you can provide would be very helpful.

Thanks again for your time.

1ijnk94,Finally got a new job! Just in time for bonus payouts... Any advice on how to still get my bonus?,"After five months of interviewing, I said yes to an offer today! Base pay will go from $75k to $99k, come with a senior title and full WFH. I've enjoyed my time at my company, but I was underpaid given my technical skills/education. It was also an extremely stressful job with little growth. I love my immediate team and it will be hard to say goodbye, but I felt I hit a ceiling. 

I never saw a raise, a full bonus payout (b.c. of company performance""), or had one discussion about growth. This year, I was told my role was ""evolving"" without specifics - that's it. Heard that before. Also, they are in a full RTO swing. They made an exception for me, but it's beginning to feel tense. It was less weird at first because the RTO mandate was just 1x a week, but now it is 4x...it gets kind of uncomfortable.

Either way, I think they're going to be pretty shocked when I give notice. I own the company's BI platform and am one of the only people who know how all of our company's data streams work. 

All in all, I couldn't be happier. It was a top company on my list. It's not as much money in base salary as I wanted, but it's on par with other offers I recently received and the benefits are unbelievable. Plus, it's still a 20%+ jump. $98k is a good right? No kids, live in a midwest city, no change in expenses, etc.? 

Anyways, I spoke with the recruiter today to accept with a tentative start date on 3/10. One problem, this is the first year my company has a 100% bonus pool. I learned it later this afternoon in a company town hall. Meaning, I'll supposedly receive my full bonus. Last year, my bonus was paid out on 3/14...I tend to expect disbursement to come at a similar time this year (probably either 3/7, 3/14, or 3/28 since those are my paydays). I honestly just didn't think about it because we never receive our bonus, but it's like $3-4k I'd like to have. 

I imagine the company won't be super keen on giving a departing employee this money. I don't trust HR types. I don't think my current boss would screw me over, but he's also not in charge of it at the end of the day. And I don't know if the new company is going to help me at all (it's a Sr Analyst role at a big company, I'm not some director getting signing bonuses), nor would I expect them to. Just, is there any way to maneuver this so I can get my bonus? Is there some sort of standard procedure? I'm braced for the worst to just not receive it, but if I can navigate it, I'd very much like it. Any advice on what I could do?

In terms of certs, I have 2 UX certs, CRISC (IT cert), CAPM (Project Management) and DASM (PM as well).

Director roles seem out of reach as they want an undergrad and masters + 10 years of experience. IT roles also want more specific skillsets depending on the role. Most PM roles seem to want much more experience (and more advanced/specialized certs like PMP, CSM, ACP). Looked into and interested in BA, and considering a BA cert, but before I do any more certs, feeling like I need to pause and re-calibrate. I'm moving in all different directions atm and can't seem to figure out what I can land on comfortably with the current skillset and experience I have.

Most ideally, I know I'd like a remote role in a team setting that's focused on solution design or improving processes or digital products.

1ijkt8i,I feel mediocre because I keep getting skipped over at work,"
It's a vent but insight is appreciated.

This all started in October 2023 when I got a promotion to a reviewer position (reviewing other people's work) 

Prior to that, I was on a specialized team for two years (we'll call it the C Team), and I also had access to work the more challenging workload.

In September 2023 my previous supervisor asked me if I wanted to be a reviewer for the C Team when my promotion came through. I told him that I would like to. My supervisor also indicated that he asked my coworker who also got the promotion. However, when my promotion came through, I was not added to the C Team but my coworker was. I just thought: maybe they didn't have a spot open. But.... when another coworker from the C Team was promoted to reviewer a few months later, the supervisors moved people around to add her back to the team as a reviewer.

I've also been kicked off of teams without warning in the last year. In February 2024 I found out that I lost my specialized access, and no one told me and my new supervisor didn't give me any insight. I only found out months later that it was a numbers issue, but even so, most people kept their access after getting promoted. The last team kick off happened a few months ago.

In October I was asked to take over a spot on a team for a coworker who received a promotion. There was never an official update but the team was notified that I joined. It was going good until I realized in late December that I wasn't receiving anything from the team. That's when I realized they updated the team lists to remove the coworker and they never added me. I haven't asked why I was removed because the message seems passively clear. 

I don't think I'm awful at my job, but I feel like I get left out. Maybe someone thinks I'm bad?... I don't know. I do know that my current supervisor doesn't know about all my past specialized work and doesn't seem to care all that much. The only supervisor who took stock in me was my supervisor from 2023. He saw and valued the quality of my work. 

I feel like I'm not a favorite and I've never been.",betj67,1,1.0,1,1738896268,2025-02-07 02:44:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ijkt8i/i_feel_mediocre_because_i_keep_getting_skipped/,2,2025
1ijkre8,Mortgage Servicing- Career Pivot,"
Hi, 

At times I feel like mortgage servicing industry is dead end with no progression and making $25 per hour is not sustainable.

I’ve worked in this industry for over 10 years with very little progression or mentorship from management team. I’ve always been awarded with more tasks = no monetary gain. A girl is TIRED. 

During this time I’ve held the following roles within Default Servicing (Bankruptcy), Loan Administration (Escrow Analysis), Loan Boarding & Acquisition . 

If I wanted to pivot outside of the industry, what would you recommend? Where can I utilize my skill set the best and be paid well.

1ijkr3d,Should I Build My Career in the UK or Try to Make Australia Work?,"
Hey everyone,

I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could really use some advice from people who have been in a similar position.

I’ve been in Australia for the past year on a working holiday visa, and I’ve absolutely fallen in love with the lifestyle here. I also have family in Australia, and in the long term, I feel like it might be a better place to live than the UK, given the current state of things there. However, I have a degree in Geography and Economics, and my work experience is mostly UK-based (finance at Oxfam, consulting at Capgemini, and logistics at Wimbledon). Because of this, I have significantly more job opportunities in the UK, where I wouldn’t need to worry about visas.

That said, I also do like aspects of the UK—London is much livelier than any Australian city, and all my friends live there, which could contribute to a good quality of life. My concern is that if I return to the UK now to build my career, it might be much harder to integrate into Australian life later on if I try to move back.

Ideally, I’d love to go into consulting—something dynamic, non-mundane, and with travel opportunities. Is there a way to make Australia work for me career-wise without sacrificing my professional growth? Are there consulting firms in Australia that would hire someone with my background, potentially sponsoring a visa? Or should I build my career in the UK first and look for a way back later?

Would love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or knows about job prospects in Australia for someone with my experience!

Thanks in advance.

1ijk6d8,Considering Leaving a Company after 35 Years for 33.5% increase," I have been with the same company (60k+ employees) for over 35 years and received an offer out of the blue from a smaller company.  They are offering me $53K more than what I currently make (this is like a 33.6% increase from what I currently make, it's a pretty substantial pay increase and has both a 401K 3% match, plus profit sharing of about 7-9%.  The main difference is that the medical, dental, vision, plus  are substantially more which reduce that $53k down by about $19, plus 11 days less in days off.  The larger company also offers a bit more benefits that the smaller company does not. 

I've been loyal to my current company for such a long time.  I have a nice 401k and am lucky to have started with my company before it went to the stock market and also have a pension plan with them.

My current company without me asking is all of the sudden offering me a 10% increase which seems a bit strange.

1ijj3f5,Stay in High Paying but Unmotivating Job vs. Pay Cut for Potential Future Growth?,"Stay in High Paying but Unmotivating Job vs. Pay Cut for Potential Future Growth?

I (F23) have been struggling with the prospect of leaving my current full-time remote financial consulting role for a data analysis product. I started last July after graduating from university with a Bachelor of Commerce. However, the fully remote aspect has been enabling me to slack a bit day to day which has led me into a pretty dark space of depression. I feel so disconnected to my team each day, no more puts on their cameras in the very few meetings we have, and the workload itself is pretty stagnant and doesn’t interest me in terms of future careers. Although I have lots of down time to focus, I don’t really use my free time to my advantage and have been feeling so lost and unmotivated to keep chugging along. I have been seeing a therapist to get to the root, and I think the cause of my depression is the lack of fulfillment in my current role and no paths to really grow after this position. However, it pays $87,000 CAD and has excellent benefits (4 weeks off - medical/dental - American company explains the pay - Lol). 

Now you might be thinking, what the hell STAY YOU IDIOT. However, I am heavily debating with transitioning into a Business Development Associate role at one of the larger more established banks in the city. I interviewed with them today… I am extremely qualified for the role and have already had direct experience in the department. I know the managers in the territories I would be covering, and have good relationships with them. It’s super dynamic, collaborative, and an environment to hustle - quite different than my current situation. However, pay range is $50k - 65k, four days a week into Toronto (1 hour commute), and most certainly less vacation time. I nailed the interview, however did mention that considering I have previous DIRECT experience with her and the team, my pay range would be in the 75k - 85k ballpark. As this is a Canadian bank (lol), I don’t think my request will age well, but she took note. That said, I do think this position would allow me to network and get my name out there way more effectively than my current job where everyone is remote and scattered all over the globe. I have also seen many internal promotions with some BDAs moving up to becoming BDMs within 2 years if they show promise.

At 23, I am trying to set myself up for financial success. I currently live rent free with my parents and have been able to save over $13k over the last 7 months. However, I don’t know if the day to day lack of motivation and happiness I am feeling is worth the pay of this current role. This change may also motivate me to move into the city and rent for a little bit to be closer to work and other opportunities. 

Should I consider taking a pay/benefits cut for a role that could potentially lend better to other financial sales careers for my future? Is early 20s the time to grind it out and hustle in the trenches? I feel like if I don’t consider these other roles, I am only prolonging biting the bullet and starting from square one in this industry.

1ijis22,Had a career-impacting injury... now what?,"Hey everybody. Apologies in advance for the long post (I’ll put a tl;dr at the end); advice, encouragement, or anything in between is greatly appreciated.  
  
So backstory: I graduated college with a BS in Industrial and Systems Engineering. My first job ended up working for a food manufacturing company. It was my job to go out onto the floor, observe processes, and improve them in any way I could; primarily hands-on work, with some data analysis and desk work in-between. I didn’t have much professional/intern experience, I felt the need to “prove myself”, which led to ridiculous amounts of overtime and never really saying no to my boss. As a result, I often took responsibilities that weren’t part of my role, in the hopes of climbing the ladder.  
  
Fast forward, one job ended up resulting in a workplace injury, which caused permanent spine damage and constant pain that worsens significantly with physical strain. A year of PT and 10 months of a mandatory disability leave of absence later, the pain has not subsided and I have now left the company, after a total of 2.5 years (including the leave of absence).  
  
So now, I’m in a bit of a tough situation: I have permanent restrictions (can’t lift moderate weights, can’t be on my feet all day, can't frequently bend over, etc.) that prevent me from doing the work I specialized in, and I’ve been out of work for over a year now, so I feel out of practice. To add on to that, I have an underlying worry/fear that I’ll let myself get walked all over in my next job, so I really don’t know what to do. I have enough in my savings account to cover a two or four-year degree or the cost of certifications, so that opens up my options a bit. Here are the options I've considered so far:  
  
1) **Go back to college and get a two or four-year degree in a career that support pure desk or remote work**. I've already taken several courses in computer programming throughout college (as well as all throughout high school), so I believe an accelerated online program would be manageable. Only concern is the resume gap it will cause.  
  
2) **Apply to jobs within my specialization**. There are plenty of jobs available, but all of the postings I've seen mention physical requirements that I won't be able to accommodate. Do you all think that physical limitations are enough to warrant not hiring an otherwise promising candidate, or would I be wasting my time by applying?  
  
3) **Strengthen current skills with online certifications**. Seems like a good idea regardless of intent, but I'm unsure if they will have enough impact on my hireability to outweigh my physical limitations.  
  
If you all have any other potential options for me, I'd be beyond grateful to hear them. Again, thank you all in advance for any help or even for just reading; I'm really concerned about my future and need any advice I can get.   
  
TL;DR: I overworked myself in attempt to further my career/""climb the ladder"", but ended up permanently injuring myself that keeps me from doing the work my degree specializes in. Now I don’t know if I should persist through my injury, or shift to a different, less physically-demanding career.

1ijipgh,Scheduling Conflicts,"Hi Everybody

I work in retail while being an active college student. For every semester I give my work place at least a month-two month notice of my future schedule for classes and the days that i can/cannot work. Recently this semester I have lab placed on Thursday (a day ive worked forever) and I gave them a notice at the end of December that I couldn’t work Thursdays starting February. 

They had written it down on the schedule sheet that shows everyones schedule that i cannot work Thursdays starting in February. And the front desk lady and I had a whole conversation about the field I am going in so they are actively aware that I am in school. They even had confirmed it verbally too that they will get me off that schedule. 

It’s February 6th, Thursday and they call me if Im coming in for my shift in the middle of lab. I let my phone ring and let it be sent to voicemail because im in the middle of lab and will be docked off points if my phone is out. 

I’m honestly terrified if I call back as my Boss is a mean lady who has a tone issue and has chased off previous employees before from her attitude. She’s even yelled at me before for coming in on a day accidentally that we were closed. My bad g, I was just ready to work and forgot the date?????

Anyway

I work tomorrow and I am honestly beyond terrified on what is going to happen. Can I get in severe trouble even though giving my employers enough time notice of my availability changing? Or can I just tell them that it was on the schedule that I am unavailable?

1ijgqcf,Struggling to decide the Right Career move –research vs project coordination ?,"
Hey everyone,

I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in nursing (based in Australia).Towards the end of my degree I realised I didn’t want to pursue nursing and Instead, I gained interest in project management/coordination and research routes in the healthcare sector. I’ve been applying for jobs- all sorts of entry level ones, but I feel like my qualifications and experience don’t fully align with the roles above.

Right now, I’m considering further study and looking at these courses:

A Graduate Certificate in Clinical Trial Operations- Macquarie uni 

A Graduate Diploma in Project Management- western Sydney uni 

A Master of Public Health- western Sydney uni 

Grad diploma of research in medicine, health and human sciences- Macquarie uni 

I don’t want to commit to a course just for the sake of it, especially since I’m still figuring out what career would suit me long-term out of all the options. I’m open to a career that combines research and project management to see if there is a particular field I want to lead towards. Ideally building on work experience would be better instead of going back to study but the job market is heavily competitive right now and most employers want experience. I find that I can sell myself with my nursing background to a certain extent but competing with more qualified candidates makes it harder to stand out. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would love to hear from people working (or studying) in clinical research, quantitative + qualitative research, project management in healthcare—what helped you break into the field? Do you think further study is necessary, or still keep trying for employment ?

Any advice would be really appreciated!",ChampionSwimming3533,1,1.0,0,1738884292,2025-02-06 23:24:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ijgqcf/struggling_to_decide_the_right_career_move/,2,2025

1ijdsmw,Do I quit my job after 3 months for a lower paying offer?,"I’m in a bit of a tough spot and would love to hear different perspectives.

Quick background: I’m 23, recently graduated with a degree in graphic design, and currently pursuing a bachelor’s in marketing online (100%) while working full-time. So far, balancing both has been manageable. 
My long-term goal is to be a creative director and eventually start my own creative direction agency for high fashion. The sooner I can start this, the better.

So here’s the situation: A few months ago, I was approached by a textile company in Zürich, owned by a friend’s parents. They saw a fashion magazine I designed at an exhibition, which impressed them, and they therefore invited me for a meeting. They offered me a creative marketing role with the opportunity to do art direction for product shoots, mentioning that I’d have a lot of creative freedom. They also mentioned that they’re looking for someone to take over the company in the future, possibly alongside their daughter (who joins in June and is a close friend of mine). Obviously this sounded like an incredible opportunity.

After joining, I realized some promises weren’t genuine. Coworkers told me I wasn’t the only one they had said the “take over the company” idea to (I wasn’t the one to bring this up). I was also told that the art direction thing probably won’t happen, as they always decide last minute they’d rather spend less money and use AI :/ Last week I experienced this first hand.

The biggest issue, however, is the work environment. One of the two bosses is a complete asshole—he shouts at employees, mocks people, makes racist remarks, and has outbursts, banging tables and disrespecting people. Not long ago he apparently screamed at an employee, told her to fuck off, and left her crying in the street. Many employees are now quitting due to this, and multiple people have had breakdowns within the month I’ve been there. The upside is that the marketing team doesn’t deal with him much, and is never really on the receiving end.

Despite this, I do enjoy the actual work, and experience in textile marketing is very valuable. The majority of people working here have fashion backgrounds, and the other boss is extremely lovely and really likes me. There’s also the issue that, since my friend’s entire family works there (both her dads run the company, and her mom works there too), leaving after a few months would be awkward and could strain my relationships with her and the family members I’m close with.

Here’s where the other offer comes in: Recently, a creative direction and marketing agency in Zürich reached out to me. I originally applied for an internship last year, but they needed someone for longer than six months. They kept me in mind, and two weeks into my new job, they reached out to me, offering me a junior art director position.

Not only is this is my dream agency, but the title of an art director is hard/almost impossible to get straight after studies. The agency is well-respected, run by amazing people, and get loads of applications each day. They offer unlimited paid holidays and are about to introduce a 4-day workweek with full-time pay, which would give me more flexibility for my studies and building my own agency. 
Where I’m currently working, there is no home office and 4 weeks holiday per year (the standard). There is no flexibility.

The challenge is that they’ve given me two options:
- Start now as an intern and transition into a full-time role.
- Wait a year and join directly in a normal position.

For me, staying in my current job for a year makes the most sense. It would allow me to gain textile industry experience, save money while I still live at home, and fulfill the requirements for my Swiss passport application, which needs me to have a stable, well-paying job. I’ve already invested a lot into this process, and restarting it would be a nightmare.

The problem is, the agency really wants me to start now, and I’m worried that by next year, the offer might no longer be available. They could hire someone else or the situation at the company could change, meaning I might lose this chance altogether.

So my options are:
- Stay at my current role and hope the agency will take me next year.
- Take the internship at the agency now

Or, if there’s another alternative I haven’t thought of, I’d love to hear it. I have a meeting with them next week, so any advice would be great.

This whole situation is very stressful but I’m also very grateful to be in such a situation.

1ijdli9,Would you tell prospective employers that your name comes up in a google search linking to an article online about getting fired for posing nude?,"I asked a question a few months ago sort of like this but in my title/question I wasn't clear. My fault. To summarize, when you type my real name online there is a news article that comes up about me getting fired from a law firm for posing nude. It's the first thing that comes up in a google search. I used to model under an alias. I modeled online and was in an adult magazine, some contests, and a local magazine. The problem is my real name was used in the article. I got some great advice last time on here and tried to find the publisher of the local magazine to de-index my real name or remove it from the article. Unfortunately, it was sold to a new company, all the current employees were fired, therefore not giving me the option to ask the original author to remove it. They then sold it to another person who is impossible to contact. I heard he has something to do with Only Fans, not sure. Therefore, that solution didn't work. I live in St. Louis but would like to move to my hometown of Chicago to be with my family. I will need to look for a job before I move there but don't want to get the job, move and then get fired after I start because they found this article. The law firm fired me on the 2nd day at work because they said someone told them about my modeling plus a lawyer there had the same last name as my alias last name. I didn't tell anyone at that job and would never in a professional environment. Please don't judge me. I was judged enough plus a struggling single mom and I am actually very different than what my persona was. Would you say something at interviews or in the hiring process? A lot of employers do a google search now. Would you only look at maybe more progressive work places where they wouldn't care (hopefully) about that article or what I did or think that what the law firm did was not ok? I don't want to look like a whistle blower or be fired for the same reason. Any advice would be appreciated.

1ijdd17,Possible careers paths from translation and editing,"I'm a 40 yo Italian who apart from a couple internships has then been a freelance translator, copywriter and editor for the past 12 years. 

My bachelor's and master's are in Comparative Literature and Film and Multimedia and ever since graduation I worked as a translator, mostly focusing on subtitles for movies and TV and on marketing localization plus some long collaborations as a creative copy.

This has worked so well for me until one year and a half ago, I never struggled with money, was very content, also got some roles as team lead, language supervisor on big projects, and got to include some famous brands on my portfolio. But in the past year and a half workflow has decreased a lot and for different reasons (reallocations, an agency losing an end client) I lost two big clients and at my age I don't want to face big rollercoasters of uncertainty anymore.

I also am happy to have a more social job instead of sitting mostly in front of my computer.

What I'm struggling is to understand what path I could take from here. As a copy, I believe I have great value, but I always worked with a team where I never handled the strategic / analytic part except some SEO, and in the past weeks all the openings I saw for copywriters require experience in strategy and recruiters obviously want to see numbers about the impact of your writing.

Does anyone have any suggestion? Maybe someone had to made a similar switch, or some business owner / recruiter has ideas of roles where my kind of experience is valued?

Would it be worth it taking a year off and doing a master to specialize in something i.e. project managing, digital marketing?

I feel I have a strong CV that shows proactivity, great self-management skills and writing/communication skills, with big clients on my portfolio (Netflix, Apple) but at the same time when I see the requirements on job openings I feel behind anyone who is 15 years younger than me and worked for 1 year in a marketing office.

Any idea is welcome, I feel energy from the possible change and also feel a little lost and hopeless at time.

1ijalqa,Seeking Career Guidance: 15 Years of Entrepreneurship & Marketing Experience—Ready for Career Change but Struggling with Offer I Don’t Want,"Hey Reddit,

I’m hoping to get some advice from those who have transitioned from entrepreneurship into the traditional workforce, or anyone who has experienced a similar career shift. Here's my situation:

I (34M) have 15 years of experience as an entrepreneur, specializing in marketing, customer experience, and product development, among other areas. These are the fields I’m most passionate about pursuing in my career, though I’m open to other opportunities as long as they don’t involve sales. I’ve built and run several businesses, and while some were more successful than others, they were all successful in their own right. However, I’m now ready to transition away from entrepreneurship and focus on finding a stable, fulfilling role in a company with a healthy culture and a strong work-life balance.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve found myself hopping between jobs, often because I’ve misjudged red flags in the environments. I used to think most jobs have a red flag or two, but I’ve learned that letting those add up takes a toll on my mental health. I’ve taken roles that didn’t align with my ideal work but did so to ensure I had income. The problem has been the lack of time for interviews and no PTO, with what little PTO I get often being spent on interviews for roles that didn’t work out.

I’ve diversified my resume by taking on roles that demonstrate my technical aptitude, like working in a SAAS company and later in IT, both of which allowed me to learn quickly. While I’ve gained valuable experience, these roles don’t fully represent the skills I want to apply moving forward, and they’ve contributed to a more scattered work history.

Currently, I’ve been out of work for about six months and am actively looking for a new opportunity. I’m considering an offer for a **Business Development Manager** role at a pretty big company. The base salary is between $50k-$60k, with a two-part commission structure that could bring my total compensation to $120k (HR sent me the commission breakdown, with each part capped at $30k). However, the VP I spoke to during the interview seemed surprised by the commission cap and indicated there might be a disconnect with HR, so I’m waiting for further clarification.

The issue is that I *really* dislike sales and commission-based roles. While the position aligns with my overall skill set, it’s not the kind of work I’m passionate about, and being on commission, especially with a cap, feels like a poor fit for me. To add to that, HR recently asked me to complete a **problem-solving test** to demonstrate my skills, which I find frustrating. After multiple interviews where I’ve already explained my problem-solving abilities, I don’t understand why I’m being asked to complete a test at this stage. It feels like something more appropriate for an entry-level position rather than someone with my level of experience.

**So, my questions are:**

1. Given that the role aligns with my skills but not the kind of work I want to do, should I take the offer for financial stability, or continue holding out for something that better aligns with my long-term goals and passions?
2. How should I navigate this situation with the commission structure, especially with the cap? Should I push back on the cap, or accept it as is while continuing my search for something better?
3. Is it common for professionals with my level of experience to be asked to complete tests like this? How can I handle this request gracefully, especially when it feels unnecessary?
4. How can I transition successfully from entrepreneurship into a corporate role where my broad skill set is seen as a strength and asset?

I’ve worked hard to build a diverse skill set, and I’m fully capable of working for someone else. What I value most is working in an environment that fosters mutual respect, growth, and where my contributions are truly appreciated. I don’t have many professional connections where I live (New England), and the area doesn’t particularly cater to creative roles in marketing, which has added another layer of difficulty in my search.

Thanks so much in advance for any advice, thoughts, or insights. I’m excited for this next chapter and want to find a role that challenges me in the right ways, allows me to use my skills, and provides the kind of work environment where I can thrive.

**TL;DR:**  
I’ve been an entrepreneur for 15 years and am transitioning to a corporate career. I’ve been out of work for 6 months and am considering a Business Development Manager role at a large company. The base salary is $50k-$60k with a capped commission structure that could bring my total comp to $120k, but I don’t want to work in a sales-driven role. HR also asked me to complete a problem-solving test, which feels insulting given my experience. Should I take the job for financial stability or continue holding out for something that better aligns with my goals?

1ijakyc,Tired of warehouse job and can't find my way out into a career,"I am M(24) currently working in a warehouse job but it sucks. It's a union job and pay is good with benefits but I don't like too physically demanding tasks and feel like its not up my alley. Trying to pivot into inside sales here but that doesn't seem possible anytime soon.

I have a Diploma in business administration and thats about it. Could never get into any career because of bills and no help from family. 

What kind of career I can get into from here? Something that doesn't require another college degree because I don't have time for that.

Though I do have money saved to pay for good short courses and program that can help me set my foot into a new industry with some growth or advancement opportunities. 


Also very bad adhd and anxiety so long hours+ commute sucks and got no time in life for anything else. 

Please ask as many questions and give some advice or suggestions🥲🥲

Last year he rated me exceeds expectations but I’ve been busy in my personal life and I’ve scaled back some effort to maintain a good work/life balance. I am happy with meets expectations this year. Now that it’s eval time I’m just really stressing since I know I wasn’t tryin to hit Exceeds this year due to a lot of travel to see my daughter in college. 

Also, my mid term evaluation was fine. Just basic stuff keep working towards goals and review my work for little typos and stuff like that. I never miss deadlines and have good attendance. After projects he always thanks me for my hard work.

1ijag4g,Job Application Tracker,"Dear Job Seekers,

I’m just like you, and I know how it feels when it seems like the unemployment phase will never end. Over the past few years, I’ve had one piece of advice that I’ve consistently shared with fellow job seekers: *“Create a job application tracker—it will change your life.”* This is because, if there’s one thing I’ve mastered during this time, it’s managing job applications and keeping a record of them.

Every time I open my tracker, I feel a sense of pride. It allows me to reflect on the small wins, track my overall progress, and, of course, acknowledge the countless rejections. This process has been a game-changer for me, and it’s helped me stay organised and motivated during this challenging period.

If you haven’t already, I highly recommend creating your own job application tracker—or trying mine. I’ve decided to polish my template and share it with others. I’d love to hear your thoughts on it!

Wishing you all the best in your job search. Stay persistent, and remember that every step forward counts.

1ij8npr,Boss keeps asking me to do things beyond my job and I fear retaliation,"Changing the jobs so I don’t dox myself) 

I just started working in at a small “shop” 2.5 months ago. I enjoy it so far but an issue that has come up is that my boss keeps asking me to do things out of my job description. I was hired as a “barista” with the promise that sometime within the next year, I would be able to become a “baker”. 

In all of my hiring and onboarding stuff I was listed as a barista, I agreed to be a barista and to do barista task. No where does it say other task as needed, and I receive barista pay. 

Well recently my boss has accepted a contract that requires us to produce more baked goods and I have been asked to start baking. 

I started baking and asked my boss when I would be able to receive the title of baker and she said that it would not be until September and that there was only a possibility of a pay increase, not a guarantee. 

So right now I am essentially preforming 1.5 jobs for the pay of one. 

I am worried about speaking up because my boss said she was only going to hire me for my job as a barista as part time but decided to make me full time so I could also do baker roles (again this was not spoken about or advertised) 

I fear if I say anything I will be demoted to part time or retaliated against, especially since I’m still in my probation period.
Or 
That if I am permitted to just be a barista, come September I will be let go as our shop will be moving towards more of a bakery and they won’t need as many baristas.
Or 
That they will offer me a baker job, but won’t offer me baker pay because I made a stink. 

I am not opposed to being a baker, I just feel like I deserve baker pay, especially if I am the only person on our team that has the skills to be both a barista and a baker and I am expected to do them at the same time.

I have two AAs (business and communications) and an AS (general sciences) but no BA degree. My current job is a bit hard to describe but I will try and answer any follow up questions if it helps. It is a team building company that runs a ropes course as one of our avenues of instruction. I started as an operator on the ropes course, moved up to become a tech lead (safety advisor) and now I work as a facilitator (main speaking role with the clients). This new role has me working in many settings including traveling across the US to speak at conferences for large companies (groups of 100-200 people) about communication tactics in the workplace, i.e. professional development. 

The issue with this job is the hours are sporadic especially in the winter months when companies are mostly on holiday and don't schedule work events. In order to keep climbing upwards in this company I'm trying to keep my scheduling as open as possible. 

I also work as a caterer for weddings on weekends but it also dies down in the winter. I don't think the owner of this company will continue operating in 2026 though, she is moving to a new career.

Looking for suggestions for other jobs that I might be able to fit into this kind of schedule. Mainly a flexible schedule that pays ""decent"". I'd really like if this new job honed or built a skill in my life so it has a bit more value than just financial but I'm trying to not be picky.

1ij5lpj,Very confused at this point…,"So basically I am currently a Recruiter in a hospital who has been a a recruiter for 7 years roughly. I hate it and I wanted to make a move into Clinical Social Work. I did not do so well in my bachelors program due to alot of factors. My GPA came out to be 2.6 and I didn’t care at the time because I could not see so far into the future honestly. 

Well anyways I got accepted into what seems like a really strong program especially on the clinical side. So I was very excited and all but the cost is 50k with a potential for some scholarships to reduce down to 40k(not guaranteed) and also I’ll be working while doing the program so its doable for me somewhat.

However, now that the trump administration is causing hell and mayhem and fafsa is on the table I don’t even think it could be worth it. So I am thinking of heading into nursing instead because of the over higher pay and due to the fact I was going to do RN after my clinical license(My career goal was to become a PMHNP with extensive therapy experience to get my own practice. The reason I want to do clinical social work is because its gives strong therapeutic skills and PMHNP can prescribe medication so it would give a holistic approach)

Nursing in my area while competitive and high paying the schooling is way cheaper due to the need. I also work for a hospital so Id have a job immediately after graduating and would be able to get out of debt much faster…but I didn’t want to start out with Nursing and I already got accepted into Grad School… I don’t know if I am even making any sense.

1ij55rj,"Being strung along for promotion, want to move on but I’m pregnant","I work for a small-ish business. It’s a remote job and it pays well enough but I’m getting really fed up. I’ve been in customer support at this company for 3 years and have always been clear in my interests of moving up and out of that role. When new projects come up, I’m the first person they ask. I’m a quick learner and for the most part these extra tasks have been easy. In the middle of last year, the owner sold the company to a small private equity firm and things have since gone downhill in general, but nothing that affected me directly. We have a random CEO who has done a good job at pissing off loyal clients by price increases and whatnot, but profits are down so I get it.

At the end of November, my manager told me that my boss was looking for someone to help out in business development and she felt I’d be perfect for the role. She said this would be a growth opportunity. 

I started working one on one with my boss to develop the role (he said him and I were copilots repairing a plane mid-flight), and I took the minimum information and tools they gave me and made a successful plan of action and was getting them good results on where the company could be doing better. All of this while still doing my customer support job. My review was in December and my boss said he was very impressed with my work, it was incredibly valuable to the company, and once they had a budget meeting in the first quarter I’d see a pay increase and a title change. 

A month later, they assigned another customer support person to assist me. They just sort of tossed her into the role and expected me to train her so I did. My boss didn’t like her work ethic and when she was unexpectedly out of work due to a family emergency, he told me she was going to no longer work in business development with me and that I’d be moving into the new role full time. Now this week, they’ve taken another customer support person and they’re expecting me to train her. When I asked if this was going to affect my full time role, my boss said that my manager wasn’t willing to give me up in customer support so I’d be doing both roles 50/50 for the foreseeable future. At this point I can see the writing on the wall that they are not willing to pay me more and not willing to actually develop this role, that I worked to hard to create. 

Through all of this I realized I enjoy and am good at business development. There’s an opening at a job my friend works at and she thinks I should apply. Great. The problem is I just found out I’m pregnant. I feel so trapped. I know there are discrimination laws, but who wants to hire someone who is going to need maternity leave 7 months from now. So my question is, what should I do. Do I stick it out and spend the next few months building experience or has anyone here ever changed jobs while pregnant and it worked out?

1ij4jv2,Not sure which course to study ?,"So I decided this year to study again to try get out of my retail jobs where I earn so little and no guarantee of hrs to study disability support or I could work in a nursing home . 

It’s a entry level certificate and the government funding only allows me to complete one fully funded as I have not been to uni and if I wanted to study another certificate of same level I would pay full fee . 

My current circumstances are I want a job where I can be on my feet and some where I can sit also or not be on my feet for 12 hrs of every day . I thought caring would be the way to go because I’ve done childcare and nannying in the past but I’m honestly scared . 
In my current role I’m getting some lower back pain from just such a physical role and I have pulled it in my past stocking role aswell .
And I also fell down a rock slide at a waterfall last year and have damaged / angled acutely my coccyx . I go to the chiropractor quite regularly but the pain isn’t going away . I’m sitting at school and it just hurts when I get up . 
So my thought was maybe I should be studying an administration course to get into like healthcare admin or government as it’s quite strong career path to choose over disability support . 
Just my concern is would they give me a standing desk . 
Do I complete this certificate or go down the administrative route to protect my back and future injuries , although sitting hurts . ",amstar94,1,1.0,1,1738854198,2025-02-06 15:03:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ij4jv2/not_sure_which_course_to_study/,2,2025
1ij48yf,Potentially Unethical Job Opportunity,"Hi, 

Im about to gradaute as a data science/ai MSc. I found this job in my hometown that pays relatively well, however things are sketcy. They sell supplements, but their reviews are full of people saying they are just scamming old pensioners and being borderline fraudulent, which is quite a common story. Employee reviews are bad too. 

  
I've brought this up and have been told this is just a loud minority and that they have plenty of happy customers that place their orders themselves.

I am currently in the final year of my master’s program in France and will be starting an internship in credit risk from April to October 2025. This internship is a requirement for completing my degree and obtaining my diploma.

I aspire to work in credit risk and was wondering if it would be a good idea to start searching for a permanent position now, even though I haven’t started my internship yet. I often hear that the earlier, the better when it comes to job searching, but since this will be my first professional experience in this field (aside from academic projects and empirical work at university), I’m unsure if this is the best strategy for me.

1ij2m1r,How do I navigate this internal job switch?,"Hi all!

I came across an internal job posting that I am very interested in. It aligns perfectly with my interests and education, but before I go into more detail I want to provide some context as to why this is a difficult situation for me. 

 I am early in my career (24yo) and I work in cybersecurity for a large company (~30,000 employees). It’s a great job, and I have nothing but great things to say about my managers and the whole team. They have treated me well and are all great people. Problem is, the job is so mindless and boring to me. I can’t stand it. I have no interest in it and I dread working my current role day in and day out. I’m not learning any new skills and it is not intellectually stimulating. The new job is within the Business Intelligence department and it is a great fit for me for both my interests and my educational background (Business Analytics undergrad, currently in an MS Data Science program). I’ve known the manager for the new role for about a year now, and I just spoke to him today. He said to apply and he would ensure I get an official interview right away and that I would be a great fit. 

It sounds like a no brainer: same pay, stay remote, same company, and it fits in with my long term goals and interests. Problem is, I just got promoted to a senior in my current role 2 months ago and I just got my bonus today. It is within the same team as I always have been and with the same people. Another problem is at my company, I need manager approval to apply for any internal jobs. What would happen if my current manager says no, would it create a bad environment? What if she says yes, but the new manager doesn’t give me the job? Would I be wrong to jump ship this soon after my manager has promoted me, spent the last couple months training me, and gave me a bonus? I would have to call her tomorrow to discuss my intentions to apply. 

What should I do? It’s a great opportunity to follow my interests and it will certainly make me happier and more motivated. But I also don’t want to ruin my reputation or do something wrong. I also don’t want it to create a bad situation if I have to stay in the current role. 

Any and all advice would be much appreciated!

1ij1vgh,Job hopping to keep my mental health and wanting to leave engineering altogether,"Hi everyone,

I went back to school at 27 and completed an engineering degree. I've been working in civil engineering ever since and I've had 3 jobs during those 2 years.

I'm struggling at my new job mainly because I've becomed the target of sabotage from a senior coworker. I don't navigate office politics well, even though now, I try to. I wouldn't call the place toxic as I've been in really toxic work environment in the 2 previous jobs and I know what it's like, but still, working hard only to be shat on because of coworkers who acts as filters between me and my bosses is taking a toll on my mental health, which, ironically, makes me much less productive, and thus more stressed out and eventually, overworked.

Basically, I'm in a downward spiral for that reason. I want to job hop to try an see if the grass is greener on the other side, but my experience also makes me want to leave engineering as I'm starting to wonder if being miserable is part of the industry, or even office life in general. I can't just quit as I have a family that relies on me but still.

To those who will just answer ""well you're the problem"", it doesn't help in any way. If I am, what do you propose I do?

To all the others, what are your thoughts about job hopping, office life and mental health? Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?",PapaObserver,1,1.0,2,1738846548,2025-02-06 12:55:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ij1vgh/job_hopping_to_keep_my_mental_health_and_wanting/,2,2025
1ij1peh,Advice for a hopeless Politics and International Relations graduate.,"25m graduated in 2021 with a second class degree in Politics and IR. Due to the covid lockdowns i had to complete my final year of university from home and did not get the chance to attend networking events as well as the usual follow-on graduate opportunities. I found myself bouncing around a couple dead-end entry level jobs with most recently working as a Property Consultant with two years experience. 

I'm severely underpaid in my current role i essentially do a full estate agents job for around £25,000 per year to work 6 days a week. I'm fed up and at my wits end with how little opportunities there are for people like me. I've had four or five unsuccessful applications with the civil service for positions which don't even require a degree-level education. One was for a admin officer where they were hiring 250 up and down the country. Didn't even get a interview. One i applied for was a for a trainee valuation surveyor, being an estate agent i thought i had the perfect duality of experience and education... Nope, application got put on hold and then declined. Bear in mind the a lot of the jobs i have applied for do not require a degree and yet i can't even get a interview! I've applied for over ten positions at the local council all of which require experience which is IMPOSSIBLE to get unless you have worked at a council. I've even emailed for feedback and asked where am i supposed to get this experience from to no response.

I tried to tell myself to not get disheartened stay vigilant and keep applying but 6 months down the line I'm twenty applications deep and not even an interview, I'm really fed up and it's impacting my mental health now, i honestly feel like giving up. These civil service applications are hard work and I've spent whole days perfecting my applications. 

I'm a hard worker I tried very hard in school why can't anyone give me a chance? I understand professional experience is paramount but where are the trainee schemes? Where are the graduate opportunities? I'm willing to re-locate, move countries and even go back to university if need be but i just need a career path to aim for. I don't even know where to look what recruitment agencies can be trusted or what.

If anyone has any ideas on some career paths i could go down i would be highly appreciative. I'm lost in life at the minute i need a career to pursue.

1ij0bgm,"how to evaluate if a company is a good ""growth match"" for you","Hi! Shared this on a 1-1 strategy call earlier and think it might be helpful for peeps here too!  
The question:

**""How can I evaluate if a company matches my own growth trajectory?**

**I've got stuck doing roles because I'm great at them, or because I have this unique set of skills nobody else in the company has, but I feel stifled and like I've hit a ceiling""**

My answer:

There's 3 ways you can test if a company will match your growth trajectory:

**the founding team**   
\- does their vision make you lean forward in your chair?   
\- how clear is their roadmap to get there?   
\- what track record do they have of helping others grow their careers?

**the product**   
**- how technically challenging is this to you?**   
**- how excited are you to work on this everyday for the next 3yrs?**   
**- what impact do you see this having on the world?**

the role   
\- will you spend 70%+ time using your best skills?   
\- how fluid / flexible can this role be?   
\- how much buy-in from leadership is there to support shaping a role for you?

Anddd a bonus insight from the Generalist World community..

If you're not hitting 3/3, yes, you could leave..

OR

You could pitch to your manager to create a new role for you internally

I've literally lost count of how many GW members have had this happen for them! Role creation IS A THING!! You sometimes just need to pitch it and this becomes a massive win-win (eg: much more cost efficient to create a role for a talented employee than hire / train one from scratch!)

1ij08m2,Underpaid and Frustrated – Should I Stay or Start Looking Elsewhere?,"Last year, I rejoined a company I had worked for before. During negotiations, HR lowballed me (below market rate and less than my previous salary with them), even though the hiring manager (HM) knew my expected salary. Desperate to get back to work, I negotiated a slightly higher offer but still feel like I did myself a disservice by accepting it.  

After I joined, my HM admitted they were surprised I took the offer because they had fought for a better package for me but failed.  

Fast forward 9 months: the company rushed to hire another employee (""Eric"") at the same grade as me to fill a government contract headcount. On paper, Eric looks good, but in terms of experience and performance, my HM has privately admitted multiple times that I’m stronger. I suspect Eric is being paid more than me due to the urgency of filling the role, which I initially didn’t mind because my HM kept assuring me they’d push for a compensation adjustment for me when the time came.  

Well, the time finally came, and I was only approved for a 10% raise—half of the 20% I had communicated as my expectation. My HM seemed nervous delivering the news and even overshared that, even with the raise, I’m still the lowest-paid person at my grade. They said they’d try again next quarter but made no promises and acknowledged that I might start looking elsewhere.  

I enjoy working under my HM and like the work I do, but the pay gap with Eric is disheartening, especially since I’m contributing more. I feel undervalued and stuck.

1iiypgo,How to write a cover letter for an Executive Officer / Executive Assistant Position at a university?,"I'm an architecture masters graduate, but since I graduated mid last year I havent been able to land a job in my field yet. I know I should reevaluate myself - and I will - but I've worked for 3.5 years prior to returning to my masters and havent had any issues with the employment process. So I'm not too upset about the whole situation.

I've wanted to try a different field or a career change for a while now and I'm wondering if this is a good oppourtunity to try apply to different jobs. I came across a few Executive Officer / Executive Assistant Positions at a tertiary institution and I'm interested in trying it out. Seems like a lot of the work revolves around project management and administration. I just have no idea how to write a cover letter for it.

In the architecture / interior design field, I've always written about my passion for holistic spatial experiences , my knowledge in technical and software skills in the cover letter, but now I'm not sure what to write about. I cant exactly write about my passion for administration. I mean I've always wanted to develop myself further as a project manager and manage projects, but I'm sure it'll work in this case.   
  
My reason for applying to this position would be to try out a different field, build up new skills and experiences.

1iiyguf,What’s Your Unfair Advantage?,"Naval Ravikant calls it **Specific Knowledge.**

And no, it’s not something you can learn in school.

It’s that unique blend of skills, interests, and experiences that make YOU irreplaceable. Think about it:

* 🏆 It’s what you’re naturally great at.
* ❓ It’s what you’ve mastered through curiosity, not obligation.
* 🌌 It’s something so niche that it’s *almost impossible to automate or outsource.*

Let’s break this down.

# 🎯 What is Specific Knowledge?

It’s the thing people come to you for.

* 🎨 The designer who creates *UI that feels like magic.*
* 🎈 The marketer who knows *exactly how to make a campaign go viral.*
* 👨‍💻 The engineer who can *untangle a spaghetti codebase without breaking a sweat.*

It’s not something you can copy-paste.

It’s a product of your *DNA + experience + obsession.*

A good way to think about it is by trying to remember what things you were attracted to when you were a child.

Your specific knowledge sits at the intersection of those things.

In my case:

* 🎮 I liked playing computer games.
* 👷‍♂️ I liked building with LEGO.
* ✍ I liked writing.

So, it feels natural that what I do right now that sets me apart from most of my peers involves:

* 💻 Working as a software engineer.
* 🏫 Building products and services.
* 📝 Writing about my experiences.

And the natural intersection of all that is this newsletter, where I:

* 🧠 Write about having a balanced career in tech.
* 📚 Create resources, challenges, and services for you.
* 💡 Build a community of smarter engineers (pun intended).

See how it goes?

It should feel natural to find your specific knowledge.

# ❓ Why Does It Matter?

Because *generalists compete while specialists thrive.*

If you’re trying to be “good” at everything, you’ll always be replaceable.

But specific knowledge? That’s where you play a game no one else can win.

# 🔍 How to Find Yours:

**What do people ask you for advice about?**

Pay attention to those “Can I pick your brain?” moments.

That’s your clue.

**What feels effortless to you but challenging to others?**

If you’re solving problems for fun while others are pulling their hair out, you’ve found your edge.

**What did you love doing as a kid?**

Sometimes, the roots of your specific knowledge are planted early.

# 👉 Example:

Let’s say you’re a software engineer who’s obsessed with *optimizing workflows.*

While others focus on building new features, you’re creating tools that save teams *hours* of manual work.

Now, you’ve turned that obsession into:

* 📝 A blog where you share automation tips.
* ✨ Consulting for companies with inefficiencies.
* 💰 A niche skillset that companies are *willing to pay a premium for.*

# 🌿 Here’s the Truth:

The world rewards people who lean into their *specific knowledge*.

Not those who try to be average at everything.

So, ask yourself:

* What’s your **unfair advantage**?
* How can you **double down** on it?

Let me know in the comments—I’d love to hear what makes you *unstoppable.* 🚀",albeXL,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1738833069,2025-02-06 09:11:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iiyguf/whats_your_unfair_advantage/,2,2025
1iixuxh,nervous about switching jobs,"i started a role last june after battling nine months of employment. my pay is way below market average, but the hours are decent and work life balance is solid. 

my workload has 4x-ed since joining, my boss basically wants me to do all of his work. i also have a colleague who keeps going on leave without handing anything over and i have to picked up his workload.

i’ve basically dug a hole by becoming too important at work. i spoke to the head of my department recently who basically said no salary raise or title raise until 2 years on the job which is bizarre to me because i’ve seen colleagues in other teams get promoted twice in a year. 

i’ve only been on this job for nine months but recently invited to interview for a job with the same work hours, better title and a 40% pay raise. the commute would be shorter than my current commute and there’s zero office politics because the team is super small. i’d be the second hire in the team they’re now creating for the work i do. 

is it too soon to leave after nine months of joining? i want to complete at least one year in my current company and then leave, can i/should i ask for a later start date?",thisismeihere,1,1.0,4,1738830286,2025-02-06 08:24:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iixuxh/nervous_about_switching_jobs/,2,2025

1iixjyg,No clue what’s my position,"No clue if I am a project Manager

I’ll try to keep it short. My wife works for a startup company as their Community Manager. I’ve tagged along to a few events, and during small talk with the founders I’ve given them advice that according to them it has been very valuable. My background is I have been an Operations Manager for Call Centers for the last 7 years so I know a thing or two about leadership and managing projects. 

Last week I was approached by one of the founders and pretty much offered me a job on the spot to basically be their liaising guy for the whole company. Basically create the foundations for all departments for the company (HR, sales, distribution, marketing, logistics, IT, etc) as in SOP, appoint people as needed, create manuals, etc basically structure the whole company. They have 0 departments right now, and have a bunch of people assigned to tasks, but obviously the communication is non existent between these people.

Keep in mind they use WhatsApp as their main channel of communication and use pen and paper for routinely stuff. 

On my first week, I have implemented Slack as the official channel of comms, and will tackle the rest accordingly. They absolutely loved Slack, and are a bit eager of what comes next. For now, I’m thinking a website and institutional emails as their a company with 50+ employees.

With that being said, am I a project manager? Or what title seems fit?

And pleaseeeee if you have any suggestions for tools (like Trello), or best practices on what should my roadmap look like I’ll be forever in debt as I am tad overwhelmed at the moment.

Now I am quite stuck on what I want to do. as this sort of position is something i’ve always been interested in.

1iivhrr,How do I accept the fact that half of my coworkers are lousy and untalented?,"I know it sounds pretentious and immature, but it’s my genuine situation. I’ve been at this workplace for 3 years with the same small team. Half of them are competent, impressive, reliable, talented, knowledgeable, etc. and the other half are just absolutely milking the fuck out of the rest of us. It drives me NUTS because I’m at the bottom of the totem pole. I voice my concerns and lack of support every single week to my 1up and 2up and absolutely nothing changes. 

We missed our goals last year by a wide margin. We’re going to miss our goals again this year. The workplace is very old school and comfy and they only fire one person every few years when they have to. So these people just make my life a stressful living hell. 

I’ve tried to just not give a shit but I can’t justify my workday without getting something accomplished. 

Idk. Maybe I need some therapy. I’m stuck here until I finish my masters that they’re paying for. I just can’t stand being held back by others procrastination and a delusional boss forcing me to work with these people.

What do I do? Just learn to care less? Go full narc and schedule a meeting with the delusional boss? My 1up and 2up haven’t changed a thing in 3 years. I’ve grown tired of complaining. Now I’m just jaded and apathetic and that’s not good for the soul.

My husband operates a CNC machine for a kitchen company and has worked there for 10 years. I told him while he’s there he may as well be getting qualified in cabinet making.

Long story short, the business sucks, horrible culture and the job sucks. 

I feel helpless because I don’t know which direction to guide him and he doesn’t know what he wants to do either.

I’m thinking a fairly easy trade would suite him best. Without trying to be disrespectful I think he could be dyslexic (undiagnosed) as he gets his left and rights mixed, words wrong and things can just take him a little more time, but I know he’s not unintelligent.

1iiuxxz,When to ask,"I applied for a job in December, I had a phone interview last week (last week of Jan) and they said they had 200 applicants and wanted to take the time to make sure they picked out the best candidates to move forward with. 30 people were invited to the phone interview and they cut that number in half to be invited to the in person 3-person panel interview in a couple of days. 

Well I was invited to the in person interview and I'm not sure how many rounds there is or if this will be the last interview they do before offering the job to someone. 
That was a long way to ask - when do I know when to mention upcoming vacations? I have actual questions prepped for the upcoming interview, but should I bring it up when they ask if I have questions, at this next interview? Do I wait to see if I get a call back for the third interview (if they do a 3rd)? Do I wait until I have an offer letter? It's not full weeks, it's a Thursday/Friday off in March and  a Thursday/Friday off in July.

I pursued a construction management career path after school, have a solid job with a good contractor, and have done good for myself.

1iiuf5l,"Six day work week job, should I stay?","A fresh IT grad last year, I started my first job as an encoder last November. I was just referred by a friend who also got in to the company but in a different department. So that I could start working as I was finding jobs as well, I went with it as the job position is an encoder. Going on almost in my third month at work, I just need opinions and advice in whether should I stay longer or not. I don't remember much but I think before starting the job, I didn't sign a contract but only my profile and personal details. 

Working in a six day work week drains me so much, then the workload is heavy as well. I am residing in an apartment because it is far to commute and my schedule is midshift. That's why it's a big advantage to work in this company when your home is near the workplace. This is what I don't like on my job, no balance in personal and work life. One day is not enough for me to go home or even rest. All other responsibilities fall only in that one day off work. 

The pay is okay enough and the overtime is paid, the benefits are also there because there's a payslip including the deductions per salary. But as I said, it burns me out so much. Even now, my body is not okay right now. I can't find time to self care. Is it just me that is a bit thinking on too much? Am I entitled for just wanting a work for 5 days a week?

1iiu4an,Should I leave my job for a 3 month position at a company I’ve always wanted to work for?,"Should I leave my stable job for a 3 month opportunity at a company I’ve always wanted to work for?

I work in a creative field where big opportunities and stable work is hard to come by. The company I’m currently with is a very small business but has always been stable, never laid anyone off and isn’t financially struggling(at least that I know of). I left my current job a little over a year ago after getting an opportunity to work remotely for a company in New York, it felt like a huge break in my career with a big pay upgrade as well. Well a couple days after my year anniversary there they did a huge layoff and unfortunately I was one. My former employer was very kind and I ended things on great terms with them and they ended up asking if I’d consider returning to work with them. I deeply appreciated this because the job market has been dismal for my field. I’ve been back for around 8 months now and while I love my coworkers I’m remembering why I left in the first place. I have no creative freedom and have virtually no autonomy over my schedule or what I’ll be doing each day, which can be frustrating. I’m constantly bouncing around and being pulled in different directions by a pretty unprofessional manager. I do CAD and unfortunately they don’t have a need for a full time CAD person so I end up having half of my job be other duties I’m not very passionate or challenged by. Right now I’d say I’m 30% of the time doing what I enjoy and want and then 70% of the time pretty miserable and frustrated with my tasks. I’ve been loosely looking for new work all the while feeling guilty because they were kind enough to welcome me back. I found a temporary position for a company that I’ve always wanted to work for, I’d be doing a job skill wise above anything I’ve previously done and have been trying to break into this new type of role with little success for a while now. I’m on round two of interviews and it’s looking optimistic, the only catch obviously is that it’s temporary. My current pay is $27 an hour and the new role would be $37 which would allow me to save a considerable amount since my cost of living is pretty low. 

I’m really torn because my field has very little opportunity and I’m worried after the 3 months I’ll struggle to find work, I believe I would have the option of unemployment to help out in the meantime while I look for work but I’d have to do some more research and confirm that.

The mtg is with the VP, the hiring manager and the sr HR manager. 

The range for the job was posted transparently as $130-200k with the ideal range being $160-165. The benefits are INCREDIBLE. However, I want to push for an annual salary of $180-185x.

1iisgek,"My dad is dying, and I don't know what I'll do for money","So to give some background, I never got my high-school diploma or went to college. I was suffering from both undiagnosed ADHD/Autism and generally a pretty horrible life situation in my later teen years, and as a result never got it. I'm 27 now, I've spent the last almost decade taking care of my disabled dad and grandmother (cooking, cleaning, helping around the house in general) because they both needed someone. They paid the bills, and I helped with pretty much everything else. We're in a small town in Florida.

Unfortunately after a few years of dealing with cancer, my dad likely doesn't have much time left. Besides being hard to deal with in general, I'm also terrified about what I'm going to do for money. I don't have too many expenses, my grandmother owns the house (though she's also old) and I pay through social security benefits (I get about $900 a month) to help with food and take care of our five cats. I've spent the last few years taking online courses and learning whatever skills I can, I'd love to do something with programming but that's too far off of a goal (since I can't go to college right now and I'd need to get a job in it). I'm in the process of doing Onsego to get my GED as well, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to get it. It's a lot easier for me now that I'm diagnosed and medicated.

But I'm terrified on what I'll do for money one my dad passes, and further in the future when my grandmother passes. I wanted to try Janitor work, but I have a weak stomach and I'm afraid of having to clean blood or vomit. I also thought being a pharmacy tech sound nice, I know some of the people at the local pharmacies since I've gone to them so often. I'd really like to avoid customer service if possible, I don't know how I'd be able to handle people yelling at me all day, I know people who worked in that field and some of the people around here are complete assholes.

I don't know what to do. I've got the short term goal of getting my GED and I'm also still doing programming courses (even if I don't get a coding job for a while it's fun). I'd like to have something where I can take time off on weekend mornings for my world of warcraft guild (it's like 90% of my social interaction, I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't go to that). Could anyone give me some advice on jobs to look into?

1iirtqy,how to tell employer that i am quitting due to mental health reasons?,"tl;dr great employer and i'd be open to return but i need at least several months off to figure shit out. how do i bring this up to my employer and explain why i'm away?

  
background:

* my job is pretty comfortable, corporate but good culture, great team, great managers. i don't need to work very hard tbh, i make a good salary. in terms of working conditions literally all good.
* hate my job in last couple of months, feel really drained, keep taking sick days off work because i don't want to. i do the bare minimum to get by, sleep a lot during work hours (im wfh). 
* also clinically depressed + a bunch of other shit. accidentally revealed this to my manager several months ago, not sure if that was a big slip up on my part. 

  
current situation:

* decided to quit my job soon to take care of myself. annual bonus statement is being released in a few weeks and i hit all my targets last year so i want to wait to have that deposited in my account before i say anything, but honestly i'm struggling already to hold on until then
* have a lot of big major life events coming up very soon, including my wedding + honeymoon. i don't know if it is bad visual if i'm like ""hey guys i'm quitting cuz im depressed"" but then turn around literally next week into my wedding?
* also have a project at work that i'm behind on, it's not urgent or mandatory i just don't think i can take on additional workload right now
* i'm the only person trained in my specific role, although i have made it clear and already have a training plan to get someone else to fill my shoes asap (under the guise that i need someone to be covering me when i'm busy on honeymoon)
* historically i have a good reputation with my managers in terms of being a reliable worker, i want to keep the opportunity open if i decide to work at this company again, although i dont expect them to keep my role open.
* how do i bring this up to my manager and explain why i'm quitting? it would also be hella fucking awkward if my managers decide to throw a ""going away"" party idk for my departure, given that this treatment has been given to other ex-coworkers who left the company due to reasons that are less shameful (e.g. got a position at another company, moving to another country, etc.)

1iiqszw,Average pto hours for more senior level positions in healthcare,"I’m a practice administrator for a dermatology practice and was lowkey lied to about the pto package and was unfortunately naive when signing the agreement because I needed to leave my other job. 

My dermatology practice in So Cal has 13 total employees. Five full time, 3 reduced time, and 3 part time. Full time employees get 1 floating holiday, 7 paid holidays, 5 days pto, and 5 days sick time a year. Is this normal for medical assistants, front desk administrators, referral coordinators? I have the same structure in addition to the providers. 

I would love some insight because the business owner is refusing to add more pto days to anyone. I’ve grown the practice and a ton more in the short time I’ve been there so I’m starting to get bunt out. I’m already getting anxious about taking any time off so I can go on a descent vacation

I'm a Canadian and I work for a small business in wholesale. My role is in office procurement(global suppliers), customer service management, and warehouse management(I know its a lot of responsibility, it's crazy). We only use Spire as our software, and let's just say I'm proficient in MS Office Apps. My pay is $26/hr(is this too low?).  It will be my 2nd year in this position this June 2025.

I finished a 1-year Payroll Accounting Program and I am an IT undergraduate(3 years finished).

To be honest, it's a small business so it's almost always freestyling so I'm not even sure if even at this point, I'm doing my job proficiently, using correct tools, etc. I did not have a great mentor at work.

I'm still in my current job, but my goal is to leave this year. It would be great if I can find a WFH/Hybrid job. I'm choosing between these 3: logistics, procurement, accounting. I feel like I still have a bit of time so I want to get certified in the path that I'll be choosing to really prepare myself.

For WFH and pay advantage, what can you recommend between those 3?

Any certifications/additional skills/software that you can recommend?

I will be grateful for other advice as well

1iipesd,I have a disciplinary meeting next week for lateness. Advice?,"Hi everyone, 

I won’t get into too much detail as it’s really quite a long story and there’s lots going on with management that I very strongly disagree with however I’m just asking for some advice. I work in quite a well known hotel as a C&E supervisor and  recently it has been taken over by a new company. It’s very obvious that they’re trying to get rid of staff to cut down on payroll and amongst all of this I feel as though I have been targeted especially by one of the main boss’. I am not claiming that I am a victim here and I don’t want to accuse the man of bullying, however it’s not just me that’s noticed he has been extremely rude and very unprofessional towards me recently. He is quite the hypocrite and does almost everything he tells us all not to do, but hey he’s the manager right? I received this evening an email saying I have a disciplinary investigation meeting next Monday due to my lateness in which will also be attended by this manager I shall name bill. Now, I will admit I have been late quite often especially if you look over the last year or so. I however was told when I got promoted that the majority of shifts that are just setup are relaxed. I have no evidence but my manager at the time told me I can turn up whenever as long as I get the work done. Now of recent I understand this does not apply as this manager is no longer here, however if you’re looking at all the times I was late throughout the whole year, this would account for at least 75% of these shifts. I have already been given a written warning and apparently a verbal warning (my assistant manager claims she told me but she’s actually scared of confrontation so didn’t at all) and I’m just wondering what to expect next? Is there usually a final warning after this or is this usually the end of the line and the dissmissal? I really don’t want this on my files or record so I’m contemplating resigning, however I don’t want to be without a job if it’s not likely that they’re going to fire me. Just wondering if anyone has been in this situation before and what happened to them?

1iio8h0,31 YO Male in Biotech,"I've had the fortunate opportunity to fall into a niche area of the biotech industry, specialized immuno-oncoloogy therapy, all kinds. I started as an operator, paid my dues for a few years manufacturing on the floor and was promoted to a trainer role by my mid 20's. I did it for a few years putting in more time, paying dues, (long hours in the cleanroom, 8 hours straight no water, no bathroom breaks) and was able to break into low level management with a supervisor role offered by my former boss who hired me as a trainer during my first promotion. I was there for about 2 years, promoted to a manager halfway through at the year mark, where I began to learn the people aspects of management, along with the administrative side of the responsibilities. I was headhunted to run the training program at a competitor CDMO out of state and was relocated, given a hefty raise, and took on a ton of responsibility overnight. While I made ends meet, I learned a lot on the fly and found myself stressed frequently. After I completed a year I kindly resigned and took a Sr. Manager position at a startup back in my home state. They met me at my existing salary, great sign on and a nice annual bonus w/ stock options. I lasted 20 months there before the writing on the wall began to show and I started looking for an out. As we ran out of money I found myself offered a job back at the company I was originally hired as a trainer at, all new management now, same pay, but just a Manager title. I don't care about the title, more so the pay and SOW. I have an easy day, I manage a team of 20 who all can be trusted for the most part. I work home 2 days a week. 45 min commute. Friendly atmosphere. But no stock in the company, and an AD was just hired over me so my upward mobility seems limited for the immediate future as she's a former mentor, also on the younger side, and truly an excellent employee. She deserves it. 

  
That said, I too just completed a round of interviews at a competing CDMO equidistant from my home location that offered 35k more in base salary, 5% more in annual performance bonus, and 10,500 units available for purchase via options granted to me at an unknown value as of now. All together, I'd be making roughly 23% more annually in this new role. The new role is the Head of Development reporting directly into the VP of Operations. Next in line is the CEO. I have no direct reports, I 'm in charge of building the team from the ground up based on what i determine is needed. I find that both liberating and a bit scary. I've interviewed 50-100 people but never did I have sole input on whether or not they joined my team.  My scope of training responsibility (not execution but oversight) includes everything from New Employee Orientation,  new hire pre-requisite training, systems training, aseptic qualifications, gown quals, and process training. annual gap assessments for training efficacy / knowledge transfer rates and Training Impact Assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of our materials. 

All of this I've done, can do, and am good at. I love the reporting structure as I'll be treated closer to the level I'll be placed at, meaning theres a certain trust I'll be able to execute what's needed of me. Periodic updates are expected but no over shoulder type, breathing down my neck surveillance is happening here.  

The kicker, they want me to start 2 weeks before I'd receive my bonus from my current employer. To be fair it's prorated because I spent part of the year out on disability but after taxes I'm walking away from at least 22.5k. They cannot push back the start date, I've already ran that by the headhunter. They added the stock options and increased the bonus by 5% to help mitigate this loss so in their eyes were square.  I'm in no need of urgent cash right now but I feel like this can be the next step in breaking through in my career if I perform up to expectations as my line of sight to the CEO has one person in the middle. 

  
Last things, this would be the second time I'm leaving my current company. I know I can wash any chance of ever working there down the drain again but frankly it's starting to feel like a rescue raft that has a few holes poked in it and were starting to notice the water seeping through. When I first came back from disability both my manager, VP of Ops, and my second in line guy- Head of MFG Ops resigned. I came back toe ntirely new leadership who've previously demonstrated incredibly unprofessional behavior 6-7 years earlier when iI was just a trainer there. I don't want to subconsciously drive this decision based on underlying potential observations but last thing, I'm currently at a fortune 500 w/ a market cap of 216 billion. I'd be moving to a private, clinical phase CDMO with around 100 million in funding from a recent series A funding round. 

  
Any weight-in, thoughts, experiences, tips are greatly appreciated. ",whereeissmyymindd,0,0.5,0,1738798086,2025-02-05 23:28:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iio8h0/31_yo_male_in_biotech/,2,2025

The other internship is a cyber security internship and the pay is not too bad but less than the sales internship. I will get to do security engineering work. I have a good background for cyber security however I also have an interest in sales engineering.
Ultimately I want money.
I have a feeling the cyber security one might bring me more money in the long run but the it sales could bring money in the short term.

1iind2d,is commuting 2 hours AND a low wage worth it to get my foot in the door?,"yes i know the title might have an obvious answer but please hear me out! 

i am post grad a year 1/2 and have found it extremely difficult to get even an interview for a positions (specifically in fashion/beauty marketing). today i had a first round interview for a position at a very big name company that would be a great way to get my foot through the door. however, when we got to the logistics of the role, i found out my starting pay would be $22/hr and working onsite 5 days a week in beverly hills. 

if i do get the job and accept the offer, i would be moving in with my bf who lives in southern california but it would still roughly be a 2 hour commute each way. the alternative would be renting a room closer to work on $22/hour in areas where rent is averaging out at $1.6k a month. the other alternative is to not take the job and stay at my easy part-time barista job in my hometown where im making $20.66, hoping that some other opportunity will come. 

are all of those cons worth it to get my foot in the industry i love and eventually (hopefully) move up? should i rather keep apply to other positions and hope i land something that will fit my career goals? what if that never happens?

Oh god i am failure and waste of human flesh. i wish someone could be born me instead of me. they all go to top schools to pursue these careers deemed as ""successful"" by society; business, doctor, lawyer, teacher, engineer, finance, data scientist, computer science, etc. i wish i was smart and can do that stuff unfortunately i am not, i didn't choose to be this way and there's nothing i can do about it. my relatives are also smart like why am i like this?! this is why i feel like a anomaly and i don't fit in with people no matter how hard i try. i don't understand why people look on other who work entry jobs like fast foods, retail, garbage man at the end of the it's just a job you get paid and we need those people in society to function. i don't even know why i am posting this on reddit. my mother is not very happy with me with my situation, it's 100% understandable. i am trying to do Youtube videos, it's just not going anywhere right now. i wish i never existed. i despise money so much; it's used to control every aspects of our lives and to oppress people, everything is about money like my goals has to be tied to money.

1iilv5i,Should I lie about my gap?,"Got fired in august due to lay-offs. I'm a data analyst with 3 years of experience.  
Got 3 month worth of severance package paid out at once.  
I lived with my parents and made above average net at my company (because of the company's pay structure)

So I was like I'm just gonna chill, no need to rush into a new job, as I have no financial burden and got the nice severance

Also here's the thing, I'm a retard.  
Because I thought that I'd get unemployment on top of that as well, but unemployment only started after that 3 month ran out as I already had got 3 months worth of severance package.  
I only knew this about 1.5 months in, otherwise would have started sooner.

I was also busy with personal projects and upskilling, and now looking back I only realized the big gap in my resumé that was happening as months flew by, and looking back I would have probably got a job sooner if I could do things over. I'm not lazy, and if it was up to me would have started a new job in a week, but didn't find anything good and good paying.

So on my resume, linkedin and when they ask, should I just spin it as worked till november at company X, instead of tilll august? August sounds so far away because it's summer

And the firing letter says contract is terminated end of august, but officially I was only unemployed until november I think because that's when my unemplyment started

1iilrex,Panicking - Missed Meetings & Miscommunication Fallout - Need Advice!,"Okay, Reddit, I'm in a really tough spot and need some serious advice. Last week I got a verbal warning about communication issues, specifically missing meetings without notice.  My manager and I came up with a plan, and I thought I was on the right track.

Fast forward to today. I completely spaced on an hour-long meeting.  Then, I was late to the next meeting by 15 minutes.  Big mistake.  My manager reached out, and I scrambled to join.  

Here's where I REALLY messed up:
He asked me about the missed meetings. In a moment of panic, I told him I had attended the first meeting (a complete lie) and was only late to the second because I was wrapping up work from the first.  I thought I was mitigating the damage.

Turns out, he checked with the attendees of both meetings.  

My story doesn't align at all with what they said. He's asked me for an explanation tomorrow.

I'm freaking out. I know I screwed up.  I'm terrified of getting a written warning (or worse).  I absolutely cannot tell him I lied.  Any advice on how to handle this?  Is there any way to salvage this without admitting to the lie directly?  I'm grasping at straws here.  Help!

When do I quit my job?

I am in my 20s and this is my first 9-5 job. I have been working at this company for nearly 2 years. I can’t say I enjoy my job very much. The work environment is quite toxic impaticular my manager. He lacks respect for us and blatantly offends us such as calling our ideas stupid, telling the women if we don’t have children than we are  never going live fulfilled lives since that is our only purpose on this earth, etc. this company is predominately men and the women who do work here are treated very differently. 

I booked a one way ticket for May because I am going to start travelling for the following months. And originally planned to give him 1 month notice has my position is quite difficult to hire for (it took the company 6 months before they found me). There are 3 of us with this position and a couple days ago I found out one of us resigned and their end date is exactly 1 month before I leave. Immediately my manager said that I will need to take over the persons duties once they are gone and I will spend the next couple months learning his job. 

I now am unsure what the correct thing to do is as I am scared that he will be rude, resentful, or even fire me if I tell him that I am leaving in 3 months. But if I don’t say anything until 1 month before the company will really struggle. I just don’t want to have a bad reference regardless. What do you think I should do?

Background: Low level accounting roles and then promoted to systems analyst. I have held that role for the last 5 years.

Outlook: Not great, company restructured so my supervisor’s job will be eliminated after he retires next month. Leaving no more promotion opportunities.

I do like my current job, however, I’m ready for either a management job or a new position with higher pay elsewhere. It’s hard to find a position that’s accounting with a little information technology, that I qualify for. The closest thing I believe would be a business analytics professional.

Trying to find different jobs or fields that could be a great fit.

1iihy30,I regret leaving my job - help,"I landed in finance by accident (specifically, wealth management) right out of college as an English major and it was the best accident that's ever happened for my career. At the time of joining, I was living in NY and the firm was boutique. The firm was made up of very hard workers from the top down. The people at the top were CPAs, CFAs and CFPs, which was admirable. I remember working some nights till 9pm (to be clear, this was not required whatsoever and was BY CHOICE because of how hungry I was) but not feeling burned out... just excited to learn everything about wealth management and financial planning. The owner started giving me clients to manage very early on as a test to see how I would handle it and I took that responsibility very seriously and exceeded his expectations. So he gave me more responsibility and in the span of two years, my salary jumped from my starting base of 55k to 85k. By year 3, the firm was growing specifically for ultra high net worth clients, most of which, were being assigned to me as manager.  The owner then decided to move to FL and picked me to move down with him, open an office, build a team, etc. He was going to promote me as a result and bump my salary to 110k and cover all my moving costs. I'm originally from FL and all my family is there so it was an easy transition and I moved back home. I was encouraged to get my CFP and I did just that but as time went on, I started getting burned out. Every big complicated client was going to me while at the same time I was being asked to bring in business so studying for my CFP while juggling the balance made me start to resent my boss slowly overtime. I also hated the commute. In the mornings it would take me 45min to an hour to get to the office from where I live. One could argue I could move closer to the office, but I prefer being close to family and the area where the office is situated is starkingly higher in rent prices so I wouldn't be able to save much living close to the office. 

  
Despite this, by the end of the first year of living in FL, he bumped me up once again to 130k. So in the span of 4 years, my salary grew nearly 136% from where I started. By year 5, I was really started to get fed up as I felt at max capacity with my client load, constantly stressed, and felt like I had 0 work life balance. The boss and others always said,""we are the best at what we do,"" and I kinda rolled my eyes at the time thinking every firm of course is going to say that. But we really did go above and beyond for clients. It was like personal concierge meets complex financial planning. When I expressed to my boss that my work load was getting tough along with the commute, he didn't really do anything about it initially. Just ""work harder"" kinda speech and that me being in the office was a priority. He eventually hired 2 people to help me with admin work which helped but I still grew a little bit of resentment. Then the owner sold the company to a larger firm and painted it at first to be a good thing for me but I realized on paper the only way I could grow my salary overtime is by bringing in new business. I didn't really feel I could be an incredible servicer and retain the book of business I had, while also being tasked to essentially double my book in order to double my salary. At that point in time I just felt so fed up that I started looking for opportunities elsewhere. Within a few weeks, I was offered a position at a boutique firm 5 minutes away from me with a 160k starting salary and 40k target bonus. No business development was required in this role and it seemed like a no brainer at the time because of how emotional I was so I ended up putting my notice. One of my managers fought for me but my boss (the owner who I moved down to FL with) straight ignored me my last month. He would walk into the office, say hello to everyone but me. It affirmed my decision and felt like the right move at the time. I think he ignored me in retrospect because he was really upset and shocked and didn't even know what to say. I was his shining start and the person he would brag about in prospect meetings. I remember he used to say in prospect meetings,""Out of the 12 relationship managers, I'm giving you the best one who I hand-picked to come to FL with me because of how great and hardworking she is.""  


He eventually texted me in my final days while he was away saying,""congrats on your career move, I'm very happy for you. I am not upset at all, as long as you feel it's a good career move for you and you work with the team on transition, it's all good."" 

  
Now fast forward a year later at my new job, and I feel like I made a total mistake. While I'm getting paid more, have little to no commute, I feel like I still took 10 steps backwards. I used to learn something new everyday at my last job, was constantly challenged and worked with 100m+ net worth entrepreneurs who built their wealth from nothing. Now I'm working with 6th generation old trust money, and I'm pretty much doing strictly admin work. I'm doing money movement, account opening, and am basically not as a client facing as I once was. This firm also does 0 financial planning and is strictly focused on investment management. Now I realize why they used to say they were the best at what they do... it's true, they really were, I don't think any other firm gets as deeply involved with clients. One could argue I can ""create"" the work space I want. But in my one year I have learned there are boulders in my way as the new kid on the block. I have told the higher up people at this new firm numerous times we should do more financial planning and the people at the top don't seem to care to do so. They aren't CFPs, CPAs or CFAs. They don't really see the value and think it's a waste of time. I still keep in touch with one of my old coworkers who is still at my last firm and when she tells me the things she's working on, I feel a pit in my stomach. The other day, I pulled up my notebook that has my to-do list and stumbled across my old notebook and I compared what I was doing this time last year versus now and cried. This time last year at my old firm, based on my to-do list, I was helping a client strategize selling a business, for another client helping them max out their exemption, for another client meeting with their adult-child to teach them about financial planning, etc. Now today, I sit here with a to do list that entails opening 2 accounts and doing 3 wires. Guess what the position above me does if I were to get promoted down the line? Approve the wires, review the account opening paperwork, etc. Despite all of this, I'm now considered a ""star"" at this new firm and my manager here (who is the co-owner) is so happy he hired me and everyone keeps saying they are so happy to have me. But the feeling isn't mutual... 

  
I feel like I made a total mistake and don't even think the owner could take me back even if he wanted to because it's owned by a different firm now and they have pretty much found replacements to take over the old book of business I was managing. 

  
I have had a pit in my stomach the past month. Do I stick it out at my current job and be happy I now at least have a work life balance? Do I find another firm?

so i m currently in 10th grade and have boards coming up and all this stream selection and career bullshit is going around my mind 24/7 fkin up with my studies so thats why i wanted a clear goal and i seem to not find it

My dad owns a manufacturing business that is well flourshing and i think so if i convince him he can fund me for my studies i mean ofc he will fund me but he can go a little bit higher for my education

for streams i m confused b/w commerce w maths or pcm   
  
and i need some career guidance if i take any of the two streams like what courses can i pursue and where can i pursue ?  
  
if i want to give JEE then should i do dummy or regular schooling?  
  
what should if i clear JEE? [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) ? B.Sc?   
  
If i do [B.tech](http://B.tech) then what field should i go for?  
  
What if i dont clear JEE ? then what can i do except engineering   
  
If i choose commerce with maths should i go with [B.com](http://B.com) \+ MBA / BBA + MBA / CA?  
   
after i complete my undergraduate degree i rlly want to pursue MBA   
  
where should i pursue MBA india or abroad?   
  
what would be the expenses if i do MBA abroad what countries and universities provides affordables MBAs but are also well reputed

After i complete MBA should i continue with my dads business??

or if i complete my MBA from abroad should i just take a job there ?

I think that i m kinda intrested in the business field as it excited me a lot rather than doing a shitty ass job , or i can go for a startup of my own or start a new industry

  
I think so this will be useful for more tenthies out there except me cuz we all are usually confused on what to pursue

1iihk86,Pitching myself to former company as perfect person to address potential future/current challenge – meeting with chief of staff tomorrow,"I was let go from my former company in early December. Because of the company's business model me being let go from an independent team is not a reflection of my relationship with the company itself. Basically the team I was on was a microclimate and it wasn't a good fit for either of us, I realized this pretty quickly and would have loved to stay on to learn things, but unfortunately timing and circumstances really fast tracked me being let go lol.

The company is essentially a turnkey service for independent 1099 sales reps, providing resources but not directly developing new talent. There’s no structured path for someone to learn the industry and transition into a sales rep role—only rare opportunities to join a team and learn from seasoned veterans (and even then, it's kind of a weird situation where you wouldn't necessarily break out on your own.. you'd help build the sales rep's book of business and eventually join the commission pool?). The company’s affiliated sales reps are aging, and there’s no clear pipeline for new talent to drive future growth.

I see an opportunity where my pain point (lack of a clear path to becoming a successful sales rep) aligns with the company’s need for new talent. My plan is to leverage modern technology, mentorship from existing reps, and company resources to build my own success—then leverage my success to help develop a structured sales development pipeline for the company, ensuring continuous growth rather than relying solely on independent reps’ businesses. Basically, not saying they need to change their business model but maybe leaning into the tech sales structure may be wise down the line. I feel like the time it would take for me to be successful, more or less, perfectly lines up with this bottle neck I'm seeing the company has/will have. I could see me being successful and my future: 5-7 years Head of Sales and 7-10 years Director or VP of Sales Development bringing in a couple million. In 10 years these aging sales reps may have retired, their team inherits their book of business, there's no guarantee that the clients will stay.. it's a whole thing.

My question is what do you guys think of my idea? Have you or do you know anyone who essentially came into a company and built a sales development department? I'm wondering what company could say because I would want to be a W2 employee.. not a 1099 sales rep. Being a 1099 sales rep I'd have to fund my venture somehow.. I'm unemployed at the moment so I was thinking of becoming a waiter again when my unemployment runs out if I still don't have a job as a plan B but then I was like ""wait why wait"" after I got through 4 rounds of interviews for a SDR role with a really good tech company and didn't get it.

I have a list of ""asks"" but my goal is to end the meeting with another meeting scheduled. I want to open an active dialogue into how this could work for both me and the company. Or I'd like to pitch this more formally with a presentation to the CEO/COO. My ""ask"" at the very least is to have my ""@company.com"" email address back because I can't exactly go out and try and build a book of business with a gmail lol... (which brings me back to my point: how do you do this? Company will always have an open 1099 sales dev rep role on their website but you need to bring in book of business that's at least 300k)

But I think my ultimate ask would be, salary plus part of commission of business I build. Salary will provide stability, % commission will feed the insatiable hunger I have. Ultimately move to a 1099 once I've build enough business? With W2 I would have stability, health insurance, the salary to fund myself.. I think a lot of people have partners who can cover the cost of living expenses but I'm single. More over, there's the cost of business cards, merch to show potential customers, costs to literally prospect: tickets to enter events, linkedin sales navigator subscription, clothes to wear to look presentable in person with clients lol I've worked remote the last two years I have no professional clothing.

\-Also would like my computer back, IT to help set up stuff, access to powerpoint ect ect

A little bit more of underlying context is that there was a company wide transition to a new platform (they'd been using Salesforce for like 15 years) and the new platform has been extremely challenging, it's been 6 months but a nightmare basically and they should have never switched. Because of this all hands are on deck for that still with no end in sight. So I really don't think anyone is looking in the direction I'm looking? I don't think anyone will notice this potential paint point until they notice it because it becomes noticable..... if that makes sense lol

I am currently exploring opportunities to further my education and enhance my career prospects in the maritime sector in Denmark.



I hold a BSc in Economics and an MSc in Shipping Management, both from the University of Piraeus. Additionally, I have two years of experience in the finance/logistics division of the maritime sector in Greece. However, I have found that my current level of experience is not sufficient to secure a job in Denmark at this stage.



To improve my chances of employment in Denmark in the future, I am considering pursuing a master’s degree in a relevant field in Denmark. I am particularly interested in programs related to maritime finance and/or maritime logistics.



Would you have any recommendations for master's programs in Denmark that could help me achieve this goal? Any insights or guidance you could share would be greatly appreciated.

Currently a Comp Si student(23M) graduating in a semester over the summer. I’ve been looking at all my options but in all honesty I have no interest in being a programmer. I love physics and I also like engineering as it’s more hands-on.

Physics, MechE, Electrical, Aerospace, Chemical, ect. Are my favorites. I haven’t research much into computer engineering as I don’t believe it will help me with careers I’m interested in (Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics).

I recently talked to a professor from a university I always wanted to go to about requirements for MechE masters, he told me to not waste my money and that I would have to makeup for a lot of missing curriculum even if I did get admitted.

This leaves me in a weird situation where I have a degree in a major I’m indifferent about, wanting to change career paths but not knowing what to do. I feel like I’m a more hands 
on type of person, I would also love to do theoretical physics.

- Preventative medicine
- Nutrition/Dietician area
- Epigenetics
- Obstetrics
- Herbs/Botany
- Research/Lab work (has worked in various research labs)
- Psychology/Psych research/Psychiatry

She’s great at science style things: Chemistry, biology, etc.

Ideally she wants a job that starts at ~70k and has the ability to go up to 100k+, again, in NYC.

Also would rather not peruse a masters or PhD but it’s on the table if necessary for a specific career path, and prefers to work on her feet rather than a desk job.

Where could she go from here and what jobs are available with this skill set?

Thank you all so much

1iie17r,I've become unemployable. How to change that?,"I haven't worked for past three years. I was doing internship after my college and in the middle, my dad committed suicide. I dropped my internship because in my culture we have to do some rituals.  
After my dad demise, for two months, I was not in a good shape mentally as I lost my all time supporter and I couldn't reason his death. I just wasn't ready mentally for anything. But, still I tried to apply for jobs but I ended up stuttering in all the job interviews. One of my friend referred me in her workplace and I ended up zoning out and couldn't even get selected for internship.   
I asked my another close friend to refer me in his job, because that place could have hired me but he simply said no to my face. And I couldn't ask the reason. After that, my confidence went down the drain. I felt angry because I had a potential more than any intern but I got nothing.  
With that, I simply cried whole night and came back to my mom. And wasted another 6 months doing nothing. I went back to the city again to start the job but failed again. This time I applied more but couldn't even get to the interview rounds. I started getting axious and worried in interviews because how trash my past interviews were. I quitted again because I couldn't even get to any job role.   
The one thing that made me who I am was the dilemma and confusion and unworthiness.

She then went straight to ask me if I still would like to continue with the financial modelling task, saying “it will take 1 hour of your time”

I interview with a major U.S. bank for a entry level position and haven’t heard back even after they said they will update me after I followed up. 

I had the initial teams interview with the recruiter on 1/7 and she said they were urgently needing to fill this position so the hiring manager was looking to do the next round of interviews next week and asked which day works best. Sorted out a day and both agreed. Okay sounds good. She never sent the invite so I emailed her and she sent it for 1/13. Had a great interview with the department manager and another member of the team. Both were great and everything seemed fine. At the end she said I checked off all the boxes and she is finishing up interviews by 1/24 and will let me know. 

About a week passed by and I reached out to the manager I interview with to ask if she needed any references etc. 

No response… so I email the recruiter on 1/29 seeing if there is any update or if they need any references etc. she said she had a family emergency and she is meeting with the hiring manager on 1/31 and will update me then. 

No response… I’m trying to be patient with this and give them the benefit of the doubt considering banks usually move at a snails pace but having been unemployed since May of 24 not having a job makes me feel useless.

1iidbsm,Help! Moved to a new Project and now I am very stressed! How do I contact boss?!,"Just a little context. I have been in this company for 9 months and I was enjoying it until recently. I am an apprentice so I have 11 months left of my contract, and my co-workers are lovely. I commute around 2hrs there and 2hrs back. I pay for my travelling. I am 23m.   
  
But the issue right now is that I was moved to a new project, a project that has very strict time codes. Now with the apprenticeship I am needed to do my apprentice work ""in my own hours"", but with the new project, I don't have any time as I get home around 8:30pm, shower, eat and then I need to sleep. This was fine with my old project as I would get home at 6pm so I had enough time to work on my apprenticeship + hobbies. This project is also a project that you cannot work from home with as welll so that's outside the question too.

My apprenticeship work is akin to a college course, except we don't get many lessons so we need to self study. I have a mix of exams, course work and project write ups. I'm feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work that needs to be done (I am aiming for Distinction). I am behind 2 projects and haven't even started another.   
  
My old project was relaxed with time, I could come in early and finish my shift earlier. It's an office job. and I had free time to do my apprenticeship work but this new project is time locked. I know this is vague (company people sometimes browse this sub)  
  
I know I sound entitled, but I simply don't know what to do anymore. This project is important for the company but I don't think I am a perfect fit and this is making me very anxious and stressed about it. I am thinking of writing an email to my boss about it, i'm thinking even if I get fired for this, I cannot sustain this. I'm having anxiety coming in the office (I was never one who was stressed) and I am thinking of calling in sick because it's physically making me throw up.

In short -> New Project is stressing me because it's times are not flexible, I go home late and I do not have time anymore to do my own apprenticeship work making me fail or even hobbies which is making me super depressed.

1iiceae,"Contemplating moving from a large, publicly traded company to a very small, private company","I currently work as a software developer for a fairly large, US-based, publicly traded company (roughly 70,000 employees worldwide). I have worked for the company for about 16 years. It is the only professional job I have ever had. Due to some major changes at the company, including a major acquisition and downsizing of the business unit I work in, I am seriously considered looking for a new job for the first time in my career.

I've been searching for jobs on LinkedIn, and was recently contacted by a recruiting firm about an opportunity with a very small (less than 50 people), privately owned company that is looking for an experienced embedded software engineer to build a new team. This sounds like an exciting opportunity for me, but I'm also a bit nervous about this potential change.

I'm looking for some advice on what to look for in a small, privately owned that could be considered red flags. Some information I have found about the company:

1. The company has been in business for about 15 years. The fact that they have been in business this long and only have up to 50 employees seems odd to me. That seem to signal a lack of growth, or volatile employment.
2. They have three investors that I know of: a bank, a state government entity, and a private equity firm. They are on their third round of investing (I'm not exactly sure what means). On one hand, this makes me wonder if they aren't very profitable. On the other hand, if the investors are continuing to invest, they must see some promise.
3. I can't find any information about the company on Reddit, or any other internet source, other than on LinkedIn and the company's own website.
4. At some point, they were a customer of my current employer, but listed as part of a completely different industry than what they are in now. The last bit of information I can find about them as a customer is from five years ago.

Is any of this information a cause for concern? Or am I just being paranoid? I'm a bit risk-adverse, so that is probably coloring my perception a bit.

I have decent work experience as an intern in well-known companies, and I really want to work for a while before going for higher studies. But my parents think I should jump straight into a master’s degree because they don’t want me to ""break the study cycle.""

Now, the real dilemma:

Everyone seems to be running after an MBA, but it’s crazy expensive, and I’m not even sure if it’s the right fit for me.

I’m confused between doing a master's in journalism, visual arts, or MBA (or something else??).

My dad thinks I should aim to become a professor, but idk if that’s what I want.

Financially, my family isn’t in the best place, and they already made a huge effort to send me to a top university for my bachelor’s. I need something affordable but also worth it.


The pressure is literally eating me up inside, and I have no clue where to start. If anyone has been in a similar boat or has insights on what would be the best move career-wise, please help a fellow lost soul out.

TL;DR: Just finished my journalism degree, parents want me to do a master’s immediately, but I want to work first. MBA seems expensive, and I’m torn between journalism, visual arts, or something else. Mom suggests becoming a professor. Financial constraints are real.

I really need some guidance right now because I feel like everything I planned for is falling apart. I’m doing (or was doing) my MSc in Biochemistry, and I just got detained in my final year because of low attendance. I wasn’t allowed to write my 3rd semester exams. And the worst part is it wasn’t because I was careless or uninterested I had to step up and support my family financially during a really tough time.
For the past few months, I was working as a tutor to help out at home, and because of that, I missed about three months of university. I had informed my HODs, and at the time, they seemed understanding. But recently, with a new Vice-Chancellor in charge, everything changed, and now my HODs say they can’t do anything to help.
I’ve tried every possible way to request my VC to reconsider. I’ve been going to his office, requesting him for the past 15 days. I even took my parents with me to appeal, but he refuses to change his decision. And it’s not just me77 other students have been detained along with me. No matter how much we try, he is completely adamant about his decision.
Just yesterday, I had a clear path ahead. I was planning to apply for PhDs abroad, mostly in the US, and I had already shortlisted universities. I even cleared my English proficiency tests. I was also preparing for BARC OCES, and CSIR-NET this year....I had already scored 80 percentile in CSIR-NET during my first year, so I was confident about my chances this time.
Now, everything feels like it's crumbling. My 1st and 2nd semester CGPAs are really good(9.2 and 9.4), but none of that seems to matter at this moment. I don’t know what to do next.
Has anyone been through a similar situation? What are my options now? Should I try to fight this academically, or should I start looking at alternative routes? I’d really appreciate any advice from seniors or anyone who has faced something like this.

I was originally interested in data science and machine learning, but after diving in, I realized that the heavy programming and math (especially ML engineering) might not be for me. I do enjoy data analysis and statistics though.

I looked at bachelor’s degrees here in Sweden (as they're free here), but none offer a pure data science program, only computer science with some data science courses. The issue is, I’m not as interested in CS or hardcore programming as other bachelor degrees.

What interest me is business, economics, management, and data analysis.  
So, I started looking into business/economics degrees with a focus on Business Intelligence and that might be a better fit than computer science. I’d still get to work with data analysis that I enjoy, but in a way that aligns more with my interests.

Paths I could see myself go is:  
Business Intelligence Analyst > Business Analyst > Project Manager  
Data Analyst > Data Scientist  
Financial Analyst > Fintech roles

Im not ready to let go of the idea of maybe becoming a data scientist even tho BI/BA feels like my top choices right now. Can I still study a master in data science even though I didn't go bachelor in computer science?

There are also shorter programs (Work college?) that are 2 years long instead of 3 and you get an internship during the course. This one is called BI Analyst with AI competence :

Does this sound like a smart approach In regard to my interests, personalty and future outlook? I’d love to hear from people in BI, data science, BM or related fields. The study counselors I’ve talked to seem outdated and not super helpful.

1iiaqbl,Salary transparency - bait a switch,"I’m not posting about this because it happened one time but  multiple employers. I’m in a state where we have salary transparency. I just applied to a job that said salary range 95to 160k. OK so when they ask for salary requirements, I put 135 to 150. HR comes back with “are you flexible with salary because that’s more than the budgeted amount we have for this position.” So frustrated I wanted to just withdraw my application, but I’ll make them work a little harder and asked- “what is budgeted amount, other perks, and bonus potential?” I just don’t know why they do this -they put a range and then I go through the process of applying and putting a number in their range and they say that’s not what they had in mind.
Thoughts? Anyone else same experience? 
Am I wrong and the range just means in the middle of that? ",Ins_UW2003,5,1.0,14,1738764515,2025-02-05 14:08:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iiaqbl/salary_transparency_bait_a_switch/,2,2025
1iiaj2w,Switched Offers: Fraud Risk Management (40% hike) vs Risk Analytics (25% hike + staff loan benefits) – Which to Choose?,"Hi all, I’m seeking some career advice. I’m based in India and have recently received two offers after working in online fraud detection—a role I landed through campus placement. I hold an MBA in Finance, have advanced SQL skills, and am a beginner in Power BI. While I’ve been doing well in fraud detection, I love working with data and want to shift to analytics for better long-term growth, skills more aligned with IT, and improved salary progression.

After spending quite some time on job portals and cold-messaging recruiters and team members on LinkedIn, here are my two options:

Option 1: Fraud Risk Management at a payments regulator (40% hike)
• Focuses on fraud: I’d be tracking the latest fraud trends, emerging payment features, and regulatory changes.
• Offers exposure to high-level fraud data from across the industry—great for future roles in fintech or specialized fraud/risk areas.
• Builds deep domain expertise rather than honing technical/analytics skills.
• The “regulator” tag might add weight to my resume if I decide to specialize further in fraud/risk.

Option 2: Risk Analytics (Data Analyst role) at a bank (25% hike + staff loan benefits)
• Involves hands-on analytics with SQL, Power BI, and SAS, which aligns with the skillset I want to develop.
• Provides exposure to a broader range of risk analytics beyond just fraud, offering a more versatile experience.
• Promises a structured career growth path in analytics, even though the initial hike is lower.
• Comes with attractive bank benefits like staff loans, adding to the overall package.

I never planned on ending up in fraud detection—it was purely by chance through campus placement. However, now that I have these offers and see many of my engineering peers earning significantly more, I’m eager to make a move that offers fast career growth, better pay, and robust technical skills.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s faced a similar decision or has insights on these career paths. Which option do you think is better for long-term progression?

1ii8acq,Am I really doing job as an java dev and should I be more patient?,"Hey everyone,

I would love to get some feedback on my current job situation.

I’ve been in my ""new"" job for a year now, where I was hired as a junior Java developer. To give you some context, I previously worked as a system engineer and made a career change to become a developer. I’ve worked on a variety of development projects, and I’m not really inexperienced. When I joined, I also accepted a lower pay since they told me it was my first time as an developer and would have the chance to learn a lot of new development skills. The company is small, and that I will have a great opportunities to grow as an software engineer. So I was really excited to start my journey as a developer.

However, for the past 5 months, I haven’t been working on any Java development. When I asked when I could return to backend development, my manager told me there aren’t enough backend tasks available at the moment. He also mentioned that there aren’t enough tasks for everyone, and other developers are working on less exciting tasks as well (at least they’re still doing development-related work !?). (And why hiring ? ) So instead, they’ve assigned me the responsibility of writing all the frontend tests using Playwright (in JavaScript).

Don’t get me wrong—testing is important, and I would be fine with writing some tests in JavaScript or even focusing entirely on backend tests (e.g., with JUnit). However, Playwright feels more like scripting than actual development work. I’ve also spoken to my manager, who assured me that this situation is temporary and that these tests are very important. But it has been now 5 mounth and I really feel really frustrated. It honestly feels too similar to my old system engineering role, which is a big part of the reason I transitioned to development in the first place.

I truly enjoy development, and I understand that testing is a significant part of it. But this doesn’t feel like the development work I signed up for. Am I overreacting? What do you guys think?",OkRecord6596,1,1.0,3,1738756446,2025-02-05 11:54:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ii8acq/am_i_really_doing_job_as_an_java_dev_and_should_i/,2,2025

The stress is nonstop, I have zero work-life balance, and I feel like I’m barely holding it together. I’m constantly working, and even when I’m off, I’m still dealing with job-related stuff. It’s taken over my life, and I just can’t do it anymore. I need a change.

The thing is, my job comes with amazing benefits, including a college tuition benefit for my kids, and I cannot lose that—especially with one starting school next year. My workplace has all kinds of jobs, from food service to high-level management, so I know there are options.

The tricky part is that I’m the sole breadwinner. My wife works, but her job doesn’t pay enough to cover our bills, so I still need to bring in enough to keep us afloat. I’d probably have to supplement my income somehow—maybe freelancing or a side hustle—but I’m not sure what would be realistic.

1ii8822,Need advice,"For about 2 years, I worked as an assistant to the head manager. The job was monotonous and led me to burnout, but given the war in my country and overall instability, changing jobs wasn’t an option. However, recently, I was offered a new position in the same department. I agreed.

And now I’m drowning. What bothers me the most is that in my first month, I received zero onboarding or mentorship. I get that this is a job, not school—no one is obligated to handhold me. I can still ask for advice on how to respond to some emails, but overall, it feels like no one cares whether I sink or swim.

To top it off, they also asked me to make onboarding for a new assistant manager. So now I’m torn between helping with tasks from my previous role and trying to handle my new responsibilities, which I’m still struggling with.

1ii34vr,"Hail Mary Negotiation After Manager Says ""No Room"" On Wage","Yesterday, I was formally offered a job that I really want. For my experience and goals, it's a great job title and a transition away from my current niche industry that doesn't attract much interest from other employers. I was offered a wage of $32/hour. In my first call with the recruiter, I was told the range was $29-39. I exceed the requested management and education experience requested for this role, and I have supplemental experience that makes me especially well suited for the position. Based on this, I followed up their offer with a request for $38/hour, and I was told there was no room to adjust the wage.

This role would be a great move for me, and I was prepared to take an hourly pay cut to accept this position (I currently make close to $39/hour, but don't work as many hours). But that big of a pay cut is just not sustainable for my family's needs.

I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, but given they provided a range at the start of the process, I have a small feeling that there actually is some wiggle room they are just not eager to share, maybe because I asked for too much upfront. I'm looking for a tactful hail mary to try and get a few more dollar  per hour out of the role, and I was thinking something like this:

  
""Unfortunately, at $32, this would be a significant step down in what I’m currently making, and I cannot accept the position at this rate. I am really excited about the work I’d be able to do at xxxx, so I’d be willing to take a small pay cut for the opportunity to work there, but I couldn’t accept at less than $36.""

I don't know if this is tacky, delusional, both, or worth it. I appreciate any advice! I don't want to let this opportunity go, but I know I may have to. My current job is a dead end, and I'm a bit worried the business won't make it that much longer, so I'm really looking to get out ASAP. I've been applying for years, and this is my first viable job offer.

I started as a Coordinator, and 3 1/2 years in I moved up to a Recruitment Specialist. I have always gotten along well with my boss, c suite, directors, managers, and employees. No performance issues.  

3 years ago, a Benefits/Leaves Specialist position opened and I applied. I wasnt that interested in the work, but applied to show interest in growing. Did not get that job, but mostly because we had an awesome candidate apply, and she was offered the job. I was supportive of this. Last year my boss got approval to expand the HR team with 2 business partners, and encouraged me to apply. I applied, interviewed, and did not get the job. I was disappointed, but overall supportive of her decision and who she did offer the job to. However, I did start applying to other jobs to see what was out there. I was offered a lateral move at a different company, and my boss counter offered. I decided to stay, and felt it was the right decision at that time. As part of the agreement of me staying, she committed to helping me grow professionally so I would be ready the next time a promotion came up. Then a promotion came up, and I still wasn't ready. Due to turnover on the team, we hadn't even started my professional development.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I keep an eye on Indeed so I know what the market is doing, and saw a position that looked appealing, so I applied. I didn't honestly think it would go anywhere, but lo and behold I get a phone screen. Then a virtual interview, and then an in person interview, and then a job offer last Friday afternoon. A job offer for 20K more than I'm making now and comparable benefits. I really liked the team I met, so I accepted the offer. I stopped by my bosses office on my way out on Friday and asked if she could meet me on Sunday, with a plan of telling her what was happening. She and I have met up outside work before, and I was under the impression that we were friends. I wanted a chance to really talk to her about it rather than just dumping my resignation letter on her desk. She said we could meet, but then when I texted her on Sunday she was busy. So Monday morning I give her my resignation and tell her that I've had a really good opportunity come up, and gave her 3 weeks notice. I would have given more, but the new job needs me to start sooner. 

I could tell she was mad, but all she said was something about me being unhappy, and that she needed time to process and then she left. Like, took a personal day for the rest of the day, left. I spent the rest of the day crying on and off and stressed as hell. I was able to talk to one of the directors who I really got along with, and she was sad to see me go but happy for me. You know, the reaction I was expecting from my leader? Today my boss is back, and first thing in the morning she pulls me into a conference room and tells me that she's disappointed with how I approached this, and that there must be something I'm not telling her, and she thought we were friends, and she's not sure she's even going to replace me. I try to tell her that I love the team, the company, my work, and working with her. All of that is true. Her response is to basically say that there must be something making me unhappy, otherwise I wouldn't have even applied for another job. 

I'm trying really hard to not take what she said super personally, because that little voice in my head is saying that I'm a disappointment, a liar, a coward, socially inept, and a waste of space. The logical side of me knows that's not what she said, so I need to work that out myself.

For informations sake, what I was most interested in with the new job was the salary and the career growth - two things she really can't offer me. She has been unsympathetic and made me feel bad about money in the past, so I didn't bring that up. The career growth, she had previously implied that it was my own fault I wasn't seeing the growth I wanted because I never came to her with suggestions. I didn't come to her with suggestions because I had already done everything I knew to do (I've read books, gotten certifications, and tried to build a professional network), so I needed her guidance to go from there. I never got it because she's always been too busy. Sometimes we were both just too busy. That's just how it goes. 

I am a very patient person, and I have always been understanding and empathetic when she fell short as a leader or I felt she was being too hard on me. I took responsibility for screw ups and did everything I could to be a model employee. 

I know the timing is not ideal for me leaving due to a lot of turnover in the department lately, and it's going to leave my team short staffed for a while. I did consider that when accepting this job offer though, because the more I thought about it the more I realized that in the 5 years I've been there, there has never been a ""good"" time for me to leave. And there might never BE a good time for me to leave. 

All of that said, here's where I need help/guidance. So far, everyone I've told about this is pissed at my boss for the way she's handling this. Words have ranged from unprofessional to down right bitchy. BUT, I want to know: where did I screw this up so badly that a 5 year relationship is now trashed? I know she is stressed and overworked right now, and she's taken that out on me in the past, but nothing like this before. Is the relationship irreparable? Should I just accept that I'll never get to use her as a reference, and I may not be eligible for rehire at this company? Is there something I can do or say to make the next few weeks less awkward, or can I do anything to fix this? I have so much respect for my boss, and am absolutely devastated that this is how things are ending.

1ii1djs,Just accepted a job offer and realized my resume has the wrong dates...,"This was honestly an accident. My resume lists my last employer from September 2021 to September 2024. I thought my last day of employment was the first week of September but it was August 31st, putting me 1 day shy of the 3 year mark. 

I just accepted a job offer that requires 3+ years of experience. When filling out the background check, I referenced my severance to confirm which showed my last date of employment as the last day of August. I went ahead and put the correct dates on the background check (Sept. 2021 to Aug. 2024) after realizing the mistake. 

Obviously it was only 1 day short of the following month, but I'm concerned as I can see how that would look dishonest to meet the 3 years of experience required.

1ii0xcu,Stay Or Go (back),"Today an old colleague who is now a CEO of an industry association reached out to see if I would come work for him. And I’m not quite sure what to do. 

For background, I spent over 8 years working for industry associations, 5 in Ontario and a little over 3 in British Columbia. Ontario is home and while in BC I got pretty serious with a guy in ON and while we tried to make BC our home, I was offered the opportunity to come back home and try working with a member-company of the association I previously worked with. I knew I didn’t want to work with associations forever and this was a chance to try something new and diversify my resume. It’s within the industry, just not on the association side. 

The new role pays slightly less than what I had, but has a lot more opportunities to grow. Not with the company but in skill set and as a professional. The company has absolutely horrible benefits, policies, culture and management. Not to mention, I have a long commute, 2-3 hours a day round trip. But, I like the role and it’s been nice being challenged a different way. 

I am almost a year into the job, and now I’ve been offered the chance to return to the association world, which has been good to me. Salary would be slightly more, I can work remote or have the option to go into the office which saves so much time, and amazing benefits that give double my vacation time. I also know the leadership style of this CEO, so I have no concerns there. It’s just…I know the work…it’s not the most stimulating and I found I got very bored. 

Now I’m being challenged in what I’m learning, but the company and commute is draining and it’s incredibly tempting to take the offer and have the work/life balance and do a job I know. 

I also feel like part of me would regret or feel like a failure “quitting” this new role after a year. 

I know I probably sound like I’m complaining, and that this is a good problem to have that most people, especially right now, don’t. 

But it’s still a decision that requires some thoughtfulness and weighing, and me putting it on here is a way to do that. So pls be kind and constructive.

1ii0hvz,Need advice dealing with disrespectful/sexist paralegal,"
I’ve been having some issues with my paralegal lately and would like some advice. 

Background: this is a government agency. I have been practicing for a little over two years. I was recently promoted to a more senior department and this paralegal was assigned to me. Typically about 4-5 attorneys are assigned to each paralegal. 

My first issue with the paralegal was regarding work life boundaries. He has my personal cell which initially I had no issue with. We are sometimes assigned cases where the court date is just a few days away and the case requires immediate attention. One time I was out of the office and one of those cases was assigned to me. He texted me many times with pictures of the case files and updates about the case. While I do appreciate him trying to be proactive, it was a bit over the top to send me numerous texts and pictures. My main issue with it was that I was only out for one day and there was time between when I would be back and the court date for me to work on the case. Therefore it was not really necessary for him to bother me on my personal cell about it. 

This happened again a second time where he texted me when I was out saying I had a case like that but actually the court date was changed “so it’s not a thing anymore” or something to that effect. So there was no need to disturb me and tell me that then. 

After the second time I spoke to him and told him that if the situation arises where I have a case with a short date but I will be back in the office in advance of the date then I don’t want him to text me while I’m out. I told him the only situation where I would like him to text me is if I will be returning the same date as the court date and would be walking into a chaotic situation when I return. 

He did not respond well to this or follow my request. He said he still has to tell me because what if a superior asks if he informed me (they would not ask and none of the other paralegals do this; also the bosses have access to the calendar and can see when we are out). I told him that he should only inform me when it’s urgent with no time to prepare or a serious matter and to use his judgement. 

Unfortunately the situation repeated a third time last week. I was out on Friday. He texted me Friday morning and told me I had a case with a court date on Tuesday and sent me a long paragraph with all the details. I told him I would be back on Monday (which he knew) and we would deal with it then. I thought that would be clear that I no longer wanted to discuss this. Nope. He texted me three more times throughout the day about the case with meaningless updates that I didn’t need to take any action on. 

The reason I say sexist is because there are two female attorneys assigned to him (myself included) and two male attorneys. He treats the male attorneys like his best friends and goes above and beyond for them. He does things for them that are far beyond his job description and honestly the attorney’s job. For example, he does legal research for them, reviews their motions, goes through the substance of their discovery, prepares legal memos, etc. The paralegal role in this job is clerical (paperwork, redactions, ordering documents, scheduling) - they are not supposed to assist with anything substantive. Additionally, he has blamed me and the other female attorney for things outside of our control to third parties, which I find rude and unprofessional. for instance, my female colleague asked him to cancel something, and in the email to a third party he wrote “my apologies, due to late notice by the attorney I have to cancel”. The timing of that was dependent on opposing counsel and outside of my colleague’s control. 

He also asked to touch my shoes once which I found creepy. 

Yesterday, I asked him to do a very simple task that takes two minutes and said I needed it done within an hour. He responded in a very snarky tone and said oh so you mean you need it NOW then? I said no just within the next hour. I had a witness in my office at the time and the witness noticed his attitude and commented on it. I think it was very rude and unprofessional to respond with such a tone to a basic request especially in front of a third party. 

The most recent incident was the most egregious. Without getting into too much detail, in certain cases there is a document that is the paralegal’s responsibility to obtain and send out in advance of the court date. I had one such case where the party that the document needed to be sent to was not the usual party. In order to make sure this was covered in advance, right after the last court date, which was over a month ago, I told the paralegal that the next court date was a date in feb. And to put in his calendar to prepare the document in advance. This afternoon, I realized that the court date was tomorrow and I didn’t remember him ever bringing me the document for review or giving me a final copy. I went to him and apologized that this was last minute but I need the document for tomorrow. He searched the case in his inbox and lo and behold it was on his calendar for tomorrow and he didn’t do it. When I initially told him that this was needed for tomorrow, he audibly SCREAMED and GROWLED at me, so loudly that another paralegal sitting nearby was shocked and said WTF is going on?

To make matters worse, he came by my office later and told me that I needed to work on my timing, when this was his mistake as I had told him over a month ago about this court date. 

There was also an incident recently where I had him schedule someone to come to the office and later no longer needed them so I told him to cancel. He did not cancel and the person still received a letter from us requesting they come to the office on a particular date. To be safe, I had emailed the person as well letting them know the appointment was cancelled and I no longer needed them. For some reason the person still showed up. The paralegal then texted me that the person had showed, and did I call them yesterday because they had to miss work. I told him I had emailed the person canceling and he told me well you really should have called, and was criticizing how I did my job, not taking responsibility that he was supposed to cancel and the letter should have never gone out once I told him to cancel. 

There have also been a few times where he had questioned me on substantive areas of the law and suggested I was doing something wrong. Genuine questions about how something works are great and I am always happy to explain something if he’s interested. However the tone here was more I think you are doing something wrong or you don’t know what you’re doing. 

I have started to document the instances where he’s been out of line or messed something up. I plan on speaking to him one on one about appropriate workplace behavior. Any suggestions on how to go about this would be much appreciated. 

Also forgot to add that this is not a paralegal with 20+ years experience who probably does know more than someone in my position. He’s barely out of college and has been at the job maybe one year. 

for anyone in big law/corporate, we are not considered on call, it is considered quite rude to contact someone outside of work hours or on vacation/holiday unless it is a very urgent matter/emergency. We don’t get paid enough for that lol. 

TLDR: paralegal doesn’t listen to my requests, blames me for his mistakes, treats me and the other female attorney much differently than the male attorneys, and has growled, screamed, and responded with a snarky tone when asked to do basic tasks that are part of his job.

1ii0f1h,Really Need Advice Before Tomorrow,"Hello all, 

I'm a high performer at work, been with the company over a decade, with a clear track record of positive reviews and promotions from entry level hourly to a professional salary position. I've been in this position for about 3 years now while I finish my BSB, which will be complete within the next two quarters. They waived the BS requirement to promote me to the position, but I pursued the degree anyways to continue my career progression.

 I was hired into the position when it was a two person team. I've been flying solo for about 2 years, and have made it known that they need to increase the headcount and the workload is heavy. It's also a junior position, but I'm doing the work of a senior level position, plus some, and am a go-to for all needs. 

My boss is now trying to give me about 3 hours of additional workload each day, to cover some of the tasks of a management position that was just vacated. A position I strongly do not want. And there is no defined duration for the extra workload.

So how do I approach this situation? I have a meeting with my boss about it tomorrow. 

I feel like I don't have a lot of negotiational leverage because I'm in a position that I'm not qualified for *on paper*, and I'm already aiming for a promotion to senior level once my degree is complete in the next six months. So I feel like even if I tried to negotiate a raise for this ridiculous workload now, they would just take it out of the promotion to senior later, and it would all be moot. 

I honestly don't feel there's any way around the new workload, so I want to ease the pain... Suggestions? ",j_monz,1,1.0,0,1738724802,2025-02-05 03:06:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ii0f1h/really_need_advice_before_tomorrow/,2,2025

1ihzusz,Is a Geoscience degree worth paying for?,"Hi I am F22 about to graduate from the open university with a Diploma of Higher education in Environmental Science from Scotland and my partner has had an amazing job opportunity that involves us relocating to Sheffield this summer for a couple years at least.

My goal was to use this Diploma to get advanced entry into Geoscience  BSc and furthering onto a Masters after in Scotland. This job promotion my boyfriend has received is a once in a lifetime opportunity for him and I am so proud and will do anything to support him as he has supported me. We have been together 3 years and were friends before that so we are in a very stable relationship.

However, this makes things a bit difficult for me, as I will now need to finish this BSc in England. Which costs a lot of money. In Scotland we are lucky to be able to go to university for free. So essentially I will be throwing that away to study somewhere where I will need to pay almost 10k a year.

The good news is with advanced entry I may only have to study for 2 years to receive my BSc (maybe 3 at most) and come back to Scotland to complete a Masters. 

But my question is, do you think it is worth it?

Do you think a degree in Geoscience (or any related subjects as idk what my masters will be yet) is a reliable enough degree that I will be able to find a career with good earning potential so that the cost of studying in England won't be for nothing?

1ihzf7h,Should I pursue a career in law or a career in education? Help!!,"26F with a Bachelor's and Master's in English. I've worked in classrooms as a preschool teacher, college tutor, and TA (which at my university were literally just underpaid lecturers). It's been difficult getting a job as a lecturer, and I have always wanted to pursue a career in law. I've been studying for over a year for the LSAT's and am scheduled to take them in May. I'm pretty confident that I am going to do well, and I've had a few attorneys tell me I should pursue a career in law. I genuinely love studying policy, I am passionate about justice, and can see myself fighting the good fight for years to come.

However, I have been substitute teaching part-time to make ends meet while I study. With the teacher shortage, I have been incredibly busy with work. I've found that my classroom management skills are pretty top notch, and all of the administrators I've worked for have asked me to return to the campus (this is true for elementary, middle, and high school). Right now, the school district I am working for pays people with my education level $63k starting. The HR director of my district also told me that with a Master's, they'd be willing to pay for my teacher certification and any higher education needed to put me in administration--including a PhD (we have an administration shortage too!). After about 2 years in the class room, I could be a Vice Principal or a Principal making 6 figures a year.

That said, I feel like I would really regret it if I pursued a career in law. I did a lot of political activism and advocacy work in college, and I felt *incredibly* drained. It consumed my life. I understand that organizing and being an attorney are two different thing, but I am worried that they are so intertwined that it will be the same experience. In organizing, I found the constant in-fighting and workplace politics to be awfully bad for my mental health. At the same time, I feel like my logical reasoning, research, writing, and argumentation skills are perfect for this career path. I actually really enjoy writing demand letters, finding loopholes in contracts, and looking up case law. 

Lastly, I am worried about my debt. I am already $93k in debt from my higher education. I don't know that getting into more debt is the move. I just don't want to regret not going after my lifelong dream.

1ihzbqf,Bigla na lang ako hindi pumasok sa work at wala ako sinabihan sa office kundi yung HR lang.,"I was hired by an agency and sent to a company as Personal assistant of this government official in Las Piñas. I started on February 3, 2025. Before my start date, I've been following and asking the HR, if how much is my salary or approve ba yung asking salary ko, because I'm assuming afford nila since hindi sila nakipag negotiate sa salary during my hiring period, and they said, the client will disclose the salary and JO on my first day-

Summary: On February 3, there was no JO/Contract, NDA, or orientation. Just a casual pakilala lang sa the whole team. When I asked where I could submit my requirements that they had requested me to prepare, they responded, Itago ko daw muna, and they would clarify whether I’am under an agency or hired directly. After I got home, I called HR and informed her that I had not received a contract from their client, etc. She said I’m a direct hire and will not be under the agency; she will call the office to clarify.

Feb 4, still no JO/contract and all, after following up with admin three times because I had no idea about my salary and had no idea about the contract and all, and when I asked them if I could now submit my requirements, they said no need na daw—so paano yung mga government benefits? — On my fourth follow-up, they said na baka kinakapa pa yung performance ko before giving me a contract—WAHHH sa isip ko, so ano to naka free-trial kayo sakin? Then that night, I called HR and informed her that I would not be continuing my employment with their client because it was my second day without a contract.

This is my first time working in a public office, so I'm not sure if the hiring procedure is similar to a private companies, such as before or on my first day, with the JO, contract, NDA, and orientation-etc.

1ihzaa3,Surviving the soul-sucking office job?,"I come asking for advice on how you all manage to not gouge your eyes out in front of a computer screen for 8 hours straight.  I spend most days slamming out computer designs in this awkward duality of feeling *bored* and *anxious*.  I want to shift away from this mentality and achieve more for myself, but I often sink into this ""man I'm wasting my life at this job I hate"" mentality that drags me down.  I end up phone scrolling or zoning out to music.  I want to get out of that brain rut.

  
My main obstacles are that ""the job / environment isn't very complicated / compelling"" alongside ""everything is so behind and rushed because of an absurd lack of communication and organization"".  95% of my day is in a grey windowless room facing a computer screen designing furniture in CAD.  Rectangles in space.  I've made so many at this point that they've all blurred together in my mind over time to where I couldn't tell you what I made just last week.  It's now very easy but I no longer feel like I'm growing, or caring.  

  
On the other, anxious hand, everything I make has an absurdly high chance of being wrong because some of the info I have is wrong.  Bad sketches, unforwarded emails, unspoken manufacturing updates, missed new materials, missed new hardware, project manager ""whoopsies"" - all are not only possible but *likely*.  As a result, most everything is at least 2 weeks behind, and we're reminded constantly.  Sometimes we're just stuck waiting, only to mad dash the day that some other department's info finally arrives.  That's assuming someone doesn't damage anything, requiring us to isolate and send parts out again in an even madder dash.

  
But there's a silver lining I want to utilize: I can get ""enough"" work done in a day to satisfy with 4 hours or less.  The other 4, I could use for whatever.  I want to be better at using those 4 ""free"" hours to benefit me.  My issue is switching gears *to self-productive* when instead I'm either seeking brainrot entertainment from the boredom, or drowning my dread in headphones from a mad dash happening or looming.

  
What do you guys do or use to pull yourself out of these work-sourced rotten moods to take advantage of those ""free time"" moments in an office?

1ihz509,Wala ako sinabihan sa office na hindi na ako papasok after my second day.,"I was hired by an agency and sent to a company owned by a government official in Las Piñas. I started on February 3, 2025. Before my start date, I've been following and asking the HR, if how much is my salary or approve ba yung asking salary ko, because I'm assuming afford nila since hindi sila nakipag negotiate sa salary during my hiring period, and they said, the client will disclose the salary and JO on my first day-

Summary: On February 3, there was no JO/Contract, NDA, or orientation. Just a casual pakilala lang sa whole team, when I asked where I could submit my requirements that they had requested me to prepare, they responded itago ko daw muna and they would clarify whether I was under an agency or hired directly. After I got home, I called HR and informed her that I had not received a contract from their client and etc. She said I’m direct hire and will not be under the agency, she will call the office to clarify daw.

Feb 4, still no JO/Contract and all, after following up with admin three times because I had no idea about my salary and had no idea about contract and all, on my fourth follow up, they said na baka kinakapa pa yung performance ko before giving me a contract-WAHHH sa isip ko, so ano to naka free-trial kayo sakin? Then that night, I called HR and informed her that I would not be continuing my employment with their client because it was my second day without a contract.

This is my first time working in a public office, so I'm not sure if the hiring procedure is similar to a private companies, such as before or on my first day, with the JO, contract, NDA, and orientation-etc.

Question: Hindi ba ako mapapahamak if hindi na ako pumasok today, at wala ako sinabihan sa office kundi yung HR lang? ",FakeCasper,1,1.0,0,1738720991,2025-02-05 02:03:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihz509/wala_ako_sinabihan_sa_office_na_hindi_na_ako/,2,2025
1ihyyv1,What do I do?,"Ive never known what to do for a career. Im not “naturally” good at anything and the only reason i’m competent in anything is because I’ve had to work really hard to get to that point. 

I work in remodeling and led a team of 6-12 for 2 years that would generate anywhere from 4-8 million per year. I recently transferred to the “in home sales” role of it so I just wait next to my phone ALL day waiting to get a text to go into work and for that reason I am constantly thinking about work. I get two hours notice before I have to be somewhere 

Ie I get a text at 4:30 to be somewhere at 6 
I get a text at 5:30 to be somewhere at 7:30


Most of the time I’ll be on an appt between the hours of 5 & 7:30 and can be in the home for 2 hours all the way up to 6 🤷🏻. I can start at 7:30 and might not leave until midnight. So late nights, indeed. I’m mainly running “PM appts” right now bc this is a slower time of year but during the summer I’ll run 2appts per day most days. My employer claims most people in their first year will make anywhere from 80-120 which sounds great! 

I have to be ready to go into work from 8am-7pm everyday (M-F). I work EVERY Saturday and have to be ready to go into work from 8am-1pm. 

My wife works in a school system so she gets home at 5pm consistently. The conversation of “hey do you want to do X on X day” comes up and I literally have to tell her “I just don’t know if I can do that on X day and X time” quite often. It happened 3x last week and I feel terrible about it. 

And I hate that. 

The money/actual job have nothing to do with it, I just cannot stand being tied to my phone and playing my entire life by ear. My parents live 3 hours away so if I want to see them I have to PTO Saturday so doing a trip of any sort really digs into my PTO quickly. 

I just feel kind of stuck. I understand the opportunity of making 80-120 at 25 but the reason I transitioned departments is bc I was allllllways working for the team. Now I’m not leading the team but I still feel a ton of anxiety/am always on edge during the day bc I just wait all day and then don’t get to see her when I come home. 

I’m 25 live in the Midwest, went to Purdue, have a degree in behavioral science, have never known what I want in my life, love being outside and have been interested in trades (I understand the long hours but i think I’d be able to turn off work mode when I’m at the house) but have 0 experience in anything related to that) firefighting (work life balance sounds amazing, I’m okay with the pay in my area but understand i would see some terrible things)

Overall i just feel stuck. Any advice on career or dealing with anything else mentioned? Appreciate you all ❤️ ",Complete-Distance825,1,1.0,0,1738720509,2025-02-05 01:55:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihyyv1/what_do_i_do/,2,2025

1ihy7qz,Is it worth it to switch careers and become a remote therapist?,"I’m currently working as a remote SDR manager making around $90K with bonuses. I’ve been enjoying the flexibility of working for a U.S. company while living in Latin America, and I’m actually about to start a family. I originally got my bachelor’s in psychology but never pursued therapy because, at the time, remote work in the field wasn’t really an option.

Now, with many jobs pushing back to in-person work, therapy seems to be going in the opposite direction—more and more sessions are being done remotely. My own therapist has even taken remote sessions while traveling abroad, which got me thinking about whether this could be a good long-term career move.

I also have bipolar and ADHD, diagnosed at 18, and I’ve been managing both with medication for almost half my life. I’ve always wanted to help others dealing with the same struggles, and being a therapist would be a way to do that while also maintaining a flexible lifestyle.

I looked into schools in Virginia (where I’m from) and found that Liberty University offers a mostly remote master’s program. From what I understand, after the degree, I’d need a couple of years of supervised clinical work, which might mean a pay cut—but if I’m still living abroad, I could make it work.

What I’d like to know:
	•	Is this a realistic career switch given my goals?
	•	What does the salary trajectory look like over time?
	•	Is it actually possible to make $150K+ as a therapist? I’ve heard of some making $200K, but I don’t know how common that is.
	•	How easy is it to build a fully remote practice?

I love the idea of doing something meaningful while keeping the flexibility I currently have. But I want to make sure it’s actually worth it before I commit to two years of school and 2 years supervised work before licensure.

A former boss of mine started a SaaS company and is gaining a lot of traction in the space as they prepare for their Series A. He’s reached out to me with an offer to be hire #4. The opportunity for immediate (+$20k raise) and potential (shares in an early stage startup) growth just seem too good to pass up, all things considered. 

My manager, the VP of IT, is a career employee (25+ years), which is not unusual for this org. We have a great professional relationship, and he hired me with a long-term position in mind. I know that leaving during such a tumultuous  time with no redundancies in place will come as a rude surprise. 

When this offer materializes after funding is complete, what steps can I take to ensure that the exit is as professional as possible?

1. The new job of mine lied about work from home policies, being told during the interview that WFH was allowed, but every time I have asked for working from home, it’s been rejected.	

2. I am considering going back to school for a bachelor's degree in my field, and the lack of WFH makes me believe that furthering my education and working at the same time would be difficult. So I’d prefer to make this easier on myself given the choice.

3. I’m unsure of my current job’s education policy/if they would allow me to do school and work at the same time. 	

4. I’d like better pay, but the time to solve that problem with this new job has passed.

1ihxbrl,"Should I take a new offer, or ask for a raise?","I'm a 29YO senior software developer at a consultancy, earning 95K Canadian. I have been at my current salary and position for 2.5 years. I have had great performance feedback from my clients and my employer. 

I have been talking with a recruiter about a role as a software development team lead, and she has seemed really excited about recommending me to her client. I told her my minimum number was around 140K to consider switching jobs, she said that sounds about right for what they're expecting to pay. I think there's a strong possibility that I will get an offer from them.

I really like my current employer, it's very comfortable. One of our major clients downsized this year, so it's no secret that it has been more difficult to place consultants than usual, and there have been no yearly raises for the past 2 years. I am always concerned that I could wind up ""on the bench"" for too long and get laid off, but my company has managed to avoid laying people off surprisingly well given the state of the tech job market. I'm always on the fence in my thinking about my job security - working for a consulting firm. On one hand, I always do temporary contracts and if I can't be placed anywhere for long enough, I'll be let go. On the other hand, there's a team of people whose job is to find billable work for me to do and I'm paid to upskill while I wait - I basically have to get laid off twice to stop getting a paycheck. I know of just one coworker who was laid off, he was on the bench for 4 months before they let him go. He earned a ton of certifications during that time and got paid to do it. 

An important detail - I worked for my current company for a couple years before, then went to another consultancy for a $35K pay increase. 6 months later I was laid off from there (due to the company mis-managing a client relationship really badly) and I came back at the new higher salary. They did me a huge favour by bringing me back, but I have been billing steadily for the entire time I've been back - I know they have been getting their money's worth and then some.

This sort of feels like history repeating itself, and I don't want to burn my current employer, but a 40% pay increase is a huge deal for me. It's a huge step towards my wife being able to stay home, and she really really doesn't want to go back to work after her maternity leave. With the job market being the way it is, it feels like it could be a really long time before I get another opportunity to increase my salary to that level.

If I get this offer, what should I do?

For some background:I recently graduated with a BS in Psychology with a concentration in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. I am currently in a research position as a Postbac in a neuroscience lab. While neuroscience is definitely interesting to me, I've found myself intrigued by machine learning and I've always had a love for math. I originally wanted to be a clinical neuropsychologist, which is still a good option for me but neuroscience interested me more which is why I joined the lab I'm currently in. But I don't think I can continue doing animal researgg cb (we work with mice). I also was super interested in the data analysis from my previous research experience. However, I'm not sure if I should keep striving to be a clinical neuropsychologist, or if it's worth it to switch over to a career in data analytics. I'm also taking a Calc II class right now, and I'm loving it. This is what has got me looking into switching over to engineering because I think I would find those type of classes fun. Is there a way to go into engineering without going back for a second bachelors? Should I look into data analytics? Or should I continue on a path to become a clinical neuropsychologist?

1iht8gr,What can I do in the US with British Masters in Clinical Psychology + no licensing pathway?,"Long story short - I live in the US now and I keep being offered group counseling, facilitation, individual counselling etc roles that I have previously been able to do. I’ve lived in Dubai for 5+ years and was able to work in various low risk counselling roles based out of the UK, Dubai, and other countries. I’ve done my clinical hours post graduation.

However it is not directly licensable anywhere in the US it seems. What kind of roles can I even do moving forward? There is a mental health crisis in the US and there is such a need but somehow it is sooo difficult and each state has its own licensing laws…. I don’t need to work in a clinic I’m just trying to work with teenagers struggling with difficulties in a group setting! 

Please give me some advice. If I have to give up counselling forever that would be so sad but then what other roles should I even do if in unlicensed? Feeling devastated.

I've been in a rut and looking to explore potential career paths given my personal skillset and strengths.

I know that I'm very efficiency oriented and someone who is good at revising to improve things. I may not be the most creative person to spawn a new idea, however, when I see something I immediately see how I can improve it.

For example, if I am handed a logo design idea, I have an idea on how it could be better. Move this here, there, omit this, that etc. If I see a system/process I immediately ask myself if there is a better way.

These strengths really apply to all things I do in life.

Then I’ve heard stories of my cousins and family friends who graduated uni and walked into a job in London in a completely different area to their degree.

	•	Is there a demand for outsourcing administrative tasks in these areas?
	•	What skills or specific tasks are most in demand for these kinds of services?
	•	Does anyone here use AI tools to automate administrative processes? If so, which tools would you recommend for beginners?

1ihsf0v,"Take a buyout, or a furlough. Need advice","I learned at the beginning of the year that my job will be moving a large part of its production out of my plant. Today, we finally got more information to mull over. For starters, I began my employment 3 months ago on 11/4/24. I am due to end my probationary period in 2 days and join the union. With seniority rules being what they are, I am resigned to either taking a $25,000 buyout, or taking a furlough. They are offering 800 buyouts, which If all were taken, would be half of the plant’s work force. From what I hear, the buyout won’t effect unemployment eligibility. What I’m hung up on, is if I took the furlough, I’d be waiting and hoping for a call back, but once you’ve been furloughed 2 years, you lose the furloughed status and won’t be called back either way. With my lack of seniority, and the likelihood of many people being on that list ahead of me, most people are saying they’d take the buyout in my position, but until i know how many people take a buyout over a furlough, it becomes just a guessing game on what the best course would be. This is a great paying job and there’s nothing comparable in my area. I really was ecstatic to get it, knowing it would be a way to give my family a good life. I suppose it’s worth noting the buyout won’t restrict being eligible for hiring in the likely distant future. I know 25k isn’t much money, but it’s better than leaving empty handed. This is all new info to me, and I’d just like to hear opinions.

1ihs8ym,Burnt out IT Internal Audit. No idea what roads to take outside of GRC.,"Title says it all, been an Internal IT Auditor for almost 6 years now and really wanting to make a change. The only problem is I have no idea what routes to take other than GRC, which I'm not against. 

Realistically I wanted to get back into IT vs. compliance and regulatory work. The company I'm employed by is publicly traded, so about 85% of my annual work is SOX (Walkthroughs, SOX testing for interim and Roll-forward.) and maybe 10-15% Internal Audits and SOX readiness (which I feel like I struggle with since we spend little time on it in my department.).

I'm just getting completely burnt out of this field, its incredibly taxing especially dealing with an unorganized external auditor like ours, EY. This year was just a nightmare of them not being able to make up their minds, then changing what they told us to do multiple times etc. 

To make matters worse, I felt like I was on track to become a Sr. Auditor for my group but I have a bad feeling I wont. I feel like I'm stagnating in this department because management has 0 time to talk to anyone or help out (outside of their taxing job duties, literally in meetings most of every day.).

I just mentally feel defeated because the tech industry seems so bad right now, but audit work is plentiful and I just don't want to get my CISA and stay in this career path my entire life. This was also my first job outside of gradating undergrad. My internship before was more along the lines of IT Project Management work.

Honestly, where I struggle is so many meetings with PM or Audit work having ADHD. I find it like pulling teeth for me to be really comprehending what is being said because I'm burnt out of this job and career path I'm afraid. 

It's draining my soul now even outside of work, even my hobbies haven't felt fun lately due to all the work stress.

1ihs2xc,30 and lost,"Hey everyone, I'm going to try to make this as short as I can. I could desperately use some college/career guidance.

I made some pretty dumb mistakes from age 17 to 23. To this day, I still feel those mistakes haunting me. I moved out of my family's house at 18 and they basically cut me off. Understandable. I was a mess. I ended up finally moving back home at 23, and worked my butt off for a few years to save money and attend a community college. 

My family convinced me to pursue Dental Hygiene. I spent 2 years taking all of the pre-requisite courses. I applied to the program and got accepted. Little did I know what I was getting myself into. By the time I started the program, I was slowly running out of money. I had bills to pay, and I was the only student in the program with a job. Every work shift felt like such an inconvenience to my studies. Between work, school, the amount of hours a day I needed to study and complete school work, and bills... I was in severe stress.

After the 2nd semester, I found out that I got below a C in one of the classes, which is considered failing. I failed out of the entire program. I was severely depressed and embarrassed about it for a while. 

It's been a over 1 year since all of that happened, but I still have this feeling of being a complete failure over my head. But I did pay all of my credit card debt and car loan off during this time. So that I wouldn't need to stress about any major bills if I did go back to school again. 

There were so many things I disliked about the Dental Hygiene program. It was extremely demanding. There were many days I couldn't even afford to sleep at all. It felt like a 24/7 job. I hated clinical the most. I absolutely hated sitting in a rolling chair for hours with scrubs, gloves, masks, safety goggles, a shield, and a gown on. I'm really trying to view this failure as a blessing in disguise.

Does anyone have any suggestions on what to go back to a community college for? Or maybe a trade? Finding a career path that sparks my interest and pays well is so difficult. Thanks in advance!

I finally received a message yesterday from a representative of CVS Health, offering me an interview with a Mrs. Katerina Guerraz, via Teams for a data entry position. I thought it was strange, considering my only application for a job of that title was through a company called Ascend. I texted the woman back for further contact info/details twice now and have not heard back, so I set up Teams and messaged Mrs. Guerraz. 

She has been incredibly brief, not in an unprofessional way but just with a little less...fluff? I guess? Than most employers tend to use. 

I had an issue before with being offered a job, with a just enough of a nonsensical backstory to sound real. I was sent a 7K check for an entire office set up, but it felt weird to me so I called the originating bank the check came from and mine and it was indeed fraudulent. And this was even after I looked through LinkedIn and FOUND HER. It all looked legit to me, even to my fiancé.

I'm just scared, you guys. I feel I'm trying to do everything I can to be sure, but I'm still nervous. Katerina Guerraz? That's the current Executive Vice President of CVS and Chief Operating Officer of Aetna. I found her on linkedin. Surely she wouldn't be directly conducting interviews herself, right? I even tried to get in touch with CVS HR to try to verify that the interview offer was legit and got looped around and around by their automatic phone thing.

1ihpg1m,"I know what I want but am very lost, can anyone help?","Hello everyone, I am 18 years old and currently work at Costco. I didn’t immediately try and go to college after high school because I have no clue what I specifically want to do and don’t want to waste tons of money if i’m not sure yet. I really do want to enroll soon though so I don’t get far behind. At Costco i’m in merchandising and before that I worked in a restaurant, at my previous job I was going to be a manager but left right before since Costco paid better. At Costco I will be doing a leadership training role that’s 6 weeks long and hopefully become a backup supervisor afterwards. 

One thing I for sure know is that I want to be in a management or leadership role, it has always stuck out to me and I know the type of leader I can be. Another thing i’ve really enjoyed with my current experience is being able to see the products of my labor and make a real difference. Especially when i’m usually the first to be asked to be there when something big is coming like whether that be showing up early to get the restaurant ready for a visit at my last job or the same thing at Costco when our VP or whoever comes and walks the store. Some of my interest are Cars and anything with an engine (would not want to be a mechanic though), most things technology, things that involve working with my hands and I like operating things. To explain operating things, I really want to be a forklift driver at my current job, and will soon be certified and also trained on our other equipment (EPJ, scissor lift). I always see the construction guys who are heavy equipment operators and think that is the coolest thing ever lol. Sadly a lot of these jobs go against being in management but definitely looks fun. 

With all my interest I just wanna specialize and be the best at something, I do that with literally anything I do. I’d also like to make a lot of money (duh we all do), that’s the only real thing taking me out of Costco because it takes a long time to get to six figures and you don’t get too deep into them once you are there. I’d also like to have a good work life balance and not have to do crazy overtime every week (some weeks is fine, I do like working honestly) and that’s another reason I wouldn’t just go into Costco management because they are usually expected to be working crazy hours. 

What sorts of jobs or degrees would you guys suggest looking into? The only thing i’ve thought of so far is something engineering or business management but haven’t actually sat down and thought about it.

1ihot2f,I spoke with my managers today about possibly switching supervisors and got some feedback…since when is it bad to question everything?,"


I work in financial aid and have been with this new job since September last yr. I know I’m still new and have a lot of growing to do but have noticed a few things with my supervisor. I’ve worked in FA before & my last supervisor was typically pretty spot on when I had questions. With this new job, the supervisor seems approachable and doesn’t seem like she micromanages, which might be part of the company culture. However, there’s been a few instances where she redirects me and gives me incorrect info & sometimes I need to correct her/tell her the info she gave me was wrong based on what another team said etc. 

And unfortunately, this has affected my metrics in some cases, which upsets me. Ofc I’ve affected my metrics at times with my own mistakes, it hits differently when it comes from your boss. And sometimes I’m trying to explain something & it’s as if she doesn’t get me, like the info she’s giving seems unnecessary at times because she’s not grasping exactly where I am or what I’m trying to convey. Again, people make mistakes but this feels like the most I’ve dealt with when it comes to working w/ someone in charge. 

I pretty much relayed this to management today *professionally* and even if I get swapped, Im worried it’s a case of assuming the grass is greener… They seemed to welcome my feedback/thanked me and when I was saying my concerns, the mgr said that my supervisor has asked her why I question everything. That is her boss after all and the mgr backed me up, telling her that I’m not questioning & in fact I want clarification. I just don’t get how it’s bad to question everything, my dad always says I should.  They’re moving people around b/c of recent promotions & wanted feedback from everyone, I’m worried this possible transition won’t solve my problems…thoughts?",Dsg1695,1,1.0,1,1738694146,2025-02-04 18:35:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihot2f/i_spoke_with_my_managers_today_about_possibly/,2,2025
1ihoft2,Need opinions on wife quitting her job for mental health,"I’ll try to keep it short,

My perfect wife is miserable due to her job.  I try to make weekends and evenings worth while but it just doesn’t always add up. 

She commutes an hour each way on I4 (“Die4”) in Florida where she works a somewhat dead end job that requires very little thought.  Meaning it does little to forward her skills or resume.  She’s been applying to jobs for over a year now with little luck.  She’s revised her resume multiple times now but it’s just a pretty barren landscape for her job field.

Now, if she left said job, she’d have all day to work on skills that would improve her chances and apply to far more jobs.  Plus save us time for the weekends by picking up chores I normally do when I get home.  Most importantly here is that I technically make enough to support both of us, but it would be very tight.

So, the choice is no job, no saving, but all the time to apply, train, and rebuild her mental state.

Or, keep working through this misery until she’s a soulless husk but finds a direct replacement job somewhere else.

One contingency we’ve agreed on is that she’ll eventually need to concede and find a job somewhere, even if it’s minimum wage.

However i don't know what i actualy want to do. And nothing really appeals to me. On one hand i feel like i need thé most chaotic Dynamic job to actualy feel something. But no clue what type of job that would be. And sometimes i just think give me a monotonous job we're i atleast can work all the time and don't have to invent like a task to do.

So like how did you know what you wanted to do? Any advice?

1iho6o6,I’m a temp admin being overlooked and I don’t care about my job anymore please help,"I’m a temp admin assistant who was originally supposed to work for just one day. I did well, and because the person I was covering kept extending their sick leave, I’ve been here for five months.

For the first 3-4 months, I worked hard—staying late, finishing tasks early, and asking to take on more. But now, my morale has dropped from 100 to 10. I’m behind on tasks, stressed, and frustrated because I usually take pride in my work and want to make a good impression.

Two things have ruined my motivation:

Exclusion from the Christmas event: After three months, I thought I’d be invited, but I wasn’t. My manager said they’d explain, but they never did. That hurt, though I moved on after a week.

Uncertainty around my job: When the person I’m covering said they were coming back, my manager cut my hours down to one day a week, with me handling mail while they worked from home. I accepted it because I knew I was temporary. But then, the person returned for one day, resigned, and left. I suggested to my manager that the agency could be flexible with pricing if they wanted me long-term, but I was told to apply online. That felt insulting, especially since I’ve worked hard and done my job well.

Now, I hear them discussing all the applications they’re getting, which feels like a slap in the face. I don’t feel like I’m part of the team, despite being here for months. My work is piling up, and I’m stressed, but I can’t quit because I need the money and a good reference.

My problem so far is that I have received about 10 minutes of job training in the past week. On top of that, the IT department has been extremely slow with getting me access to required files and accounts set up. I have basically sat at my desk for a week with nothing to do. Nobody seems to want to teach me anything, and I feel like more of a burden than an asset. The other project managers have been at the company for 3+ years and do not seem interested in showing me how things are done.

Fast forward a few days and I had a 45 minute interview with the hiring manager. The first 30 mins went great, we had an excellent rapport and even told me they’d be putting me through to the final interview stage. After this announcement, I became a bit giddy and took my eye off the ball. I started blabbering on too much, answering questions poorly and I could see the hiring managers aura take a slight turn for the worse. They then ended when my time was up saying my recruiter would be in touch. 

It’s been a couple of days and I’ve not heard anything back so far. Should I follow up with my recruiter or wait for them to contact me with final interview details? I know final interview plans probably take longer but they were very keen before it seemed.

This is annoying as I think it’s probably knocked me down the pecking order somewhat.

My friend is planning to switch jobs and wants to tweak his resume a bit. He has a total work experience of 2.5 years, with 6 months in DevOps and the rest in web development. However, he plans to claim that he has 1.5 years of DevOps experience instead of just 6 months.

He's wondering—how risky is this? Can HR or hiring managers find out that he’s lying? Do companies actually verify this kind of experience during background checks, or is it mostly based on interviews and technical assessments?

1ihlwqp,Need Help Negotiating Salary After Being Offered a New Position with Same Pay,"I’m hoping to get some advice on negotiating salary in a situation that’s a bit tricky. I’ve been offered a new position within my current team, and the responsibilities align more with my interests and career goals. I’m really excited about the opportunity, and I love my team and the organization I work for, so I definitely don’t want to leave.

However, there’s a catch: the job code for the new position is the same as my current role, so the salary they’re offering is the same as my current pay. I was under the impression that this would be a promotion with a salary bump, as it was inferred by my boss during discussions, but HR has now made the offer, and it’s at the same salary level.

While I could technically move to another organization and do the same job for more money, I’m hesitant to take that risk in today’s economy, especially when I truly love the work I do and the team I work with. The issue is, I also feel that the new role and responsibilities should come with a pay increase that reflects the added value.

My question is: how can I negotiate a salary increase without declining the role? I’m not looking to leave the company, but I do want to make sure I’m being compensated fairly for the new responsibilities. The organization is large and tends to go by the book, so I’m a little unsure of the best way to approach this conversation with HR.

Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated! I need to write up a response to the offer ASAP.",under-a-crescentmoon,1,1.0,0,1738687162,2025-02-04 16:39:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihlwqp/need_help_negotiating_salary_after_being_offered/,2,2025
1ihlt14,"r/ I moved to another country for a better life opportunity but my career took a big hit, now I don't know if I want to do my job or change it. I am 30 years old, already had a major change in my over a year and don't know if I should try another swing or just stay and hope it'll get better in time","I don't know what to do with my life. I recently moved to another country and changed my entire life because I hated living in my home country. From politics to economy, from social problems to opportunities, everything was stressful, hopeless and depressing, so I took a big swing, risked everything and moved out. Things weren't perfect but I felt like a huge weight lifted on my shoulders, I felt so much happier and lighter. I'm still trying to figure out life in here but I also started to feel I don't know what I'm doing and if what I'm doing will be enough or am I on the right track.  
For to move out I had to leave my career that I loved and start from the beginning in the country I moved (Canada). Now I am doing a job I don't like, under a manager who is way more disqualified than me. I used to be an Event Manager, and I always had certain creativity and leadership in everything I did. Now in this position, I have no creative nor operational control. I feel stuck, worthless and kind of feel like I'm getting rusty. My brain is shutting off. I'm afraid by the time I land I good job (hopefully, but maybe never?) I'll be useless. I'm missing the industry and developments and connections.  
I am 30. And I actually don't even know if I want to continue to be in this industry. Yes, I loved my job very very much. I still love what I used to do, but I feel like everything is different in here and it's too late to start over, I already missed everything and it seems like I'm going nowhere. I don't have the same energy. I have a certain idea what I want to do and where I want to be but no matter what I do, I don't seem to be getting any closer.  
I have been thinking of changing careers. I already changed my life and I'm already at the bottom, so it seems like something I can do. I have been searching of the things I would want to do, but all the stuff I would want to do seems like stuff I cannot to, and all things I can do are the things I don't want to do.  
I love creative jobs, but I don't have creativity, I don't have good attention span, I am easily distracted. I don't have the discipline and and passion to dive in, figure it out, practice and practice. I have been looking at Video/film editing as well as VFX. I can see myself doing these jobs and I can see myself enjoying. But I can't see myself getting there, because the work and the dedication is scaring me, I feel like if I commit to either of it, I'll disappoint myself. The lack of creativity, discipline and passion scares me to start.  
I've also been looking at UI/UX. I don't have much information about it but it also seems like something I can do. Doesn't seem very complicated to me and I don't have to be uber creative. I kinda understand how these kind of things works, I am not bad at internet, social media, design and everything in between.  
I kinda want to be able to create something, touch something, change something in someone's life and affect them in a good way. That's what I loved about evet management. I loved how people seem to enjoy being there, at the event I spent maybe months of creating. Left with a smile on their face. I also loved working at a fast-paced environment. I am not a very social person but when it comes to my work, I can be there and I actually enjoy it. I miss it. I think my event management days are in the past as I don't know the event scene in this city and I can't seem to be finding even part-time or volunteering jobs that would help me connect and network. So that's why I feel like I need to start from somewhere else that I don't need to have any attachment or to any venue, city, setting, or history. Somewhere I can just use my knowledge and skill, but still be a little creative in my own bubble. It wouldn't hurt (would be absolutely amazing) if it is something I can do remotely since I love traveling so much. And honestly, settling down in a city or country seems a little claustrophobic and not ideal to me at this moment in my life. I want to be able to travel but also experience life in many places.

And yes, I kind of tried travel management. I was a project manager at a travel and events company which planned and produced tailored events for corporate, which included their travel management as well for incentive travel purposes, so I had a taste of that, which was actually really fun. But again, in another country setting, it is close to impossible to start somewhere as I don't know close to nothing about this country and my experience in another country (and my age) doesn't align with what's needed here.

With everything in mind, I need some assistance since I am stuck. I think I need people who work on these or similar jobs to give me some intel or say ""do"" or ""don't"". Or I don't know. I should be talking these with my friends and therapist, honestly, but I don't want to hear ""you got this""s. No, I am not, I haven't got this, I am very much stuck and I need guidance not pretty words.  It feels awful to be stuck at 30+ years old when you made such a big move in your life and career and feel like finally going somewhere, but it doesn't take you anywhere. Now what? I feel like the fish in the plastic bag in Finding Nemo.  
If you are working in these industries, please pitch in. I'd like to hear from you.",Sweet_Situation1706,1,1.0,1,1738686908,2025-02-04 16:35:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihlt14/r_i_moved_to_another_country_for_a_better_life/,2,2025
1ihkz0x,How to talk about current Social Media/Digital Marketing position with future employers?,"Hi all! I am currently 6 months into a 10 month social media marketing internship. This is not my first internship and I am incredibly lucky because I’ve had amazing experiences with other companies. This internship however is…not great. I’ve had zero support or oversight. I feel like I was not set up to succeed. I’ve felt completely lost for 6 months and have simply tried my best while being in completely over my head.

We are a B2B company with no content of our own products to market, so I basically had to work with nothing. I’m not trying to play victim, this is just setting up the question I’m here to ask: how should I explain this job experience? I’m graduating in May so I want to begin sending in job applications for entry-level positions, but I don’t know what to do with work I’m not proud of/feel like it doesn’t reflected me. I’m afraid to promote anything I did at this job because I’m scared they’ll look at the accounts/website and see content that doesn’t reflect my skills/ability.

I obviously don’t want to speak negatively about my former employer during an interview, but I feel like this position is too relevant to leave off of my work history completely.

1ihkfph,Is your mentorship still serving you—or is it time to move on?,"Mentorship is meant to support your growth, but not every mentorship relationship is built to last. As your goals evolve, a once-valuable mentor may no longer align with your career direction. Staying in a mentorship that isn’t working can hold you back, create frustration, & even hinder your ability to seek new guidance that better fits your needs.

Knowing when to walk away isn’t a sign of failure—it’s a sign of growth. Just as mentorship begins with intention, ending a mentorship should be a thoughtful & respectful process.

**📌 Signs It’s Time to Walk Away:**

✔️ **Misaligned Goals:** Your mentor’s expertise no longer aligns with where you’re headed in your career or personal development.

✔️ **Lack of Engagement:** If your mentor has become unresponsive, disinterested, or no longer invests time in your growth, the relationship may have run its course.

✔️ **Toxic Dynamics:** If the mentorship feels draining, overly critical, or unproductive, it’s worth reevaluating whether it’s still a positive influence.

✔️ **You’ve Outgrown the Relationship:** If you find that you’re no longer gaining new insights or growth from the mentorship, it may be time to seek fresh perspectives.

✔️ **The Relationship Feels One-Sided:** A great mentorship should involve mutual respect & engagement. If you’re always chasing after your mentor for advice or feel undervalued, it might be time to move on.

**How to End It Gracefully:**

✔️ **Express Gratitude for Their Time and Guidance:** Acknowledge their role in your journey & how their support has helped you grow.

✔️ **Be Honest About Why the Mentorship is No Longer a Fit:** Whether your goals have changed or you need a different kind of guidance, transparency ensures clarity & respect.

✔️ **Leave the Door Open for Future Collaborations:** Ending a mentorship doesn’t mean cutting ties—keep the relationship positive in case your paths cross again.

✔️ **Keep It Professional and Respectful:** If the conversation feels difficult, focus on appreciation rather than critique. Frame it as a natural transition rather than a rejection.

**Why It Matters:**

Mentorship is about evolution, not obligation. Walking away from a mentorship that no longer serves you allows you to seek new perspectives, continue your growth, & make space for the right guidance at the right time. Holding onto a mentorship out of loyalty or fear of change can limit your opportunities. Knowing when to move on—& doing so respectfully—ensures that both you &your mentor can continue growing in ways that make sense for your respective journeys.

**Summary:**

Walking away from a mentorship isn’t failure—it’s a necessary step in your growth. The best mentorships evolve over time, & when they no longer align with your path, it’s okay to move on. By recognizing the signs, ending the relationship with gratitude, & leaving the door open for future collaboration, you ensure a smooth & professional transition. Don’t let outdated mentorships hold you back—embrace change & keep growing.

1ihkcok,I finally stood up to my coworkers yesterday in a professional way.. but I still want nothing to do with them?,"I (26f) work in an office and 2 of the women tend to be temperamental. They're 50+ and very cliquey, and are often not invited to work outings because of this. Since starting 2 years ago, I have really made an effort with them and have tried to help them out and be as nice as possible. I'm a people pleaser and have let a lot of their behavior go to ""keep the peace,"" but it sticks and has built up over the years.

The issue is that they have a habit of snapping at me, like changing their tone or literally raising their voices at me. It has happened multiple times now, and 2x in the past month when I was asking clarifying questions about work related issues. It happened again yesterday and I finally went to them and basically said it needs to stop, it's not appropriate, and I don't appreciate it. One apologized, the other just sat there. 

The one that apologized came up to me this morning to get a better understanding of how her behavior affected me, **which I really appreciate**. However, she kept making excuses for every instance I brought up. She said she didn't want there to be any tension, and I agreed, just saying there wouldn't be and I accepted the apology. She did say she was sorry and that she didn't realize she had been doing it.

I told her in return that I never intend to cause issues and I'm always open to feedback. She replied and said her and the other woman were sometimes unsure about my moods, which is very fair. I never really stood up for myself prior to this, so I would let things get to me and my mood until it ruined my entire day. That vibe can definitely be felt, and that is my fault. I've worked on this for the past couple of months because I noticed it as well (also why I started the whole sticking up for myself thing). 

However, at the end, she just kept saying she didn't want tension or issues in the office and I agree and just said ""there isn't and won't be"". I mentioned that it had gotten to a point where I feel as though it might be best for me to keep to myself. She didn't seem happy about that and took off. As she was walking away I told her I would work on my behavior though. 

Is it okay to keep my distance from these two moving forward? On top of the moments of disrespect, they never ask me about myself, they just talk about themselves and that's sort of off putting as well. I want to remain as professional as possible, but I also want nothing to do with them outside of work.

Is this super unprofessional? I'm trying to grow and be more professional. I'm not used to interpersonal issues in the workplace and this entire thing has me feeling like a failure.

1ihkcgk,Would you rather relocate to a very HCOL city for a dream job or stay in LCOL city you love for a job that’s made you hate your life?,"For context: I got a job offer for a pretty unique role at a company I’m excited about and would represent a career pivot I’ve been working towards for years. I don’t think this type of ideal opportunity will come around again. There are similar types of jobs but may not be in industries or companies I’m passionate about. It was advertised as a remote role but now is mandated to be on site hybrid. However it’s in a very HCOL city and my salary, although increased, will not be able to support myself and my partner (plus dog, no human kids) without reducing our quality of life. 

We currently live in a LCOL city and own a townhome with a low mortgage in neighborhood we love. We also have family very close by and love this city. We feel safe and secure but also can feel stagnant at times but can see ourselves settling down and having kids in the next ~5 years. My current job pays very well and is remote, although it’s impacted my mental health to the point where I had to take medical leave (which honestly saved my life). I’ve tried to view this purely as a job that just pays the bills and I can take advantage of the benefits but it’s soul sucking. 

Would you take the risk (high risk, potentially high reward) and relocate, or stay where you are and continue building your life, accepting that you need to change your perspective on work or just settle for a similar job (that may or may not come to fruition)?

1ihix0o,"""Employers care about skills, not tools"" is the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard","Worked 3 years as a Data Analyst and have university master business degree.  
Proficient in Python (not just dabbling) SQL, SPSS and data visualization using Highcharts (which is a JavaScript framework).  
I basically had to create every chart requested by project managers which they needed for client deliverables.  
Unfortunately for me, which I wish I knew, and would have changed jobs sooner, is that we didn't work with popular BI/data viz tools like Power BI or Tableau.

Have been doing a lot off applications the past months.  
After I explain my role and mention dataviz, the first thing they ask is almost always do you have experience with Power BI/ have you worked with Tableau? I say no of course, and their interest fades. Which I get.

I did the 50 hour Data Analyst in Power BI career track which is hands-on exercises in PBI Desktop in each chapter, and a lot of stuff was familiar for me, like data modelling, chart types, which chart to use when etc.  
As my job entailed cleaning and transforming raw data into clean data and dataviz.

But because I didn't use that specific tool in my job, recruiters and hiring managers keep rejecting me, often don't even get to the first stage after a phone call. They literally say we are looking for someone with hands-on experience with Power BI. Or Tableau.

So yeah, recruiters care about tools, not skills.  
They didn't give a shit about my 3 years of data(viz) skill.

I would probably have had a job if I had worked for 1 year or 2 years solely with Power BI, and no Python or SQL.  
Because many jobs require mainly only Power BI and then some SQL which you can learn easy and other stuff is more of a plus a lot of the times.

The reason this upsets me is because if I could have worked 2 years as Power BI analyst and could have gotten a fulltime freelance or payroll job by now as Data Analyst/Power BI analyst.

A lot of Data Analyst roles have Power BI as required experience.",Business-Age3649,73,0.949999988079071,60,1738679427,2025-02-04 14:30:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ihix0o/employers_care_about_skills_not_tools_is_the/,2,2025

1ihh1qg,Seeking Job Change alongside Graduate School - Scheduling Conflicts,"I find myself in a complicated situation in my career. I have a BA in Sociology and currently am in my third year working at a Charter high school as an administrator/teacher. I work here largely through strong networking; my HS teacher became the principal and hired me on in 2022 as as Admin assistant. At first, his philosophy and style of leadership worked amazingly for me. The money isn't great, but it's been steady and has increased 6k since I started (it has likely hit it's ceiling without more credentials). That said, I've grown to be very unhappy in the workplace between poor leadership, inefficient pay, and generally being unhappy in the education. I would like to find other work, but as many of you know, this is difficult to do especially with my undergraduate degree and work experience.

The good news is, I've been admitted into a graduate program at a nearby university for Mental health counseling. This is exactly what I want to do and am looking forward to starting school in August. During the interview, the director explained that the newness of the program and quantity of faculty mean there is really no room for part time students in the cohort. worse, that because of the need to see clients for internship and possibly other reasons (so year 1 or year 2) she would like to potentially schedule two class in a day (starting at 2pm) to accommodate.

I need full time work that will provide the flexibility I need to do that, and my current workplace. despite my frustrations, likely will support me in that. I live a 30 minute drive from the school and am likely moving a bit closer this summer. I want new work and now I don't even know if I could find work that pays similarly and will give me that flexibility for school.

I am not sure what sort of advice I am seeking. The truth I know is that too many large (expensive ) events are happening in my life at once this year (I am also getting married in December). How would some of you handle this?

I'm a medical student at a school that doesn't offer research or statistics courses for students who want to pursue research, publishing, and data analysis. I'm particularly passionate about the intersection of medicine, data, programming, and AI. However, I don't enjoy using Excel or Power BI—my preferred tools are Python, SQL, R, and R Shiny.

I'm looking for advice on a few things:

How can I learn medical research methodologies, including systematic reviews and meta-analysis, on my own?
I want to deepen my knowledge in these areas for potential publishing in medical journals.

What steps should I take to support myself financially by working as a freelance data analyst?
I know I need to build a skillset that aligns with both research and data analysis, but I’m unsure how to blend medical knowledge with strong data skills.

How can I get started as a freelance data analyst, especially using Python, SQL, and R Shiny?
What platforms or types of projects should I target, and what additional statistical skills should I focus on to improve my freelance opportunities while studying?

I'm hoping to hear from others who might have gone through something similar or have advice on balancing a career in both medical research and freelance data analysis. Any recommendations for resources, courses, or strategies would be greatly appreciated!

1ihfzp3,I’m scared my ex-manager will lie about my performance,"Hi everyone,

I worked for 2 years in a big bank (my first job) where the environment was very high-pressure and stressful. I decided to leave for a better opportunity and a once in a lifetime graduate programme acceptance.

My manager and the manager above him really did not take it well and didn’t let me resign for two whole days of meetings and basically guilt-tripping. I remained firm and professional, repeating my reasons and thanking them for everything. The senior guy even tried to offer me a mid-year bonus to stay.

Anyways, 2 years later I’m going through interviews for a really big company and a very big role. They asked for a reference from my former manager specifically (mentioned him by name). I tried to contact him through email and whatsapp but he’s ignoring me. I told the recruiter I couldn’t reach him and the recruiter (after some back and forth) said the hiring by manager knows my ex-manager well and will probably contact him directly for an opinion. 

This whole experience has been…overwhelming. On one hand, I really don’t understand how my manager could STILL be upset at me 2 years later when I was an analyst and he is a senior director. It seems a bit immature. Given that, do you think he’ll tell the truth to the hiring manager that I was a valuable employee? (as he told me when I was leaving!). 

Is there anything I can/should do if he lies, not just for this process but for the future? I have factual info about my rankings and even the mid-year bonus thing to convince me to stay! The way that they did it, I’ll for sure know if he said good or bad things…it’s a very small market and everyone knows each other.

1ihckll,Should I Stay at a Retail Telecom Job or Switch to an IT Help Desk for Better Pay and Future Prospects? (Include TL;DR),"Hey r/careeradvice, I could really use some outside opinions about a career crossroads I’m facing.
Background:
	•	I just started working at a retail telecom store (think phone and plan sales), earning $12/hour for the first six months and then $10/hour plus commission after that. I’ve only been here for four days, but the manager seems super invested in me. He’s hinted I could become an assistant manager because my coworkers don’t seem to care much about the job. The store, however, feels a bit unstable—high turnover, vague promises, and I’m not sure if it’s going to lead me anywhere long term. I can walk there since it’s less than a mile away (I have no car yet).
	•	On the other hand, I got an offer from a company about 9 miles away for an IT help desk role paying $20/hour, guaranteed. It’s a night/overnight shift, so I’d likely have to Uber until I can buy a small motorcycle (looking at a Honda Grom). The commute is inconvenient at first, but that paycheck is hard to ignore. Plus, I want to break into cybersecurity or some kind of remote-friendly tech career in the near future. This help desk gig seems more aligned with that goal.
My Goal:
	•	Ultimately, I want to become a digital nomad—travel around and work remotely in cybersecurity or another tech field.
	•	I also want to afford the small motorcycle ASAP (I can probably save faster with the higher hourly wage).
	•	But I feel a bit guilty leaving the retail job after only four days, especially when the manager is counting on me.
Questions:
	1	Is it worth sticking around the retail telecom store longer just because the manager believes in me, or should I jump ship and take the IT help desk role to move toward my digital nomad goals faster?
	2	How would you weigh the short commute and potential commissions at the retail job versus a higher flat rate but longer commute with Uber expenses until I get the bike?
	3	If you’ve made a similar leap from retail to tech, any tips on how to handle the transition or resignation?
TL;DR: Retail phone sales job for $12/hour now ($10 plus commission later), short commute, and a manager who wants me as an assistant manager—vs.—an IT help desk gig paying $20/hour but 9 miles away and requiring a rideshare until I buy a motorcycle. My dream is to work in cybersecurity as a digital nomad. Should I bail on the new retail gig or give it a chance?

So, something that I really enjoy doing is working on vehicles and I have become quite knowledgeable, (especially around classic cars/trucks). But I cant get a job working at a shop and I would like to start making a passive income that could at least help pay some bills. 

I would love to create a channel like Vice Grip Garage, who I've been watching for years now, in the hopes of making a career out of it. 

But the issue is, I have $200 left to my name. I own a crappy hand-me down digital camera and and old pickup that needs a lot of work. So, do I go all in and start a channel uploading hopefully at least 2 videos a month in hopes I gain some traction, or keep waiting for aYouTube?

I want to flat out quit, but every post says to have something lined up before I do, which I don't. I genuinely don't think I want anything lined up, at least not immediately. 

I'm suicidal every day. Engineering job, pays 6 figures, seems like the dream right? I'm stressed constantly, and can't fall asleep, and when I do I don't want to wake up. Anxiety and panic attacks almost daily. I'm sure others would feel lucky to have the job I do, which is one of the things that convinces me to stay.

It feels like I actually have to attempt suicide to justify quitting, and anything less than that seems like I haven't toughed it out enough.

I have a healthy emergency fund/savings in the 175k ballpark, plus other investment portfolios. Mortgage is only about 1500/month since I've been paying it down aggressively and recast a few times. Wife works and brings in about 80k annually.  I think we'd be fine for a while, but I'm not sure if I'll ever feel like I'll have enough to justify quitting short of winning the lottery. It feels like I'll never find a job again with how people make this job market seem, and the money would eventually run out. I keep telling myself ""just a few more paychecks"" to convince myself to keep going, but it's been over a year now. I feel like I'm giving up the last bit of the prime years of my life (about to turn 32).

I guess I just want someone to tell me it's ok to quit without something lined up. I've been in counseling almost weekly for about a year now. It even seems like even my therapist thinks I should quit without directly telling me to do so.

Kicker here is we think we may have a baby on the way. It's still very early. Part of me feels even more trapped. Part of me wants to enjoy some last moments of freedom before a baby and quit asap, but once again I think about the money and let that government my life.

1ih9cu2,I have shiny object syndrome (help),"Hey everyone,

I need some honest advice. I feel like I’m stuck in a loop—getting obsessed with something, making real progress, and then abandoning it for the next thing. I’m 29 (M) and while I’ve gained a ton of skills and experiences, I feel like I’m wasting my potential by constantly switching paths.

My Pattern
I have an obsessive work ethic—when I get into something, I go all in and dedicate every second to it. But once the initial excitement fades and progress slows, I move on to something else. I recently found out this is called Shiny Object Syndrome, and I want to fix it. I know that long-term success comes from consistency, but I struggle to stick to one thing for years.

My Background

• High school: Didn't do much.

• University: Studied architecture (hated it), took 8 years to finish because I kept getting into different passions—photography, real estate, and sports.

• Sports: Discovered my university had a karate program, trained obsessively for 4 years, became 2nd place nationally in my weight class, and even earned a scholarship. But I didn’t see a career in it, so I quit after graduation.

• Business: Found a real estate mentor in a famous franchise in my country (like REMAX or Century 21 in the US), became the top real estate agent in my office, but then left because of COVID lockdown—when I probably should’ve doubled down and gone bigger. Here, the architecture background actually helped a lot.

• Content Creation: After leaving the real estate job during COVID lockdown, I identified a trend with short-form content creation. So for 2 years, I dedicated myself full-time to TikTok. At one point, I made 4 videos a day, reached 215k followers, had many viral videos, millions of likes, and a couple of brand deals (but didn’t make enough to live 100% off content creation).

• Digital Marketing: Studied 2 certifications (6 months each), one in UX design and the other in digital marketing, got some small jobs around it, and then pivoted again.

• Freelancing: After leaving the real estate job during COVID lockdown, I identified a trend with short-form content creation. So for 2 years, I dedicated myself full-time to TikTok. At one point, I made 4 videos a day, reached 215k followers, had many viral videos, millions of likes, and a couple of brand deals (but didn’t make enough to live 100% off content creation).

• My life now: Discovered free sailing courses in my city, became obsessed, started taking more and more courses, and I am now a sailing instructor and yacht captain (still not in big yachts, but boats up to 24 meters). This has allowed me to visit many beautiful places. The downside is the long shifts and some grumpy clients. Overall, it's a good experience, but I feel the same pattern creeping in again, making me want to look for the next thing.


Why I’m Asking for Advice:

I think I’m addicted to the high of rapid progress—the rush of learning something new and seeing quick results. But as soon as things slow down, I chase the next challenge.

I know I have the drive to be great at something, but I just don’t know what to dedicate myself to long-term. I want to break this cycle before I wake up in 10 years feeling like I wasted my potential.

So here’s my question:
If you were in my shoes, with the skills I’ve already earned, how would you figure out what to commit to? Does any particular job or career path comes to your mind when you think about the skills I already acquired?

This is becoming really frustrating for me. I never know what to say when someone asks me what I do for a living, and when I see some friends building long, successful careers, sometimes I feel left behind.

Any insights would mean a lot—thank you for reading!

1ih9aih,Am I about to lose my job?,"Sorry if this is long, but I'm concerned that I may be let go due to restructuring. Just got this job in July 2024 after working in another job for 10 years. Loved everything about it and kept on getting excellent feedback from my boss. However, things took a turn about a few months ago. 

  
Just a bit of background - this company has their corporate office in the States as an R&D facility, but with 3-4 manufacturing sites in South East Asia. I work in the corporate office, with me and my boss in a small team of 2. There are a few other people in the other sites that are under him. A few months ago, they sold one of their business units to focus on a singular business unit. While I don't have access to this information, my boss has willingly provided this information to me on our 1-on-1's about how the business is currently struggling financially. Throughout the months, he's also sprinkled in things about the company that he doesn't necessarily agree with and how he would do things better. A few months ago, he was open in telling me secretly that he's felt he's being kept out of the loop from his boss on certain business decisions that we need to be aware of, as we are in the area of compliance. He also felt he was being pushed out and believed that the company may be looking to keep me on in place of him, as I would be a cheaper replacement for the role. He also let me know that it's possible that due to the financial struggles, they may look to restructure and potentially let go of us both. I brushed off his concerns and told him to let me know if there is any way I can help outside of our regular job duties and responsibilities. Outside of that, he mentioned that he did not like the way he was being treated and would ""most likely"" be looking for a new role by October.

The next day, we talked again, where he apologized for bringing up those topics, saying it wasn't professional to speak about uncertainty related to the role. We continued to work together and were focused on preparing for an audit that is currently scheduled for 3 weeks from now. 

Today, over a Teams conversation with someone from one of the other sites, he asked me ""is it true you are moving out of \[company name\]?"" instead of responding through chat, I gave him a call to see where he may have heard that from and he said that he basically heard that one person from his team was being contacted with my boss in order to be hired for my exact title position. There is no other individual in the company who has my current position at this time. When I probed further, he mentioned that the person on his team would be in charge of the documentation on our corporate site, even though they would be still be residing overseas. He had the impression that I would be moving on and that I would be onboarding the person on his team. 

At this point, I'm pretty much convinced they are looking to let me go after completion of the audit. There has been no talk of promotions or being able to help in other capacities as of yet. However, through this whole time, I've gotten nothing but great feedback, saying how much of an asset I am and how he's been pushing his boss to get me more involved, because he feels they are underutilizing my talents. We are even due for our bonus, where my boss gave me an evaluation and rated me the highest score that can be ranked. Is there anything I can do at this point? I'm already looking to update my resume and start applying ASAP.

1ih8x7n,Contemplating a career change/how to make myself more competitive for better jobs,"Curious if anybody has any ideas or advice for roles I could transition into based on my job experience, or things I could do to make myself more competitive in the job market. Located in NYC.

I've reached a crossroads in my career and am preparing to leave the film industry. I've worked as an assistant editor for years, but my current company is unstable—major layoffs, possible sale, and increasing workloads, in addition to being expected to start working weekends with questionable potential for overtime. My role has shifted from assistant editing to pure tech support, and the position feels like a dead end. Despite applying elsewhere, I fear landing in the same situation. Many colleagues with a decade in the role have seen no advancement, and the Assistant Editor-to-Editor path seems all but gone. And with all the instability in the industry itself, I fear if I lose this job, it may be months, if not years, until I find work again.

So I'm looking to make a career change, even just for a few years until things calm in the industry, ideally leveraging some of my current skills so I don't have to start completely from square one. I'm open to taking classes, getting licenses or certs, and maybe going back to school for a year, but a fully going back to school for a 4 year program isn't possible for me at the moment. The majority of my work experience is in post production, however I do have motion graphics and animation experience, graphic design experience, tons of photography experience, including a current volunteer position at a publishing house taking product and marketing photos, branded creative work, directing for television, pitching to clients, producing film and photo shoots, customer service, some coding and web design and post-production tech support. Obviously I know I'd be starting over, so I'm not expecting to find the prefect role out of the gate, however, I would like to try to put myself in a position where I could have another remote or mostly remote job again, and I would love a job where I can generally expect to have weekends off. A few things I've been considering:

* Social video editing. This is the most clear trajectory considering I already have post production experience. I just don't have a portfolio with this type of content and of all the editing jobs that could be replaced by AI, I fear this one could be one of the first. 
* Going into advertising/marketing. Since I have so much video editing/design/photography experience I could see myself being a strong candidate for certain marketing roles, especially any type of branded content creation. However, I don't know much about the industry itself, as I've only been in and out as a freelancer, and I don't know what types of educational requirements may be needed for those types of roles.
* Project management. This is an option I'm strongly considering, as I know I can take classes to get a project management certification. Since most of my past experience has involved project management to some degree, I think it could be easy to tailor my resume to fit potential PM positions.  
* Graphic design. I have a few friends who work as brand designers and they say having video editing experience can make you highly competitive. I also know of programs that can teach you design fundamentals in a few months, but I know that having a portfolio with client work increases your strength in the applicant pool, and I don't know how long it would take me to build something competitive enough. 
* Website design/coding/full stack development. This one is a little out of my experience range, but I've had friends who have taken classes in web design or full stack development that got great jobs just a few years after getting their certifications. I've always been interested in learning to code, however, I've heard tech has had some similar issues in terms of industry and job stability. 
* Film marketing/distribution/other non-production related film jobs. Despite being in my industry, I know very little about most of what these positions would entail. 

Again these are only ideas I'm chewing on. Definitely open to suggestions, just hoping to pick a lane to focus on in the next couple months, especially since certain classes and certifications can take a few months to a year to complete.",Puzzled_Top_996,1,1.0,0,1738641259,2025-02-04 03:54:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ih8x7n/contemplating_a_career_changehow_to_make_myself/,2,2025
1ih8a3h,Failing in a new job,"So - long story short. I am failing in my new job which I thought was a fantastic opportunity. I have always been good at my jobs, but in this role, I'm just failing left and right. I am so ashamed, and it gets worse since my boss has started asking what's wrong and if I am ok. I am just not good at pretending, I have always been very honest and straightforward. Somehow in this company - start-up - it feels so dishonest. Like, everyone is trying to be so positive but I can sense the tension behind it. Also, they were quite dishonest about the actual job. F.e., they didn't tell me that this is a newly created team after the previously existing team was laid off in 2023. So, this is the second try for something no one could find a solution before, yet now all eyes are on me. 

My boss put me on the spot in a weekly team meeting where I was supposed to give updates on projects she had handed over to me. I've only been in this job for 2.5 weeks, and I wasn't even added to the relevant team meetings for one of these projects because they're still figuring out their own plan and forgot to add me.

Also, everyone is super young and incredibly self-confident. I feel very isolated and also belittled. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, like a fraud who lied on the resume but I didn't -something just does not click here. I am also very tired and burnt out after several layoffs in my previous company; therefore, I never took vacations and had constant stress. 

I just want to quit, like today. Which is insane given the tough market out there, especially in tech. I feel so defeated, and I know that if I fail in this job, my previous successes and self-confidence will vanish entirely.

I was laid off last year after 5 years of excellent performance reviews. That wasn't great, but it didn't crush my self-esteem. However, the last year of applications, interviews, case studies, and endless time-consuming interview loops - where I always made it to the final round but then did not the job - has been brutal. My self-esteem is about to disappear entirely.

Oh, and this job is a contractor role they hire people as contractors to build a case for a full-time position then. This puts me under enormous pressure as it feels like a 5-month probation period. 

Has anyone ever felt so ashamed in their new job? I am going to work tomorrow with a know in my stomach. It also impacts my personal life now, my new relationship was something so positive that finally entered my life. Now this is also falling apart because I am always super tired, forgetful, stressed and just suddenly not at all in the mood for dating.

1ih7xkf,I know I can at least try to outlast my micromanager jerk boss at our company. Open to any and all tips on how to not let him get under my skin in the meantime?,"I know this is maybe a little weird to ask, but I would really love some advice to help change my mindset.

First, I LOVE my job. I find it fulfilling, challenging, engaging, and overall I have great relationships with the people I work with and have worked my way up the corporate ladder and all that.  But I do not love my new(ish) boss. He’s been hired for about a year and it is very clear he lied about his work experience and really doesn’t know what he’s doing. I think he expected this job to be easy and that he could just show up and boss us all around, and now he’s finding out he actually has to work hard and clearly isn’t cut out for it. He seems totally miserable and bitter and takes it out on his team. Lots of micromanagement, condescension, control issues, just an unpleasant person to interact with. 

My question is, for anyone out there who’s dealt with managers like this and chose to stay and basically attempt to outlast them, what did you do? Tell me about your mindsets, reframing, healthy coping mechanisms, literally any wisdom you’ve got. I’m determined to stay for the long haul if I can, and YES I understand no job is guaranteed and all that but I am truly just here to ask for help in changing/adjusting my mindset on how to handle him in the long-ish term. He gets under my skin a lot, and some days feel worse than others and if anything I get so annoyed and disappointed in myself when I let him get to me.

Recently, a former coworker offered me a new job starting at $100K with no bonuses. I’m struggling to decide if making the switch is the right move.

1ih7952,Generally how long after you don't pass a PIP are you fired?,"Can anyone give any advice on how the termination process works after you've failed a PIP?  
  
I was put on a PIP late last year for low performance. The end of the PIP is fast approaching (e.g. 28 Feb) and I will 100% not pass the PIP. I don't want to stay and am definitely looking at other jobs. However, my job is relatively high paying and I want to be paid the maximum amount possible before I leave.

A few key notes:

* To resign, I need to give 1 month's notice.
* My contract states ""*should \[EMPLOYER\] wish to terminate your employment, we may do so by giving you one month's notice in writing*."" There is precious little information available on what happens AFTER a PIP (probably by design). 
* I can be terminated without notice (and therefore paid up to the date of termination only) if I engage in misconduct, act dishonestly, become unable to comply with any of the conditions of my employment or ***for any other reason justifying termination without notice***.
* I am covered under Australian labour laws. 

I haven't engaged in any misconduct or acted dishonestly, but am a bit worried about their other catch-alls (""for any other reason""). 

I'm thinking of giving my notice 1 day before the PIP is due to end, mostly just to avoid an 'official' termination and in the hope that they don't bother trying to go down the road of termination without notice.

1ih6nda,Need help figuring out a career,"I (24f) have been a long-time lurker on this sub (and on many other career-related subs) because I have never really known how to approach a topic like this, so I apologize in advance if I tend to ramble in this post. (To clarify, I’m located in the US, around the Midwest) 

I will start off by saying that I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression for not ever finishing college at my age. My biggest regret is starting college without a set plan because I thought I would find my purpose there. I still feel quite a bit of shame and embarrassment for being a dropout, and I feel so stupid for going to college without a plan and for being too indecisive. 

Thankfully, I did find an awesome position as an inpatient certified pharmacy tech at a great hospital in my local area. I absolutely love my job, and I have a lot of pride in what I do. This job has been my saving grace after feeling so much shame and disappointment in myself for not ever finishing a degree. However, I still don’t feel satisfied enough because I’d love to have a degree in an advanced role. My goal has always been to go to college and at least get a bachelor’s degree, so I don’t want to give up on my dream of being a college graduate, and a first-gen at that. 

If I were to go back to school, I’d like to preferably stay in healthcare because I’m starting to feel a higher sense of job satisfaction in this field, but I’m open to other fields. The most important things I would seek out of a job is WLB, job flexibility(I’m really starting to like shift work these days, as I work 3x12s on overnights right now), security, a good salary, and growth. I don’t mind doing a mix of hands-on work and menial tasks every so often, but I do enjoy being on my feet and trying to constantly engage my brain, so I don’t think I’d be super open to more mundane tasks (but if the job makes great money, maybe I’d reconsider). I like being a part of a team, but I’m also not a very bubbly, talkative and outgoing person, so I don’t mind working alone either. I’m extremely task-oriented, to the point where I tend to become laser-focused on whatever I’m doing. I’m also starting to become better at multi-tasking and knowing how to prioritize things. I really love knowing that my work is helping others in some way, even if it’s not so direct. I do honestly feel a sense of fulfillment in that. 

My positive qualities: 

- Highly ambitious 
- Very studious/academically-inclined
- Meticulous
- Good at focusing on single tasks for long periods of time
- Good at multitasking & prioritizing things (still improving upon this) 
- Work decently well under pressure (but there are some days when it does get kind of overwhelming)
- Inquisitive & always willing to learn 
- Can work alone or with others
- Enjoy being creative & hands on, but I’d say I have a mix of both left & right brain qualities 

My negative qualities: 

- Not that confident in my own abilities/second-guess myself all the time (hence the reason why I’m chronically indecisive) 
- Anxious at times 
- People-pleasing tendencies 
- Communication can be hard for me due to my more introverted qualities 
- Not the best at math (especially mental math) 
- Not the best at “thinking outside the box”/having more innovative ideas (I can be a bit too literal-minded at times, or I need to be shown how to do something in order to understand it more) 
- A tad bit scatter-brained/forgetful 
- Not the most concise 
- Social awkwardness

Hobbies/interests: 

- Photography 
- Traveling
- Dancing 
- Hanging out with people 
- Reading 
- Listening to music 

Subjects I excelled in:

- Science 
- English 
- Writing
- Art

Subjects I struggled in: 

- Math
- Public speaking 

Career interests I had at one point: 

- Veterinarian 
- Travel agent
- Nat Geo photographer (no joke) 
- Cosmetic chemist 
- Dermatologist, psychiatrist/psychologist
- Accountant

1ih5unp,"24M Can't find a job, should I get a masters abroad?","I've been struggling to find a good full time job ever since I graduated in 2023. I did my bachelors in business administration during Covid and thus wasn't able to network well and get lots of connections during this time. However, the school is a UC so I don't feel my education is particularly lacking. Still have only been able to land part time jobs since I've graduated. Is there something different that I should be doing? I don't live in my college town and never have so am not able to easily go to alumni/networking events on campus and live in a fairly opportunity-less suburb. I live with my parents at home so have been saving some money for continuing education.

Thus, I have been considering doing my masters abroad in either Denmark or Netherlands. I am a European citizen so would be able to get free or heavily reduced tuition (€2500 max). I would be getting an MSc in Information Systems or Data Analytics.

I am between this and getting certifications in information systems (such as A+) and staying here in California. However I am worried about the fact that there are huge tech layoffs and more companies outsourcing the information technology role to other countries. Furthermore, I have not had any luck with getting an entry level role in anything related to the information technology realm and am unsure if I will be able to progress with the amount of competition in the tech industry in California.

I am aware of the significant challenges of moving to another country including completely different systems and requiring the learning of another language. And also the problems with making friends especially in more socially closed countries such as Denmark and Netherlands as well as being away from family.

However still, I am interested in receiving some advice on this.

1ih482a,How do I make myself standout after applying to my dream job?,"I recently applied for a job online that honestly would be a dream job. It's WFH position with a Tech company, so everything is online. I originally applied through Indeed, where I discovered the posting to begin with, but also completed an application online through their website and uploaded my resume and cover letter there as well.
 I really want this job, but it's one if those jobs that has tons of applications so what can I do to stand out? I've received confirmation emails that they got my application, resume and cover letter but it was an auto-response. 
The only contact info listed is for general questions, demo requests, etc. There is nothing for HR or hiring. The information on the hiring page is only the job postings along with the perks of working there, benefits, etc. there is no contact information there either. There is a Meet the Team section, but that lists people like the CEO, COO, CFO, etc and it feels sort of presumptuous to contact any of them since I have only applied and usually someone in the hiring department would contact me first. 
All of that said, is there anything else I can do to stand out so they not only interview but also hire me? I really want this job, but so do tons of other people.  Any advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated.

1ih31b4,Tough Decision,"I started as revenue agent at IRS last spring. I came in at the lowest grade level (pay grade) possible for a revenue agent due to unfortunate timing. I currently make \~50k MCOL. Shortly after being hired, I finished my masters which would have qualified me for a higher grade (roughly 20k difference in salary.) I applied in order to get a grade bump immediately after receiving my diploma, but due to slow hiring processes, I was not able to get through before the new administration came in and set everything on fire.

I am planning to finish my CPA by this spring at which point I would have 1 year experience and be able to get the certification. This would open up some doors for me on the outside, but is useless at the IRS. I feel like I should be able to make 70-80k if I apply to CPA firms in my area with my CPA.

Pretty straight forward choice so far, but the dilemma for me is I generally like my job. It is tolerable, I don't hate life most days. I work 40 hours per week. Never more, never less. I am very concerned that I will really regret letting this go and ending up stuck in a cube 60+ hours per week during busy season. Financially the choice is obvious, I'm just very concerned about my mental health. I am not a go getter. I try to do my job well but I can't see myself really giving a shit about the company or climbing the ladder. I just want good work life balance, tolerable job, decent salary. I can more or less get that at the IRS minus the pay part, but my salary would eventually get to \~100k+. It would just take about 5 years to get there. Important note: I'm 30M, this is a career change for me. If i was early 20's I would absolutely stay. I kind of feel like im playing catchup though.

Lastly, Elon's fork in the road offer is on the table. I am 60-70% confident this is a scam/bait and switch and people will not be paid out til September, but I feel it may be worth rolling the dice in my situation.

Anyone have any thoughts?

1ih2upy,Did I make the right choices? Or should I pivot now?,"Not going to lie, I feel like I've been spiralling about my job and career for the past 1.5 years and it's currently only gone worse. Would appreciate honest and **kind** advice on my situation.

I’m a 29F and currently work at a global professional services firm (think B2B advisory) in London. I recently got promoted and committed to taking on a VP role in London, but I keep wondering if I made the right choice. A year ago, I debated between:

* Going for VP in London (which I chose)
* Applying for an MBA (likely INSEAD or LBS, potentially a US programme)
* Moving to the US with my company (SF office most likely)

My current salary is £100K (\~$127K) and will increase to £110K in 2026 and £120K in 2027, plus potential bonuses + windfall at the end of my mandate in 3 years (keep in mind I'm in London so wouldn't compare these salaries to US ones).

My company *would* have sponsored $70K for an MBA if I had applied last year, but I never went through the process as I got caught up in the promotion process. Now, I worry I’ve missed my window. Lately, I’ve been thinking that I could do the MBA after my VP role, but at that point:

1. I likely wouldn’t get company sponsorship, so the financial burden would be mainly on me
2. I’d be 32, which makes me wonder if I’d be *too old* to break into some careers (e.g., strategy or management consulting).

The biggest thing holding me back from an MBA now is financial security. I have a couple of rental properties with mortgages (rented on AirBnb), so stepping away from work (and my income) makes me a bit nervous. But at the same time, I don’t want to feel like I closed doors that might be hard to reopen later and I ask myself whether getting an MBA might boost my income potential. I keep going back and forth:

* On one hand, the VP role will set me up well for future leadership opportunities and is good money for the next 3 years; but, by the end of it I will have stayed at the same company for 8 years - which feels like ages in the current job market
* On the other, I feel like I should have at least applied for an MBA to keep my options open and I really miss studying and could do with a change in scenery / industry.

Anyone else been in a similar spot? Did you go for the MBA later or pivot into consulting another way? Should I finish the VP mandate and apply for the MBA after?

Would love to hear how others navigated these trade-offs. I'm really quite torn so appreciate any thoughtful advice <3",Francesca007,1,1.0,2,1738623765,2025-02-03 23:02:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ih2upy/did_i_make_the_right_choices_or_should_i_pivot_now/,2,2025

1ih2721,Employment contract advice,"I was recently given an employment contract and it was posed in a way by the CEO that it was to secure my position in case the owner sells the company and my job is secure.

This contract comes with a nice raise that's retroactive.

Reading through the language and under termination it was stated they can still terminate me without cause provided they give me 1 month notice and 3 months salary in the form of severance.

Termination for cause is immediate no severance after they inform me of the cause and give me 1 month to explain.

Are these negotiable? I don't like that they can just get rid of me without cause but if I want to leave I have to provide 3 months notice. There are also non-compete clauses in there which expire after 3 months of employment here.

I'm currently a senior consultant for a major firm, but I've been on the bench for the past 4 months with no luck getting into a new project.  

I talked to my mom last week and out of nowhere she expressed that my vocabulary wasn't good. She said she never used any ""big"" words and that my vocabulary is very basic. I think I have a wide knowledge of vocab words, its just I don't use them in my professional life - mostly because I forget too. This morning, i got rejected from another potential project, and my mom said its probably because of the way I speak as its not eloquent. Is that a really a thing as to why people can sometimes get rejected from jobs? Should I invest more time in improving my speaking vocabulary? 

  
TL;DR: I use basic vocabulary when speaking in and outside of work - is that a reason for me being rejected for potential new roles?

Now here is the embarrassing part. I sat in the corner furthest away from the front of the room so nobody could see me unless they turned their heads around. In the corner there was a trash can and... I really don't know why I thought of this... But I decided to have a ninja shit in the meeting room.

When I'm in a meeting I usually like to have a mountain of papers to scribble on. So I thought that I could use some of it to shit on. I took some paper and slowly slid it down my pants. Then I released my bowels...

The shit clumped up on the thick layer of paper and when satisfied I took out the papers to throw it in the trash bin. But just as I smeared the shit all over my ass and aimed for the trash can, a colleague who sat next to me saw me. And this colleague wasn't just an ordinary colleague, it was my childhood crush. She saw the shit-filled anal mucus paper wrap and instantly puked. To my demise the whole room looked back to see my hands in the air holding that burrito of pure shit.

1ih13pq,I began having seizures and lost my bartending career. Now what?,"Hi, everyone. 

After Covid, I accidentally became a bartender - and I immediately fell in ***love*** with the job (and even had plans to buy the bar where I was working). 

A few months ago, I lost my position (and the opportunity to buy the bar) due to the onset of neurological issues, including medication-resistant seizures. 

Losing your job (and life plan) while in the middle of a health crisis is never fun, but it's been made particularly challenging because of how unprotected the service industry is. 

So...what do I do now? 

Since my diagnosis means that I am unable to drive - and that a hospitality job is now dangerous for me - I am trying to transition into online work, which is proving to be very difficult. 

I have previous experience in administrative assistance, office management, social media coordination, etc. but this was all pre-2020. 

A job where I regularly speak on the phone (call center, sales rep, etc.) won't be a good fit due to the frequency of my seizures and the time it takes me to recover afterwards.

I am quickly running out of money and it's been impossible to claim benefits (thanks, service industry lol) so I need to find something quickly. 

Do you guys have any career advice or suggestions for someone in my position?

Just barely making any money, and I have a pretty stellar resume. Applied to over 180 jobs in the last 2 months, and had several sets of interviews. I always get rejected at the end, and I’m wondering if there is something in my background check that could be setting it off, and other than losing my job for improper following of tobacco sale procedure, I don’t have any bad background. A DUI from back in college but that has been handled for almost a decade.

So I have two questions. One, is there a good cheap way to check my background myself and see if something is on there that could be screwing me?

second, and potentially more important question. I have heard construction is good to get into and make decent money quickly, at the cost of lots of hours. That’s fine, I just have no idea how to do it or get in touch with people. Do I go to a site? Do I look up construction companies in my area and call them?

1igxc97,I (22M) need some advice on how to best approach this next part of my life.,"I (22M) do not know what path I should take.

I currently work in sales for a raw materials company.

The work has been pretty soul sucking, and it’s not your typical job.

I walk around in retail locations all day long, and I typically have to drive to different locations, so I find myself driving anywhere between 3 to 4 and a half hours a day, between 5:15 AM to 4 PM.

I am completely and utterly burnt out. I have only been here for seven months but I have GRINDED to get where I am.

I know what some of you guys are thinking, “You are too young to be burnt out!”

But let me just add some context:

I worked 2-3 part time jobs every year of college (and in high school too), even dog walking during my lunch breaks at my internship because I went to college in a HCOL area and I needed money pay my own tuition/majority of my living expenses (my parents helped a good amount though thank god).

I worked hard to get nearly perfect grades, got involved on campus as much as I could, and transferred out of my community college to get the top public school in the US.

I went through an abusive relationship with an ex girlfriend which honestly pushed me to self harm at one point as it was basically a catalyst to other mental health issues I was facing.

I went to the gym almost everyday for two years and ate until I couldn’t because I had severe body dysmorphia.

I went through so much and DID so much.

I would not say I “deserve more” or I feel like I am entitled to some insanely well paying job, I think every job needs to be worked by someone no matter what it is, but I just want more than to be in a retail setting again, especially after how hard I tried to get out of that life after I had experienced it.

I don’t even care to make a lot of money, in fact I don’t make much now, but I just want to at least grow in something that doesn’t make me want to kill myself every. single. day.

Currently, I have been applying to tech sales roles to try to get out but the thing is… I don’t even know if I like sales. 

I had an internship Summer 2023 and I was really only exposed to sales for about two weeks as part of a competition for the internship.

Sales was just the only thing I had relevant experience in due to my background in retail and so I kinda just chose that.

Sometimes I consider going into accounting, but I only have a BS in Business Administration, so should I go back to some online school and get a Bachelors degree in Accounting?

I have considered community college again, but people have also told me that it is also extremely difficult to break into accounting with just an AA degree.

So which degree should I potentially get to be able to get my foot in the door?

I have also thought about saving up and going all in on starting a clothing brand. I feel like I have some pretty good ideas that arent just slapping a word on a t-shirt, and I have made mockups and gotten into contact w/ manufacturers, but I just don't know when I should potentially take the ""leap of faith"" and pursue building my own business full time (I can elaborate on this if you guys ask).

Not only do I want to start my own brand because I feel like I have always been a very creative guy, but I feel like building a business would be a good opportunity to get into areas of business I am more interested in.

I know that it is ok to not know what to do when I am 22 and I know that for a few years its going to be hard, but I still want to learn so much and figure out what it is I don’t mind doing everyday for the rest of my life (because I sure as shit know I do not want to do something in the raw material industry).

1igwjaa,"How can I tell if I need to take medical leave from work, or I'm just trying to avoid difficult work?","27M. My deprssion worsened last year and I started experiencing cognitive decline and ""dementia-like"" symptoms, constantly forgetting things, making lots of small mistakes in speech/writing/tasks, difficulty concentrating. It got worse until it bled into my work and I made a few small mistakes with big consequences.

I am seeing a therapist, who believes that my cognitive decline is caused by depression. All of his advice is just ""go outside and do things out of your house, and do the chores you keep procrastinating on"". I'm also getting a full neuropsych evaluation. I did bring up taking medical leave to my therapist and he didn't react.

This past week I've been stuck on one task which should be really simple on paper but has left be completely lost for a number of reasons - I'm on a new team and don't know this project, I can't get my work environment set up properly and nobody on the owning team will help me (even though I've asked multiple times), the project is super weird and every avenue I've tried just does not permit the specific task I need to accomplish. I worked all weekend and got nowhere. I took the day off because I can't come in to work today and admit to everyone again that I've made zero progress on this small task.

Hey all!

I started my first office job out of school in October. I love what I do, and all my coworkers/managers are great to work with. Never had any issues or butting heads over anything so far. However, I have found that most, if not all, of my work tasks can be done from home just fine.

The caveat is that my role doesn’t have all of my responsibilities full my fleshed out just yet. Essentially, I’m open to potentially taking on more tasks that would involve lab work and potentially more meetings throughout the week.

1igvy5m,Would you take Company B's offer?,"Hi All:

**I am thinking about leaving my current company for a new company that offered me a substantial offer. Let’s call current employer “Company A” and new company, let’s call them “Company B”.**

I love Company A, work life balance is great, second in command, however little room for advancement without relocating unfortunately (won’t do that). 95k + company car + fuel and meh benefits, terrible 401k program. Commute is only 20 min round trip from our home.

*Company B offers me 132k + fuel + annual bonus of \~14k ( average, can increase to a lot more) and way better 401k program. Commute is 45-50 min each way.*

**I tell Company A that I am resigning and they counter offer a few days later.**

Counter offer from Company A + Additional site which allows bump to 115k, company vehicle, fuel and 4 weeks PTO. Additional site is 3 1/2 hrs round trip that I would need to make once a week.

**I tell company B (new company) that I am going to stay with current company and they COUNTER OFFERED THE COUNTER OFFER!!!!**

*Counter offer from company B 152k + fuel + annual bonus of \~14k (could be more) and way better 401k program. Commute is roughly 45-50 min each way except on Mondays and Tuesdays where commute will be 1h 15 each way.*

Also, if there is inclement weather, I have the option to work from home. They are very flexible.

Obviously company B will require commuting more, but the income potential and growth leans heavily with company B. Thing is, I have kids and am very much involved in their extra curriculars. That said, as long as I leave earlier for work, I can leave from work earlier as well. Again, they are very flexible as long as I am putting 8 hours in.

With Company A, this will probably be my last raise for a few years and growth will be extremely limited. There is no big bonus with Company A like there is with Company B either.

I am leaning towards Company B, but I love Company A, it is literally the happiest I have ever been in my career. With Company B, I will have 8 direct reports as opposed to Company A with 3 direct reports.

How would you answer these questions by this senior, if you were in my place? 

1) Why did you leave in a short duration?
2) Given your reason to leave, why are you  interviewing for the same company again?

1igv8h7,Should I quit my PT job?,"I am looking for some advice as to whether I should quit my part-time job and focus on my career in veterinary medicine. 

Here's some context:  
I am a certified veterinary assistant making around 2100 per month after taxes. I attended a 7 month program to become certified in this position, having graduated in April 2024. The work environment at my clinic is absolutely incredible. My colleagues are the most supportive group of people I've ever met. I absolutely love my job here and learn new techniques and skills every day. In a few years I am hoping to go back to school to become a veterinary technician and continue to expand my knowledge in the field and really build a career for myself.

My PT job is at a small municipal airport doing customer service for an airline. I live in a remote/rural area in BC so the airport isn't busy aside from the summer (tourist season). The job consists of checking people in for their flights, taking payments for luggage, communicating with the flight crews, and typical day end chores like cash reports, flight logs, daily synopsis, etc etc.   
I have been with this job since 2022 aside from the 7 months I went to school. I know what I'm doing and it's easy work. I only work once or twice per month on the weekends and make 20/hour before taxes. The shifts are 4-5 hours long unless the plane is delayed but even then the hours aren't much.  
Since I work so infrequently, my paychecks are usually \~$100 but sometimes $0.

Here are my qualms with the airport:  
\-I don't get very good flight benefits. I get to fly standby (aka, I can book a standby flight and hope the plane isn't full on the day I'm flying.. or else Im SOL) for roughly $70 one way (regular price for a confirmed seat is anywhere from $350-800).   
\-My partner doesn't get access to my flight ""benefits"" because we are not common-law as we don't live together even though we've been together for 2 years - so if we wanted to fly together, I'd be paying significantly less than him...  
\-My coworkers are pretty freaking lazy and unsupportive. The past two shifts I worked, the other customer service agent I was scheduled with left 1-2 hours early from her shift. The first time it was because she just didn't want to be there today, the 2nd time was because she was just ""so tired"" from waking up too early (she had 45 minutes left in her shift)  
\-Because of how little I work at the airport and how short the shifts are, I spend most of the money I make there on gas to get there. I live a 40 minute drive (on the highway) away from the airport so commuting is a little rough, and again, I live in a remote area, we do not have public ground transport.   
\-I dread going in to work every time I am scheduled....

As I am typing this out, I know it seems like a no brainer, I should quit. But it's hard to let go of a job I've been with for so long - and at one point, I did really enjoy this job too.

1igv58y,Company retroactively inputting PTO prior to final pay,"I’ve been with my company since January 24’. I’m an executive chef for a large corporation that opened a restaurant in early June of 24.

In late July I received a call that my mother was unexpectedly admitted to the ICU from a car crash. I immediately bought a plane ticket and flew across the country to be with her. Days later she passed away and I was left with my other siblings to tie up loose ends as well as be there for each other and grieve.

All in all I was out of work for roughly 3 weeks. At the two week period I received a call from the head of HR notifying me that I had already passed the extent of the company’s bereavement policy, but the c-suite executives I.E. CEO, corporate chef, director of ops, and herself had agreed to continue to pay me during my leave, but just needed to know my return date. 

We discussed a date on the phone and confirmed that it would be my return date. She told me that considering the extended time off mentioned above, she was going to utilize two days of my accrued PTO as padding into the leave before my return. Of course, I had no problems with this and was nothing but thankful for how they were treating my situation.

Fast forward to now, January 2025, where I have given my formal notice with the company. I received my final pay today, which included zero PTO payout. I contacted my boss who informed me that my final check was initially processed and submitted for approval with my PTO included, and was approved by CEO and Corp Chef, but HR came back and denied it, stating that I had taken excess paid time off during my Mothers passing and that they would be essentially be retroactively putting all of it towards that time.

I have access to my payroll app, you can see the two days of PTO that were submitted by HR themselves on my behalf (the two days agreed upon back during leave) as well as my PTO bank accrual which remains at 80 hours.

This PTO payout would be north of $6,000 and is of course a huge blow/disappointment to not be receiving. Is there anything that I can try to do to recoup this money or has my ex employer technically done “nothing wrong?”",Sea-Juice-5326,3,1.0,15,1738605115,2025-02-03 17:51:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igv58y/company_retroactively_inputting_pto_prior_to/,2,2025
1igugsv,I'm a recent History and International Relations graduate who is stuck between a few career options,"I'm from the UK, graduated last July and I'm completely stuck as to what to do next. I know that I do best at anything that involves academic research, and I also love writing. Over the last few months I've been trying to build a copywriting portfolio so that's definitely on the table as a career option, but I'm not sure I want to give up on my love of History or International Politics. The trouble is, I'm hesitant to go back to do a Master's degree until I'm certain of what I want to do, I love both subjects equally, and I worry about the career prospects of academia since it's an incredibly competitive field. 

I've thought about a few other options, including becoming a political analyst or a policy advisor, or becoming an archivist or something generally to do with museums and heritage.

I don't need a career that makes me six figures, but I would like something that's reasonably low-stress that feels meaningful to do. 

Apologies if this reads a bit all over the place, I just feel totally stuck.

Any advice on how to choose a path?

1igudqp,Should I leave or AITA?,"I’ve worked in my industry for over 10 years, with 6 years at my current company. 1 year into current company and a new stream of work came in, I volunteered to take full ownership of the launch and processes and have worked hard (as a team of one) to make it my baby and continuously expand the operation. 

A few years in and the job had become increasingly monotonous and easy - our in-house PM at the time was on long term sick so I put myself forward to assist with the PM team as a new challenge and worked with them extensively for 18 months acting as project lead in many cases and producing some high quality work (without a pay rise or change in job title). When the time came to replace the PM I of course applied. Despite essentially having covered the role already, I was told I hadn’t “made enough of a significant contribution” to be considered for the role. It was given to an external candidate fresh out of uni with no work experience or pro qualifications. 

After venting my frustration and my enthusiasm to pursue development in PM work, the compromise was for my company to place me on a PM apprenticeship and undertake the PMQ exam, which I passed with flying colours within 8 months. This is now a couple of years later, I am still in my apprenticeship but unable to submit assignments as I am no longer involved with the PM team, despite being more qualified. 

The operation I manage has significantly expanded to the point where I am completing the work of 2 people and need additional support, and management’s response was that I needed to pay more attention to detail and focus less on the PM stuff. Basically meaning the hard work I’ve put into my studies and exams will not be leading to anything. 

Am I being unreasonable in that I need to focus on the job I was originally hired for, or are they dangling carrots in front of me?",Mundane_Leave8296,1,1.0,0,1738603296,2025-02-03 17:21:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igudqp/should_i_leave_or_aita/,2,2025

1igtq8p,Asked old supervisor for a drink/dinner to say thank you? is it ok?,"Backstory: I quit a job back in December after two years due to a toxic/unprofessional/disorganized work environment, a lack of opportunities to grow and learn new skills, low pay, and issues with the new management. I poured a lot of emotional energy into the job and overextended myself trying to be useful because I really wanted to help the company work better as it was a mess when I started there. I don't think I fully succeeded and I certainly wasn't the perfect employee, but while management didn't appreciate my efforts, my direct supervisor did. We had a friendly relationship, he taught me as much as he could about the industry we were in and was very patient when I made mistakes. He also brought me+another coworker homemade soup for lunch sometimes (he and his wife are childless and often had more leftovers than they could eat.)

I just found a new job and let him know, and invited him and his wife (who i have not met) for a drink/dinner to say thank you for his support while I was there. Was this ok/appropriate? 

For context, this was a pretty informal work environment in the printing industry.

He is asking me to send a letter of recommendation to the interviewer's email address.

I have been on 4-5 hiring committees before within my department, and we had someone send in a recommendation like this once or twice. It just made us kind of uncomfortable and we disregarded it because it was outside of the process and unexpected.

He is from another country: the same country the candidates were from who sent my hiring committees letters like that.

However, there’s been a few instances where she redirects me and gives me incorrect info & sometimes I need to correct her/tell her the info she gave me was wrong based on what another team said etc. 

And unfortunately, this has affected my metrics in some cases, which upsets me. Ofc I’ve affected my metrics at times with my own mistakes, it hits differently when it comes from your boss. And sometimes I’m trying to explain something & it’s as if she doesn’t get me, like the info she’s giving seems unnecessary at times because she’s not grasping exactly where I am or what I’m trying to convey. Again, people make mistakes but this feels like the most I’ve dealt with when it comes to working w/ someone in charge. 

Another supervisor was promoted to mgr & with 2 new reps promoted to supervisor, they’re wanting feedback to see if we’re better off switching around teams.

So im heavily considering this option.

My plan is to go AMT(Aircraft Mechanic) and stay the 20 if I decide I liked it,if not I would then get out and pursue a degree with the gi bill or go into Aircraft Maintenance.

I plan on taking advantage of the benefits and opportunities the uscg can provide.

1igqas7,Should I leave?,"I know everyone is going to call me crazy, but hear me out. I have an administrative assistant job at a law firm and it’s probably the most boring job I’ve worked, ever. I earn 40k a year, 2 weeks vacation and full health/dental/vision insurance, and I don’t have any degrees, not in school, I’m 21. The amount of work that I do most certainly amounts to about 1.5 hours throughout the week. The other 38.5, I’m doing *nothing*. And they don’t want to give me any more responsibilities. 

I feel like I’ve lucked into such an easy and well-paying job (especially for my age). But I feel worthless. I leave work feeling depressed and looked down on everyday. I feel like I never have any chance of movement because of how unstable the rest of the company is. Other employees constantly complain about how nobody communicates, nobody delegates, things aren’t efficient, etc. 

My prior experience is working at Publix and as a nanny. At Publix I did really well, by the time I was 19 I was earning around 37k a year as a team leader (not quite management but almost there). At Publix you do not get full benefits paid for, it’s about $120/mo but you do get vacation time even if you are part time after awhile and you get company stock for your hours worked. They also match 401k contributions up to 3% (I think that’s the right amount, I know they match up until a percentage). When I left the company I had over 4k in stock (a little less than 3 years worth) and it only would’ve grown exponentially, I’m actually mad I pulled it out bc Publix stock went up twice in 2024. I felt useful, I was good at what I did, my old bosses valued me and have already confirmed I’d have a job there if I wanted it. I felt happier and more productive. My previous manager at Publix was 25 years breaking 100k a year. Publix also offers tuition reimbursement if I do decide to go to school but it wouldn’t allow me to work on school while at work, which is the only real benefit of my current job. 

My issues with working a desk job, I’m worried they won’t disappear either: sitting down 24/7, feeling lazy, having to sit in the same spot all day everyday around the same people, and the office politics that I feel underqualified to even participate in.  

I’m genuinely wondering, though, how many people have taken an administrative assistant role that isn’t giving them any actual experience and turned it into something better? And that better didn’t have a pay cap of below 70k/yr? I feel like even if I went into another office I would be so lost because they literally want me to sit all day and do nothing at my current job, so I have basically no experience except transferring phones.

1igpvae,Need help in figuring out my career path,"Before phrasing my question, a bit about my background and why I've chosen to post this question now. (I apologize if the post is too long or meandering, but this was the best way that I could think of, to express my thoughts and my need for some guidance.)

I'm studying CS Engineering currently from a shitty university. Despite working hard for my grades, they have deliberately sabotaged them and also disbarred me from the on-campus placement process temporarily, until I can clear my backlogs(which were not due to less marks, since I got the highest grades in my division, but due to an administrative error which showed me having less attendance than I actually had).

Off-campus, I have friends, seniors who have tried hard, but despite being skilled, they are also finding it difficult.

I enjoy CS. I enjoy playing around with math, Computer Vision and AI ML technologies, I enjoy reading research papers to know more about innovative ideas, I enjoy doing Codeforces problems(although I do not like the time limits of contests). 

I enjoy learning. I'll admit I don't learn very well from formal books, but if needed I can grind through those. Mostly, once I've learned the basics of a topic, I try to read blogs, research papers, and watch YT videos.

I have done a couple of basic web development projects. I enjoyed the part where I had to plan out the system's components(not in a formal way, I haven't studied system design very deeply) and how they interact. I disliked the actual coding itself, but I suspect that isn't very uncommon. I enjoyed documenting my progress.

I haven't delved much into cybersecurity, but the little that I have tells me that I would enjoy it, but also possibly be overwhelmed very soon. I have no experience in the field though, and I'm only relying on stuff I've heard from other sources, so the reality might differ from my assumptions.

\*\*\*

Ever since I was a kid I've dreamed of primarily three things. Of becoming a writer, of being a teacher, and of protecting the innocent, righting wrongs, etc. 

My interest in CS developed fairly late, and the fact that at the time it seemed like a good option to earn money(I need to earn well for a while at least, to support my family) and do something I liked, I decided to pursue a degree in it.

The thing is, after this latest stunt by the university, a straw that has broken the camel's back, and also the state of the tech world right now-I am left asking some questions.

a) Can I work in the CS industry and earn well, without feeling like...I dunno, guilt or remorse or even shame that I've strayed so far from my ideals?  
I know there are companies which do good work, but in general the ones that pay well also exploit the hell out of a lot of things.

And I know I am fine with working in jobs that I don't agree with for a while, to save up money to pivot into something that fits better. If that's the case, I can work a CS job for 5 years, even 10 years if needed, but beyond that-is difficult.

b) Is the CS grind worth it if you're not convinced this is the right long-term career for you?

So far the only CS careers I can really see myself pursuing long-term, that fulfil my requirements of decent, and if possible steady pay, and fulfilling moral responsibility, is academia, and cybersecurity.

But other stuff-SDE, AI ML, even cloud and low-level development-I am not convinced are the right careers to pursue long-term.

c) what options do I have other than the CS grind? I can see this degree through, but after that, I'm lost.

One option is to do an MBA, or Masters in Economics or Finance, from a good university. I like Economics, and I like playing with data. But not the best option.

Another option is to do a software job for some time, then masters in CS, and then PHD and apply for postdocs, then teaching positions.

Another option is to go the cybersecurity route, stay in industry as long as I can, and exit to academia when I am feeling burned out/unable to continue.

If you know of any other options, that satisfy these two criteria: I won't be a blind code monkey or cog in the wheel that's only making stuff for the rich to exploit endlessly and not create any actual value, and if the role is good enough to earn well and save well(cuz I really need to save well-I do not come from a rich or even affluent background), or at least, offer some stability in income-please do let me know.

\*\*\*

(Also, I am not passing any moral judgments on anybody. I know several fine people who have worked in the IT industry and I do not think less of them for it. But it is not something I can do long-term without feeling guilt, shame, etc, unless it is in a role which actively benefits everyone or is not morally ambiguous. If it is not a role like that, I could not retire doing such a thing; I would need to pivot, and pivot fast)",Independent-Flow5686,1,1.0,0,1738591697,2025-02-03 14:08:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igpvae/need_help_in_figuring_out_my_career_path/,2,2025

I could really use some advice. I've been working for 11 years at a Central European software development company as a Sales and Global Partner/Account Manager.

Here's my dilemma: I really want to change jobs, but it seems incredibly difficult from here, and I feel like I'm stuck in a dead-end.

1igoyfd,Withdraw application or wait for offer?,"I recently interviewed for a new career at a different company from where I currently work.

Am I a scummy person if I wait to see if they make an offer and decline so I can potentially leverage a raise from my current job? Or is it expected that I withdraw my application at this point?

For some context, the interview contained a lot of red flags for me. They all but forced me to tell them my expected salary but ducked the question when I asked about their approved salary range and expected growth over time. They also asked a lot about my willingness to provide mentorship and my long term goals/willingness to stick around for a long time, which tells me they might have a turnover problem. They did say the position was empty because the previous guy got a new job. Finally the job in question would be a very specific niche of my field whereas my current job is more of a generalist with lots of opportunity to learn within and beyond my field.

I've realized that I don't want to stay in academia after the phd, but at the same time I don't have a clear idea about my options after I defended the thesis.



My research has been very theoretical, so I didn't have the chance to develop strong coding and/or data analysis experience. At the same time, I don't have a dream job that I know I wanna absolutely do, so I'm very open to a lot of possible positions.

1ignrfu,How do I put on a brave face at my new job,"I’ve been at my new job for a month. The first two weeks were pretty light, just a bunch of introductions and learning the processes. But for the latter half of the month, I started taking on more tasks that my manager has assigned me. My first major task was somewhat good somewhat bad. I did it correctly but still missed some things that my manager had to double check and point out. It made me have to rush revising everything again on the day of the deadline. And that really put me down. I felt like I came across as careless for not checking on the output more thoroughly. And then last week, my manager was out and my other coworkers asked me for help on a certain task that my manager usually handles. Long story short, I panicked. The task was two parts. I did the first part but accidentally made a mistake which took longer to correct than the task itself. Because of my mistake, I became hesitant to complete the second part and had to decline doing it. I felt so embarrassed but really just wanted to be on the side of caution since I honestly didn’t know how to deal with the problem and might just make things worse. I had to ask help from other coworkers who helped me, but it wasn’t really their job to do that so I felt so embarrassed. I also ended up realising exactly what I needed to do to come up with a solution long after work hours ended. I realised it was so easy. I mean, my manager didn’t teach me how to do that specific thing but it should’ve been easy to guess how to do it since he had already taught me how to use the specific platform we have. It was supposed to be simple problem-solving using the features of the platform…. I feel like I appeared unreliable to my coworkers who asked for help and that I seem to not handle pressure well. I feel like I disappointed them and that this incident will be a big factor as to whether or not they will take me in full time. In the end, the task was resolved but very very late. And now I’m second guessing everything I do at work and how I’m perceived. I feel like I’ve let my manager down since I couldn’t function without him. And I also feel like I’ve tainted the first impression that my new coworkers thought of me. How do I put on a brave face from now on? I’m feeling so self-conscious about my every move now. I don’t even know if it’s imposter syndrome or if maybe I’m just not cut out for this job.

1igmra6,Career Dilemma: Should I Stay in a Multinational or Join a Pharmaceutical Company Closer to Home?,"Hi everyone, I need advice on my job situation. I’ve received an offer from a pharmaceutical company and I’m considering whether to accept it or stay in my current role. I’m 25 years old, with a Master’s degree in Management Engineering and 1.5 years of work experience. Currently, I work as a Process Engineer in a multinational food company in Northeast Italy. My contract is fixed-term but will soon become permanent. I earn €31,300 gross annually plus a €2,600 bonus. There are future prospects to become a shift supervisor, including night and holiday shifts, with a salary of €37,000, and eventually progress into a management role. The company offers a structured environment with growth opportunities, but I live in a remote village, about 500 km from my hometown.

The new offer is for a Demand Planner role in a pharmaceutical company with around 2,000 employees, which is smaller than my current company. The contract would be an apprenticeship, with a salary of €36,200 gross annually plus a €2,600 bonus. The role is more analytical and focused on supply chain rather than operations. The company’s location is just 60 km from my hometown, which would significantly improve my quality of life.

The new offer has some appealing aspects: a higher salary, a more analytical and strategic role, the stability of the pharmaceutical industry with potentially more growth opportunities, and the chance to live closer to home. However, there are also concerns. Moving from a large multinational to a smaller company may mean fewer growth opportunities, and the apprenticeship contract is less secure than the permanent one I’m about to obtain.

I’m seeking advice on which option would be better for my career development. Is transitioning from a multinational to a smaller company a risk or an opportunity? Also, does it make sense to try negotiating the offer, considering I have only 1.5 years of experience?

1igk1tw,New career - advice please?,"After recently being let go from my sales job (I’m actually grateful because I hated it but wouldn’t have left) I’m looking for a new career. I’m done with sales, I’ve never enjoyed it and I want something more rewarding. 

Ofc at the moment, I kinda have to take what I can get but I’m happy to train for something now. I was thinking something like doing my FREC 3&4 and going down that route however after some basic research, it looks like you have to be employed to complete it? Correct me if I’m wrong though?

A bit random but I’ve also been thinking of bookkeeping - as far as I’m aware it’s easy enough to learn and you don’t need a degree to practice it and I figure having a few self employed friends (and potentially myself) it would be a good skill to have to make even a side hustle out of!

Any suggestions on other jobs or paths I could take that aren’t sales? I don’t have enough money to be completely unemployed and I don’t want to go back to school so ideally on the job or evening training I’m looking for!

Six months ago, our CEO left for another organization, and has contacted me about a new opportunity at their organization just this week. Much more money, and again, a new opportunity. I’m in the steps of interviewing right now, but fully anticipate that the job is mine.

Timing of this is unique. My current boss and I have been working together for 5 years. He’s been nothing but good to me and he has truly invested in me over the last five years. He just promoted me this week. It’s the same job title as the one I’m interviewing for, but the salary is not comparable where I’m currently at.

However, he and the previous CEO did not see eye- to-eye, and if I leave, I’m anticipating that this is going to feel like a betrayal to him, which it isn’t. He’s been a mentor to me and gave me a resurgence in my career, but I’ve become stagnant after 10 years.

1igi5mu,4 years of experience on mostly proprietary stuff. What can take me to the next level?,"Hey all,

I am in a bit of a transitional spot in my life and some input would be super appreciated.

I've been working for the past few years in Operational roles... Infrastructure, Production support, application support, etc.. I'm doing pretty well, I'm at 80k a year + 10% bonus.

I'm a bit lost however on how to best hit into, and past the 6 figures. My goal is to move to NYC within the next year, but I don't want to move there unless I'm atleast at that point financially. (I know I can go without being there, but I'd rather not.)

The issue I'm having is that my current/past roles are mostly working on proprietary applications, scripts, and on-prem infrastructure. It's given me a decent bit of knowledge on a tonnn of things, but I'm not specialized yet. This experience makes it fairly easy for me to get considered for 60-80kish roles, but I see significantly less that I have correlating experience for.

So any input on either what roles I should apply for, or what would be the easiest/quickest way for me to get into a new specialization would be appreciated. I don't have any preference for where I end up, I just want to hit my financial goals.

I suspect my issue is that I'm looking to heavily at technical roles when my previous experience is not technical, but more administrative? If that's the case I have no clue what to look at.

I'm going to also attach my resume for context. I rewrote it earlier, it needs some decent revisions but I am tired so I'm more so posting it just to show what experience I have.

1iggqvj,Looking for Career Advice: Junior in Public Health with Interest in Health Informatics,"Hey everyone, I’m a junior in college majoring in Public Health and on track to graduate in May 2026. I’m hoping to build a career in Health Informatics or something related, but right now, I’m feeling a bit lost and could use some advice.

A bit of background: I chose Public Health because I come from an immigrant family, and I knew I wanted to be in healthcare in some capacity. Honestly, I don’t hate the major, but I also don’t feel completely passionate about it. What’s really stressing me out, though, is that I’ll be graduating soon and I don’t have any professional experience. I’ve only volunteered at my church and a local clinic, and I haven’t been able to secure any internships. I’ve tried looking on my school’s website, but I haven’t found much, and I’m not sure where else to search.

Another challenge I’m facing is that while I wouldn’t consider myself introverted, I struggle with speaking in front of people and often have trouble articulating my thoughts clearly. This is one of the reasons I’m drawn to Health Informatics because it's healthcare-related but more “behind-the-scenes”, which feels like a better fit for me.

I also feel a lot of pressure because I’m the first in my family to attend a four-year university. They have high expectations for me, and I’m afraid they think I’ll land a good job after graduation, but right now, I can’t even get an internship or gain any experience, let alone find a job. So, I guess I’m reaching out for advice on a few things:
* How can I gain relevant experience or internships? 
* What steps can I take to improve my communication skills for professional settings?
* Any advice for someone trying to break into Health Informatics or similar fields?

I feel a little silly even writing this but I just got Reddit and it was a worth a shot. I haven’t expressed my thoughts and concerns with anyone not even close friends or my boyfriend who I tell everything. I’d really appreciate any insight or suggestions. Thanks so much for reading!

1igg5xh,Why do I feel so negative about my job and company after getting a promotion to middle management?,"I work at a real estate investment company. It’s a small office of 10 people, reporting into a bigger structure. 



There are basically two big bosses running the office. In a lot of aspects, it’s a good place to work. Good pay, no micromanagement, pleasant office culture, reasonable hours, fair expectations, etc. On the downside, many of our policies, structures, etc are clearly not structured and ‘professional’. Also, some very problematic cultures and comments and such, but unfortunately it is hard to change those in my spot. 

  
The other thing about our office structure is I’d say there’s two groups of people - either “senior” staff who are directly anchored into the company via a small ownership stake, etc, OR a lot of relatively junior employees who are fresh grads and perhaps naive. I’m awkwardly a bit in the middle. 



I came over here as a senior operations person. Let’s say that I’m young - similar age to the people “junior” to me. I have gotten paid well my entire short career, and have a fairly progressed role So I can’t whine or complain that I deserve more validation.  



My aspiration is/was to be on the actual investments and deals side of the business. Also (unfairly), it can seem like the prize or upside can largely favour this side. It’s just how it is sadly. 



I was put in charge of a new capital project of ours. This project was completely sideways from the beginning (not my fault). I didn’t get blamed per se, but they just no longer really supported my aspirations of getting to that job. They also said I wasn’t “hungry” enough to make money, while they were simultaneously reneging on the compensation structure they promised. The whole experience was rage inducing but I had my hands tied a lot.  



Also, our business had had a lot of turmoil the past year, and the two big bosses have made some HORRIBLE decisions - personal wise, new investments, etc. 



Through a re-org, I was offered a manager of operations job. This actually suits my profile extremely well on paper, I get to avoid some of the politics, and will learn and refine some management skills. I am getting paid very well to do this too. 



And yet I’m still needlessly feeling cranky and skeptical at the start of this. 

* I just can’t help but feel like the expectations and structure of this are dumb; they just want a loyal deputy to do/manage all their grunt work, while they keep the upside. 
* I really do question some of the business and other decisions they make, but my only actual scope of work is my own little department 
* Don’t necessarily feel I get treated that well, in that all of the senior people will just tell me what to do all the time. I’m basically going to have to learn to be more prickly. 
* In a weird way, I guess it irritates me that my few young employees gleefully look up to the big bosses. 



Now I know this is really peevish. I guess what I’m asking is - why do I feel so negative about my workplace when I’m getting paid well and in a senior role, and all my coworkers below me seem happy? ",throway3pointer,1,1.0,0,1738554502,2025-02-03 03:48:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igg5xh/why_do_i_feel_so_negative_about_my_job_and/,2,2025

1igevvf,Should I ask the company I work for for a referral fee for sending them new business?,"I'm currently a contractor at a small company that provides software for pharma and biotechs. As a non-scientist, it's taken me months to get a foundational understanding of how our tech works, but after finally completing a relevant course outside of work, things have started to click into place. I have an MBA, but so far, I've been underemployed, doing menial business tasks that an entry-level undergrad student could accomplish with their eyes closed. (For some context, due to wanting to switch industries and for some personal shit I had going, I took the job because I was initially sold on how great of an opportunity it was to learn and break into the industry).

In reality, they've been struggling in recent months to close deals (aka, very tight on funds) and after hearing my boss's sales pitch for the first time last week (who takes all the sales meetings), I've realized it's terrible and probably a big part of it of the problem (along with his disorganization and little to no marketing in a highly competitive space). 

  
I like my boss and team personally, but I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I've wait long enough for things to get better and need to find a different, full-time job where I can be challenged and truly learn. I also desperately need the higher pay and benefits. 

I've signed up to attend a scientific conference in a few weeks, and paid for everything out of my own pocket as my boss wasn't interested in having us represented. My plan is to go and network with folks at companies that really interest me so that it can be easier to apply for a job with them (I'd then have a direct contact in the company).

My issue is this: if I'm supposed to be selling myself as to how great of a employee I am (presumably, how much I've done for my current company--ha!), but if they ask questions about my current company's tech and it turns out to be of great interest to the one I'm courting, .should I have a referral agreement in place  in case they reach out to my boss for a sales call? Maybe I could be upfront and tell them that while my current company is great, my interests lie elsewhere, and that I'm actually interested in them, but obviously this doesn't gurantee me a job. So if they reach out to my current company anyways, I'd like to think my boss would give me some sort of kick-back, but without a formal agreement in place and with funds being tight, I have no assurances that he would. And even then, it could be for a trivial amount far below what they'd get. 

  
Hopefully I provided enough context, and thanks in advance for any guidance! ",deluna_sense8,0,0.5,9,1738550492,2025-02-03 02:41:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igevvf/should_i_ask_the_company_i_work_for_for_a/,2,2025

1igdrn8,Anyone ever feel as if they 'broke up' with their employer?,"Left my company a few months back after being their for 5 years. It was the first company I ever worked for right out of school. Even though I wore many hats which at times led to burnout, and thinking to leave several times,  they taught me everything I know. It was a remote company, however I also grew very close to my team and built report across the business. I ended up leaving to spread my wings, learn new ways of doing the work, gain experience in a different industry, and not to be 'comfortable'. But now being at the new company for a few months, I am bored (rarely have any tasks to work on), I can't think out of the box like I am used to, I also feel lonely in terms of team interaction (my peers are around my age and the company is also hybrid so I see them 2-3 days a week). 

I keep in touch with several of my old colleagues and they keep me up to date with what is going on there. I see and hear people move into the role I was aspiring to go into.  The projects they are working on is something I wish I had a chance to be apart of, but when I was looking to leave and asked what are the goals for the next 12-24 months, there was lack of clarity. It also felt like more work for me but minimal recognition (pay and title).

So basically the transition has had some 'breakup' qualities- I think about my old company on a daily, what I would be doing there right now, thinking of questions I should have asked my manager before making a decision, losing sleep on wishing I hadn't jumped ship, even considering reaching out to see if they would take me back. I left on good terms since there was nothing pushing me to leave per say, and they did mention boomerang is always an option. 

I keep reminding myself why I left, to learn and be a better SME, and to give it some time but I can't help wonder about the what if I stayed. I am unsure if I miss them too much or is this normal?

1igdonz,Is it over for me ?!,"Alright, I'm feeling lost right now and don't know what to do with my future.

If you have any advice, please guide me.

I'm a 20-year-old from North Africa, living in a remote village. I failed university and dropped out because it wasn’t even internationally recognized.

I've been trying for years to move to Europe with a work contract, but I don’t have the money to afford university studies there.

I tried learning cybersecurity, hoping to get a job in a first-world country, but I realized I’m competing with people who already have Master’s and PhD degrees—and they’re already in Europe. I doubt any company would take the risk of relocating someone below average from Africa while ignoring top-tier candidates.

My mother told me to become a barber or an electrician, but I don’t want to do physically demanding or exhausting jobs.

So, I moved to Plan B—which is to avoid skills that require a university degree (like data science or machine learning) and instead focus on a profession that only requires a strong portfolio.

After researching, I found that digital art is one of the few fields where degrees don’t matter much.

So I started learning Character Modeling and VFX, but the problem is that this field requires a very powerful computer, and I'm too poor to afford it.

Now, I’m looking for a skill that only requires a strong portfolio.

Do you have any ideas?

1igd7de,How do I quit my job without looking bad?,"Hi, long story short... my job sucks.

I work at a coffee shopManager has done many things that are consider illegal. He steals the tips, schedules people to work 6-7 days per week, doesn't allow people to take breaks or makes the schedule in a way that people don't have a break or have it after 6-7 hours, he fires people just because he didnt like them,  doesn't pay on time and payment is often incomplete, I could keep going, but everything is so bad, to the point every single person wants to quit.

But the straw that broke the camel's back was when he forced me to go to work when I had a surgery. I had an accident that required a minor sugery, although it wasn't too bad the doctor told me I needed some time to rest and heaal, he suggested 2 weeks. I told my manager and he was okay with that. He suddenly schedule me to work a few weeks after, blaming me for not giving him ""enough notice"" .

He blamed me saying that I never mentioned any surgery to him, when I showed him the email proving that I had, he then blamed me again for not telling him about my accident and surgery a month in advance. I told him that I could go back to work in 5 days but that I couldn't do any activity that required a lot of effort, and that I was still putting my health at risk. He is so upset because he wants me to come back ASAP because he needs to go on vacation tomorrow and nobody else can work.

I am more than upset that he thinks his vacation is more important than my health.

I don't want to look like an idiot quitting, I think it I have plenty of reasons to quit but I also need money.

Do you think I am exaggerating? How could I quit without sounding like an asshole?",Creepy-Run-8528,1,1.0,5,1738545344,2025-02-03 01:15:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igd7de/how_do_i_quit_my_job_without_looking_bad/,2,2025

1igcu9b,Terminated during job search - how to handle? Advice and suggestions please,"How do you go about handling being terminated while in the process of looking for a new job?

Quick backstory - my company was acquired in a PE backed deal 18 months ago. My former boss left 7 months ago. He did NOT get along with our new CFO (brought over from another portfolio company to be the CFO of us and two others). Between that and some increased scrutiny due to some errors/omissions made by my former boss and a couple of other previous employees regarding financial statements, it's become increasing clear new CFO wanted to bring in their own people. It's to the point where me and two others on the team have all started looking. I began my search a month ago and have been ramping it up the last couple of weeks. I was informed this past week that I am being terminated for producing inaccurate financials (fwiw, one of the 2 people mentioned was also terminated).

Here I stand in the process of interviewing for 4 different roles. I have moved beyond the first 2 rounds of interviews for each of them, so I am cautiously optimistic one of them will lead to an offer. Issue now is that I have been terminated, how do I handle this? My resume shows my former position as my current role. During interviews with each, I have indicated I am currently with my now former employer and I reported directly to the CFO. Now I am in the position where in the next round I will more than likely be asked things like ""why do you want to leave?"" or ""who do you currently report to?"". Should I simply lie? Or be honest about the recent change?

In speaking with a handful of people at my old employer to say good bye and thanks, they've all offered themselves as references. So if nothing else, at least I have people at this former employer willing to provide a reference.

Anecdotally, some friends have said given the termination is so recent (didn't happen say 3 months ago), not to worry. If an employer does a check, they're just looking to find out if you were actually employed where you said you were and your title and a rough idea on dates. However, I am concerned if they do ask if I am eligible for rehire, or if they're told my employment end date was at the end of January 2025.",Glad_Gold4052,1,1.0,0,1738544286,2025-02-03 00:58:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1igcu9b/terminated_during_job_search_how_to_handle_advice/,2,2025

And I've now finally come to the conclusion that I'm going to resign by April at the latest. 
But now the next problem is just around the corner. I am a baker. I can easily find a new job as a baker, bakers are wanted everywhere and my average grade in my apprenticeship was a 1.2, which is why most people would take me with open hands and a kiss on the hands, literally. 

Problem: there are no good bakers in my town. All employers pay minimum wage. Six days a week is standard. 24 days holiday is the maximum. No matter how long you're in the job or what kind of degree you have. Plus the products are no different from the supermarket ones. I can't work like that. I'd just go from one burnout to the next.

I told the head or sales I am leaving and he said “if you need a reference in case you don’t have a job lined up let me know”. That kind of irked me because does he think I was fired? 

Now I don’t feel as bad and kind of want to do far below the bare minimum.

1iga7xc,"Felt uneasy after phone screen, unsure if I should withdraw from the interview tomorrow or go in anyway. Please help?","Apologies for the long post. It was longer but I trimmed down a lot. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I got some uneasy vibes from a phone screen and I’m not sure what to do regarding the in-person interview I’m supposed to have tomorrow.

For some background, I’m 27 and I worked at the same retail store from 2016 up until this past December when my store closed down. I’ve been looking for work since October, and have had a few interviews since then. I received a bachelors in business administration in 2023 and want to start focusing on a career instead of retail. I’ve been applying to clerical and customer service roles, as I think that would be a good starting point and some of my skills and experience would transfer. I don’t want to work in healthcare, but it’s a huge industry in my state and a lot of the currently available jobs are in general practices or hospitals. Because of this I’ve been more open to applying to specialized healthcare offices, like dental or physical therapy, but I’m still not super interested in those jobs.

I applied last Wednesday for a receptionist position at a dentist office. I received a message from the dentist running the practice on Thursday regarding scheduling a phone call about the position. I responded saying my schedule is fairly open, and to let me know what time(s) work so I can make myself available. He responded on Friday morning (around 7:50am) asking if he could call at 11am. My sleep schedule has been terrible since I haven’t been working, so I was still sleeping and didn’t see the message when I woke up at 11 to my phone ringing. I didn’t recognize the number so I declined the call. After I looked at my emails and saw the message I realized it was the dentist so I called back and had a discussion with him.

Since I had just woken up and was not prepared for a phone screen, I wasn’t giving my best answers. The way he spoke didn’t seem like he was too fond of what I was saying either, but I’m autistic so I could be misinterpreting this. After asking me some general questions, he asked me math questions unprompted. I’m not bad at math but with the combination of having just woken up and being caught off guard, I know I got most of them wrong. He then talked about how he is extremely strict regarding how things are run and the reputation of the practice. He never went over what the position entails (though a lot of the duties can be assumed given its a receptionist position). He was very vague when I asked about growth in the role (not that I assume there is much with a local dentist office), and said only 70% of new hires make it past the 90 day probation period. At the end of the call, he asked if I wanted to come in for an in-person “working interview” that would be one hour of meeting the team and seeing the office and from there they would determine if it would be a good fit. I’m supposed to go in at 9am for this.

Something about the way the phone call went and how he talked about the position and practice didn’t feel right. I felt uncomfortable being called without my confirmation and the way he spoke made me feel uneasy about the environment. Some family and friends also thought the unprompted math quiz was odd, given the role. The 70% rate of new hires making it through probation also felt low to me, but I’m not sure what the actual average rate for that would be. I’m unsure if I would take the job, if offered. I’m in the process of applying for unemployment though, and I know I would lose that (if it even gets approved) if I turn down an offer, as this would be considered suitable work.

I’m unsure about what to do. I’m feeling a sense of dread about the interview. I have another interview with an entirely different company later in the week that I’m actually looking forward to, as my phone screen with their recruiter was very pleasant, the company seems extremely organized and communicative throughout the process, it pays better than this role would, and has significantly more opportunity for growth and development. My family is suggesting I go in anyway and just try to do really badly on the interview so I don’t get an offer but I’m not really sure how to intentionally do poorly on an interview. Part of me feels that I should withdraw from the interview but I don’t know if I’m overthinking this. I’ve never really felt like this about going in to an interview before (anxiety sure, but not dread) and would like some thoughts about the situation and advice about what I should do from here.

1ig8jjz,I need advice on how to get in contact with people studying in my field,"(I apologize if my English isn’t perfect—I’m still learning.)

Hello,

I was recently accepted into university to study psychology, with plans to pursue a master's in neuropsychology. I hope to start college next year, but there is a high likelihood that I may have to wait an extra year. This gives me a lot of time, and I want to use it productively by self-teaching neuropsychology to better prepare for college. Unfortunately, neuropsychology is not a popular field in my country, and finding information on it has been difficult.

I’ve reached out to a few people for guidance, but most have suggested I simply read more books and research papers (which I’ve been doing) and wait until after my undergrad to study abroad. However, I want to start preparing now to increase my chances. I also tried emailing professors, but I haven’t received any responses.

If anyone could recommend forums, online communities, or ways to connect with international students or professionals in this field, i will be very gratefull

Last week I made a mistake that cost us money however it was not at all my fault, my manager also was at fault as she was not supervising me when this happened (i did not get fired). However my manager still after a week is shouting at me and being horrible to me due to what happened. She is no longer being constructive but just mean, saying things to make me feel humiliated, and raising her voice. I gave her the benefit of the doubt when it first happened as I understood why she would be mad but I think now she is taking her frustration all out on me as she got in trouble for not doing her job properly. I thought it was all in my head, but even other colleagues noticed. One asked me if I was ok and that she can tell the manager is mad at me.

1ig7i31,Social media manager-should I quit?,"TLDR: Should I quit my full-time job and consult so I have more time to spend with my child?

Full version: I am struggling with the internal politics and dynamics of my job—and have been since the day I started. It was nothing like what was presented to me during the interview process.

Plus, work feels so meaningless when you’re spending so much time away from your baby for them to be raised by strangers and bring home every illness under the sun.

I am at the point where I need to decide:
-Do I stick it out for another year?
-Do I get another job?
-Do I quit the workforce and freelance?

What I have to consider: 
-I was also at my previous two jobs for only two years, so I don’t want to look like a job hopper. First was a startup going under. Second, I was laid off at 3 months pregnant. Now, in a dead-end role.

-I took this job as a demotion in pay and responsibility because I was needing to quickly find something with a baby on the way and I was also in the underwriting process for a loan. 

-We actively trying for a second child, so I could potentially stick it out because, if I want to continue on with my career, I wouldn’t qualify for FMLA elsewhere.

-I’ve been consulting nights and weekends for a few brands to make up for the cut and pay, and now, I’m to the point where I make more than my full-time salary.

What’s going on:

-I’m not allowed to do anything. Basically, I plan out social posts, and then my boss says looks good, and then my boss’s boss redoes them, and I just press schedule. 

-Within half a year, I stopped trying to push for what was current and best practices, and just tried to do what I thought my boss’s boss would like…which I still can’t nail down because…

-I keep a note on my laptop of all of her feedback, preferences or criticisms and changes, and she constantly contradicts herself.

-Our social performance is not doing hot, and compared to other brands I’ve supported, it’s terrible.

-Every once in a while, I get a wild hair and bring up stats and best practices, but posting stories and Reels or commenting on other content is all met with resistance. 

-So my day-to-day job is basically using the early 2000 stock images and the copy I am told to use to put out. And these posts all do terrible. Then I’m asked with how do we drive engagement and how do we grow our following…

-What’s most frustrating to me is I used to lead communications teams, with people doing social media reporting up to me. I used to work directly with the c-suite. But I’m treated like I have no clue what I’m doing or I’m not capable of doing it. In some circumstances, I’m not even allowed to send an internal email without it getting approved.

-I am bored out of my mind. Whenever I ask for more responsibility, I’m giving tasks like proofreading or order catering. 

-I’ve had crucial conversations with my boss on this. She remains Switzerland.

-I know of four other people on the team who are also bored out of their minds, reading books during the workday or applying to other jobs. Two people I know who have left the company (one formerly in my role), left for the same reason.

-I’ve questioned my sanity and have had times where I thought, maybe I actually suck at my job. But the brands I consult for love my work. The organic and paid social we’re doing are performing excellently and driving revenue. 

I’m genuinely loss at what to do, if I just stick it out because it’s a means to an end and helps me provide for my child. Or do I change jobs and hope that I find a better environment where I have more autonomy? Or if I have enough work under my belt that I take the leap and go 100% consulting and have more flexibility to be with my child?",Acrobatic_Sand_7473,1,1.0,5,1738529889,2025-02-02 20:58:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ig7i31/social_media_managershould_i_quit/,2,2025

1ig58u9,Senior Operations Leader vs Growth Lead in federal government contracting (GovCon)- looking for senior advice,"Everybody knows that working in the US Government under President Trump is getting exceedingly difficult.

Right now I'm a very senior operations leader managing a multimillion dollar contract with 150 employees.  My leadership is not giving me the respect I should be getting.  There are conferences I should be attending where ownership is sending a relative.  My clients are under a lot of stress and are taking out a lot of pressure on me because Trump is expected to start forcing people out.  The pressure is not a great feeling.  However I know my position is safe.

I was given an offer at my same salary to be a BD / Growth Lead for that same agency- no longer managing 150 staff or all the clients. I turned it down, but then a recruiter called me back, saying the salary has increased so that it would be a 15% raise.  I think the risk of getting fired in 12-18 months is high.  But I'm nervous about not making those numbers.

I'm really concerned about being more at risk in a BD role where I may not easily make my numbers under this administration.  Sometimes having a large team behind you makes the most sense, even with the stress, that you have the structure of the team to keep your position safe.

1ig4zjv,I have a great job but something is missing,"

I posted this in r/lifadvice too but I'm yet to recieve any comments, so I wanted to try here. Though my problem stems from a family issue, the decision I'm trying to make is about my career. 

So a little intruduction: I'm a 27 yo guy working as a baker. I have four older siblings. And one sentence frequently occupying my mind: ""If only one of my children had a degree."" That's what my father repeats at family gatherings. Ever since I was little what made you a valuable person was the accomplishments in your field. Not to drag my father's name through the mud, but that's how he made me feel. I understand where he's coming from. He never had that chance. He was born in the fifties he worked in a coal mine in his teens, then joined the military, he had a family and that's it. 
But the weight he put on us unknowingly haunts the family to this day. At least that's how I see it. 

Now to my main concern. After highschool I was unsure about my future. So I decided that I'd be the one to accomplish my father's dream and get a degree that he could proudly hang on his wall. I went to the best university in my country and studied to become a physics and english teacher. Flash forward one year and... I failed. 
The worst year of my life yet. With my ever-growing anxiety from highschool resulting in very very dark nights by the time I left the uni. 
It took a lot of effort picking myself up and moving forward. Following another common saying from my father: "" A man should either study or work, better case if he does both.""
So i got a job as a receptionist. Though it was unfulfilling, it gave me time to find out what I wanted to do. I decided to follow my heart and make my hobby (baking) my profession. 
Fast forward three years and one terrible job I am now here. With a well paying job, the best coworkers I have ever worked with and better mental health then the last ten years. 

But one desire is still left. I frequently get the urge to go back to university and study something. This time on my own accord. And I always found psychology interesting. All that's left is to click the apply button... And then a very familiar haunting feeling hit. 
Is this what I want or am I still trying to make my father proud?
Will I fail like last time?
Wouldn't it be a waste of time and money? I mean I couldn't dream of a better workplace and now I want to risk it. 

To be honest I don't know what I want to hear. I still have two weeks until the application. I'm at a crossroads in my life. Have any of you been in a similar shoe? 
Thank you for reading this. And if we can have a discussion I would happily read any opinion. Oh and tell me if i should post this in another subreddit. I'm not that familiar with the site.

1ig2zrw,Looking for New Career Paths—Would Love Ideas and Suggestions!,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to get a bit of advice on my career direction. Here’s a bit about my background and where I’m at:

I’m 30 years old and recently completed a bachelor’s degree in Media and Communication Science. During my studies, I worked in marketing at a well-known company between semesters. While my role was technically in marketing, it mostly involved instructing the agency the company used for their social media and writing guidelines, leveraging my previous job experience.

My career journey has been quite varied. I started an apprenticeship in interior design at 15 and later held mostly sales jobs. Eventually, I transitioned into freelancing as a social media manager, which allowed me to fund my education and attend evening school and later earn my bachelor’s degree.

Now that I’ve graduated, I’m looking to move into a role that isn’t strictly social media or sales.

I do have some marketing experience and generally enjoyed it, so I’ll definitely be considering marketing roles. However, I’d love to hear suggestions for other career paths that might align with my degree and experience—roles I might not have thought of or even know exist. While I have good social skills, I’d prefer to avoid roles that involve being in front of a camera or require frequent presentations or pitches to large audiences.

I’ve already tried asking ChatGPT for advice, but the suggestions weren’t very practical. I’m hoping to hear from people with real-world experience who can share their insights. Honestly, any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and I’ll research them further.

1ig2vdj,Confused About My Music Career Path – Considering Changing Direction in Music Studies,"Hi,  
I’m a bit confused at the moment. I’ve been playing the pipe organ for many years. When I was in 5th grade, I tried to get into a more prestigious music school, and they offered me organ lessons. I decided to give it a try. I’ve always been up for new challenges, so that’s how it all started. The level difference was huge, but I managed to catch up.

In high school, things started to get difficult. We were in the same school as my primary school, which had its pros and cons. We had more music classes, including organ improvisation. It sounded great, but I realized it was nothing like the piano, especially the more popular, recreational kind. Organ lessons were mostly about rules and harmonizing church hymns, and I’m just not into church music. I’ve always avoided it like the plague.

In my second year of high school, I started to doubt whether this was the right path for me. I felt burnt out and couldn’t see a future in it. In my final year, I decided to attend a music academy in the same city – I thought maybe new people, a new perspective, and fresh motivation would change things. I told myself I would try this year and see how it goes, and if it’s not right, I’d go for Erasmus.

Problems on my studies started right away. I had trouble accessing the instrument, managing my time (it took me 30 minutes to get to university one way, which may seem like nothing, but sometimes I wasted it on things like eating or shopping). I always struggled to get a practice room, and the academy was the only place I could practice. On top of that, I had another course related to church hymn harmonization, and I’ve had enough of that. It’s something I really don’t enjoy, and I just can’t do it like everyone else. When I don’t like something, I can’t learn it.

In two days, I have exams. I’ve been sick since Christmas, so I’ve had about three weeks off, plus the Christmas break, which means I barely got through the pieces. I’ve been scolded by the teachers, which really affected me mentally. I felt awful, like no one cared about me. Luckily, my family comforted me, saying it was unreasonable. It’s only my first semester, and I already feel disconnected from all of it.

I’ve always dreamed of developing my vocal skills, but I don’t feel confident about pursuing that path. I have a strong music foundation, so I’d like to finish my bachelor’s in music, but I don’t think I can continue with the organ. I’ve struggled with it so much already. Even though playing is okay, it’s everything around it that tires me out. It’s hard to explain, and I’m not sure if it’s even understandable, but I just don’t feel it. I can’t see myself with the organ in the future. I dream of traveling, discovering myself and the world, but I don’t see myself as a teacher or organist in a church. That kind of work just doesn’t bring me joy.

I’d like to leave, explore the world, and become independent, but I don’t want to give everything up either. If you have any ideas, I’d love to hear them.

1ig2gcz,From Classroom to Corporate: TESOL Training for Trainers or Udemy Course? Need Your Advice!,"I’m a PGT English teacher and currently working as a Subject Matter Expert in English. Lately, I've been eyeing the corporate world and considering a transition into becoming a corporate trainer. With a background rooted in education, I'm excited about the possibilities—but also a bit overwhelmed by the options available.

I'm torn between two paths:

TESOL – Training for Trainers (the official course from TESOL International Association) or
an online course from Udemy.

A few things I’m curious about:

Accreditation & Recognition: How much weight do these certifications carry in the corporate world?

Content & Skillset: Which course would better equip me for the corporate training environment, especially considering my current background in English education?

Cost & Flexibility: Any insights on the value versus the investment for either option?

If anyone has taken either course or made a similar transition, your insights would be invaluable.

1ifyzc2,"Changing careers, I wanna get into public service, probably eventually into politics","Hi everyone, I'm a 35yo guy in Montreal, Canada. 

The past few years I've been working as a computer programmer / tech support guy. I am mostly self-taught but did a programming bootcamp a few years back. Unfortunately I got laid off a few months ago and to be honest with myself I wasn't too surprised about it because programming clearly isn't for me. It gives me wild anxiety to try to write code and I wasn't getting enough done.

I really need a job with more meaning to me. I know that might be a lot to ask, especially in the present climate, but still. I can imagine myself 15 years from now and I want it to have been worth-while. Some context: I've got autism & some other diagnoses; I haven't had an easy go of things but changing career paths I believe will be a big help. Unfortunately my health stuff does kinda get in the way of some options - I've got a seizure disorder which means when I'm sick I'm not really in any state to call in cuz I tend to not be conscious...

I'd really like to get into politics (federally) or public service of some sort, where I feel like I'm contributing more to society. I realize that those are also not ""easy jobs"", there's a lot of stress in that career, but it's just more worth-while to me. Autism makes a public-facing job harder but it is definitely doable, there are plenty of autistic politicians out there.

I'm willing to start at the bottom; I've started going to meetings at city hall, borough meetings, etc. & I'm thinking maybe a job where I'll be around the municipal politicians.

Education-wise, I've got two bachelors degrees in music and in neuroscience, which are both cool but not terribly helpful for getting jobs. I've been getting more involved with the local arts scene too. My CV is kind of a patchwork of contracts, grants and shorter jobs lasting a year or two. I feel like it's probably not very attractive for recruiters, but, again. I need a career change.

I'd really appreciate any advice folks might have. I'm doing what I can here.",SolipsisticLunatic,1,1.0,0,1738508346,2025-02-02 14:59:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifyzc2/changing_careers_i_wanna_get_into_public_service/,2,2025
1ifynfl,"Any job/careers recommendations that have a stable and healthy work environment? College student here, needs insight :)","
Hello!

I'm currently exploring career options that offer a stable and healthy work environment with a consistent 9-to-5 schedule. For context, I’m a junior in university (📍Philippines), and over the past several years, I’ve struggled a lot with my mental health. I've realized that I function best when I have a structured routine: consistent sleep, morning and nighttime routines, regular exercise (cardio, yoga, etc.), and time for hobbies. And because of this, I want a career that allows me to prioritize my well-being.  

I’ve experienced depression and burnout before (and honestly, I think I still am), and I don’t want to reach a point where I break down in the office because that would really be embarrassing. More importantly, I don’t want my mental health struggles to hold me back from growing in my career. I know every job comes with stress, but I want to be smart about my choices and find roles that are typically less high-pressure/stressful. If you have insights on departments or industries known for having good work environments, or even the niche ones that not a lot of people know, I’d love to hear them! Feel free to recommend specific companies as well.  

As for my preferences, I lean more toward creative and communications-related roles. I’d really like to avoid finance, IT, or freelance work since those aren’t my strengths. I know this might sound picky, but I’m fortunate enough to come from a financially stable family, so I have the time to figure things out. That said, while I’m very much open to jobs with lower starting salaries, I’d love to find something with a lot of room for income growth over time, especially since I want to afford therapy and possible medication in the future.  

Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much! ",Ok-Geologist-8243,1,1.0,0,1738507384,2025-02-02 14:43:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifynfl/any_jobcareers_recommendations_that_have_a_stable/,2,2025

1ifxmp6,Corporate America: Can't run from gosssiiip,"As the title of the post says, I can't run from gossip. Half year ago I started working in an american corporate, but in Europe - in finance, if that's worth mentioning. I'm fresh graduate, never worked in corporate and I must say, I'm drama free person. I don't like to gossip, talk shit about people bcs in the end, I do not care at all. The problem is, that EVERYBODY around me does! I'm in highly competitive enviroment of young people who essentialy think, that in two or three years they become a CFO (that's never gonna happen obviosly haha, as the median of age is circa 26/27 years). When you speak to your coworker, in few minutes the debate falls into gossip again. It never really matters who am I talking to, when I speak with side A, they talk shit about B and reversed. I'm just working on my PC and then my colleague comes, sits and out of fucking nowhere she starts telling me shit. I'm not shy, I'm just polite and can't make myself tell her that stfu. If I would do, they would talk shit about me - which I frankly do care about (pls don't judge). The finance job is challenging enough but I cannot learn to navigate this toxic culture. iIt seems like you cannot win!! I just don't really understand why we cannot support each other or at least not talk shit. I just don't get it!! My managers ofc don't see any of this.. they see the biggest manipulators as angels. I guess it's just a rant. I'm not sure how to navigate this at all, how to react when somebody try to get in a gossip session with me, how to stay of it as a subject of gossiping..also, even when e.g. A is gossiping about B, when they meet is all about sweet nice words, warm smiles.. I just can't be this fake, idk what to do. It is manageable, but I'm really good at my job, in networking but I cannot handle this fake ass shits, facades and this gossiping, bcs you cannot trust anybody and they all seem really friendly and nice and then BAM.. and I'm just sitting and listening to them and thinking like,  what the hell. Also, I wanna say that I like my job, would like to keep it and do not plan to leave. 

Sorry for such a long post, but if someone has any advice how to navigate such dynamic, gossip-y environment where everybody considers everyone as a thread, please, give me any advice... thank you!

Mr K and I got along great, he's only a few years older than me and we have a similar mindset and work ethic.

My boss Mr J will retire in summer and I have already been offered & accepted to become head of operations - leaving me with an open head of production position to recruit for.

1ifunw5,Stuck at 29K While My Colleague Earns 37K – How Can I Improve My Position?,"I’m 32M, a passionate C++ backend developer from Europe. I’m still working at my first company, the one that hired me after graduation. The job is not hard for me. I usually finish my tasks well before the deadline, and I spend the rest of the week studying topics related to my work and working on other projects to improve as a developer.

Over the past year, I’ve grown frustrated because I see one of my friends, who was hired at the same time as me (we even studied at the same university), getting a raise every year. He started with a slightly higher salary than me, but our pay was almost the same at the beginning. Now, he’s earning 37k, while I’m stuck at 29k.

I love my job. I’m really passionate about programming and everything related to it. I had great grades in university and even spent the past year earning a master’s degree. I’ll officially finish my master’s next week, and I think I will ask HR for another raise.

The company itself isn’t bad; it has a chill and balanced environment, great work-life balance, and interesting bonuses. But I think I landed on the worst team in the company. It’s clear that our boss has no intention of pushing the team forward, and he has no idea how to manage us.

I’ve tried working harder, focusing on my mistakes (the ones he points out), but nothing has changed. Like my friend, I asked HR for a raise. Last year, they gave me a simple one, level promotion with just 60 euros more per month, while my friend got 400 euros more per month. I don’t know why, but his team is much more driven, and he has worked near the CTO since the beginning. I’m sure he deserves the raises, he’s a great developer and a nice person but I still want to know if there’s anything I can do to increase my position and salary.

I feel like I’m running out of time. I started my career late, and I want to reach his level to stay competitive, stabilize my income, and eventually buy a house (or at least try to). Right now, I’m honestly frustrated.

What can I do to improve my position and paycheck? Is there anything I can do besides quiet quitting to grow within this company, or should I keep improving as a developer and look for a better opportunity elsewhere?",Hour_Ad_3581,0,0.5,3,1738492947,2025-02-02 10:42:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifunw5/stuck_at_29k_while_my_colleague_earns_37k_how_can/,2,2025
1iful9g,M21 Australia Vic: looking for advice,"Hello, humans. I hope you're doing well. I appreciate that I have this space to ask for advice, and I also appreciate that you are spending your time reading this post and possibly giving some helpful advice!

  
For some background info, I am Male, 21 I'm currently doing a bachelor's of bioscience (It's on hold this semester for reasons I'll explain later) I have enough credits for a diploma if I leave uni. I have a variety of work experience I worked as an all-rounder at a jumping castle and party hirer business (from 13-18), I was an assistant at a cattery from 12-18, built fences for 2 years, did night fill at a Woolworths for a year, Chemist warehouse for 2 years too as a clerk, Mcdonalds for 2 years as a back of house and most recently (18-21) I've worked at a well respected 4x4 company making canopies (2 years) on afternoon shift and then when I was moved to another section I did powder coat for 6 months and then I found a better job within the company and I became a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) administrator which I've been doing for 8 months now. I have 60k in stocks (an ETF called VDHG) and a house with my partner I bought a year ago for approx. 400k. 

  
CMMS admin is a **mint** job. It's super cushy, so I don't want to leave. I make $30 an hour, and there's OT that I can work for during a couple of months when business is going well. However, I'm afraid to leave because I don't know if I'll survive a job where I have to work hard (mental health issues).

  
With all the above said my next goal is to set something up so that when I eventually (in a couple of years) leave or get moved from my current position I have a place to go. I don't know what to do and with today's job market I don't know where to even start. I've applied to 200 ish jobs maybe 10 of which I was ""qualified"" for and I put effort into tailoring my resume and cover letter to get. Of the 200 jobs I've applied to only 1 had less then 200 applicants. I've applied to mostly lab tech roles or other maintenance admin adjacent roles which I could reasonably do with experience that I've gained through work and schooling.

  
for my next job, I want to earn as much as I can but realistically I'm aiming for 70k AUD a year and I want it to have 2 of these four things: be super easy, have room to progress, be able to listen to music or an audiobook while I do it, get paid BANK.

  
I've looked into being a maintenance coordinator and Lab tech and these all seem like things I reasonably could be hired to do presently but I am having no luck. Not even a call back, what can I do to help my chances?

Next as sort of a start-again option, I've thought about I.C.T., Computer science, and FIFO but I need more information and for the first two I need a degree or way too much time to self teach and FIFO seems like as a job I won't be able to do as all I see is super gruelling roles (is there admin positions or easier non- back-breaking mid paying FIFO work?). If you have any information about these careers I would love to get information.

  
As a final question, what would you recommend I do if I was your kid? Stocks grow at something like 7% a year and I'm about 180k away from paying off my part of the mortgage. I hope to retire around 40 as I don't want to have kids and invest 50% of my income. What jobs should I look at that might suit me? What can I do to grow? Where do I go? I'm really afraid looking at the current job market. I'm not better than anyone else how will I get the job over 300 other applicants?

1ifuijs,25% Pay Cut for More Interesting Design Role?,"
Hello, 

I am about to graduate in June with a MSEE. I have two job offers on hand but I’m having a really hard time deciding which one to take. 

The first job is higher paying ($125k base with up to 20% profit sharing, $15k sign on bonus, $12.5k relocation bonus). It is a post-Si validation role for a chip company in the Bay Area.

The second job is lower paying ($110k with no profit sharing, no sign bonus, $5k relocation bonus) but will be for a power electronics board-level design role for a defense company in San Diego. 

Including the yearly bonus of 20%, I would be taking a 25% pay cut taking the design role. However, hardware design is significantly more interesting to me than hardware validation python scripting. My thesis project is also focused on power electronics. I’ve also heard that the growth experienced as a design engineer is very valuable. 

In my early career, should I take the money, or the more interesting job? 

Will the money literally “pay off” in the long run over taking a more interesting job? 

What are the career prospects for board level electrical hardware design? ",Normal-Perception834,1,1.0,0,1738492276,2025-02-02 10:31:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifuijs/25_pay_cut_for_more_interesting_design_role/,2,2025

1ifu4la,Career Advice Needed: Totally confused,"I will try to keep the background and the problem statement as concise as possible.

BACKGROUND: 

Did B.tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering.

Joined WITCH after graduation; worked there for 1.5 years. (Java based Support and enhancement project)

Went Abroad to pursue Post graduate Diploma in Cybersecurity (Although initially I was attracted towards it but after 1 year of studies, I realized that I didn't like either of its domain)

Stayed there for another year to recover some money that I invested. (So 2 years in total).

Now I am back in India and want to restart, and I could come up with a few options but really not sure how to present my case to the recruiters and which one to pick right now.

OPTIONS I have:

1. CYBERSECURITY ANALYST: 
This one is the most logical one but I really do not enjoy it so I know I am not going to excel in it.

2. WEB DEVELOPMENT:
I have the application support experience + I can learn new tech stacks and build projects too.

And can be honest with the recruiters that I enjoy development and Cybersecurity isn't something that I see myself doing.

STACK is another thing I am confused about:

A. JAVA spring boot : Showcase my previous support experience along with learning & building project's.

B. MERN : This stack has a lot of jobs according to my research, hence maybe that increases my probability to land a job.

3. EMBEDDED:
I used to enjoy working on MCUs and hands on project, used to be decent with C/C++ ( can revise by building projects on any industrial MCUs.

But not sure how a 4 year gap from the Graduation field will look like.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

I want to join the workforce again, with a good trajectory to grow and stick to the field I choose this time. I understand that the gap and my latest degree will not make my journey friction free, but I would like to know your suggestions which can help me in atleast minimizing it.

1ifs5lr,I have been fired 5 times in a roll in 4 years.,"Since the start of my fashion career from 2021, I have been fired 5 times in a roll. I’m a fashion designer. 
Do I need to test if I have autism or ADHD? 
At this point I don’t know what can I do.
No company wants me anymore. 
I can lie but I don’t want to lie. 
But no matter how “positively” I frame them, still concerns new employers.
I’m 36 now. lol.
1st job - toxic work environment and toxic boss;
2nd job - toxic coworker and performance issue. Not able to finish a tech pack. But I was never told I need to finish which parts of it. And I thought I did my part. Company complained me stealing kitchen snacks, which was for employees and I didn’t steal. 
3rd job - extremely toxic work environment and performance issue. I was being bullied discriminated at work and no one willing to help. At least this was what I think. And that drowned my mental status to extreme depression. After one time I made a mistake, I was fired. 
4th job - unintentionally violate NDA, completely unconscious. I posted a collab name on my portfolio website and founded by someone in the company. I wasn’t expect anybody would go search my name specifically to dig me. I think the company was suspecting me from the start. As my boss one time reached out to me and said why wouldn’t I open up and gossip like the other girls. 
5th job - my boss said I went behind her asking a designer position that wanted to take over her job. Lol. She said I don’t fit in the culture and asking too high position they cannot offer. They also suspect me trading secrets with suppliers which is a total misunderstanding. But they didn’t let me explain.

And all of them are less than 1 year. 
I just want to find out how to move forward. No one wants to hire me no more. 
Do I have mental illness or what? I can’t figure out. I don’t even know how and where to improve. 
I had a career coach and after hearing the details of each employment history, he just said I’m super talented and they all are sh*t places to be.
But am I attracting to those toxic places? Why? 
Is the industry, or is me?

Because each termination is a burnt bridge, I didn’t even get to have any connections built. And I wasn’t able to stay in one place long enough for people to get to know me.

I was born and raised in Asia. Is culture and bias play an important role? 

My friend keep asking me to let go. But these experiences hunts me still, in the middle of night. I got PTSD. Each termination was really ridiculous to a point I starts to doubt my entire being.

Help.

1ifr4mj,Torn between doctor and teacher,"I'm a sophomore undergrad right now and I'm at a crossroads in regards to what I want to do with my life. For a lot of my life, I thought I wanted to be a teacher. I tutored a lot in high school (and still do a bit of private tutoring), and I find it incredibly fulfilling. When I got to undergrad, however, I got on the pre-med track because I thought I might want to go into medicine. I've done very well in my pre-med classes so far (chem, physics, bio, etc.), and I'm really lucky that my school has a lot of opportunities for premeds, so I've gotten to do things like volunteer at a hospital, work part-time in a lab (I enjoy this as well), and shadow some physicians. I enjoy all of these things, and I could definitely see myself going down this path and enjoy the patient care aspect of medicine, but it doesn't feel like a calling in the same way that teaching does. I love helping people, caring for people, and being good at what I do. I also like having some degree of autonomy in my work.

The reason I started thinking about this again was that this semester, I became a TA for Organic Chemistry and it's made me more excited than I have been in a long time. Teaching discussion, holding review sessions for the students, and even answering questions in office hours gives me, for lack of a better word, an incredible high. I'm always excited for discussion to come around, it stays on my mind for hours afterwards, and I get  a huge amount of satisfaction out of helping people understand the content, especially in such a difficult course. In my own classes, I'm constantly itching to get up and teach the content myself once I've learned it, because I always think I can convey it better than how it's being taught. (Maybe that is just my own ego getting in the way, lol.) On days when I get to teach, I wake up excited simply because I know I get to teach that day. I was also really happy the other day because several students in my discussion section came up to me and told me that I was an incredible TA and they were glad to be in my discussion section, and it was just a proud moment for me. I think a part of why I enjoy it so much is that these students are more hardworking and motivated than most - I've worked with more remedial students (in math, mostly) and that definitely doesn't elicit the same feeling, but I still enjoy it.

Anyways... I'm really struggling to find the right path because there are many directions I could go from here. I could stop doing my pre-med activities and classes and focus more on education-oriented extracurriculars and courses, and then get a job teaching high school after graduation (I wouldn't want to teach elementary or middle school - I enjoy the more advanced content). I could continue down the premed path, go to medical school, and then get a job as a doctor, and hopefully find some ways to teach there. I think in my ideal world, I'd teach preclinicals at a medical school or undergraduate premed courses and also have time to see patients. I don't even know if a career like this is possible, so I'd really appreciate any insight from those in the field of academic medicine on teaching opportunities. I could try and do a PhD and then teach at the college level, but I don't think I would like to do a PhD because I'm not much of an original thinker. I can do very well in my courses and I'm a dedicated worker, but I don't think I'm cut out for the research that a PhD requires.

  
A couple of other considerations that are on my mind when I think about this:   
Salary - obviously a teacher's salary will be lower than a doctor's, especially at the pre-college level. I'd like have enough to to live a middle class/upper middle class life, but beyond that point, it doesn't matter too much to me.  
Family - I want kids. I'd be ok going through med school and residency and having or adopting kids later, but I would choose a specialty that allowed me to spend time with family.  
Prestige - Another part of why I'm on the premed track in the first place is my ego - I want an impressive career and I've always looked up to those in the medical field.  
Job satisfaction - I want to feel satisfied with my work and not feel like I made the wrong decision or went down the wrong path.

  
I truly appreciate any help, especially from people in either of these fields. Thanks in advance!",Defiant-Food3603,3,1.0,3,1738477577,2025-02-02 06:26:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifr4mj/torn_between_doctor_and_teacher/,2,2025

1ifopz7,How Ai Will Gradually Replace Jobs: The Inevitable Shift,"
The job market is changing faster than most people realize. AI is no longer just a support tool; it is becoming the primary driver of software development, content creation, and labor in general. I’ve analyzed upcoming developments and created a timeline based on the current evolution of AI. If you think programming or any other human job is safe, think again.


---

🌐 2025 – AI Writes Code from a Single Prompt (Within 6 Months)

Tools like GitHub Copilot (the most widely used today) will generate entire modular software projects from a single prompt.

Code will become increasingly standardized and AI-manageable, thanks to larger context windows (a few million tokens).

Developers will initially need to fix errors, but over time, LLMs will reduce the number of bugs on their own.



---

🛠️ 2026 – Automatic Debugging & Reduced Human Supervision (Within 1 Year)

Larger AI context will allow LLMs to debug code independently.

Errors will become subtler—issues of logic and coherence that LLMs still struggle to resolve.

80% of programming will be AI-driven, with humans relegated to minor corrections.



---

🖥️ 2027 – Full Project Development with Minimal Supervision (Within 2 Years)

AI will be able to write, test, and fix complex software with minimal human involvement.

The IT industry will change radically: developers will become increasingly redundant, except for cybersecurity and AI system design.

80-90% of coding jobs will be automated.

🤖 2030 – Autonomous Robots in Traditional Jobs (Within 5 Years)

Cashiers, bartenders, factory workers, warehouse operators—the first human jobs to disappear will be those that are mechanical and repetitive.

These robots won't initially run on batteries (due to high energy consumption) but will likely use direct power sources or hybrid systems where the data center making decisions will be connected to the power grid, while the robot will communicate via Wi-Fi or cable, transmitting real-time video feeds and other data while receiving commands.

Entire industries will see a massive replacement of human labor.

🌍 2035 – AI Controls 99% of the Global Job Market (Within 10 Years)

""Prompt Engineers"" will become obsolete—AI will be capable of designing, developing, and optimizing any system without detailed human input.

Humans will no longer write code, design products, or perform any technical tasks.

The only human role will be to ""decide what to create,"" while AI does everything else.

🛑 The Point of No Return: AI’s Autonomy in Decision-Making

If humans grant AI full decision-making autonomy, it could mark the end of human control over technology.

Today, LLMs lack critical thinking, but in the future, they will develop a pseudo-critical thought process, capable of making strategic decisions and adapting in real time.

🚨 Conclusion: The Future of Work No Longer Belongs to Humans

The future that many consider science fiction is already happening. AI is progressively eroding the value of human labor, eliminating repetitive tasks first, then complex ones, and eventually, with increased autonomy, reducing humans to mere spectators.

Most people don’t realize this shift because it’s happening gradually. But within a decade, human labor will be almost entirely obsolete.

💡 It’s no longer a question of if, but how fast this will happen.

🚀 Those who don’t adapt now will be irreversibly left behind.

1ifm39d,What Career Should I Pursue Based on My Interests?,"Hello, I’m a high school senior, and I’m struggling to figure out what career path would best align with my interests. I’ve applied to colleges for mechanical, industrial, and human factors engineering, but I’m starting to feel unsure about which direction to take.

I originally wanted to go into Human Factors Engineering (HFE) because I love the idea of optimizing designs based on people's needs. I also enjoy building things and working with mechanical/technical stuff (I really liked working in CAD and architecture in my engineering class, and I like working on my car). From what I’ve seen, most people pursuing HFE get a bachelor’s in psychology and then a master’s in HFE, but I prefer the engineering aspect more. After researching online, I found that industrial engineering (IE) is probably the next best alternative to go into HFE.

However, the more I research, the more IE seems demanding in ways I might not enjoy. I don’t like writing long research papers or academic articles. I do, however, like learning about human behavior and using that knowledge to optimize designs, which still sounds interesting to me.

Then I found out about industrial design (ID), and it seems like a great fit—except it's not really a technical field. While it aligns more with my creative and design-oriented goals, the field is highly competitive, and people have been building portfolios years before college.

I’m feeling stuck because I don’t know what career path would allow me to combine my engineering, design, problem-solving, and human-centered optimization interests. Some jobs I’d love to do (or something similar) include:

Designing spacesuits for NASA (focusing on how astronauts interact with and feel in their suits)

Optimizing aircraft cockpits (button placement, usability, ergonomics)

Designing cars and optimizing interiors (efficiency, comfort, usability)

Planning NASA’s future space colonies (how astronauts interact with habitats, designing base layouts)

I know these roles already exist, but they reflect the type of work I’d love to do. The problem is, I don’t know what career path would actually let me do this kind of work. 

What career should I pursue that aligns with these interests? Should I go into engineering, industrial design, or something else entirely?

1ifkpia,Career advice,"

Hi everyone,  

Throwaway account because my usual one has my real name in it—rookie mistake!  

I've been in a Director-level sales role for seven years. When I started, the company was a small, single-owner business. Last year, we were acquired by private equity, and since then, the new leadership has been toxic. While I’ve been considering leaving due to the repetitive nature of my work and the leadership changes, my job itself isn’t bad. I know it inside and out, and over the past two years, I’ve earned around $200K. The flexibility of working remotely (with some travel) has been great, and I have a solid work-life balance.  

Recently, a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn about a **VP of Development** role. I was originally looking for another Director-level position and never considered myself VP material. However, after reviewing the job description, I realized I’ve already done everything listed—except for budget responsibilities. The recruiter liked me and passed me along to the Director of HR, who also had a positive impression. Now, I have interviews lined up with both the COO (my potential boss) and the VP of Marketing.  

Some key details:  
- **Relocation:** This role requires moving out of state, but the new city is just two hours from family, so it’s not a dealbreaker.  
- **Compensation:** The base salary is **three times** my current base and would fully cover our expenses. However, total earnings (OTE) would be similar to what I make now.  
- **Equity:** I currently have some equity in my company, which I’d be leaving behind.  
- **Career Impact:** The company is undergoing significant changes in its business model, making this an exciting opportunity to make an impact.  
- **Work Environment:** Unlike my current remote role, this position requires being in the office five days a week.  

The biggest factor for me personally is that I have a **3.5-year-old and a 3-month-old**, and we currently have a nanny. A full-time office job would be an adjustment for my family.  

I’d love to hear from anyone who has made the **jump from Director to VP in sales**—how was the transition, and what should I be prepared for? Also, any **interview prep tips** for these high-level conversations? Finally, **if you were in my shoes and got the offer, would you take it?**

1ifk1wc,"Salary expectations and ""office hours"" - never figured it out.","I'm kind of new to software engineering, was working as a ""Technical Support Technician"" for 15 years, then got promoted into a Software Engineer role. Got impacted by a RIF after being a Software Engineer for 1.5 years, and got a new role as a Software Engineer, which I have been in for about 1.5 years now. So all in all 3 years of experience in the field. 

  
Prior to being in the role of a Salaried employee, I was purely hourly. I was expected to work 4 days , 10 hour shifts. Some times I worked 3x 12s, rotating to 4x 12s, to where I had 4 on 3 off 3 on 4 off...

  
I've kept that philosophy going into my salary days, both in my on-site role (which I was RFO'd due to asking why we had to be on site in a Ask Me Anything meeting...) - to my now fully remote role. This is great in flexibility, as I can work varying hours, take 2 hour breaks for exercise in the middle of the day, or work 9 hours Monday, 8 hours Tuesday, 9 hours Wednesday, 5 hours Thursday (half-day), and 9 hours Friday.

  
In stretches where I put in 50 to 60 hour work weeks, I then work with my manager to ""comp"" that time off, putting in several 30 to 35 hour weeks. Manager is cool with it, so never go bad ""vibes"" doing that.

  
What I'm a bit confused about is how other people handle this. At times I feel like I'm one of the only people flexing hours like this. Many coworkers I see just work 7-5, take lunch breaks, maybe go pick kids up - but sometimes I get the impression they are doing at least  46 hour work weeks. My peers are also in Senior level positions, and I apparently found out I was in a Junior level role (3 years direct experience doing what I'm doing now.)

  
Is there a unwritten rule that you always should put in 45-50 hour work weeks in a Senior level role as salary, or in many Salary roles? Or you can't advance from entry level to mid or senior level without putting in more than 4 hours of extra time each week? 

  
Or does it matter as long as I'm ""billing time"" accurately? I keep a personal spreadsheet for the past 4 years of hours worked to keep it straight in my head, but even though it's straight on my paper, I'm wondering if anyone really even cares, tracks it beyond what is ""billable"" (as training in many cases is not, if I want to do training I almost have to put in ""overtime"").... 

  
Just figuring out the ""expectations of hours"" when salary has always been confusing to me in many ways. ",f00dl3,0,0.5,4,1738454104,2025-02-01 23:55:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifk1wc/salary_expectations_and_office_hours_never/,2,2025

1ifiz9d,Should I take this (somewhat sketchy looking) graduate job?,"Hello everyone,

I am a final year student at uni studying computer engineering in the UK, and I recently received a job offer from a geological software development company to join their ML team. They primarily deal with oil/gas companies, they have a software for modelling stuff for oil rigs etc. The hiring process was quite straightforward and the people seem nice enough, the location is quite nice too, its a quaint and well-to-do town near London. The pay they're offering is really quite good (especially given the avg grad engineering salary).

The problem is that I am not stoked on the company. I know this sounds silly, but I just read through their glassdoor page and they have scathing reviews from current and former employees. Apparently they have a toxic environment that is managed very much like a call-center. These reviews also stated that they suffer from high staff turnover. The environment is generally quite depressing they almost expect you to leave. All of it sounds quite bad, though the reviews are from 2ish years ago and since then the CEO has changed and the company has undergone some rebranding and has relocated. In total though there are only 5-6 reviews, but it is a small company. In any sense, it sounds like a bad environment to join, and even if things have changed there I am hesitant to accept their offer. 

I did not get this sense when I went to interview them, but in retrospect they did ask me some questions that I think were odd, like if I prefer autonomy or do I work well under directions. I might be waffling a bit here though. Throughout the process they were fairly vague about the responsibilities of the role, stating that I'd be working on supporting software projects and incorporating new features while in their AI development team. Part of me is worried they'll just delegate me as a technical-support member, though I don't know how they'd do that since I know nothing about the petroleum engineering. 

Then there is the fact that they deal with the oil/gas industry, which is definitely a field I don't want to stay in - it all feels very morally grey and unethical. I am quite worried that working here will stain my career in some way and I won't be successful moving. 

Thing is they're offering more than double what the average graduate engineer makes though - part of me is enticed by this, but I also feel like I'm being led into a trap. I want to continue applying to other places, but I am worried if I verbally confirm my offer they'll push me to sign a contract and then I won't be able to get out of it. I always wanted to work in the tech sector, but I've been rejected by every other company and this is the only offer I've got. My academics are pretty good, and I go to a pretty good university too, part of me feels as if I am taking a step down since I am not joining a prestigious tech/financial company.

Ideally I don't mind making slightly less than what they're offering but at a company where the culture is good and the work is a bit more inspiring. But again, I don't have any competing offers and I have been struggling to get interviews/callbacks from other places. The job market is fairly bad I suppose, and I feel that I should be happy about an offer, but I have only been stressed so far. I got about 5 months before I graduate, and part of me thinks I have the time to search for a better role - but that's not a guarantee. I am just not excited about taking their offer, but the money is what is making me question whether I am being stupid about this. I would really appreciate some advice about how to go about this. 

\*Sorry for the long rant 

tl;dr - I have a high paying graduate offer from a company with terrible reviews on glassdoor. While they have changed upper management and relocated, I am not sure about taking their offer especially since they are in an industry I am not keen on. I am also worried I won't get to do good work and this will make it difficult to move jobs after I start. I don't have competing offers and I am not through to final interview stages with any other company. Should I take it?

1ifi630,Looking to completely reorient career; any advice appreciated (TLDR way below),"Looking to completely reorient career: any advice appreciated

As the title indicates, I am considering a complete career reorientation. Here is my full scenario listed out:

* I am a freshman computer science major currently. 
* In 8th grade, I have fallen in love with the idea of computing and how fascinating coding is. Prior to this, I went around telling people I wanted to become a doctor which is not really relevant to the post, but I felt like mentioning it.
* The former is what sparked me into going down the unofficial computer science route in high school meaning I have taken any and all computer science related courses offered by my school in a reasonable pace and standard.
* As a result of my time in high school being led majority by computer science, I applied as computer science at all schools and eventually got in and came here. During this time, however, my passion for computer science was diminishing and what was the start of another passion started to seep through the cracks.
* I started having a high interest in politics, government, and current events to the point where friends started asking me questions about daily happenings in these areas of life instead of consulting the internet because they knew I would know anyways.
* Over the duration of senior year of high school, being somewhat influenced by lawyer media and literature, I started to think about becoming a lawyer in the future but that idea got immediately shut down as I was applying to computer science everywhere or have applied already.  During the summer after senior year and up until this very point, I also considered going into politics.
* Another point to note is that several friends said I should switch out to a different major OR reorient my career in some way to include the following fields: political science, politics, government, law. (versus just becoming an AI or software engineer) This suggestion was in part due to me having failed two classes in my first semester one of which was a core computer science class. The failing was a result of my diminishing willingness and passion to expand my knowledge in the field of computer science and pure laziness. The suggestion was also in part due to my growing interest in the general happenings of those aforementioned fields. Overall, I am starting to slightly hate the idea of a computer science career.

I know this was a long post, so I appreciate you for having heard me out until here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated on what I should do next or if this is even the right pivot for me. (Or redirecting me to a better source/subreddit for this) For a starter, some of what I thought about doing follows:

* Continue my computer science degree, but join organizations that have a focus in the fields aforementioned so that getting into law school is possible. Then, try to get into law school and progress in whatever path I choose after that (become an attorney, start a political campaign, etc.) While I am trying all this, I still stay faithful to the idea of a computer science career and try to get internships and build my resume to have a prosperous and potential career there.
* Change my major to one of the aforementioned fields and go from there. If all goes wrong, I join a bootcamp or build my skills some other way that is cheap after graduating (as one of the aforementioned majors) and go down the computer science career path given that I already have some introductory knowledge in the field.

Thanks again for any advice provided. I need a logical base to go off of in order to talk to my parents about this, so that's why I am turning to this forum. (They are the ones funding my education in part - a huge part.)

TLDR: Changing career path from computer science to law; any advice on how to move forward, if this is even the right move or anything would be appreciated (even redirecting me to another appropriate subreddit would be fine)",coolestFreshman,1,1.0,0,1738448795,2025-02-01 22:26:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifi630/looking_to_completely_reorient_career_any_advice/,2,2025
1ifhyjc,Hustle and grind or military,"“Last year, I was a QA intern at a small company, where I had been for two years. My plan was to stay for another year to either move up or, if not, join the USAF Reserves to get a security clearance and pursue contract work. However, I was laid off just after graduation and quickly started fast-tracking my enlistment. Meanwhile, I continued applying for jobs and landed a position that doubled my salary to $80k. While this new job is a great opportunity, I recently spoke with someone who helped me realize that after-tax pay, along with the current job market, may make it harder for me to pivot into a new role as I had hoped. Now, I’m thinking of joining the reserves to secure something long-term for my family, but I feel like I might not have enough experience yet to easily transition back into the civilian job market. I also worry that the longer I wait, the harder it will be for me to join the reserves. But at the same time, I just started this new job three months ago, and I don’t want to leave too soon.

1ifhxae,Help with a problem in a professional situation? Someone is taking credit for my work!,"A few details about me and my professional situation: I work as a project manager in a DAX-listed company (DAX = most valuable company’s in Germany). My direct supervisor is retiring next year, and I had hoped to take over her position. To position myself for this role, I took on one of the most important and largest projects of recent years about a year and a half ago—with the goal of making myself visible and proving my leadership skills.

So far, everything has gone excellently: All previous project phases have been successfully completed and praised by my team lead, her superiors, and management. However, a few months ago, at the start of the most crucial phase of the project, management suddenly decided to bring in an external project manager. Officially, we were supposed to lead the project together, but on paper, he is positioned above me. There was no clear justification—I suspect that a decision-maker in management had a bad experience with a similar project and is now being cautious.

My problem: The external PM doesn’t really understand the project. His planning is often unsuitable, and both my team and I notice that many things are not well thought out. Time and again, I have to correct things or give him hints—only to see him present them to management as his own ideas and get all the credit. This feels extremely unfair: I’m doing the real work but receiving neither recognition nor appreciation.

Now, I feel torn. On one hand, I could stop fixing his mistakes—but that would put the project at risk and make things harder for both me and my team. On the other hand, it’s technically no longer my responsibility since I’m not in overall project management anymore. Still, I wonder: Isn’t this exactly what is expected of a future leader?

Lately, I’ve been subtly hinting that certain tasks fall under his responsibility. However, he still makes decisions over my head—even in areas that are actually my responsibility. Management isn’t aware of this and assumes I’m just continuing to do my job as usual. Discussions about clear role definitions haven’t led to any real changes.

My main goal is to leverage this project to advance my career and position myself as my boss’s successor. I’m now wondering: What’s the best strategic approach? Has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I ensure my contributions are recognized—without getting caught up in pointless power struggles? Has anyone here worked as an external PM—how did you handle such situations?

Looking forward to your insights!

For context: Our management is also being advised by a friend of the new PM.

But as I waited for the classes to start, I was going to job fairs to see what was out there. I saw that one school was offering free IT classes, so I was like ""why not"". The CNC class is ok but i'm really enjoying the IT class. The first IT class is just a ""fundamental"" starter class but I really want to go for there A+, network+ classes and maybe getting a entry level job with one of those. They also have a sec+ class that I could take too if i'm still struggling to look for a job. I pretty confident I can have a job fairly easier in the cnc program right after school (3 months) but idk about landing a job with the 3 or 4 IT certificates that I would get with the other school (about 1 year if I that all three classes).

1ifhc3v,Stay or go?,"Hello! I need to make a significant career decision and would love some advice. A little background is provided here:

- I'm currently working as a Senior Marketing Manager for a top 10 global pharma company, in the UK. I joined this company in Jan 2024 as analytics and reporting manager, saw an opening for my current role, and switched to this one in October 2024 for a 12 month rotation. I make about £80k a year gross.

- I'm an Indian, currently in the UK on a skilled worker visa, which is tied to my role.

- My company has been laying people off every now and then, worldwide. It's on a streamlining spree, and ever since I've joined the company, I've seen some or the other area being trimmed every other month or so. After every round, leadership reassures us that it was necessary and that it's over, but now I find it very difficult to believe them.

-I have another job offer, in a big 4 consulting firm, working on the same field as my old job (tech, analytics, AI etc). It's for about £100k a year.

So with this in mind, should I switch jobs and opt for safety, or role the dice and stay in my current firm? I like what I'm doing right now and also like the people I work with. The increased salary, while nice, isn't exactly an overwhelming factor. If I wasn't nervous about the layoff situation, I wouldn't be considering a job switch at this point. Added to it is the worry that if I do get laid off, it has implications on my visa too and my life in the UK would be upended as a whole.

1ifez5o,FP&A to IR – 40%+ Increase & Equity At Cost Of In-Person And Stark Industry Change?,"I’m currently an SFA Lead at a large F500 where I’ve spent most of my 6-year career in an industry I truly enjoy. My role has evolved from the boring, soul-sucking grind of being a business partner FP&A analyst—spending my days focused on monthly expense variance reports and ""timing"" updates—to a dynamic, revenue and margin-focused position (think S&OP/IBP). I earn a $105K base plus a 10% bonus and work fully remote.

Recently, an F1000 company approached me for an IR Manager role offering a $140K base, a 12% bonus, a $15K sign-on bonus, and $10K in equity. The role is hybrid—remote on Monday and Friday, in-office Tuesday through Thursday—and involves reporting to the Treasurer, with direct exposure to the CFO and CEO (including travel to conferences). They’re in a different, less “sexy” industry that focuses on cyclicality and low margins compared to the innovation and higher margins of my current field, though both companies are tech enabled. The move is easy to explain: I’ve been looking to transition from remote work to an in-person environment for greater growth and opportunities.

I have some IR experience from flex projects and would be open to a full-time run at the role. This opportunity aligns with my passion for investor relations and strategy—especially with my upcoming top PT MBA program.

That said, the move does come with some risks. At my current $20B company, I’ve built a strong network with leadership that champions my performance and shields me from RIFs and restructures. My manager has been incredibly supportive—providing more responsibility, a seat at the table, and constant challenges. In similar roles at other large companies, I’d likely be expected to do much the same: maintain a track record of few mistakes and cultivate solid relationships—areas I’ve worked hard to excel in. I genuinely enjoy the benefits of working in-person, which is a major draw for me. So, while leaving this safety net is not without its concerns, it might just be the calculated leap I need, but it feels very scary to leave somewhere I am so entrenched, protected (for now), and comfortable, for somewhere new where I will need to do the usual 6-12 month grind of meeting people, learning the business, falling on my face sometimes, etc.

I also recall a recent post on another sub arguing that success is about positioning yourself with top executives once you’ve proven yourself. In this new role, I’d be doing just that, which is both exciting and daunting.

What do you think? Has anyone made a similar move? I’d love your advice and experiences.",MBAFPA,1,1.0,0,1738440220,2025-02-01 20:03:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifez5o/fpa_to_ir_40_increase_equity_at_cost_of_inperson/,2,2025

1ife276,Should I ask for more money or wait?,"As of May 2025, I will have been the assistant manager for a popular café/restaurant in my area for a year. I've worked for this company on and off for 2-3 years prior before getting this promotion and it's great. I work 6 days per week, 40-45 hours and feel fulfilled with my duties. I wake up and I love what I get to do. The kicker is that my take home pay per month varies between $2800-3200 (lets average this out and call it $36,000 per year). This is in the ideal situation that I'm working 40-45 hours every week of every month which is not always the case. 

There are opportunities for growth in this role. My boss and I have talked about potentially getting me involved in owning a percentage of the business, but nothing is guaranteed and that wouldn't be a conversation for another year or so. I'm recently engaged and I'm feeling the financial pressures of being adult and wanting to start a family in the next 2-4 years. I want to start paying off some debts and generally make enough money to enjoy myself and provide for a family one day. My fiancé and I get by on both of our smaller salaries, but I want more. 

For more context: I don't have a degree, but I have over 6-7 years of experience in café management and I genuinely love it. I want to stay in this field of work, but I simply want to make more (as many others do).

1ifcsdh,I'm in a difficult position and need some advice on how to move forward.,"It started back in October 2024. I got a new job as a bartender. Started the fulltime job and loved it, the work and pay were decent and the coworkers were amazing. Met a girl and after some time was afraid I would not have time for her if I kept working late shifts (I worked mostly until 11-12pm).
I then started to feel kinda bad about the job just over a month in. I felt bad about the hours, the management and the overall things I had to do during work.
I told my boss that I wanted to quit, but he gave me time to think about it. After a week we got back together and I asked if I could work part time. He told me that I would still be working into the night if I stayed. I then quit my job.
The first days it felt good to have left the job, but after a short time I wanted back and missed everything. I talked to my boss and did a presentation and he re-hired me. Only downside is I could not start as a bartender again as there was no need for an additional one at that moment in time. He said I could work in the kitchen as a salad chef and in 2 months or so we would see if a position at the bar opened up for me to take it. I agreed even though I hate kitchen work just to take the chance to be the first choice in the future. But now I feel really bad working in the kitchen. I feel isolated from the coworkers I used to work with as I dont see them quite as often, I feel like my potential as a bartender is being wasted. I hate overall working in the kitchen and I am worried that I wont get the chance to go back to bartending at that place. I know I just need to push through and wait it out until maybe the beginning/middle of March, but it just seems so far away.

1ifbkwi,I work for a high-growth (but toxic) startup. A potential payout is coming. Should I stay?,"Using a burner, posted in one other thread. I've been with my current company 2 years last month. Trying to decide if I should stick it out or not.

Here are some details:

* I got into this role accidentally. I was self-employed for many years and they offered me a job after doing some 1099 work. Since coming on FT, I've been promoted several times. I'm making more than I ever have, and I was given equity last winter.
* I've survived 5 leadership changes am the only original member of my department left. My boss, who joined shortly after I did, just resigned. We were close, and he protected me from tons of the BS. We've joked for months about who would go first. Now, I'm by myself and will be expected to take on some of their responsibilities with no pay increase.
* Under current leadership, we are shameless about delivering poor quality work as fast as possible. We take advantage of our clients, who, without being too specific, are in a vulnerable position and only work with us due to extreme need. We promise hope, but never deliver. This part I'm numb to, but it's exhausting.
* The culture is passive-aggressive, hostile, and fake. It wasn't always this way, but has been since this new leader took over. She doesn't like me because I push back, but people above her do. My job is likely safe if I want it, but she could make my day-to-day even worse.
* **Here's the kicker**: **The company took on $23 million in Later Stage funding at the end of December 2024**. Previously, they only ever took on $6 million total over 2 rounds. The owner is an old man, and I have it on good authority (his own family within the company told me) the goal from day 1 was to fatten the pig and sell it.

It seems the end is coming, but I don't know how much longer I can do this. 1/5 of my equity has vested as of this week. If the company sold, all of my options would vest and (I'm guessing) I'd cash out about 12-18 months of my current salary. (Low six figures.)

You might think ""sounds like a shit show, no one will buy that"" - it is, but the owner is well connected, and our board is full of people who have built businesses in this industry for 20 years. We're also the only company doing what we do. They're gonna sell, although it's hard to say for how much.

Mentally, I am tapped out, and my health is suffering. I have been looking for work since November, but the landscape has changed. The market for my preferred work isn't great.

**If you were in my position, would you stick it out?**

**And can anyone give me insight on when they** ***might*** **sell? (I know this is a crapshoot.)** If it's going to be more than 12 months, I'd rather just leave now.",National_Tune3252,5,0.7300000190734863,41,1738431429,2025-02-01 17:37:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ifbkwi/i_work_for_a_highgrowth_but_toxic_startup_a/,2,2025

Nothing I do seems to make a difference.  I don't have family or personal accomplishments so it's even more embarrassing to have none of those and still be failing career-wise.

Nevermind that my center has been struggling to win substantial work for the past year, which is completely out of my control. The work is always either too much or none at all. Every week feels like a new crisis. I can't do it any more.

I want to switch to the private sector. I have been considering doing something related to AML for a banking institution or something like that. I don't care about using my justice degrees, I just want to have a stable job with reasonable hours.

I have experience in GIS, qualitative and quantitative data analysis, survey and study design, customer service, stakeholder and client interaction, and report writing.

Thanks for reading.

TLDR; Must escape nonprofit work. Looking for a job with stable hours and growth potential. Does not have to be related to criminal justice. Not having billable hours would be a plus.

1ifa1un,Can’t decide between two summer internships,"Hey everyone, hope you all are doing well. I am a college junior who is slowly realizing that it’s unlikely that I will be able to work the two internships I am in the final stages of the application process for right now. Here’s the deal: 
1. The first internship is something really personal to me. I would be working in a leadership role at my favorite department in my university, and it includes many things I love to do. It starts at 21 hours a week in June (7 hours a week for 3 days), then increases a day (+7 hours) each month until the end of August. I would also be provided with free on-campus housing for the summer, since I do not live and cannot commute locally unless I find somewhere I can live for the summer. The pay is $15 an hour. If I were to get this job and don’t do #2, I would also be working at my university library as a front desk worker for an additional $15 an hour, for a maximum of forty hours a week between that and the internship.

2. The second internship is likely better for my career. It’s a summer analyst position at an investment management firm, which, if I do well there, could lead to a job between graduating college and grad school. I also imagine it pays really well, definitely better than #1. However, I’m pretty sure I’m being considered for a full-time position, which unless I somehow negotiate to go down to part time (which would be best-case scenario), I won’t be able to work #1 at the same time, and would have to find nearby housing elsewhere. I really don’t want to live by myself, mainly though due to my social anxiety. 


TL;DR: I’m stuck between choosing between two summer internships, the first is really personal to me, and provides on-campus housing. The second is better for my career but I would need to find housing, even though my parents said they’d pay for it. Ideally I work #2 part time and still do #1, but I’m not sure how to bring that up to HR at my final interview for #2.

1if9dz0,Am I shooting myself in the foot?,"Tl;dr - I’m tired of struggling in my analyst role because of my incompetent manager, and I worry about it impacting my career. I’ve looked for another role internally and have an interview coming up. However it’ll be a step down (back to coordinator position) and with one of our cross-functional departments. My current role and the one I’m interviewing for are both related to finance although quite different. Titles at my company are pretty flat, so a coordinator does get paid pretty well here compared to other companies since some coordinators here are fairly experienced. I’m not sure if it’s a bad move to pivot though, and I don’t want to act impulsively. Would it be better to stick it out and stay in my current role even though I probably don’t want to be in it long-term because it’s quite niche and my team’s future is unclear? 

—

I’ve always struggled with figuring out a clear path for my career. I’ve worked mainly administrative and very junior operational roles at the coordinator level. Two years ago, I landed in what I thought was a great opportunity at a notable company. It was a coordinator role with potential for growth into an analyst. I was promoted to analyst last year, but my promotion coincided with my team’s restructuring so I had mixed feelings.

As a part of the restructuring, I became a part of a newly formed sub-team led by one of the existing managers who went from having 0 direct reports to 6. This manager has a lack of vision, organization, and trust for our team. She doesn’t encourage/allow a lot of collaboration among the team members, so we’re essentially left to figure out things individually or only with her. One of the primary issues is that she’s leading workflows she isn’t familiar with so they don’t run as smoothly as they would if she would just let the IC’s on the team work on them together. She’s also a huge bottleneck to a lot of our work because she wants to sign off on everything, but her bandwidth doesn’t allow for that so things just sit and get delayed. The list goes on and on, and that’s why we’ve had a few feedback sessions already with her manager and HR.

I don’t know for sure what the plan is for this situation - whether my manager will be let go and/or  the team will be dissolved - but this stuff also takes time. What I do know is that I’m losing out on proper training because I’m stuck working closely with her instead of my teammates who have a better grasp on our processes and are better at teaching. My teammates and I have become really deflated dealing with our manager and our team’s lack of structure. Whenever we try to implement structure and organization, she sends us down a winding path because she wants to think about what we propose or has us start all over but halfway through she changes her mind or realizes she didn’t think it through and sometimes things are just left incomplete.

I’m tired of struggling in my role because of my incompetent manager, and I worry about it impacting my career. Having this title on my resume creates an expectation, but I don’t feel confident in this role and now I’m losing interest as well. I’ve looked for another role internally and have an interview coming up. However it’ll be another coordinator position and with one of our cross-functional departments. My current role and the one I’m interviewing for are both related to finance although quite different. Titles at my company are pretty flat, so a coordinator does get paid pretty well here compared to other companies since some coordinators here are fairly experienced. I’m not sure if it’s a bad move to pivot though, and I don’t want to act impulsively.

Would it be better to stick it out and stay in my higher role? While the pay is good, I would just feel very unhappy until things get resolved with my manager/team but I don’t know how long that will be, and I don’t want to waste my time floundering in my current role. I also don’t want to get pigeonholed because the work I’m currently in is much more niche than the work of the cross-functional team I’m interviewing with although eventually many of us will find ourselves in a specific type of function.",1-elle,2,1.0,2,1738425655,2025-02-01 16:00:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1if9dz0/am_i_shooting_myself_in_the_foot/,2,2025

1if95mw,"Help! Need OUT of healthcare, but what do I even do next? Healthcare is all I know","I’m currently a DBD for a nursing home and have been doing sales and marketing for nursing homes, home health and hospice for the last 5 years. I am also a licensed clinical social worker and prior to going into BD I was working at a hospital as a social worker. I also have a couple years experience working in addiction. 

But, I want OUT. I don’t feel like my skillset is being utilized to its full potential and that I could be much more successful in another role/career but have zero clue what that career is. I was initially interested in CSM and think I would do really well in a position like that, given my unique background. But, I think it was just one of the first roles I kept coming across again and again that I latched onto the idea of it and don’t truly know if that’s best for me. 

Ideally, I would love a position that is client facing and supportive. I enjoy talking to people- helping them find solutions and providing support. (The social worker in me) I also enjoy some friendly competition. I would enjoy something that involved me conducting trainings/on boarding for new staff or clients. I’ve always enjoyed being the person to train new employees for jobs I’ve been at. I cannot do anything that would involve me stuck doing tedious tasks, hours of reports or reviews of report analysis or related because I have ADHD and wouldn’t survive one day.

Currently looking for a new job.

I can’t do coding or finance jobs because it’s too complex and I don’t see myself slogging at these job for decades.

1if8av0,"Getting laid off, in need of advice","Getting laid off in 2 months. Been in biotech industry for 2 years and a few months (entry-level). Our company has been given the notice for our last day. There are a few positionings open for internal transitions to be announced soon. One solid one is a team lead for the same position responsibilities. My supervisor has been trying to convince me to apply. 

I feel stuck. 2 years and a few months coming out of college feels short. While I know it is an opportunity for growth, I'm afraid of the lead position for a Client. I've always naturally fell into leadership roles through taking initiation, been involved with organizations/projects taking lead, but never had the title for a work organization. I fear of the responsibilities of having to speak up, that is my weakness. I know it will come with a lot of challenges, and I'm just too soft-spoken/introverted and sometimes socially anxious. 

For this position I was able to get an insight by the direct team. It would be a start up. I'd have to set strong boundaries, to stay within our scope and to not allow the Client to step on us. I'd need to be assertive and stand ground for our growing small team. These things, I've been weak at growing up. I've made a lot of progress the past 2 years but have only started really taking action the past few months. With this new opportunity coming so soon if taken, 
I'm afraid to fail the team.

1if6cks,Should I leave my stable government job for the private industry?,"I recently started an entry level job as civil engineer with my state DOT, however another company I had applied to reached out offering me a potentially better job (they person they wanted failed a drug test).  The new job involves organizing minor construction projects internationally and then flying out to manage them for 1-3 weeks.

&nbsp;

DOT pros/cons (in order):

* It's a union job with guaranteed raises/promotions, as well as cost of living increases, so I know roughly what I'll be making in 5/10/20 years.
* The job is 100% in office and I don't particularly like working in an office.  On the other hand as a 9-5 I can keep my life on a daily schedule which I like. 
* If there's a recession I won't be laid off.
* While the job offers retirement after 25 years, if I want to go to the private industry it will be easier with this job than the private job which is more niche.
* The team I work with is great.
* It's in a slightly better location.

Private job pros/cons:

* The job is more interesting/exciting.  While I'm not thrilled about a ton of travel and an ever changing schedule, I also am thrilled about working on more interesting and impactful projects.
* If after 5 years I get sick of travel and want to move on, it will be trickier to find a similar job (because it is somewhat niche).
* If there's a recession I would likely be laid off, at least in my first year or two.
* It pays slightly more than I make now, but there's no guarantee that I'll get consistent raises/promotions.
* When I interviewed I did a phone screen and zoom interview, but never an in person interview (I never made it to that stage).  Because of this I've never met the team in person or seen the office, so it's hard to gauge if it's a great fit for me.  I also am missing some information that I was going to ask at the in person interview (exactly how much travel, career growth questions, OT, ect).  They need someone to go to a 3 week course soon which is why they offered me the job so quick, but this may be a red flag.
* I won't get an offer for a job like this again.

1if5qnp,My boss wants to promote me but HR won't let him. How can I vouch for myself?,"I graduated in December 2023 and began working in my first position in June 2024. In November, during a 1 on 1, my manager told me that he wanted to promote me to the next title level because he believed I was doing very well and far exceeding the expectations of my current title. My position has five tiers of titles, I’ll refer to them as Tier 1 through Tier 5, with Tier 1 being the lowest and where I’m currently at. However, he is expecting pushback from upper management (even though he is the highest level of on-site management for my department outside of the director) and HR due to my short time with the company so far.

Promotions at this company follow an annual cycle occurring in March and happen alongside annual performance reviews. Yesterday, in my monthly 1 on 1 with my manager he told me that he wanted to give me a heads up that the promotion to Tier 2 would not be happening. HR and the department director denied the move because they decided I do not meet the criteria for the title. One of the main reasons being that there is a one year tenure requirement associated with the Tier 2 title. He also mentioned that the company operates pretty tightly around this annual performance review cycle, rarely allowing people to be promoted off cycle.

However, he also told me that this year the company is allowing for an up to 4% merit-based raise and that while my raise would typically be prorated due to my newer employee status, he was able to secure me and promised I am getting the maximum 4%. I expressed my frustration with the situation, as the tightly controlled promotion cycle means I wouldn’t be eligible for promotion until March 2026 despite already performing at that level. I also pointed out that I believe I am at least performing at an equal level to colleagues that are at this Tier 2 level even potentially outperforming them. Particularly speaking about a colleague who is also a recent graduate and was hired directly into the Tier 2 level but is greatly under performing. Since my department is small, word spreads quickly, and I know he has had multiple discussions with supervision about his poor performance since his hiring around August. Although, I did not mention this part to him. He responded saying that he understands my frustration with the situation and how unfair it seems, even calling it ""bureaucratic bullshit"" but given that his superiors told him no, it’s out of his hands. The best he can do is come June, when I reach my one year tenure, he will attempt to write a justification case to HR and the department director requesting an off cycle promotion. This is not guaranteed and if it is denied, I will have no choice but to wait until March 2026. He also suggested that I can attempt to vouch for myself during my performance review as the department director will be there but emphasized I will need to bring strong reasoning for the promotion beyond just “my boss says I’m doing a good job.”  
  
What is the best course of action for attempting to advocate for myself during my performance review? Is it even advisable to do so? I have a few ideas of what I can bring up such as high output of work, low error rates, proven ability to quickly learn new techniques/technologies, and even suggesting some changes to the department’s practices with one of them being implemented. These are all things my manager has told me I am doing, but I’m not sure how this can best be worded during my performance review to sway the director, if possible.",BlackPlasticSpoon,0,0.38999998569488525,52,1738414618,2025-02-01 12:56:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1if5qnp/my_boss_wants_to_promote_me_but_hr_wont_let_him/,2,2025

Two weeks later I got another offer from another company  ( I'd call them B) so I was like I'd be loyal and not leave and rejected them. So my issue here is that I rejected company B and they offered me a full contract not starting off with probation salary id get my full salary. So fast forward to today I'm still on my probation salary with my current company when my probation was supposed to end 3 months and this is my 8th month. I'm getting really frustrated talked to HR countless times but she never does anything  but she said she will increase my salary after she talks to MD they even increased everyone's salary last year and they said they'd increase mine when my probation period was up. Last year I was a bit patient and never applied whenever i saw jobs being posted i was hesitant and wanted to get my 1 year job experience so i have a leverage atleast. opportunities are popping up and have applied for 2 positions at big cooperations hopefully I get called up for interviews at both.

1if28jf,Teacher at an International School,"Hi everyone,
I am a new teacher with a B.Ed degree from India teaching secondary students. I am 25 years old with a Bachelor's degree in Economics. I got a job in Dubai in a primary school right after B.Ed in 2024. I had to leave because of under performance but I found another job teaching EAL students in a UK curriculum school with Native teachers in Dubai itself. The school is only paying me enough to live here, I cannot build any savings. MeanwhileI see other teachers earning 14k AED, which is my ideal income in this country. I am on the fence about a couple of decisions in my life and career. My aim is to teach at a school where I am appreciated, in a country other than India. My life goal is to have my own house, car and save 50 percent of my income for retirement every month. 
I want to go back to school to become a primary teacher because I like working with primary school children. 
I am looking into PGCE primary in the UK. I am also eligible for a European passport because of my ancestry. 
Question: Should I go for a UK qualification and a European passport, then try for schools in Europe in the primary section? 
I cannot earn enough in Dubai to achieve my dreams at the moment. I don't want to enter any Indian-managed UK curriculum school in Dubai because I don't want the past to repeat itself. My experience and a lot of the people around me tell me it's a shit-show. And I won't get hired at schools that hire Native teachers because of my passport and qualifications.

1if1bh1,What do I do when I can't get a job in my career,"Hello everyone! I'm hoping you all might be able to give me some advice. Basically, I graduated from college with a degree in environmental science last may, and between the end of May and the end of September, I held a state internship where I was conducting water sample collection for bacteria analysis. Prior to that I worked at a nature conservation center doing everything from animal care to camp. 

That being said, I've been looking for a full time job since the end of June, and have easily applied to at least 400-500, if not more, jobs since then and have continued to come up empty handed. I have gotten advice on my resume and edit/improve it on a regular basis however can, and I feel as though I'm, for the most part at least, confident and friendly during interviews. I try to focus on what I can do for the compnay rather than what I want from them and feel that I conduct myself in a mostly competent way. 

But still nothing lol! Pretty much, I've kind of started to think that I'm just not going to be able to get a job in my field. As disappointing as that may be, it is what it is, and student loans don't care about disappointment! So I'm wondering what jobs I should try to go for. 

I think the main difficulty I'm having is that literally all of my skills, except for word, excell, general customer service, are all super specific to the environmental science rolls I've had in the past. Like, I'm worried I have zero transferable skills lol. If anyone has advice or suggestions on entry level jobs I should look into, it would be appreciated. Thank you!

1if16pt,"Mixed Interests, Financial Freedom, and Work-Life Balance?","
Hey everyone,

I graduated college and feel stuck trying to decide between three career paths—medicine/dentistry, law, and finance. I don’t want to invest in grad school unless I’m sure I’ll like the path, but I also don’t want to stay stagnant. I’m willing to put in the work, I just want to feel confident in my choice.

My Main Goals:
	•	Helping people in a meaningful way
	•	Achieving financial freedom (eventually earning $500K+ and having flexibility)
	•	Having a good work-life balance (I don’t want to be miserable working crazy hours forever)

My Thoughts on Each Path:
	•	Medicine/Dentistry: I enjoy hands-on patient care and making a direct impact on people’s health. But I don’t feel naturally gifted in math and science, and the long training period + student debt are intimidating. Dentistry seems like a good mix of patient care and business, but I worry about burnout.
	•	Law: I like the intellectual challenge and advocacy aspect, and I think I’d enjoy certain types of law (corporate, healthcare, or even public interest). I know big law firms can be brutal, but there are also more flexible legal careers. The earning potential is good, but I wonder if the work is fulfilling enough.
	•	Finance/Business: I like the idea of making money work for me, possibly starting my own business, investing, or working in private equity. The financial upside is huge, but I question whether it would feel like I’m truly helping people or just chasing money.

I’d love to hear from people in these fields about:
	•	Your work-life balance and whether you enjoy your career
	•	How long it realistically takes to make good money in these careers
	•	If you ever struggled with a similar decision and what helped you choose

Any advice or personal experiences would be super helpful. Thanks!",NoBlackberry3295,1,1.0,0,1738394920,2025-02-01 07:28:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1if16pt/mixed_interests_financial_freedom_and_worklife/,2,2025

So while I continue to hopefully recover or try to recover from my PTSD and other ailments, I am wanting to look into part time stay at home work and then as I hopefully force myself to leave my house 2 or 3 times a week (Which I plan on starting as soon within the next couple weeks) then I hope to find an in person job that pays more.

First one was for a customer service job at my current company (got it), second was for my current job as a digital marketing assistant (which turned into me being a social media manager), third was for a social media manager job I actually wanted but didn’t get, fourth was to be a flight attendant (didn’t want it but got it), and my most recent was for social media management (I’ve wanted this job since 2022 and I didn’t get it).

1iez29i,"My Manager is on sabbatical The Replacement denies my position, due to my disability.","I need help. TL;DR at the bottom. 

 As the title states, this is my current situation.

I am long winded, and I am mentally broken at the moment so it worse.

I cannot give any specifics since this is a well known place/industry/producer.
Non standard abbreviations
TR :The replacement
UM:Upper Management 
BB: Big Boss

I am the main provider for my family, my partner works full time but I was 72% of the income.

Some reference: This company is spread over 3 separate locations within the city, each with their own teams that all do similar work.  

My duties as they were presented to me: 
As HOD oversee and run three specialised teams consisting of 1 or 2 people +1 Jr. HOD. 1 team per location. It includes scheduling, product development (my passion and the main focus for them hiring me) costing, financial oversight, dealing with suppliers, and general organisation and management. A side part is to cover any gaps that may arise in labor due to absence of bodies. I have many years experience in all of these things and have achieved significant landmarks in development especially. 

The above is all covered in my job description this is primarily an admin role.

Upon my hire, there was an agreement that I would be paid hourly for any hours over or under accordingly.  This saves HR from having to do extra work to monitor my disability as their legally required accommodations would be worse for them than my proposal. Also it would facilitate me leaving when I can finish the work without pressure or social stigma. 

The contract states my salary for a 48 hour week and I am full time. There is no ""minimum hours"" given. I negotiated a 36-40 hr expected work week, Industry standard. I explained, with my disability, I can get a good 8 hours of standard work on my meds. The harder I have to work physically, the faster it wears off and I can't take more because it can incapacitate me. In the industry, shifts run from 6 to 14 hours. Stupidly, I said I would work up to 12 hours hard cap, big mistake.

Now here's the kicker. For the first year I had to maintain rappor and support as labor/general management, 2 teams and I was the 3rd team, me, alone. I performed longer than 12 hour shifts without breaks, that did not benefit me financially as the taxes taken out were in a bracket I wasn't earning in consistently and breaks were deducted whetherI punched out for them or not. I was new so i felt obliged to pull my weight and my partner couldn't contribute anything financially at the time I took this job.

  I was supposed to ease in to the management role, this was acknowledged and I was apologised to repeatedly, but they couldn't do without me in a labor role. (Sucks being good at what you do.) 
An opportunity for development (my passion) came and I seized it. I developed multiple items, made the plans, methods, arranged  accrual of supplies and put together all financial information (while still not having personal access to the systems) and sent out all information to the appropriate people. With nominal input, and minor changes made to only a single product, BB approved my items with amazing feedback.  Everything from other teams/locations excluding 1 product were scrapped and reworked from start to finish before approval. 
I saved the day, otherwise we would have nothing to move forward with, without a delay.

Later, I made deals with suppliers by using the values of the company as a whole. Since it is a singular brand spread over individual locations, you have to do a bit of mathematical legwork to get the numbers suppliers are interested in and UM doesnt bother themselves with that. I wound up saving 15.6% on costs for that quarter and opened up negotiations for other teams and UM. Now UM is interested, but feigned indifference, as I tracked what they proceeded to do since it directly effects how I will have to observe finances for my teams when I am required to.

My immediate supervisor(who also hired me) starts to work on becoming scarce in preparation for his sabbatical and training up his replacement.  I get the same apologies, and I am actually happy that I have gotten myself to the point I could start performing some of my role's duties while covering the labour. 

TR takes over and shit hits the fan, I am over worked to the point my disability nearly ended my existence. I arranged a meeting same day of my near life ending event to go over how TR can change my situation so I am not worked to literal death. I was told ""hold on for a few more weeks."" I was forced to play the disability card, and told TR, rightfully, NO!

 Now I am ""typed into"" a temp labour role and my actual job duties are no where in sight. For months I  have been given less than half of the industry's standard hours per week, and I cannot make ends meet. I had to get outside help financially. Because I am ""full time,"" I am not able to collect disability. There are no labor laws defining minimum hours.
I have complained to TR, HR, and UM. I have requested to arrange a meeting to square this away. I was told it is not a priority, after my 3rd attempt over the span of 6 weeks.
I currebtly see Jr.HODs have been given tasks that are my role, and their teams are struggling as a result.
 Development, other than the most basic yet picky for us, has also been given to Jr.HODs and I am not consulted nor even looped in on what is being worked on, at all. Ofcourse during time of presentation, it goes horribly, and TR's notes regarding input on ""changes necessary,"" all conflict with what BB has requested and TR has presented plans to me with said conflicting changes. 

I am at a loss, I don't know where to go or what to do. I cannot prove I have been discriminated against and I cannot go back to a full labour role, due to my disability. I currently am in the middle of an overloaded week only a couple hours off from what I had the week of my ""event."" I am desperate financially that I said yes to this despite the consequences.

Please Help!

More Info: Many years ago I maintained an extremely similar admin role to what TR is currently doing, for a much larger company. My experience tells me TR is floundering with the new position. TR is constantly harried and everything is last minute as they overloaded themselves with tasks that should be spread to other admin like me.

TL;DR: my replacement supervisor is not letting me perform the tasks that are my role, as I was hired to do. Also, refuses meetings to discuss issue. Instead, doesnt give me enough hours and schedules me as laborer, despite I hold an Admin position, due to an event with my disability. I can't make ends meet as a result.",SnooChickens4607,2,0.7599999904632568,2,1738386409,2025-02-01 05:06:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iez29i/my_manager_is_on_sabbatical_the_replacement/,2,2025

1iexpby,Need advice about how to handle drama,"I 17f work with alot of teens I believe 17-18 but there's a new boy not sure his age so maybe 16-18 we have a General Manager (I'll call GM) Assistant Manager (AM) and a Shift leader (SL)
Recently there was a mass quit where between 2 to 4 people left (Unsure if a person that always calls out quit but didn't tell because she works at 2 to 3 stores as a shift lead) 
But a girl my age (k) allegedly started flirting with a married 21 y/o (T) and one of the other people was best friends with T's wife (D) and one girl (P) was best friends with D.


K flirted with T trying to get him to give her something to smoke and when he didn't she told me and a girl that got transfered X and when we told her to tell a Manager because she said it was T that was flirting she said no and when we asked a week later she said that her family handled it 
Almost a month later I over hear F and  P talking about how K was flirting with T and I was like wait are you sure cause K told two people this and that and they were confused and was like no and then they started texting T to tell him and then D came back from break and was like wtf no that's not true I know them I daw the text from the wife's phone because I was at their house with them and their kids and read it from t and his wife's *JOINT* social media! 
K talks shit about all the managers and almsot everyone (besides boys our age because she thinks they are cute) and I wouldn't be surprised if she talked about me behind my back. Even the manager that she favorites. We'll today I and to clean a bathroom and asked her if I was doing it right and she waved me inside the bathroom and I thought it was because I missed something but she closes the door and starts yelling about AM from three days ago. And K just yells and I'm start having a small panic attack she shut the door abruptly just us two alone in a bathroom her back was against the door before she walked towards me where I was against the wall because I was panic at the sudden change of her slamming the door and yelling. 
So I'm against the wall she's now in the middle and I'm having a panic attack and I'm like girl stop I'm going to lose my job because you're yelling (I was really scared because I felt trapped as she yelled in the bathroom and I'm not saying I'm scared she'd hurt me but I wasn't sure if she locked the door and I was scared AM was going to come back from break and yell at us and get written up or fire us.
And after I'm like dude you scared tf out of me after we left the bathroom AMs nephews A and Q was there and so was AM' wife W and I'm having a panic attack only calming down because I used my ""rescue medicine"" that's for panic attacks and she starts getting upset that I'm upset but is still trying to talk about what happened days ago
So basically I'm wondering if I should look for a whole new job because I believe she's part of the problem or what especially because K is always complaining and isn't exactly doing her job 'right' not putting topping on the food right or packaging the sauces with the food and doesn't do register right and laughs about it constantly and I just feel like everyone else has to pick up her slack even tho it's split with like 3 or more people it's still extra stuff.

1iexhic,What to do with my new manager?,"27F in Toronto, working an ordinary office job. 

Our team got a new manager (let’s call them Z) this year. Z is internal to the company but not familiar with our team. Z brought 2 people with them (A & B), both external to the company. 

Now when A or B makes a mistake, Z will say anything to defend them and transfer the blame to me. The veterans of the team don’t know what A or B does on a daily basis. They don’t communicate with us. Very much an in-group/out-group situation. Z will always be on their side no matter what happens. We talked to Z about working more collaboratively and have team meetings so we can get to know each other. Nothing yet. 

Any advice how I can navigate this? I don’t want to quit my job with the market like this. Working with A & B is so painful for me and I’m walking on eggshells. Feels like I can’t do or say anything right.

Last week, I called the office and let them know I could start sometime next week. They said that was fine, and when I asked if I should send an update with the exact date, they told me to just email them.

Two days ago, I had something emergency come up and needed to push my start date to Feb 10, so I sent an email asking if that would work. I haven’t gotten a response yet, and when I tried calling today, no one picked up.

Now I’m not sure what to do— since I never gave them an exact date before, should I show up on Monday just in case, or assume Feb 10 is fine?

1iex1iy,Do I stay?,"Hi. I am in my mid 20s and have been very fortunate, working my butt off in my field to get where I am. I even went to school and got a degree in it. I work in hospitality and event management, I am finally in one of the management roles I was looking for since college. The property I work at is full of potential and very beautiful, I have a great boss, and my office mates are amazing.... However... a bunch of the departments I have to work with, including HR, has caused so much drama and many of which refused to do their jobs properly, which in turn makes me have to take over much of their role (in my case specifically accounting, but other departments too). I have recently been dealing with a significant amount of stress related to this, and I am going downhill with my anxiety again. Honestly, I don't feel any passion for this anymore and it kills me. I'm debating leaving management altogether, and just moving in banquets for now. Part of me feels like I should've gone into culinary instead (this was a heavy debate for me as I left high school) i don't know what to do, i can't ask my husband because he's at bmt, and I just feel lost. 

I guess my question is, do I leave to help me with my health well potentially damaging any future I have in this field down the road, or do I stick it out until we have to move in October well, potentially damaging my health in the process?",IkeaKat,1,1.0,0,1738379450,2025-02-01 03:10:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1iex1iy/do_i_stay/,2,2025
1iewmun,Petty Boss Giving Retaliatory Vibes..........,"My ""manager"" stepped down from leadership in August 2024. There was no further communication with the department, and he transitioned back to his original position. Fast forward to November and me receiving a ""below performance"" review despite no interaction with this manager since May 2024. The below performance review forfeited my raise and bonus. This manager has a history of telling employees ""to go to HR"" if they have/had an issue with his style. I inquired with HR how was it considered ethical to review employees that you no longer manage, to which my HR rep replied she had only been with the company for 6 months (super red flag). I have an inquiry with the EEOC in April based on this coming off as retaliatory. I've been with the department for 6 years and have applied to over 40 plus positions. The moment this manager steps down from leadership, I get 2 interviews and am offered and accepted a job, which was later rescinded, with the hiring department telling my department that they ""just have to hold me"". It's a super shit show and I really believe that this manager called himself ""sticking it to me"" because we butt heads professionally and he never had an answer for me when I inquired about (advocated) for myself or asked for clarification.

For context, I interviewed for an internship at Amazon and got positive feedback more than a week ago (about 8 business days now).

I immediately confirmed for July. But since then? Radio silence.

I followed up by email after 4 days, and still nothing. Meanwhile, I have another confirmed offer, and they’re giving me until next Friday to decide…

Is this kind of silence normal at Amazon?

Does it mean I’m on a waitlist?

Should I follow up again or just accept my Plan B and move on? (Knowing that Amazon’s offer would be REALLY good.)

1ieupul,Career change - thinking of leaving the corporate world in my late 20s,"I’ve been at the same company since I graduated college. It was a great company with a great culture and employees that had been there 20+ years. A larger, family owned business and saw myself being there for the majority of my professional career. I climbed the corporate ladder the right way and excelled in my everyday work. However, we sold to private equity four years ago and it hasn’t been the same since. Constant reorgs, no direction, and no culture. Some of us that have been around awhile talk about how things used to be and have hope things will get better. I’m starting to realize that it may not and looking at a career change. I recently moved back to where I grew up, and have been thinking about going to work for my dad’s small business with eventually taking over when he retires in the next 5 years. I never took an interest in taking over before as he never pushed my brother and I to do so. He always encouraged us to get an education and pursue our own dreams. My current work requires me to travel weekly across the country, which is time away from home. My wife and I are expecting our first child in June and would love to be home more to support them. Working for the family business would be a pay cut but enough to support my family. With my dad growing older, this would be the last opportunity to learn everything before he retires. 

Any advice would be very appreciated.

1ieu79p,"Got offered a job that pays 25k more, should i take it?","For context, I'm a Toronto-based software dev and my current salary is $115k (at Company A). I'm not actively looking but a recruiter recently reached out to me about a Senior Software Dev position at a local startup (Company B). I went through their interview and they made me an offer paying $170k.

I brought this to my manager, and they offered me a raise to $145k and a promotion to Senior Developer. I tried to negotiate but it seemed like this was as high as they'd go.

Now, the obvious answer might be to take the new job with the higher salary, but:
- Company B is fully in office and Company A is a very lax hybrid (which i like a lot).
- Company A has more paid vacation days and an equally lax nomad work policy (that i use every year to spend 1-2 months back home with my family).
- I also like my current team and a lot of the people i work with.

I'm not particularly passionate about either company's core product.

The facts i listed above and my gut tell me that i should turn down the offer and just take the raise at Company A, but i can't help but feel like I'm making the wrong decision career-wise.
