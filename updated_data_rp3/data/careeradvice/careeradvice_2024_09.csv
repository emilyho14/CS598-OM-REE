1ftaacv,Big tech vs. Big-ish tech,"Looking for advice. I work in software development and have been sort of progressing linearly for the past 6 years, currently in a senior role. I’ve moved countries a year ago and struggled really hard to get a job although eventually I did get hired at a startup. One of my closest friends also lives here and works for a big tech, but over the past 1 year there have been no openings for my role there. Last week, I got the notification for an opening I’d be a good candidate for and my friend could potentially be a good inside connection. The caveat? I just passed a lengthy interview process for a big-ish tech (apparently loads better than my current startup setting plus better pay). The thing is, now I’m wondering whether or not I should take advantage of this opportunity - given my friend is thinking of moving back home in the next year or so - and try to secure an interview for the big tech role. I’m super tired and have been working nonstop for the past 4 months, a new hiring process would surely be exhausting, so I’m not sure which the best route to take is. There’s also the conflicting emotions of passing this lengthy interview process, handing in notice at current job, almost grasping at stability… phew.

Any advice is welcome, appreciate it. ",NoLynx9211,1,1.0,1,1727740040,2024-09-30 23:47:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ftaacv/big_tech_vs_bigish_tech/,9,2024
1fta61p,Struggling with working at a small startup,"I'm not sure where to start, but I worked at a unicorn startup for 4.5 years prior to being laid off (economy reasons) in January so I have startup experience, but it was extremely organized and felt like processes & culture were established right. I got a job at another startup in June, but this startup is still in early stages as far as company structure, benefits, organization & information sharing, etc. I've been at this company for around 4 months now, and feel like I cannot do my job to the fullest function which is really making me struggle.

  
1. Lack of documentation - When I started, there was a half of a page with a RACI chart and extremely high level process of my projects. These processes I'm realizing are missing at least 3-4 steps in between each step because they have not been updated to reflect the company's current process. This has caused me to miss steps and make other teams upset that it is affecting their clients. I also have been hit with the ""well did you check the \[XYZ document\]?"" And I'll be shared a one-off document that isn't saved anywhere and is also not up to date. There's also no video trainings on how to use databases or when/why to filter for results when it's a HUGE part of doing my job correct. 

  
2. Reporting structure - I am an IC and around entry/mid level reporting to the Senior Director of the entire team (6 people - all directors as well). My Senior Director obviously has her own job and is very busy, but I feel I cannot get crucial questions answered unless its in our weekly 1:1, and sometimes they just can't wait. The reporting structure is difficult because as someone newer (and clearly not grasping what I actually need to do to be successful) I need more help/time that I really am not getting.

  
3. Workload is much higher than advertised - On top of trying to understand processes, I am getting drilled with work. Some within my scope, some outside of my scope. I would say i'm taking on 5 more projects monthly than was told I would be, and I would have to start doing some sales components - which was not in the description at all. It's probably because I'm not efficient enough yet, but some days i am working 10+ hours to finish my work. 

  
I'm just really struggling feeling successful at work right now, because I don't feel I was set up properly with the information and resources during my first few months. The co-founder will email me asking why I did something a certain way, and even if I think its right, its not. Now, its seeping into my everyday and honestly, affecting my mental health because I am fearful if I don't do everything perfect, I'll get laid off again and have to navigate this job market another time. I've brought all these concerns to my sr Director (who I can tell is also burnt out) but I'm not exactly sure how to have her support me when she also has no time to make things better.

  
Overall, I know this job is not for me long term, but really trying to figure out how to make it work. I'm not sure if i need advice, or just a place to vent. But thanks for listening.

1ft9icy,"How to handle serious issues with coworker and career sabotage?
","I work in the tech related industry, at a corporation.

A co-worker of mine (a woman) started exhibiting hostile behavior towards me (a man), when I was assigned a portion of a project that she wanted.

She confronted me asking me to explain why I was given that portion of work, right off the bat.

This was followed by some weird, death stare type behavior a few weeks later when I saw her in person at work (I am remote for the most part). She approached me and basically stared me down in a not subtle way, without blinking, asking me when I'd be handing the project over to her. The reason I am indicating she is a woman and I am a man, is that I do not believe this type of hostility will be as concerning to my manager, as opposed to if the roles were reversed.

Fast forward another few weeks, I complete my portion, two weeks faster than had been discussed and agreed upon, due to pressure from my manager to deliver it to her sooner. This was also odd, as she went on PTO fairly soon after delivery, so I feel like the time could have been better used.

I flagged items that needed follow up and handed off the work to her. I followed up several times offering my help and my presence to discuss and collaborate. I need to note that I was supposed to remain on the project in a collaborative capacity.

I want to also note that I tried a 'kill her with kindness approach'. Instead of reacting negatively to her behavior, I tried to really convey I was there in a team capacity and not a threat to her, and that my goal was to be helpful and ensure success for the project. I went above and beyond in the hand off to make things easier for her.

I did not hear from her nor receive any type of communication for about two months. During this time, she spent her energy making it clear to me and others that it was handed off to her, so I remained very hands off.

I later learned she did not perform any follow ups, nor inform me she couldn't so that I could do so.

Due to this, the issue I initially flagged and communicated turned out to be an anomaly in some data, leading to the results I had shared being inaccurate. The flagged issue was also not related to my portion of the project or new work, but rather incorrectly labeled data used as comparison, which I had no hand in labeling.

Instead of communicating this with me, or discussing with me, she held a meeting with the other stake holders to show them the data was inconsistent and call question to credibility of my work. These are the same stake holders I had been meeting with regularly, and with whom I am involved in collaborating with together on this project. I was specifically excluded from this meeting, when it would make sense I would be the most relevant to inform (regarding misaligned results).

I have now raised this issue with my manager and he said he'd talk to her about it, but I feel like I am in a very bad position if this is not taken seriously. I am also concerned because it seems like my manager is eager for it to be a misunderstanding, since she is a good worker overall.

We were supposed to work together, as a team, but instead she came off as hostile, territorial, and self centered. Another thing to note is if she had done the follow ups immediately, the planning for the project would have changed, so this impacted the company as well. It is very possible she was aware having done the follow ups (they are very fast, and pretty basic), and withheld it until enough time had passed so that she could reveal it in the manner that she did.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? What is the best way to handle this?",throwaway_job_help,0,0.5,9,1727737879,2024-09-30 23:11:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ft9icy/how_to_handle_serious_issues_with_coworker_and/,9,2024

Hey everyone, I’m looking for some advice on salary negotiations with a promotion. My manager says I’m on track to be promoted at the end of this year. My current salary is 87k and I’m slightly underpaid for my role. Earlier this year I asked my manager what comp would look like after promotion and I believe they said $95k. I’ve done my research and spoke to people in similar roles and $120k is what market pays for the role I’ll be promoted too. Obviously this is well above what my manager said and so I’m not happy.

1ft8nmi,"Currently a Civil Engineer, should I go back to school to pursue another career and face student debt?","Hello,

I just need a little guidance and thoughts/opinions for my future. 

I am currently a Civil Engineer in the Maryland area. I made 60k before I left my job to study for my F.E. Exam (required for growth in my career). However, I have problems deciding whether to continue since I do not have a major passion for Civil Engineering. In the start, I only chose this major by randomly picking an engineering major that would make “money”.

This leads to my dilemma. 

Should I continue on this track, or go back to school to pursue a career I am more passionate about? Looking towards nursing. 

Some more context:

* I graduated bachelor's in 2022 without any student debt; so heading back to school worries me about the debt afterward.
* Currently 26 years old.

Do you believe this is the right choice of going back to school, starting again, and student debt for a more passionate major? Or should I continue my career as a civil engineer with the perks of no student debt?

Thank you, any opinion or thought would be great.

I’ll leave some information on me and my previous jobs and experience and hopefully someone can give me some suggestions.

- I’m 19 and graduated high school in 2023
- I graduated through an online program through my district as I went online at the start of COVID and realized I prefer that due to my anxiety.
- I was a personal shipper at Walmart for seven months, up until this month.
- I do enjoy interacting with customers but feel I would he overwhelmed in a fast paced customer focused environment.
- I absolutely love working with children but after babysitting, nannying, and volunteering in classrooms I realized that’s not the path I want to take in life.
- I’m very passionate about supporting foster children and currently run a nonprofit organization directly helping children in care. I am also adopted. I would love to be able to foster in the future
- I did want to be a CNA however I really don’t think it would be the best as I don’t do good handling vomit and other bodily functions
- I can easily start working early in the morning and actually quite prefer it that way
- I love finding ways to help students succeed and on the side I create educational activities for special education students as I used to volunteer as a para educator 
- I work much better on my own as I do in groups 
- I do like repetitive tasks 
- I oddly like packaging up orders to be shipped off
- I feel I would like a job where I spend a decent amount of time doing office work however I’d also want other responsibilities which include interacting with and working in different parts of the facility.

The other details making my search harder
- I have a scholarship that’ll cover pretty much any college tuition in the state of Michigan, including online courses offered through a Michigan college
- I really need a higher paying job, maybe not now but something with the possibility to grow and earn more. With having  fiancée and knowing we want kids in the next few years, I want to be able to support us financially since I’m not sure either of us are fully comfortable leaving our child with a babysitter or at a daycare

Please feel free to ask any other questions you have as I really would appreciate any job ideas you have at this point. I know I’m still young but i genuinely have no idea what I’d like to do.

1ft84w1,What kind of jobs related to admin work should I look in to that will give me a bit more freedom?,"
I have worked as an office manager/the owners assistant at a real estate office for going on 3 years. I’ve had my real estate license for a little over 2 years. I am now studying to get my insurance license. 

I am so drained from my office job. I’m organized, I learn quickly, I review real estate docs for others, I do new agent training, I set up everyone’s systems, I am basically running a brokerage. That’s not being cocky, my bosses don’t know how to do anything that I do day to day. I have learned this from the few vacations I’ve taken while here. I’m good at my job but it is longer fulfilling. Real estate agents don’t understand that just because they work at all hours of the day, I do NOT. I’ve tried to make this clear but people don’t seem to understand boundaries. 

I’m not the most social person so real estate is a bit of a struggle for me. Last year I closed 4 deals, this year I’ve done 2, hence I haven’t quit my desk job at the office.

My bf owns an insurance company so I am working on getting my insurance license to help him out. I’d basically be handling all of the paperwork while he focuses on building the clientele. He travels a lot and works remotely so we’d both love for me to have more availability. 

I don’t want to solely rely on him for income once I am licensed to sell insurance. Any advice on other jobs I may want to look into? Don’t really want to go back to school but I’m open to gaining certifications.

1ft80af,Internal Job Application Expectations,"Internal Job Application Expectations 

Hey everyone,

I recently applied for an internal position and haven't heard back from the hiring manager- not even a rejection or that they are reviewing my application etc. I've met with her before about doing similar work for my internship for my masters program. However, I jumped when I saw this new position because it's exactly what I want to do careerwise AND it is somewhat similar to what I wanted to do for my internship. I meet about 80% of the requirements.

Has anyone experienced this before? What could be the possible reasons for the lack of response? I'm trying to stay patient but also curious about the status of my application. How can I kinda be like ""hey, i am still interested in the internship if i didn't get the role""? I just want to make sure there isnt any misunderstandings and I understand.

1ft7brz,Quitting Job to focus on degree? ,"Hi,

I’m 26 and hold a associate degree in chemistry. I used to work in the industry as a lab technician and later a sales representative. Both didn’t sit right with me and decided to go back to college. So now I‘m pursuing a bachelor degree in logistics management. I really enjoy it and want to work in this field later on. Only downside is that my school is remote and it got pretty lonely so I picked up a part-time job managing the inventory and purchasing for a small startup. It was also a great opportunity to get some practical training. 

Well now almost 18months later, I feel exhausted. I now work more hours than planned and things in the company got a bit rough. I got new responsibilities that have nothing to do with my former job description. Plus I‘m behind schedule to graduate 2026 and will probably graduate 2027/28 if things stay like they are. 

So I would like to quit to focus on my degree and get back on track to graduate 2026. The job itself is pretty much a dead end and I don‘t see room for future growth. 

My only fear is that I will have a gap in my resume which might come back to me when I‘ll job hunt after graduation. 

So I don’t know what to do. Is here anyone who has advice for me? How bad would a resume gap be? I worked continuously from 2018 to now. ",SunLess8626,1,1.0,0,1727732082,2024-09-30 21:34:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ft7brz/quitting_job_to_focus_on_degree/,9,2024

Those who have worked in the restaurant business would understand how hard it is to transition out of it because the money is so good and the flexibility of the work. Anyways, after leaving my bartending/management job that I had for 6 years I bounced around place to place bartending and serving since that’s all my experience has been, kinda the only jobs that would give me a chance. I’ve been applying nonstop to 
entry level HR jobs, but even entry level positions want experience not a degree.. it got to the point that I was applying to any position that had entry level work available & this has been going on for 2 years now. 

My interest are in fashion, art, culture, environment, makeup, skincare and community work. None of which MAKE MONEY. lol. I’ve considered working in museums but all my applications have been denied. As much as I like cosmetics, I truly believe it is over saturated and I’m not interested in the service industry much anymore. I have a love for problem solving and considered forensics but I have zero experience and authority research I’ve found out it is very exclusive and over saturated as well. I’ve considered being an ultrasound tech because they make good pay &are in high demand aka job security. 

Currently, I’m pausing putting in applications and trying to just focus on what the heck I want to do for a career. I’ve realized through this process and recognizing that I prioritize money as my motivation to work. I would love to help people, but overall I can tell in working in the restaurant business for so long that I work for money. Ive thought about going back to school and taking it more seriously, possibly law school but it’s extremely expensive and with my gpa I’d need a 170+ on my LSAT to be considered at any competitive school. (Which is possible with enough preparation) 

Basically trying so hard for a while to break into corporate has me considering it not to be the best option for me. I want to find something I can do for the next 10-15 years and be fulfilled financially. Maybe chase my dreams later in life? Idk, I just want to be an asset to society.

1ft5lkl,Current company is imploding and I don't know what to do... ,"As the title implies, my current situation in my professional life is quickly imploding. 

  
I have worked as a project manager for the same company since I graduated college (10 years this month.) Things have been great up until the owner/founder of the company, and my direct report, passed away in 2021 due to his wife pulling him out of the hospital and refusing COVID treatment. Since then, she has taken control of the company and it has been a slippery slope since she has been in charge. Immediately she cut off all of our company cards, denied travel, and started pulling money out of all of our LLC accounts for herself. She fired our marketing department and decided she was going to take it over herself. I would like to add that she has never been involved with the business at all. None of our clients know her, nor do they want to deal with her. 

  
About 6 months ago, she started aggressively emailing us. She would threaten to stop paying us or would cut off our funding if we did not follow her instruction. I have it all documented and safe on a backup hard drive. It's probably about 30/40 emails. She recently took away our contract bonuses (which is 40% of my pay,) cut our healthcare plans, and 401k. I no longer have health care or a retirement plan with my salary also being cut in half. She is apparently in the process of selling the company and has been since the beginning of 2023 but there are NDA's and no information. I have this gut feeling shes trying to sabotage the company before the next person takes over. 

  
I have been applying to jobs and have had a few interviews. I had one employer reach out to me about potentially offering me a job pending reaching out to past employers I had worked for. Come to find out, I was passed on the job because my current employer had apparently given me a poor reference and basically sabotaged my opportunity. I feel stuck, overworked, and mostly hopeless. I have had 6 co-workers quit in the last 3 weeks which has put even more work on my plate. I am un-married and single and don't have the savings to just quit without another job lined up. How do I move forward from here? I feel as if any job I interview for will be sabotaged. How would you move forward?

Loved it even though pay was low. I was able to get another job and today was my first day but my body decided to break down during my lunch break. This is a completely different role than what I'm used to. It's not accounting. It's a lot of facing customers and clients from all walks of life and taking phone calls and a bunch of other stuff that they drowned me with. I couldn't possibly remember all that in one go but I get the vibe that I better. The work varies highly. There's all sorts of situations. My last job was very routine based. I was desperate because I need money but I feel miserable. I also have a lot of pressure in caring for my mom financially because she can't make it on her own. I don't even know how I survived the interview. It was 3 people at once. Perhaps adrenaline. I haven't even gone through background check or whatever yet. The same day I did the interview, they called me and asked if I was interested and I said yes and that I start working today and that background check process will be later but they asked I bring 2 forms of ID (which they haven't asked me about yet). They took me a picture after signing papers about workplace safety. I don't know what to do anymore. Am I completely fucked? The place is so tiny; I also feel like I'm suffocating.

1ft46db,"Software Field or Prepare for govt job?...Need advice for a Computer science graduate (2024) who used to topper once, Talented but not studied to his potential in his btech (he just chilled in btech),prepared seriously for few months in final year and cracked a on campus MNC(around 7LPA - tier3 clg)","Here's my story. I was the district topper in my 10th class, and after that, my parents and relatives started saying I should become an IAS officer. Before that, I never dreamt of becoming an IAS officer. However, up to my 10th class, I was always interested in current affairs, general knowledge, history, and political science. Without realizing it, I enjoyed exploring these subjects, and even now, I stay updated with current events and remain curious about politics and history.As time passed, I also began to believe that I had the potential to become a civil servant. With encouragement from friends, family, and relatives, I started considering it seriously. After 10th grade, I got admission into a 6-year integrated BTech program at a government university. During my intermediate years, I studied hard and performed well, but once I started my BTech in computer science, I became more relaxed. Since I was a topper, I thought I could get good marks without putting in much effort, so I spent a lot of time watching movies and series instead of focusing on my studies.I rarely concentrated on computer science during BTech and mostly did last-minute night-outs before exams. Despite this, I managed to maintain a good CGPA of around 9. However, I never really cared much about the software field. I always thought I would only do a software job for two years and then start preparing for civil services. But as the years passed, I lost interest in civil services, partly because I felt I had wasted my four years of BTech. I decided to first secure a software job and then think about my next steps.In my final year, even though I didn’t have much in-depth knowledge of computer science subjects, I still scored well in semester exams by cramming before the exams. However, I felt far behind my peers who were more serious about computer science. This realization pushed me to start preparing for placements. I dedicated three months to learning DSA, SQL, OS, CN, and worked on projects. I thoroughly enjoyed this process, and surprisingly, I outperformed many of my coding friends who had been preparing for years, landing a decent offer of 7 LPA in an MNC (which is good for my tier-3 college).Interestingly, many of my friends who had started coding before me were either placed with smaller packages or were not placed at all. This made me realize that I had a knack for software engineering. I learned concepts quickly and started enjoying coding, even though I hadn’t done much DSA.However, the thought of preparing for government exams still lingers in my mind. On one hand, I feel that the software field is uncertain, and you constantly have to update your knowledge. On the other hand, I believe I have the potential to crack government exams like SSC CGL. But then, I also worry about the high competition and my family’s financial situation, which makes me think I should focus on the software field, learn DSA, improve my system design skills, and aim for a better product-based MNC in the future.Now, I find myself unable to decide what to do. Should I pursue a government job, or should I focus on improving my software engineering skills and continue in this field?

1ft3n43,Career Change from Analytics to Medicine,"Apologies in advance for the rant. 

While growing up, my parents always wanted me to be a doctor. I rarely thought about what I wanted, other than the fact that I wanted to make enough money to never have to think about it, so I stuck with what they wanted until I got to college. It wasn't until college, however, that I though medicine wasn't right for me because I realized that, at the time, I was only in it for the money and to fulfill my parents wishes. So, I pivoted to a career in analytics/data science because I was good at math/statistics, and I felt that I could still make good money without the enormous commitment of Medical school. 

Well, here I am a few years after graduating - and career-wise, I am miserable. I started working in analytics within Finance and I feel like every day I am losing a part of myself. There is no motivation or excitement to do the job. To get better. I dislike the office culture, I dislike the grunt work, I hate the excel sheets and the boring analytics, and I dislike the meaningless work that has no impact on society other than making my company more money. And I think the last point is the piece that is hurting me mentally the most. 

Currently, I make a very decent salary >$100K for the work that I put in. Other than the fact that I get absolutely zero fulfillment for my work, I have a pretty solid job that others may consider great. I have a great work-life balance. I have a decent salary that has some upside if I continue to work hard and get promotions and bounce around companies. I realistically work much less than 40 hours a week so I am probably fairly compensated for the work I put in. I am comfortable, but not happy. 

I have friends who work in high finance making LOADS of money, and they seem like they love doing it (or at least love the money). I have friends in tech who love it and the lifestyle it gives them. I have friends who teach, making pennies, who are so passionate and love what they do. And I have friends in/pursuing healthcare (dental and medicine) who are stressed, but are incredibly happy with their decisions in the end. I feel like I have none of this. I have nothing to talk about when someone asks me how my day was. 

After some thought last year, I felt that my best course of action was to ignore all of these feelings and continue to try to upskill and find a company that I could find meaning in. So I applied to a masters program in data science and started at the end of the summer. However, a couple months in, I still have zero drive to learn the material and feel like I made a huge mistake starting this degree. 

Over the past few months, I have been feeling a strong pull to go back to pursuing medicine. This started with a severe health scare that forced me to get an immediate heart surgery. I gained an immense admiration for not just doctors and surgeons, but the everyone in the medical field as a whole. It also made me realize that life is way too short to spend a third of my life doing something I have zero interest in. 

I have loved learning about the human body and optimizing health (mental and physical) for a few years now, and I have become much more passionate about diving deeper into medicine. And above all else, I have developed this powerful urge and drive to help the world in some way and improve the lives of people. I have been debating dropping the masters and going full speed in preparing applications for Medical school, but I am not sure if this is the right move. I have also thought about PA and NP, but I feel that if I were to make such a drastic career change, I would like to attain the utmost expertise in the field (meaning absolutely no disrespect to the PA and NP professions - I have an incredible respect for the work they do having seen it firsthand). Also since I am late to the game, I would rather put in the time (and money) now rather than pursuing PA or NP now and realizing I want to pursue Medical school even further down the line.

Note that I have zero clinical or research experience, so maybe this is all incredibly naive and immature to think I am suited for practicing medicine (I shadowed a cardiologist and a radiologist in high school, but at the time, didn't have much interest in it. Looking back now though, I would kill for opportunities like that again). 

I am 26 now, and am not sure if this is too late to make such a drastic move. I would still need to finish pre-med prerequisites and gain clinical/research experience. Granted I even get into a medical school, I would not begin until I was at least 28 or 29. All I know is that the analytics/data science/tech career is not right for me, and given my passion/interests/motivations, I do not know where else would be a good direction. 

Would love some insight, advice, personal stories, anecdotes, etc. Anything is helpful. Thank you!!!!",wander_lust8998,1,1.0,5,1727723019,2024-09-30 19:03:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ft3n43/career_change_from_analytics_to_medicine/,9,2024
1ft3ld5,Offer from one company - based on stopping interviewing with their competitor - how should I navigate?,"Hi there,

I am lucky enough to be interviewing with two companies in the same industry (hedge funds) in New York. I started interviewing with company A first although the role seemed a little junior for me - and I got an offer. Company B is the most well know name in the industry - and the big direct competitor to A

Unfortunately, the offer was a little low for me with most of the compensation deferred by a year in a guaranteed bonus next October ($175k base, $75k bonus). Using my current company's bonus approximation that I'd be forgoing - and interviewing at their direct competitor Company B - I got them to throw in a signon bonus and increased base salary (it was not much more that my current role) - $200k base, $40k signon, $50k bonus.

This offer however is contingent on stopping talking to company B - which is obviously unenforceable. Company B is larger and known to pay more than Company A - and the role is potentially more interesting.

I'm in a tricky situation - how can I keep the terms of Company A while also seeing out the end of the interviews at Company B? I'd like to evaluate both properly, but I feel like I am being pressured to accept A even though I am fairly torn between the roles.

1ft3al9,Need Advice - negative postmortem feedback coming,"I’m going to be real here—leading my team through a major initiative didn’t go as well as I hoped. Tomorrow, we have a project postmortem, and I sent out a pre-survey to get some feedback. The overwhelming response? That the project management was terrible.

I’m fully prepared to take accountability for where things went wrong on my end, but the feedback I received from the team is essentially that their work suffered because there wasn’t a strong plan in place.

What frustrates me is that, while I recognize my mistakes, the issues went far beyond project management. Here are a few examples:

	•	The content created by the team was rejected just two weeks before launch because it didn’t meet quality standards (it was for a national company, and everything was US-focused). There were six people who should have reviewed this.
	•	We didn’t have finalized speakers until 30 days before the event, despite me following up weekly for two months trying to lock this in.
	•	The translations team repeatedly provided incorrect documents, causing us to constantly revise them.
	•	Two key workstreams—strategy and metrics—never finalized their deliverables, even though I asked them to start months earlier. They insisted on waiting until we were close to launch.

I’m walking into a meeting where, for an hour, I anticipate a lot of finger-pointing at me without anyone acknowledging their own role in the project’s struggles. Only one person mentioned any of these issues in the survey feedback.

My question is: how do I handle this? Should I just sit there, take the feedback, and keep quiet? Or should I come prepared with examples of what went wrong in other areas, including the times I pushed for progress that didn’t happen?

I know I made mistakes, but I also feel like this is turning into a blame game where the failures of others are being ignored. How do you handle complete failure when it feels like the whole team shares some responsibility?

Any advice would be appreciated.

1ft1tsn,I feel so stuck I just want to give up. Please help me.,"Hi everyone. As the title of this post says, I feel very stuck and lost in life, so I would really appreciate any advice.

For some background, I graduated with a BS in environmental engineering last year. Throughout my entire undergrad, I studied my ass off, thinking that I would eventually go to law school, bringing my marks up very high by the the time I graduated. However, on the other hand, because I was so focused on studying and thinking I would go into laws school, I didn't put in much effort in getting much co-op experience that was relative to my degree. And unfortunately, for personal reasons, by the time I graduated, I decided not to pursue my original goal of going into law school.

Six months after my graduation, I barely landed a job that was somewhat related to my field of study. However, it was not exactly the engineering work that I wanted to do. It was a construction estimating job for the dewatering subtrade. Having been exposed to some geotechnical engineering throughout my job as well as my undergraduate studies, I was fascinated and wanted to be more involved in the geotechnical engineering side of things. So I decided to apply to entry geotechnical engineering roles. However, it seemed like my lack of experience in geotechnical engineering as well as my environmental engineering degree prevented me from landing any jobs. 

Now a year has passed. I enrolled myself into a part-time masters of geotechnical engineering program, while working at this job full-time. I work from 7 AM to 5 PM and commute 3 hours a day everyday for 5 days a week. I have no life. While doing this, I tried to apply to various co-op positions as well, even if it is temporary (4 months or 8 months), but they all seem to be looking for undergraduate students. Having said this, I'm not sure if I should just quit my somewhat relevant job to pursue my studies full time, and upon graduation, apply to geotechnical engineering jobs thereafter or if I have to suck it up and do this for the next 3 years until I finish my masters.

Honestly, I am burnt out as hell. I finish my 13 hour shift, including my commute everyday, just to come back to a pile of work for my graduate studies, while applying to jobs with the hopes of finally working in the field I want to be in. I feel like a loser who accomplished nothing in life. All my friends who went the conventional route are doing amazing (at least on paper). They all make good money and have hybrid roles. And here I am. I feel like all my life has been wasted and that I had studied my ass off for no reason, while everyone else was taking it easy during my undergrad.

1ft12ty,Advice on working with toxic family members & leaving?,"

Sorry I didn't know how to word the title. Basically I currently work with my family and they're nasty and toxic and I can't take it anymore(example criticizing what I eat & fat shaming me) & just in general racist bigots(they're mixed so I don't get it) and the usual gossiping backstabbing. Since I work with and for family there is no HR or anything. I want to make sure that I don't just rush into another crappy job just to escape. What websites are better to look for jobs? I use indeed and Glassdoor currently but actually finding jobs that aren't just door to door sales or their crappy recommendations. I tried LinkedIn but the app isn't very stable. Is it worth it to pay someone to help me with my resume? I wasted $35 with indeed for their ""professional"" services. I want to get my foot into an actual career somewhere but I feel like I have more things against me than for(disabled woman without a degree.) I'm currently trying to go to college for an IT degree and working on my real estate license but they have me so stressed out I'm too exhausted to do it. I have days where I just want to up and quit. It really is affecting my health and there's been a few times I thought I was gonna have a mental breakdown or seizure from the stress.

I want to go to college, but I have no idea what to study, and I'm not keen on pursuing anything related to my passions (like arts, music, dance, culinary, or gardening). I feel like most careers in those fields wouldn't provide much ""job security"" and could become tedious.

Here's a bit of background: I had to drop out of high school after my GCSEs when I was 16 because my parents weren't interested in paying for my A-levels. Now, I finally have the chance to continue my education, but going back to high school feels like a waste of time. I've gained work experience in a variety of fields and even completed a few Google certificates on Coursera, but I want to pursue something more formal that can lead to a stable career. I'm also academically strong (I was a straight-A student), so I know I can handle it.

I've been considering finance, but I’ve heard people in the field often feel miserable, so now I'm second-guessing that choice. I've also looked into business analytics and software programming, but I haven’t made any decisions yet. I would really appreciate some advice and ideas on potential study options. Thank you!

Everyone, including my boss, kept their jobs but there was a reorg of roles. I was stripped of all duties but one. (For this post, lets say that over the years I acquired many responsibilities and was an office manager-type, the stereotypical go-getter, but after the reorg, I was told to only do receptionist duties.) I wanted to quit but the situation w my parents made  it difficult. Admittedly, I have tons of resentment and have quiet quit. Now the new company is trying to get all their branches to use the same ERP system and have been working on making the transition but they need lots of input from all the departments to make sure the transition goes well. It's a big, slow change that's been in the works for 2 years. My boss just emailed me saying she was going to be the lead for ""receptionist duties"" input but realized that i should do it instead.

Still, I really want to work as a policy consultant/analyst in the private sector (be it financial sectors, accounting firms, tech companies, etc.)

I am graduating with a major in public policy and double minor in economics and political science. So my exposure to these kinds of statistical software is somewhat limited, though I am quite familiar with R and excel, but that's about it. I have collected a couple of research assistantships and internships throughout my undergrad in quant heavy fields though, so I think that helps. Still, I can't help but feel I am fighting a losing battle against my competitors --- people who have majored in ""hard skill"" degrees.

Maybe I am just seeking reassurance at this point, but feeling like my odds are against me makes me want to work even harder, so I do not want to give up knowing I haven't tried my best.

1fstxik,Continuously dismissed ,"I thought I’d come on here to ask for some advice about problems I’m having at work.

I’m head of my department at the company I work at (graphic design, been there for nearly 5 years). When I was hired I was told that there would be opportunities to study and benefits after 3 years. So when year 4 rolled around I reached out to the owner in April with an email asking to have a meeting to discuss the studying opportunity (which is a field that my company needs expertise in), benefits and the possibility of renegotiating my salary (I’m currently being underpaid by at least 5 grand for my experience level and duties). Followed up a few times on this email with no response.

In July I brought it up again and finally got a response that they would be looking at increases at the end of July. Nothing happened. Eventually I got a meeting in September. 

So this meeting was scheduled in the calendar, 11am. I’m ready and waiting, no one logs onto the teams meet. I drop a message asking if everything is fine and we’re still on. No response. Eventually I call and am told that they’re in an urgent meeting they will call me in an hour. End of day rolls around and I try to call, no answer. I drop a text asking when we can reschedule, left on read.

So I leave it, this was Wednesday. Monday rolls around, still no response so I drop another message at 1pm and get left on read again.

This ‘ignoring’ is definitely part of the company culture here. I have so many outstanding projects that I email consolidated reports on every Monday following up, deadlines are ignored. So it’s nothing new.

I love the work that I do but I am just feeling so defeated at this point. I put in the work, the extra effort, I self study to make sure I can keep up with new things they want to try and always have my ducks in a row for every deadline and project. My work ethic is constantly complimented around the office and it has been noticed on more than one occasion that I am running everyone’s deadlines and making sure production is on track, even when it’s not my department. This avoidance of a meeting and not even having the decency to let me know that it won’t happen or reschedule is really just so disheartening.

So looking for any advice on how to handle it. Should I try reach out again? Or just cut my losses and begin working on a new portfolio. I can’t keep getting paid what I am indefinitely, haven’t had a raise in all the years I have been here no matter how much cost of living has increased. The company is opening new branches whom I’m also ‘managing’ in terms of branding and course materials and I’ve had to take over some work for accounting too because they can’t handle everything so my responsibilities have also increased.

I just don’t know anymore.",Kikididntdeliver,2,1.0,3,1727698125,2024-09-30 12:08:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fstxik/continuously_dismissed/,9,2024

Hello, 

I am currently in my last year of a Bachelor of Science, majoring in physics. When I chose my degree, I was hoping to go into academia.

I had to retake a couple classes multiple times, and although I have improved through my degree, I really just mean that I'm passing on my first attempt now.

Academia is pretty obviously not going to happen, at least not now. But I don't have a clear plan B... I picked physics with the assurance that it was a hard science, so if I changed my mind, I'd be okay. I just don't know what that looks like.

1fst2hq,Tips on getting out of recruitment?,"I’ve graduated in 2019, with Psychology and, as a lot of people refer to it, I “fell into recruitment”, but my plan was never to stay in it for that long! I just thought it would be a good way to get some office and customer service skills. 

However, 5 years on I’m still here, in my 3rd recruitment role. Currently work for an agency that recruits board level and directors into the public sector.

Although the company I work for is good and the role itself isn’t bad…I just have no passion for this. I don’t particularly like my manager and I’ve just lost my drive. I feel so lost. 

I’m good at the job, but it’s not something I want to do for the rest of my life and I don’t think it is something that adds value to my life. 

I have been applying for different jobs such as HR, I’ve applied to some graduate schemes (thought I’d take my chances) and some account executive roles. However, not having much luck with anything right now. 

I wonder if anyone has any advice on how to get out of recruitment? What kind of roles should I look for? Should I possibly do a course?

1fssa8l,Torn between 2 paths,"(Pretty long post ahead)
Hi, new member here. I’m a 17-year-old, soon-to-be 18 female student currently residing in New Zealand. I come from a low-income background and was fortunate enough to immigrate with my family last year.

Up until recently, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I didn’t know my interests, couldn’t see myself in any career, and was unsure of what path to take. However, when I took my first plane ride last year, I became so fascinated by aviation. What truly triggered my interest was meeting a pilot in real life and listening to her career story, someone we know personally. During that time, I finally realized what I wanted to pursue, and it felt amazing to have a personal goal for once—not just something I followed to meet my parents’ expectations. Unfortunately, I discovered my true passion quite late. I’ve already been accepted into a 3-year Bachelor’s program in Civil Engineering, which I’ll be starting next year. The costs are relatively low thanks to a full scholarship, and the remaining fees are covered by my father. Part of me wants to pursue aviation, but another part of me wants financial stability, and I believe engineering can offer that. The more I think about it, the more desperate I become to pursue aviation. But my financial situation is a barrier—my parents are only paying for my Bachelor’s degree, which costs just four figures for the entire 3 years, and they also have no idea that I’m considering aviation.

Right now, I plan to complete my Bachelor’s degree, gain a few years of engineering experience, and save up money. Then, if I’m financially stable, I’ll pursue my true dream of working in aviation. However, I’m torn by the thought of starting from scratch, leaving engineering behind, and being “too old” by the time I establish myself in aviation. To me, it feels like I’d be giving up a well-established career to become a student all over again. Additionally, I’m aware that this path could be quite expensive and risky because of the number of hours, commitment, and experience I need in order to obtain pilot licenses and secure employment with an airline.

If anyone asks why I’m considering changing careers eventually instead of going straight into aviation, it’s because I simply don’t have the financial means to pursue aviation by relying on my parents. I believe that pursuing engineering first can provide me with a safety net and the financial resources I need to pursue aviation later. And hey, it's an additional valuable credential on my CV. I’m also currently not eligible for loans or most scholarships, as I’ve only been a resident visa holder for a year. 

My parents are very traditional and have always believed that I wanted to be an engineer, so they’ve pushed me in that direction. In reality, I chose engineering because, back in my home country, it was considered one of the few stable career paths (Engineering, Nursing, Accountancy, name it). My only goal at the time was to escape poverty, so I chose engineering. 

Am I making the right decision? Do you think it would be a waste to pursue aviation after completing a degree and gaining work experience in engineering? I’m worried that I’ll be throwing away years of study, work, and money when I eventually switch careers. If anyone has advice or opinions, I would really appreciate it.

1fss8mr,Feeling screwed over by accreditation ,"I work for an environmental company and have a degree in animal behaviour, but my current role is mostly administration/finance and billing. I really wanted to get into the environmental protection side of the work, but would have to take a sidestep using the very minimal experience I had. Spoke to a few people in those teams and they recommended getting a CIEEM accreditation, which is £90 a year, plus each course at my level is around £150-£200. I would require 5 or 6 courses to progress to the next accreditation level which would give me a post nom. I applied and got in, paid my yearly membership fee. 

I wanted to gain shadow experience from the other teams I spoke to, and was then informed by the hiring manager that the courses CIEEM offer were basically useless for any role in that team because it's so job specific. And I can only shadow for 2 days a year because my current job role is so different they won't support it as ""personal development"".

1fsqxur,What van I do to get my life straight?,"Here we go, I’m 23 years old, studied law halfway and very poorly, with terrible grades and not really learning anything. The tough part is that I have no idea what I’d like to do. I like languages, that’s all I know, but I also realize that studying literature means earning little.

I know 23 isn’t old, but the pressure is enormous. I live with my mom, have worked various times but never in a job that pays more than 2,000. I’m at a point where many friends are graduating, getting internships, traineeships, and I’m stuck. I feel like I’ve lost five years, and my mom keeps reminding me of that, which isn’t helping at all. I know she’s right, but she’s the type who loves to point out flaws without encouraging solutions. She thinks I should follow her path: finish law and take those super tough exams like judge, police officer, prosecutor. I understand those are great options, but she talks as if it’s my duty to achieve that hyper-difficult career, projecting her frustrations since she studied law and couldn’t follow that path.

I’ve done career tests online, ikigai, tried researching courses and fields, but I can’t decide. Everything either scares me, seems like it has no future, feels like I’m not capable, or that I’m too old to pursue (like engineering).

Can anyone give me some guidance? My anxiety has been through the roof for over a year, and I can’t change. I’ve been seeing a psychologist for a year, which has helped, but I can’t focus. I don’t know how to start getting my life together.

1fsot6m,Should I take legal action/have my CEO step down from his position because of his mistreatment toward me?,"This past summer, I started taking medication to treat my depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I told my direct supervisor about my starting of taking medications. He was very supportive of me and he always has been, but he asked if it would be ok for him to tell our org's HR person alongside our CEO because of previous hardships we've had with an intern and their mental health struggles. I said it was ok because I thought that me being open would be part of my healing process and really destigmatize mental health in the workplace.

Throughout the summer was a large battle with my prescriptions (I'm suing my psychiatrist for malpractice, but that's a whole other story). Due to the medications I was prescribed, I became very manic. No one at work mentioned any of the symptoms to me, despite people knowing I was trialing many different medications. This mania went untold to the point where I made an inappropriate joke to one of our interns. I feel so awful about it to this day. I had a panic attack at work for two hours about this and later that night, I was really close to cutting myself. I've apologized to her directly twice. I had a meeting with my direct supervisor about it, then I had a one-on-one with our HR guy. Despite all of this, the President still thought he needed to talk to me alongside our HR guy... Why do we have an HR guy if the President is going to talk to me directly? His crisis management is non-existent. Yes, I acted inappropriately with our intern. It was all due to my mania caused by my medication. No one recognized this. I was an RA in college, and I know that in crises, you ask both parties how they have been affected by certain situations.

During my redundant meeting with him, my mania was still awful. I was also increasingly anxious about this situation. It got to the point where I overshared about my personal life. I told the President and my HR person that I have an inclination that my dad might be cheating on my mom and then the President started laughing at me... He could have laughed because he was uncomfortable, didn't expect to hear that, or maybe he genuinely thought it was hilarious. What really hurt, is that when he realized I was being very serious, he didn't say sorry or show any sort of sympathy toward me. Later that evening, I really cried my eyes out and decided it was time for me to quit.

On September 6, I decided to tell my direct supervisor about my plan to quit. He was very supportive of my decision and thought that my CEO's actions were beyond inappropriate. However, I was scared of telling HR and the CEO about my decision because it was already anxiety-inducing having that earlier meeting with them. I decided to schedule a meeting on September 9 with the two of them. However, on September 8, my manic episode was so bad that I unknowingly attempted suicide by overdose with the intent of killing myself. I don't remember a lot of this and there are a lot of blind spots in my memory. I went to the hospital for two days then went to a psyche ward for the remainder of the week. Obviously, I missed work and was unable to contact a lot of people.

When I got released from the psyche ward, I got an email directly from my CEO (this person doesn't know how to delegate) that showed little heart and really made me feel shitty. He came to realize that I was in the hospital and psyche ward because of a suicide attempt, but he still showed no warmth.

When I finally came back to work (September 16) I talked to my CEO about me wanting to quit without getting into specifics. He was fine with the decision.

Keep in mind, I'm originally from one side of my country and my job is a three-hour plane ride toward the other side of the country. my family was worried about me. My sister booked a plane ticket for myself to go back home on September 18. I planned on working remotely until October 1 to wrap things up. However, when he found out that I had a ticket to go back home on September 18, he didn't like that I didn't tell him beforehand (he figured I was at the hospital the week of September 9 for a suicide attempt, but he still didn't care). He said that my last day would be two weeks from when I told my direct supervisor (September 20) instead of October 1. I did not want that at all and it goes to show that even when I survive a suicide attempt, the CEO still doesn't care.

Also, the HR person at work told the CEO to apologize, but apparently, the CEO refuses to do so because that would mean admitting he did something wrong.

Is it even worth pursuing this? I want the best for the org, but at the same time, it could just be water under the bridge for myself. Maybe, for my own mental sake, I should not care about this org anymore because I don't work there anymore.

The micro-businesses get the benefit of me marketing them and handling the sale and the stores I sell to get the benefit of writing a single purchase order to me and not having to juggle orders to multiple small vendors.

To do this, I’ll need a business license and probably a permits for each city I want to sell in.  The biggest problem I might encounter is the vendors not being able to keep up with larger orders.

That leaves me to be the only Full timer working for the company alongside the founder. We work closely everyday but I don’t like the fact that I don’t actually have work friends to rant to if need. 

I’ve already had 2 intern friends leave at different times and it sucks because when they left, I was practically left alone. I want to leave so badly only because I hate how small the company is now that I’m officially the only other full timer. Boss hasnt even mentioned to me whether there would be someone else to work with me soon so I expect that I will be the only other employee. 

If I quit, I’d have to find a company that’ll do less of what I enjoy doing and would be more corporate (as I want to experience this environment) but I’m not sure if I’d enjoy. Good thing is - I’d have more friends probably? 

If I don’t quit, I’d be stuck here forever and obviously I don’t want to be in this environment anymore. The good thing is it’ll be faster to work up the ladder but problem is if I make mistakes, it’s easily noticeable and I get the blame for majority of the fuck ups since a lot of responsibilities are now pushed to me. I honestly just want to get up and go to work and then save enough just so I can start to fund my own personal projects or do things I enjoy.

1fsmekg,Cubicle Has Become a Storage Space,"I work remotely mainly. I do come into the office occasionally when needed, however, because we do have a smaller office and there are lots of people coming in and out and have asked if they could use my workspace when they are in or visiting, I agreed and thought that since I don't use it enough, it would be fine if someone want to use it (since it has two monitors, a keyboard, and a mouse), which would be better than just using their laptop. 

I came into the office recently because there was an on-site event I was willing to help at. Sadly, I noticed that my space has been used as a storage place and the coworker(s) were putting stuff that I believe could be put in their office or out in the other spaces in the office and not directly in my cubicle/workstation! I want to say something (I did briefly mention that I allowed people to use my space for work and not as a storage space, however, I don't know if they think I am only joking or that I am not serious enough) because I don't want them to believe that I am a petty person since I barely come into the office and that I am not even willing to let them use my space as storage for a couple of months only until all events are done.  I mean if I want to be very petty, I could just say I don't want anyone to use my space anymore and just lock it up cause I do have a key to do so and that if they want to use the space... then make me 100% remote and take away my space? Or will have to ask me every time! 

Any advice? I don't want to relay this message to my boss cause then the boss could either say that it's fine and it's only for a couple of months or will instruct the coworker(s) to remove it. However, my coworkers may use it as something to hold against me. 

The only two ideas that I have is to one, just ignore it since I don't really go in and won't see it every day and hopefully, after the events, they will remove the stuff from my workstation. Or two, tell my coworker that since my workstation is used as a shared space for those who wish to use it when they come in, I would appreciate it if they don't put storage stuff in there and store the stuff either in their room or somewhere else in the office? 

Am I overthinking the situation? What should I do?

1fsm70v,Losing Hope at Finding a Way to Support Myself,"I don't want to offer too much details about my life, but I will say that I am a male in my late 20s living in the USA.

I went to college, and as part of my degree, I had to do an internship. The internship was my first ever full time job. At first it was okay, though the 8 hour days took some getting used to, but as I progressed through my internship, things started to get worse. In the beginning, I was given relatively simple task that I could complete but that just took a lot of time. But as I got further in, I was given more and more challenging tasks. 

I couldn't handle it. I have been considered a smart person nearly all my life, but I was utterly failing at the work given to me by this job. I had never felt like such a failure in all my life. I started to hate going to work, and my attendance began to suffer. I have always struggled to make friends, but due to the fact that I was younger than all my coworkers, I was never able to really connect with any of them. When I completed my internship, the courses left for me to get my degree felt nearly impossible. Not only were they more difficult than the courses at the start of my degree, but after my experience with my internship, my heart was no longer in it. I started putting less and less work, but as I got closer to my degree, I felt an overwhelming sense of dread as I approached the transition from school to the working world.

After I finally got my degree, I was called by a recruiter to discuss a position with some company. But I never even made it to the meeting. That night, I had a full-blown panic attack and ended up canceling the meeting over email. I felt like I was about to have shackles put on my limbs for the rest of my life, doomed to a miserable existence. The next day I got a phone call where I very awkwardly tried to make up excuses for not wanting a job, and eventually recruiters stopped contacting me.

Over the next few years, I tried several ways to find self employment that were outside of my degree, but nothing was working. I am on my fourth attempt at finding some way to make money from home, and it too is looking like a failure.

  
I am starting to lose hope at ever finding a way to support myself that won't make me totally miserable. Does anyone know something that might help me find what I am looking for?

1fsm0cb,Is it okay to continue the job search after getting hired?,"I graduated in May with a bachelor's degree in graphic design. Throughout college, I worked part-time as a designer, so I have around four years of experience under my belt. After graduation, I moved back in with my parents and spent the entire summer applying for jobs. I’m grateful for their support, and they’ve said I can stay as long as I need, but I’m 25 and really want to start my own life somewhere new.

I applied to countless jobs in the area I want to move to, but nothing panned out, even though I had a few interviews. On a whim, I applied to a position near my hometown, and of course, that’s the one that got offered to me.

The role I interviewed for was a salaried position with great pay, and I felt I was a perfect fit for it. However, after waiting for a month, they told me they promoted someone internally for that position. Instead, they offered me the entry-level hourly position that opened up as a result. I wasn’t thrilled, but I needed a job, so I accepted it.

Shortly after accepting, I found out they’re still looking to hire two more people for the position I originally interviewed for. I was really upset, but at that point, there wasn’t much I could do. The job I have now is decent with okay pay and benefits, but I still want to move, and the entire hiring process left a bad taste in my mouth.

Is it okay to keep applying for jobs in the area I want to move to? If I do, what should I say to interviewers when they ask why I’m leaving this job so soon? I’m worried it will look bad. If it’s best to stick it out, how long should I stay before moving on?",CloakedWizrd,2,1.0,7,1727665794,2024-09-30 03:09:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fsm0cb/is_it_okay_to_continue_the_job_search_after/,9,2024

1fskhqc,Toxic workplaces,"I've only worked in 3 different companies in my 15 years work experience.  My 1st was toxic, nepotism and threats. It was my 1st work experience so I was naive to it for at least 6 years.  I stayed another 5 years until my family grew to a size it no longer made sense to work.  I rejoined the work force 5 years later.  Got an additional degree in that time.  It was a very small organization and a very healthy atmosphere all the way up. I worked directly under the top leadership.  I stayed there 4 years, earned my bachelor's and received 2 promotions in my time there. However, I had a pull to pursue a different career and landed a role that which seemed perfect.  It took me a year in before I realized how toxic the work environment is. People at face value are friendly or keep to themselves and I finally realized why a lot of people keep to themselves and that some of the openly friendly people are two faced.  Unfortunately the bulk of the issue come top down.  

Some of the things I've experienced are:
- being assigned new duties, not be asked if you have prior experience, given minimal direction and training and no point of contact for guidance or insight other than the managers who don't even have time to eat lunch some days so they aren't exactly accommodating and be expected to deliver
- being assigned new duties in the same manner above that someone else is currently assigned, be told that the person has not been told you are taking it over so keep it a secret
- managers not having time for you but you can overhear them in open conversations about personal matters (there is a blurring between business and personal relationships amongst the managers)
- nearly nonexistent feedback on job performance and delivered results
- unknown expectations 
- hiring people and unspokenly expect them to fill another role
- deviating from spoken training expectations explained in detail during the interview
- targeting an employee for basically shunning, a certain clique which are closest to management speak terribly of him for no known reason other than they decided they don't like him - he's a nice person and very intelligent, the only thing I can think is they don't like his nationality or are threatened by his abilities and fear he could rise above them but it'll not happen because they got his manager to buy in on their dislike of him (this is the worst part and I've lost respect for those involved)

I know I'm not stuck and there's always a choice, however, there are a few things that make it more wise to stay a certain amount of time. 

1. At hiring I received a sign on bonus for a 2 year commitment that would be repaid if I leave before 2 years (8 months left until I'm free and clear)
2.  Received a project bonus for being part of the team with an integral role in the complete overhaul in our software system (unknown repayment period - management is gatekeeping the info)
3. Getting experience on the new software is something professionally marketable
4. I'm 10 months from PSLF - public student loan forgiveness
5. I'm in a new career field entirely and only just over 1 year experience.  Another year or two would make it easier to land a senior role elsewhere.  
6. I believe my compensation may be on the higher side compared to colleagues and it's the most I've made by $20k (even without accounting for the bonuses)


Due to my low experience with different with environments, the last thing I want to do is leave for the toxic environment, have to pay back bonuses, possibly accept a lower pay, not get eligible credit for PSLF and end up in a similar environment.  Are most workplaces toxic? Should I just learn to mediate the BS away?  Is there a key to surviving in it?

1fsg0l2,"Four months ago, I came to the US alone, homeless, and determined to make it. Since then, I’ve been fired, accused of being on drugs, and told that my hard work isn’t enough. Now, I’m left questioning: Is it me, or is the system stacked against people like me?
","Hey everyone,

I just need to release my thoughts here and hopefully get some feedback—good or bad, I’ll take it all.

My story is a bit different. I arrived in the US 4.5 months ago, alone—no family, no friends—but with fluency in English and a work permit. I’m in Orange County, CA, and while I’m not studying, I’ve been working.

My journey started rough. In my first month, I found work at a bakery, earning $14 an hour. It wasn’t much, but it was a start. While there, I found a better opportunity elsewhere. I informed my boss, but shortly after, they accused me of being high on drugs and fired me. For the record, I’ve never smoked weed, never touched alcohol, and I don’t do drugs. During this time, I was homeless, sleeping on a sofa in a restaurant.

A week later, I took a new job at a phone repair company. They offered me a small room to stay in—no restroom, no kitchen, just an air fryer—and paid me $1,000 a month. The work was tough, 9 am to 6 , six days a week. I was working 54 hours a week. One day, I was 5 minutes late, and my boss’s partner called to tell me they had been watching me on camera. When he arrived, I didn’t greet him, and when he questioned me, I stood up for myself. He fired me on the spot.

For a few days, I slept in my car, trying to figure things out. I reached out to the restaurant where I had previously slept, and they offered me a job. I’ve been working there for a month now, earning $17 an hour, and I’m staying at my boss’s home, paying $500 a month in rent.

But here’s the kicker: after two weeks, when I was due to be paid $1,300, my boss told me he didn’t think that was fair because other staff were working harder. I’ve done everything for them—running errands, helping with their website, even sourcing equipment—yet I’m constantly told that I’m not doing enough. It crushed my motivation, and every payday, I hear the same thing: that my pay isn’t ‘fair’ for the work I’m doing.

Recently, my boss said something that’s been haunting me. He asked, ‘You’ve worked for three different people—maybe the problem is you?’

It made me wonder… am I the problem? I know I have weaknesses—who doesn’t? I’m far from perfect, but I’ve worked hard at each place. Maybe I’m not enough, or maybe it’s the way they treat their staff. I don’t know.

I’m at a crossroads. If I leave, I’ll be homeless again. I work from 6 to 12 am, so I have the chance to find another job, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t even have a proper resume. Here in Orange County, just renting a single room costs $1,200. If I leave, I don’t know how I’ll afford a new place.

I’m lost. I don’t know what to do, or where to start. I need advice, guidance, or anything to help me get back on track.  
I feel some of them are just milking their staff.

Please, if you’ve been through something like this or have any advice, I’m all ears.",Vegetable-Vehicle785,1,1.0,0,1727647351,2024-09-29 22:02:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fsg0l2/four_months_ago_i_came_to_the_us_alone_homeless/,9,2024

There have been girls working here for 10 years who have never gotten a raise and make the same amount that I do. 

I have a friend in the paralegal program at a community college near me, it’s 100% online, but does require you to work in a law firm before graduating to gain 200 hours of work experience, the program is also 2 years.

1fsf3os,"Am I getting paid fairly? NYC youth workers, counselors, after school workers. Feeling unhappy with pay.","Hello, I am a 22 year old college student. I’m part-time right now. I currently work at a after school program in Queens, NY. Apologies for the throwaway account, I just need to ask some questions and blow off steam.

At the job, the responsibilities are to pick-up children from multiple schools in a building a few blocks away from a community center. And after that, they get fed and we later help with homework and do activities. 

My compensation for this is, 16/hr and I’m working about 20ish hours a week, 5 days a week after my classes are done. There are almost 80 kids in the program and around 8 staff (excluding supervisors and higher-ups), so the workload can be a lot if someone calls out (happens often). I feel like for what I’m getting paid it’s just not worth the risk of putting yourself on the line if a child gets injured, runs away, fights etc... For example, a child got into some serious incident about a year ago and the worker who was responsible for their supervision was let go (wasn’t the workers fault) and could probably never work with anything youth related again. They were let go without being able to defend themselves really. It’s also exhausting working with incompetent higher ups who don’t know what they are doing. 

Company staff tells us we are replaceable and such, but we haven’t had any staff to make up for the loss of staff for the past 4 years I’ve been there, which has been A LOT. And I think it’s because who wants to work a minimum wage job living in one of the most expensive cities ? 

I’m asking how much do other people in similar jobs/positions earn? I’m only asking because It’s getting harder to keep up with cost of living going up and living in NYC. 

Yes, I’m thankful for the job especially in this job economy but I don’t see myself growing here anymore in this job and being as fulfilled as I was when I was new.

So they offered me the role after interviewing and offered me $23 and I countered with $25. They then offered $23 (September 2022), $25 after 3 months (December 2023) and $25 after 6 months depending on my work. So 7 months in I got $25.

Now im a kick ass employee, I work fast and get things done and fix whats needed. They were always praising me with my work. 1 year in the work started changing, it started being more focused on Shopify management and troubleshooting, along with ActiveCampaign advanced automations, and AI and ChatGpt and Zapier work, basically in areas of marketing tech while also overseeing the admin department. The company is made up of 5 people and CEO and COO are sisters.

In January 2024, I asked for a meeting and wanted to ask for a raise, I KNOW I do a good job, I always fix and find issues before they come up and have taken on WAY more than a typical ""virtual assistant"" job. When asking for a raise, the CEO said ""well we dont give raises this soon"" and I was caught off guard and didn't know what to say. Like in my head, I was like ""what raise?, the one I initially asked for when I came in solely as virtual assistant?"".  I then  mentioned I did ask for $25 in the beginning and she said ""yes we wanted to reel you in"". She also said the company rn is in process of restructuring and cant offer more.

1fsccgn,Steering my brother in the right direction ,"My brother (23) graduated with a degree in Interactive Media last December. Since then our dad has been hounding him to get a professional job, telling him to apply to whatever he can. Problem is, my brother is not motivated in any way shape or form.

He's been working in hospitality since graduating and has been working happily there, but my dad hates it.

I get where my dad is coming from, since although hospitality's a career it's not an ideal one with its unsocial hours and typically low wage. On the other hand I also see my brother's point, what's the point in applying yourself to something if you're not emotionally invested in it. Any time I've spoken to my brother he's said he doesn't know what sort of job or career he wants to go for, so I'm at a loss.

1fsb97y,How do I professionally quit my first ever job?,"I came to the US from Japan for work and have been working for this company for two years. 

Managers are super lovely, and bosses are very, very friendly people who have sometimes helped me solve my personal problems. I can at least ""feel"" that they all love me and want me to stay in the company for as long as possible.

However, it is a small company with low pay, no career growth, and a heavy workload, let alone an industry in which I have little to no interest. Therefore, I have decided to change my career and move on for my betterment.

Whenever I imagine myself telling my boss that I am leaving, I feel really bad. I can see how sad she will be, given that they hired me despite my lack of job experience and coming from a different country.

What would be the best way to say I am quitting my job? Should I say, ""I found a better job with a better salary, probably less stress, and more growth,"" and then just leave?

What if they try to negotiate, but I am not interested in this industry, or I want to quit no matter what?

1fsaqgx,How do I get what I’m worth without getting canned?,"I have a pretty simple question but I feel like I should give lots of info first. I’m gonna keep this vague as people in the company are definitely redditors. 

I have been at my job for almost 3 years. I was hired at the manager level of one aspect of the business when the office only had about 6 employees. 

I took what was a decent salary for me to start (70k) seeing that there was a huge growth opportunity and it was a company I was familiar with and wanted to join. 

I quickly standardized, documented and built out a system to take care of what I had been hired to do, and quickly pivoted to working on other stuff that we needed as a growing company. 

At the 2 year mark, I was promoted to the director level. My performance reviews have been exceptional. The owners of the company didn’t feel like they had the systems in place to expand and i built it all out. I have never received any feedback other than the systems I have introduced are amazing and they are so much more confident with me here to expand at a rapid rate. I continue to get huge, brand defining projects and have been nailing everything. 

My issue is my salary. Year 1 I got a full bonus and a 5K raise. The director level promotion got me to 85k at year 2. However right before that 2 year review we hired two directors to take care of different aspects of the company that are not directly relevant to mine. The new people are equally experienced in their respective fields, and are both absolutely amazing and we are all within a couple years of each other age wise. 

I found out that they were in the 125k to 150k range with their salaries. Our jobs are different but equally important and glassdoor on average shows our salaries should be similar. I’m not mad at them as they deserve every penny and they have been huge additions to the team. 

I think I’m grossly underpaid and that my bosses have trouble with the idea of giving someone a 50k raise. If I quit tomorrow my replacement would definitely have to be paid in that 125-150k range to get anyone half decent. 

I live in a HCOL area and can’t get ahead on my salary. I break even and save a bit but I rent and dream of owning a house and putting money aside for my kids. 

I have my 3 year review coming up and I don’t know how to approach this. I don’t want it to be known that I know what everyone else makes. I legitimately love this job and the people I work for and with. 

I see it as a huge professional growth opportunity but I’m absolutely miserable outside of work being broke. And knowing they can easily afford to give me the rate I deserve is absolutely infuriating. We just hired a new lower level manager (not related to my work) who’s 10 years younger and he’s making 10k more than me. 

What’s the most political way to approach this? I really don’t want to switch jobs but at this point it’s starting to make sense. 

Thanks.

2. How do I even start up conversations? I’m a bit of a socially awkward person. I do well with people 1-on-1 and I love truly meaningful conversations.

1fs9hw3,How to approach my boss in this situation?,"Hey everybody! I'm looking for some advice on how to approach a situation at work.

To give some backstory, I'm currently in a hybrid (4 days in office, 1 from home) role and have been for 2 years now. Our team has gotten smaller over the past year hence more work for everyone else, including myself, to do. 

My direct boss has been on scattered paternity leave for a total of 4 months this year, and in his absence a lot of his responsibilities fell on me during that time. 

Both him and his boss have mentioned promotion to me, and would like to get me on that track (so they say). It's not happening this year, but could happen next year. I do bust my ass in this role, give extra hours, and adaptible in the things that I take on especially since the downsizing of the team.

My situation really boils down to two things. 

1. I'm getting married in 5 months, and my fiance and I are in different cities at the moment. She can't really be remote for a long period of time as she works for her family business. So we're trying to sort out our long term plan for where to settle down. However, it's pretty openly known that they are not really allowing people to be permanent work from home (with very few exceptions). I would be more inclined to stay at this job for longer if they allow me to be remote as I am someone who prefers stability over hopping around companies. 

2. The promotion track. While it's been mentioned to me, I never really received any guidance on getting on the proper track to promotion, I feel like it was brushed to the side. 

What I don't know how to do is ask about promotion while also asking to be permanently remote at the same time? They sound like contradictions to me lol. I also don't know how to raise this with my boss in a way that doesn't make it sound like I'm ready to quit asap. During my review last year apparently I was labeled as a ""high flight risk"" aka they wanted to keep me happy bc they think I'm valuable and could leave at any moment.

1fs6zsp,Looking to Switch Careers at 35,"**TLDR:** Looking to switch careers at 35 due to personal reasons. I want to transition into finance, preferably in a higher-paying country. Help me do this

**Background:**  
I am from India, a developing country. I completed my Bachelor's in Commerce (Accounting & Finance) in 2010 at the age of 21. Initially, I took up jobs in operations and sales because, at that time, my mindset was, ""Why do a desk job when my communication skills are really good?""  
I worked in operations and sales until 2016. My combined knowledge of accounting and finance (back-end), along with my experience in operations and sales (front-end), helped me establish and run a service-based business—specifically, an after-school coaching business.

The mistake I made was making the business entirely dependent on me and not developing systems for it. Initially, this was due to a lack of capital, and later, simply out of convenience.

**Current Situation:**

1. I have hit a ceiling in terms of earnings in my present situation.
2. I have become bored with teaching the same content every year and feel a lack of personal growth.
3. (Most importantly) I am planning to start a family and want to provide my children with better opportunities than I had.

**Future Plans:**  
There has to be a significant change now. After analyzing all the options available to me, it seems that:

* Moving to New York or London, transitioning into finance, and working for the next 10 years is the best path forward.
* Eventually, I plan to start a better business—one that is not dependent on a single individual but operates with proper systems.

This change solves two major problems:

1. (Most importantly) Better education and exposure for my child(ren).
2. Better savings potential than what is possible in India.

Eventually, I plan to return and come back to India

I feel like I may have gone too far down this path and put all my eggs in one basket/not diversified enough in my field, and without some kind of breakthrough I’m not sure that this is sustainable into the future. I’m getting to the point where I feel I may have to give myself a timeline to keep trying and then look to something else. This is particularly stressful as I’m approaching my mid-40s.

My short term plan is to use marketing strategies to promote myself, as well as actively seek out opportunities adjacent to my specialty (that tend to pay better), and see if I can grow my career potential over the period of a calendar year, let’s say.

1fs6rw3,Boss (in religious institution) routinely overstating my hours/seniority to congregants,"I was hired over the summer as an administrative assistant in a religious institution in New York.

What do I do over the next few months?","Laid off from job, need to find new role soon, but on track with dream company within a few months — how do I manage next few months for budget and goals?

So, I have two goals — short term and long term. I also just got laid off.

I’ve been talking with a previous supervisor and colleague and having lunches with them. I worked with them as an intern and have been having lunches with them about every three months since January 2022. I almost went back when there was a job opening in 2021, but my former friend got the position over me because he did his internship there after I did and they added something to the company after I left where he had an edge over me. But my supervisor reached out to me after the rejection in New Year 2022 and asked to have lunches with me, and told me he wanted me over my former friend. The rest is history and we’ve been in touch.

For that company right now, they may adapt technology I’m skilled in and my supervisor informed me of this in April. He said he would want to bring me in if negotiations work. I had lunch with him and my colleague last week and we had a discussion about the direction. I also told them about the troubles of my work and that I am looking around. 

They told me for timeline will probably be “not before the end of the year, but within a few months”. Then my supervisor asked “if you were somewhere for 6 months then were to come back, would you be OK with that?” And I said yes. This company is my dream company and my long term goal.

My short term goal is finding a position as soon as possible where I can still contribute and possibly only be there for a short period. As of right now, my finances will last me about 4-5 months.

So straight to the point, I graduated high school back in 2020 as an above average student, and Now I’m looking to focus on building a suitable career between becoming an electrician or a physiotherapist.

I’m aware if I pursue the latter then I would need to attain a bachelor of sports & exercise science followed by a master of physiotherapy. I’m very much aware of how competitive this field is and the academic demand that goes with it. I planned to specialise in the sport side of the industry and even do personal training on the side as I study.

However, I’ve been listening to complaints about the constant burn outs from the profession, repetitive tasks, and not feeling compensated ect.

Meanwhile with the electrician option, no hecs-fees, paid to learn, a strong interest in the construction industry, enjoy working on the tools. I also have a few connections with companies that would be keen to let me on, I just don’t want  to jump ship straight away until I believe I did my due diligence.

1fs60ut,Natural Disaster/Hurricane Helene WFH PTO,"Hi all, I'm sure as many know, Hurricane Helene did an unmentionable amount of damage at this point between FL, GA, NC and TN. The one similar pattern I'm noticing on posts is many companies don't have ""natural disaster policies"" and they are forcing us to use our PTO, take time unpaid, OR (this seems most valid) the company has something like ""disaster pay"". Our only other way out is if our electric/wifi goes down and I've seen some companies say ""use your hotspot."" 

There's disasters in all areas of the US. I feel that we all could run into the same issue at some point. We can't go to a physical office due to we don't have one close enough or our weather conditions lasts longer than 1 or 2 days so were unable to go in. So we run out of our PTO that we've worked hard for and these disasters are out of our control. 

Maybe it's just me...but I feel like something needs to change. Especially after a hurricane like this where so many WFH. Why do we not have more protection? For example, my company is based out of Illinois but I live in Lakeland, FL. Luckily, we are fine. But you never know when tracks change for hurricanes and they can change last minute. So you're telling me, you (my company) would rather be responsible for anything that happens to me, than paying me for a day? Or better yet, coming up with a ""Disaster Policy"" so we don't have to do this over and ove, and you have it in writing for long term use? 

If you have info me or others could find helpful, pleaseee add it to the replies! I hope this feed could be helpful to many others and make a change by us speaking about it. What's your take?

1fs4u77,Leaving Retail,"I'm needing some advice to get out of a rut. 

  
I have worked in retail for the last 7 years, one year as a brand associate and the rest in management roles, including Acting General Manager, now an Assistant Operations Manager for the last 3.5 years). To put it simply: I am burned out. The turnover, the hours, working every weekend, never seeing my fiancé, nobody on my team is ever on the same page, etc. I'm doing my best when I'm there, but I cry just thinking about going in anymore.

  
I told my GM in February that I was making this my last year and starting to search for something else, and here I am in September with no progress.

  
I graduated in 2020 with an Associates Degree in Web and Digital Media(all classes shared with Graphic Design besides the last two semesters). Unfortunately, due to covid we were unable to do a portfolio show for my class, which is usually where most students find their starting job/internship. I ended up chugging along in retail to keep making money and haven't had any free-time since to work on my portfolio or even continue to practice my skills.



I'm having a hard time figuring out where to go from here. I don't believe I can transition straight into web or graphic design as its been over four years since I've even attempted to code/touched adobe suite. My portfolio website was also wiped when I stopped paying for a hosting subscription. 



I have been applying for Office Management/Administrative roles and have yet to hear back for a single interview. I would really just like to find something 9-5, M-F so I can start to work on my design skills in my free-time again.

  
I don't know how to put what I actually do in my role into my resume to make it more appealing to recruiters. I feel like they see ""retail"" and are immediately turned off. I do a lot of office/administrative tasks; payroll processing/timesheets, scheduling, forecasting, corrective actions, recruiting, hiring, onboarding, training, coaching, creating SOPs/training materials, customer service, lead district zoom calls as needed, act as GM POC when necessary, MANAGEMENT, etc.

  
Anyone else who got out of retail: where did you go? What can I put on my resume to give me a fighting chance? It's getting so hard to see ""we've moved forward with a more qualified candidate"" every single time I put in an application.

1fs303i,"4 month Big 4 internship vs. trying to get a full-time, more permanent position?","Hello!

I'm a licensed psychologist and have a master's degree in management and organizations. I graduated this summer with a master's degree in management and organizations & graduated with a master's degree in psychology in 2023. I'm interested in I-O (= industrial and organizational psychology or work and organizational psychology, as it's called where I live), and dream of working in HR, recruiting or personnel assessment. 

I have some experience in HR. I've worked as an HR trainee and HR assistant. My latest HR position ended in late August and I've been unemployed ever since. I've applied to different HR positions, but have not been able to even secure interviews. The job market is total crap where I live and many fresh graduates are struggling to find work. There have been and will continue to be massive layoffs and even experienced HR professionals are struggling to find work. 

Clinical psychology doesn't interest me but there really aren't any psychologist job openings other than clinical positions. I did my psychology internship in a clinical setting and realized that it just is not for me. There haven't been any I-O psychology job openings and I doubt there will be in the near future because of the economic situation. I'm dreaming of working as an personnel assessment psychologist, but there have been zero open positions. I've send tons of open applications but nothing has come up. I really don't have any connections to that specific niche either. I believe that recruiting/talent acquisition experience would help with landing a personnel assessment job in the future, but I haven't been able to get a job in that area.

I've given myself 3 months to find a job in HR or something close to I-O, since I have some savings and am able to support myself for a while. If I'm still unemployed after that, I'm going to start applying to clinical psychologist positions. There's a nation-wide shortage of clinical psychologists in my country and I am pretty certain I could land a position somewhere, not in my city, but somewhere else. I will probably have to move to get a job. I'm not enjoying unemployment and am continuously thinking that I could be working in a relatively well paying, stable clinical position – the problem is that I do not enjoy clinical work. I know I am extremely privileged to be able to not work as a clinical psychologist while searching for a more interesting position.

I'm soon having an interview for a Big 4 HR consulting trainee position, which seems very interesting and also something that could give me great experience. However, this job would start in January – I know I'm getting very ahead of things, may not even get the position etc. This position would require me to move to a more HCOL area, however I may have to move anyways. My worry is that if I'd get that position, there's three full months before it starts. What if a more interesting, permanent position opens before that? The trainee position is for 4 months – they stated that many of their trainees get a job offer from them when the traineeship ends, but I've been reading a lot about Big 4 consulting and how especially the HR/people/human capital consulting is struggling in this economy. If I would land this traineeship and declined the offer, I worry that I'm still unemployed in January and regret not accepting it. 

So I may not get the job (the recruiters probably will ask about my unemployment and the upcoming three months and I probably am not the most attractive candidate, since I could find another better paying, longer lasting position in that time) and then just continue to find work. However, if I do get it, I have to move, I will have a trainee position for 4 months and nothing after that is guaranteed - I may become unemployed again in a HCOL city with much more competition for open positions. On the other hand, I think it would give me great work experience and may help me land an I-O related position in the future. 



TLDR; Ramblings of a fresh graduate filled with hypothetical worry. Landing an I-O related position (including HR) – or actually landing any entry-level position in any industry seems impossible, job market is terrible. If you were offered, would you accept a 4 month traineeship that starts in 2025 that could help you break your career in the niche area you are interested in IF it meant that you may stay unemployed until it starts and may find something more interesting meanwhile?",binomepoisson,1,1.0,1,1727612152,2024-09-29 12:15:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fs303i/4_month_big_4_internship_vs_trying_to_get_a/,9,2024
1fs2y9n,Should I Quit My Current Job or Stick It Out for 6 Months?,"Title: Should I Quit My Current Job or Stick It Out for 6 Months?

Hey Reddit, I’m looking for some advice on whether or not I should quit my current job. Here’s a bit of background on my situation:

**Context:**

I’m currently studying at a hospitality management school, and to progress to the next semester, I need to complete 6 months of work experience. Since I have substantial experience in hospitality, I don’t need to do an internship and can work in a regular job instead. Eventually, I want to move into event management or HR.

Previously, I worked in a system catering restaurant and enjoyed it a lot. I was always excited to go to work. For this 6-month period, I decided to try something new and applied to a variety of restaurants. I was invited for an interview at a hotel with two in-house restaurants: a regular one and a Michelin-star gourmet restaurant. During the interview, it was suggested that I start in the regular restaurant and, towards the end of the 6 months, transition to the gourmet one. Working in the regular restaurant would allow me more flexible working hours since they are open every day of the week and I could influence a bit when I would get my days off. This flexibility was really important to me because my partner works early shifts and has Fridays and Saturdays off, and I hoped for a schedule that would allow us some overlap.

However, after starting the job, I was informed that I would be working exclusively in the gourmet restaurant for the entire 6 months. This means my hours are set from Tuesday 2pm to midnight, with Sundays and Mondays off. Unfortunately, this schedule means I barely get to see my partner, which is a big downside for me, especially since I spent the last semester away from home, and the same will be true next semester and after the next semester I have to do an internship and I would love to do it abroad. This job was meant to be a chance to spend more time with him before another long period of long distance.

I also don’t enjoy the working environment in the gourmet restaurant, and I don’t see myself working in this type of establishment long-term. My direct supervisor is difficult to work with: she’s impatient, doesn’t answer my questions, and has been quite harsh with me, which caused me to cry on my way home one night. This has made me quite stressed to go into work which is a relatively new experience for me because I always enjoyed my work and was proud of it. Now when I am driving to work with my moped I catch myself thinking if I get run over now, at least I don't have to go to work. Now these are intrusive thoughts, dont worry I don't intend to actually get hurt. Although I feel like I am learning new things, I wake up with anxiety every day because of how unpredictable and moody she is. It’s affecting my overall happiness and stress levels.

I wanna make it very clear that I know the industry well and I know long working hours and stressful days and none of that has ever been an issue for me. I don't mind any of it, as long as I actually enjoy what I'm doing.

### **Pros of Staying in the Job:**

1. **Valuable Experience:** Working in a Michelin-star restaurant is an excellent opportunity to gain experience that I wouldn’t easily get elsewhere. It could be a great addition to my CV.
   
2. **Good Pay:** The salary is quite good, which helps with my expenses while I study.

3. **Reputable Company:** The restaurant is part of a reputable group in my town, which has a strong presence in the hospitality industry. This could open doors to other job opportunities within the group once I graduate, and I could see myself working there in a different position in the future.

### **Cons of Staying in the Job:**

1. **Poor Work-Life Balance:** My current schedule means I barely get to spend time with my partner. This was one of my biggest concerns, and it’s turning out worse than I expected. Given how much time I spend away from home due to my studies, this is a significant downside.

2. **Stressful Working Environment:** My direct supervisor is difficult to deal with. Her moodiness and impatience make me anxious, and I’ve already experienced emotional breakdowns because of her behavior. This isn’t sustainable for me in the long run.

3. **Not Aligned with My Future Goals:** I don't see myself working in a gourmet restaurant in the future, so the skills I’m acquiring here might not be as relevant to my career path in HR or event management.

### **Possible Solutions & Their Problems:**

1. **Quitting and Finding a New Job:**
   - **Problem:** I’d need to check with my school to see if they would count the weeks I’ve already worked towards the required 6 months. If not, I’d need to start over and might have to postpone my next semester, extending my time at the school.
   - **Problem:** Finding a new job on short notice might be difficult, especially since I’d only be available for a few months. Many employers might prefer longer commitments.

2. **Going Back to My Previous Employer:**
   - **Problem:** It feels like an emergency plan, and I’m not sure if they would take me back for the remaining months. Additionally, it might not offer as much valuable experience as I was hoping to gain by trying something new. And my previous employer doesn't have the same reputation my current one has. The school where I go to places a lot of value on image and reputation and will support students more who did there workinf experience in a reputable establishment as it directly benefits the image of the school.

I’m really torn about what to do here. Should I stick it out for the remaining months despite the negatives, or should I take the risk and try to find something more in line with my goals and personal life? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!

1fs2noz,Should I quit my internship?,"I'm (23F) currently in my second year of studying Engineering, and back in March, I started a casual paid internship for 2 days per week. Initially, the internship was only supposed to last until the end of June, as I had a winter unit abroad, but before I left, they let me know that there would still be a place for me when I returned. So, after coming back, I reached out and resumed my internship.

However, I often find myself with very little to do and have to repeatedly ask for tasks throughout the day just to stay occupied. This wouldn't really bother me but I need to submit weekly timesheets outlining what projects I've worked on, and if I’m not given tasks, I don’t have much to report and if I put my time under anything not project related I have to comment on what I was doing. I’ve offered to watch the videos for the weekly lectures (as there is one each week on a day I don't work) but they are not very keen for me to do this and either find a random task for me to do or let me go early. The work itself has been repetitive and mostly involves basic data entry, which I understand can be part of an intern role, but it feels monotonous. Additionally, since I work in a different city from the main office with just one other person, it’s not a very social or engaging environment. 

As a result, I feel like I’m not getting much out of the role or have got as much as I can. On top of this, I’m balancing another job on campus, peer mentoring, a club committee role, involvement in a student team and studies. With all this going on I am starting to feel a bit stretched thin and unmotivated. In my free time I just doom scroll or binge watch tv shows as I feel like doing anything is too much. So this is another reason I am considering leaving this internship - to lighten the load and try to (hopefully) get back into better habits. But I also feel like I could be leaving a ""good"" thing, as despite the lack of work they seem keen to keep me on and the staff member I do work with keeps bringing up graduate roles in the company for when I finish. Thanks for any insights or advice!

He told me that if I fail this year I will have to drop out of college.

And if I have to drop out, he said that I will have to go to work at a supermarket checkout or some other job for uneducated people like busboy or janitor.

*And he told me ""don't get your hopes up because those jobs are very, very, very hard and you will wish you had done better in college"" (Exactly what he told me, and what had the most impact on me).*

And he also told me that it was a shame to waste the fact that I come from an economically privileged family that can give me opportunities in the academic and working world.

I am worried because my father is very good at forecasting the future and I believe that this time he will be right, that I will have to leave the university and go to work somewhere else.

And this is not America, here in Portugal if you only have high school you will not get far in life.

You will be forever in miserable jobs earning little more than the minimum wage and no matter how hard you work you will not be rewarded.

I don't know what I'm going to do, I wouldn't want to upset my father by having to give up something that my father has always loved.

But I think that this time I am not able to change things and things are going to end badly.

I'm screwed.

i was recently offered a new role and it comes with a £3500 pay rise annually, its a lot more work because I have to do printing, post, bit of cleaning if needed (they do have a cleaner), making barista style coffee for clients if needed, reception cover, and pretty much whatever the facilities team needs help with. there are only 25 people at the moment in the team so I don't see it being that busy and once the team grows to 50 then I will get another person to manage. 

objectively I think its right to take it since more money, something new to learn, and It leads to managing.

since i have verbally said yes, i have not been able to sleep, i feel like i have made a mistake. i don't know if its just wanting to be in my comfort zone or the amount of work they want just for £3500 doesn't seem like its worth it.

my goal is to get into IT, i am doing the Comptia courses at home so neither job will be a stepping stone. i thought maybe get more money while i work on my qualifications. 

what your thoughts? is staying where i am genuinely happy better than going some place i could not like just for a bit of money.",Anastasius525,1,1.0,0,1727595942,2024-09-29 07:45:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frz6nv/should_i_take_a_promotion/,9,2024
1fryz5m,"Big tech Staff SWE but feeling burnt out with job, looking to get into entrepreneurship","

Hi, 

I feel like I know the answer to my post already but still looking to gather some different opinions.


I am a staff engineer in big tech and while otherwise things are going ok (likely not on the chopping block, but you never know) I am starting to feel super burnt out. 

Constant politics, deadlines, extreme expectations of multitasking, expectations of long hours and working on a legacy tech stack and some sticky health issues is starting to take a toll on my physical and mental health. 

We have around 1.5m USD in savings and investments (including pension funds) which should cover us for around 15 years of expenses ( based on our current rate) which could go up or down depending on how we modify our life style (10 years should be guaranteed though).

I am wondering what to do at this stage of the career? Should I start side hustles first and see if one succeeds before leaving the job? Or should I take a plung and start it already. 


 I definitely don't see myself being able to sustain this kind of life style for a very long time. 

I am really itching to take a break and start something new and creative, may be even considering a field change. In my experience, I am the happiest when I am creating something new and innovative and get to experience flow states regularly at work.

I work at a mid-sized consulting firm, where we switch managers from project to project. Most of the time, it's great – some managers are super helpful and laid-back. But occasionally, I end up with a manager who’s... challenging.  
Recently, I started working with one who's really organized and generally nice, but he insists on handling all communication with the leadership and clients. On the surface, it makes sense – he has the full picture of the project. But it also means I get little to no exposure to leadership or a chance to present my own work, which, as you know, is pretty important for my performance review.  
I did try to change this. One time, he agreed to let me present a part of the work in an important meeting. But then, literally right before the call, he was like, ""Oh, I think it'd be better if I handle the whole presentation to keep things streamlined and leave more time for Q&A."" Since it was last-minute, I didn’t push back. This has happened a couple of times now, and it's starting to feel weird. It’s not a huge deal, but it's frustrating that I don't get the chance to show my work while he gets all the exposure.  
I won’t be on this project forever, but I want to learn how to handle situations like this better in the future. Any advice?

My boss and I just don't like each other so he's trying to force me out, but I just nailed the PIP's so there's nothing he can do. I actually enjoy whatever stress it causes it him that he can't get rid of me. I enjoy showing him how easy it is for me to meet the requirements of the PIP, something he probably wouldn't be able to do which makes him feel stupid. He actually trembles when he speaks to me which gives me further pleasure.

When he complains about anything I just email him ""I'm sorry, let's schedule a meeting to address your concerns. It is important to me to address your concerns."" Then in the meeting I mentally torture him by confusing him and making him feel stupid. My goal is to wear him down psychologically for years until he lashes out or quits.

My question is basically about the narrative that a PIP is an indication that 100% you're going to get fired. I haven't found that to be the case honestly, if you're in a large corpo bank like I am you can just nail the objective requirements and there isn't really much they can do to get rid of you. You've objectively proven you're doing the job well enough by nailing the objectives. It also allows you to twist the screws on your boss by frustrating them, causing them mental anguish and exhausting them. Eventually I will wear him down and destroy him.

1frq3nl,Company is going under and I can't take the pressure,"I am a senior finance employee at a small company that is bordering collapse. Unfortunately, one of our projects went severely overbudget (which I was not directly involved in), and I have spent the last 3 months trying to clean it up and make sure the company stays above water. This is a small company and over the course of the last few months I have taken on a senior position (sort of CFO, but not formally) as some senior executives have transitioned to different roles within the company. I believe a significant cause of this mess is because the executives turned a blind eye during this project, which coincided with these transitions, and no one realized the severity of it until the project was over and the clean up revealed a massive financial blow.

I've flagged our financial position to the C-suite multiple times and expressed my concerns both verbally and in writing. Unfortunately, I feel like a broken record and it seems like no one else really wants to dig into the details and they are all leaving me to figure it out and make sure we don't run out of money. The C-Suite are all executives with decades long careers in this industry. I started at this company 3 years ago right out of business school. It feels unfair and the pressure is starting to get unbearable.

The CEO in particular seems to be turning a blind eye to the problem. He thinks we are all just going to figure it out somehow, meanwhile I fear every week that we are going to just drain the bank accounts because of this overbudget project. What makes it worse is he is trying to raise money from a group of people who have proven to be dishonest in the past (our lenders/banks have had issues with them on other deals as well), and I want nothing to do with them. He is channeling all of his energy into getting money out of this group rather than selling assets and focusing on our real business.

I've gotten to the point where I need to leave, even if I don't find another job right away. On top of all of these issues, the work environment is incredibly toxic. Given I am the primary manager of cash right now, I fear that if I leave everything is truly going to collapse. I don't want that to happen, but I also feel like I have been ringing the alarm for a long time and no one is taking it seriously. I have suggested ways to bring cash in and cut costs, and we have had meetings with execs assigning each person their role to help do this, but no one is succeeding. I can't be the only one to bear this problem, and it currently feels like I am.

I don't know anyone personally who has been in this situation. Would love some advice on how to gracefully leave at a very critical time, primarily for my mental wellbeing.",Glad-Tone1861,18,0.8299999833106995,16,1727563248,2024-09-28 22:40:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frq3nl/company_is_going_under_and_i_cant_take_the/,9,2024

Once you do that you'll be able to understand the basic concepts good enough to pass.

I started doing that and scheduled my exam for 2 days later and passed it in my first attempt. It was the best feeling in the world.

Hey all

I am quite confused whether to pursue a Masters after 6-7 yoe. Any help grom someone who has already done it or considering to do it would be highly helpful. 

About my profile: 
- 2019 CSE graduate, tier 2 college, 9.1 CGPA. - currently working at FAANG as SDE2 in India.
- no research paper
- gave GRE recently and got 313 (149V,164Q)
- haven’t given TOEFL yet
- planning to seek help from a consultancy for SOP writing and application process.

My main reason is to have MS for a good profile in the future and also getting knowledge on some specialised courses.

Considering the things still pending, am I too late to apply for Fall 2025? Or its not going to be worth it at all?",user_msmba,0,0.5,0,1727553632,2024-09-28 20:00:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frms8r/should_i_go_for_ms_in_cs_after_6_yoe/,9,2024

1frmlzl,Surviving a PIP and demotion,"Wanted to get some feedback. I recently found out a person I find difficult to work with was put on a Performance Improvement Plan about 8-9 months ago. They were demoted about 3-4 months ago. What are the odds they can come back from all this? 

This last week in particular was really rough. They are not my supervisor but I still have to deal with them frequently. I had a meeting with my supervisor to let them know that this other person’s unprofessional and poor quality work is making my job harder and more time consuming.

The only other person I’ve known at this company to be demoted was gone within 3 months of being demoted but I don’t know if that was voluntary or not. I’m just trying to get an idea of how much longer I might have to deal with this person. I probably won’t be at this job in another year or two, but I don’t know if I should just mentally prepare myself that this person is a cat with 9 lives at this company and they will be there as long as I will be, or maybe there’s a chance they’ll be gone in another 2 months.

1frmke4,Feeling Conflicted about my Current Situation,"So... long post. I had not been employed for 2 years (long story I won't get into) and had lied in my resume to fill the gap, but I did have the job for that amount of time, just not during the 2-year gap (I worked 2 jobs at one point and shifted the years of the 1 job to fill in the gap). I have been out of the work environment for so long and idk if I'm feeling the way I am because of this or I just really not like my current job. I also know the job market isn't doing well right now and it's really hard to get hired so, I am lucky to even have gotten hired. I guess I should mention here that I am an Asian American female and that I do see some racial and gender discrimination in hiring around the area I live in and the type of jobs I'm interested in. Also, I really only wanted a job for a year and then quit to do TEFL, I just wanted some income and insurance before I attempted going abroad.

How I got hired... 

I had an interview last week for this freight forwarding company that required no experience at all. I was told that I could hear a response by the end of the week or the following week. I didn't hear anything, so I emailed the interviewer at the start of the following week to ask for an update. I didn't take an interview for another job because it was immediately after this one and I wouldn't have made it on time, plus, this one did sound like I'd be learning something different than my previous jobs. I was hoping to see if I got the job or if not, at least I'd be able to apply to other jobs. I got a response back asking when I could start and to show up a couple days later.



My experience at the new job so far...

The day comes and I'm locked out with no communication until I call the manager to ask what happened. He's out buying supplies (desktop computer) for me and that he was coming in an hour later, but my coworker should be there. That coworker seems to come in 10-15 minutes late every day. 

So, when I first applied to this job it said, ""Mandarin preferred"", but I don't speak Mandarin, and we do work with imports from China. My coworker tried giving me a rundown of what he does, but his first language is Mandarin and he wasn't too good at explaining things to me, especially as someone who has no idea about freight forwarding. Within the first hour, I lost all excitement for this new job.

The manager later has me google ""Incoterms"" for a few hours after I set up my computer/station. Honestly, I was so confused the whole time looking it up. While doing this, the manager and coworker do their own work, taking/making phone calls, and other things. The manager then tries to explain the terms to me but he kind of talks and uses terminology I hadn't heard since college or haven't heard of before. I don't do well learning when it's just verbal instead of visual/actually doing things myself, so I'm just confused the whole time. 

At the end of the day, he had me try to match documents to our system to check for errors for an attempt. He would ask if I had any questions, but I still literally had no clue what anything meant so I did ask a few questions, but his answers were so long and honestly, I don't even know if he answered my questions. I had to ask him to review my work and I got things wrong.

The next day, what do you know? He tasked me with matching documents to the system the whole day. Not even a ""try doing a few yourself and let me know when you're done so I can go over things with you"". I ended the day without anyone checking, so for all I know, my work could be incorrect and I'm just continuing to do things incorrectly. He would ask if I had any questions though, but I feel like sometimes, you don't know what to ask.

The following day, he has me doing similar things and importing documents from the email into the system. I finished at 11:20 am or something and sat around doing nothing (yeah, I didn't want to do anything else), but the manager didn't even notice/check in on me to see what I was up to. Then, I went on lunch at 12:45 and came back at 1:15 to pretend to work again. It wasn't until 2:45 or so that he finally checked in on how I was doing, so I made up some BS that I couldn't understand some email since it was in Mandarin. He installed this translator thing on Outlook and left me to finish my work which only took 20 minutes lol. Later, at like 4:30, I figured I couldn't pretend to be busy the whole day on a few emails, so I let him know I'm done. He then ""teaches"" me how to check for the actual day of departure and estimated day of arrival for each shipment. He kind of already taught me that on the first day.



The environment...

I guess I'm also not used to working in an office setting. All of my previous jobs required me to walk around a lot and/or talk to people/customers. 

There's only 3 of us currently in that office and the only time they talk is to ask each other questions about problems that come up or if they had to call/take a call to get some information or fix a problem. I feel kind of alone (?). I'm not even an extrovert but there's not much of any comraderie between us. 

They are nice enough though and the manager does suggest to me that I should get up and take a break every now and then because I shouldn't be looking at screens for so long and he doesn't want me to get burnt out so fast.

Also, they're both smokers. They constantly go on smoke breaks and come back in, so I'm breathing in secondhand smoke. Plus, they throw away their cigarette butts inside the office near our desks.

Then, there's no windows except by the door but the door is also blocked off by another wall. I feel like I'm locked in or something.



My current situation is...

I know that I do not care about this career path. I do not like my work situation. I know that the manager is looking to expand this company. I feel I took on too much immediately.

But, I need a job with benefits. It's hard getting a job right now. I don't even know how soon I could get another job, if I could even get a job. I feel bad that this manager took a chance on me.

I guess I'd be doing them a favor by quitting asap instead of wasting time training me, but again, I can't guarantee a getting another job with benefits. I also guess I fooled the manager well enough because he thinks I'm a fast learner, smart, and a hard worker lol.

  
Please push me in either direction with what you just read. Should I just stick with it for a year, learn as much as I can, and stay because it's so hard to find a job with benefits right now? It could be growing pains of a new job. Or should I just quit and hope I get lucky getting another job?",Solid_Loquat_7520,3,0.7200000286102295,9,1727553034,2024-09-28 19:50:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frmke4/feeling_conflicted_about_my_current_situation/,9,2024
1frmbxx,From arts to medicine - worth it?,"I am playing around with some ideas and I am looking forward to some useful insights or stories of experience etc.

I feel really stuck lately and try to decide on my next move. I have an art degree but the art world did not really feel great for me as it was too unstable, too much based on appearances and networking, constant competition. In my late 20's I decided to use my foreign language skills to study linguistics and landed a job at a big corporation with benefits and all. I have the stability and I am grateful for it, especially in this economy.

However, I still feel stuck and feel like I can't actually do anything remarkably useful and my security and income depends on my current employer and I feel that I do not have enough specific skills to really feel secure and, truth be told, useful for the world in the bigger picture.

I have thought about getting another art degree to create my own work but I realized I don't really need a degree for it as I have already arts background and connections and it would not solve my issue with security.

So I play around with the idea to go to study something in the medical field. I hereby mean: optometrist, dental technician or even art therapy etc.

Do you think someone in their 30's, with an art degree and linguistics background (with objectively bad math skills) could ever make it in medical field? Do you have any recommendations for some specific area? Maybe you have some experience or have seen somebody make this kind of move? Would this even be realistic and worth it?

When I was working in the old job, I really enjoyed the problem solving & working with people aspects that came with IT -- it kind of seemed like I found a new passion.

My current job is fine, it's definitely not my passion but I also don't hate it either.

My main concern with staying on in my current field is that I will regret it later on in life (but maybe it will be enough to just simply treat it as a hobby on my own time & volunteer to learn new stuff?).

1frlm4s,Seeking Career Advice: Promotion Offer After Organizational Changes,"Recently, my organization went through significant changes, and two key figures—my direct report (a director) and a closely working manager—were let go. As a result of this restructuring, I have been offered a promotion from my current team lead role to a managerial position. This new role would involve inheriting my boss's responsibilities, managing more employees, and overseeing my current duties.

I was offered a $10k salary increase (from $133k to $143k), along with a $25k retention bonus, payable if I remain with the company for the next year. While this is a generous offer, I'm considering my options given the increased workload and responsibility. Here’s what I’m thinking:

1. **Accept the Offer**: Although I am relatively new to both the team lead and managerial roles, I could take on the new responsibilities and agree to the salary bump and retention bonus as offered.
2. **Negotiate for a Higher Salary**: Given the increased scope of work, I could counter with a request for a $20k salary increase, keeping the $25k retention bonus intact.
3. **Look for New Opportunities**: The added workload might be overwhelming, and I could explore other roles that might better align with my long-term goals and work-life balance.

I've worked closely with my former boss for the past eight years, and he’s been both a mentor and a close friend. It's been difficult to process his departure, but I want to make the best decision for my career moving forward.

1frjo2q,Should I Apply for a Higher-Paying Job at My University?,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently facing a dilemma regarding my job situation and could use some advice. I’m working as an Associate Research Administrator at a good university. I’m happy with my role—it’s flexible with great pay, nice coworkers, and I only have to be on campus once a week.

Recently, a colleague from my previous department who became a Senior Research Administrator mentioned that her department is hiring a Research Administrator. This position offers significantly higher pay. I’m interested, but there’s a catch: her new boss is a close friend of my current boss. I’m concerned that if I apply, she might mention it to my boss, which could create tension or damage my reputation if I don’t get the job.

I’m torn between taking a chance for better pay and growth, and staying in my current role where I’m comfortable. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on how to navigate this without burning bridges?

Thanks in advance for any insights!

1frjjtt,Best Career for long term growth and earning potential between 2 options (healthcare),"Hello,

I am an adult and pediatric echocardiographer (also called cardiac sonographer)

I examine adults and kids with heart disease using ultrasound. It's a diploma in Canada. 

I currently work for a travel agency (think travel nursing but for ultrasound). I make 80/hr traveling. Around 40/hr if I got a job as a hospital as a staff member. 

It's good money. I just personally get bored unless I'm growing and learning new things.

I have two options with my education to finish my degree. 

1. Dual train in MRI and basically do both MRI and Ultrasound. I pay grades are the exact same (at hospitals) so it's really a lateral move financially it seems but lots of demand for MRI technologists.

I'm actually about 1/2 done my MRI degree. I really just did it cause I was bored. It's very interesting technology and I just love studying and learning new stuff really. I'm just worried I'll slowly go crazy if I keep working in dark rooms attending to the never-ending stream of patients doing more-or-less the same scripted task over-and-over. I need to use my brain to solve problems or else I'll slowly go crazy I think. 

2. Get a degree in Technology Management. This is essentially a way to move into Clinical Management at a hospital. I think it lends to my strengths which is problem solving and enjoy working with different groups people. I can transfer some of my credits over to this degree so I'm not concerned being half finished my MRI degree. I guess I could move to medical sales as well perhaps but I'm not sure.

 It seems like there is more career growth in hospital management, whereas there is little upward mobility as a medical imaging technologist. 

Maybe there is a third option I'm not aware of and was hoping to see what strangers on the interwebs thought. 

Just as an FYI, I wouldn't make 80/hr as an MRI technologist until I worked at least a year at a clinic or hospital and then did travel work. 

I'm really just looking for variety and interesting problems to solve. 

Your thoughts are appreciated. 

Thank you

1friiwu,"I am about to graduate college with a BS in Economics, but I want to also pursue my childhood dream job. What should I do?","Hello, any advice is greatly appreciated. 

I am 22, about to graduate university with an Economics degree and am currently working in Business Development. It wouldn’t be hard for me to find full time employment upon graduation as I have a nice network that I’ve been building throughout my time in college. 

However recently (the past half year), I haven’t been able to shake the feeling of wanting to pursue my childhood dream job of being a firefighter. A close friend of mine recently became one and it reminded me of my how I wanted to be a firefighter when I was little. I know it sounds stupid, and it definitely is. I am aware it is hard to be a firefighter and I know it’s a very difficult job, and being a firefighter would not pay nearly as much as working in industry would. However, I want to help people, I greatly respect first responders, and have really been thinking about doing it. The idea of working as someone who I personally respect feels nice.

I know I will only live once and I feel like I’ll regret not at least trying to pursue it. 

Is there any way I can do both? Firefighters work on every third day generally which leaves time to do other things on the side. Would it be possible to put my economics degree to work like that? I have loans to pay off, although not too much, they do exist. Most of firefighter second jobs are trades, not a corporate setting.

Am I insane for wanting to pursue this path despite my current trajectory? I had abandoned this thought a long time ago but for some reason, it’s back. Should I just chalk this up to childishness and keep only working on a corporate career, or should I try to do both? I would love to do both if possible, but I need to be realistic. Do y’all even think it’s possible?

What should I do? 
I need realistic outside opinions

1fridr3,How do I market myself to the corporate world?,"For 10+ years I’ve had a career in the arts, but due to some health changes I’m having to look for a more stable career. 

Jobs I’ve had in the past and a bit about them: 

Props assistant and head of department on touring live shows for both arena and theatre. Think Broadway musicals and kid shows. These jobs meant I would travel to a new city each day  or each week and set up our show and run performances. I’ve worked in most states in the continental US and 12 countries outside North America. Props department is responsible for setting up any furniture or small hand props, facilitating safety and cleanliness backstage and setting up instruments and supports for live musicians if the show has them. 

Purchaser for film and television: 
I’ve worked in art department but also as an overall buyer for a production. If you need it, we will find it. One of my favorite achievements was finding out at 7 am on a Sunday that we needed a rental mobile stripper pole delivered to our venue and set up for rehearsal by 11 am that morning. This job entails in person and online shopping, vendor management, communication, logistics and creative problem solving. 

Prop master for theatre, set decorator for TV, and non union art director for small projects: 
Establishing a creative vision that aligns with the script and artistic direction, sourcing, fabrication, and management. Installation skills, aesthetic eye, problem solving in real time. Communication with the creative team and clients. 

What I’m looking for:
1. Short term (now through possibly mid February.) remote and flexible opportunities that pay in the $25/hr range, part time. Right now, we are in the midst of medication trials and determining what my health looks like long term and what is sustainable for me. I really need a survival job at the moment. 

2. Long term: 
Something that uses my skills but isn’t soul crushing. Remote and flexible hours would be a plus so i can take a sick day if i need and make up work later in the week. Benefits will be necessary as i am potentially about to lose my health insurance due to not getting enough work this year (health problems + film industry slow down over the last 2.5 years.) 
I’d love to stay adjacent to entertainment if i can but i have a lot of passions as well (nature, animals, wellness, sustainability, and travel.)

1frhgnu,i feel lost honestly... can someone with some experience in this kind of situation guide me?,"I am this stage of my career where I know that I am almost at the brink of burning out from working in marketing (worked across different industries).

Have a look at my profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedbucheeri/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedbucheeri/)

I am born and raised in Dubai but studied in the UK (BA and MA) and worked in Dubai for a bit until I reached a point where I said I just want a change.

I had the opportunity and was lucky enough to be able to reunite with my fiancé in Germany (whom moved there before I did in June 2022) but after having worked here a bit too in Germany, I feel like I am just stuck and lost as to what to do.

Maybe I am just a bit tired of not being to do something different in marketing or maybe it is more of I know that I don’t want to deal with advertising for something I don’t believe in (I cant really tell what it is). But I know for a fact that I am done pushing sales for corporate entity through marketing initiatives and want something different.

Now don’t get me wrong, I know how hard career changing is and it is not that I hate marketing, and I know I can continue to do it because it is something I have been doing my whole life but at the same time, I am wondering if I should really change into tech maybe so to make my profile stronger if I want to work in other countries and cities like Singapore, Japan, New York, Kuala Lampur, Sydney, etc. Maybe my experience is not enough at the moment.

For some reason I cant get past the first stage of interviews this year in Germany and this didn’t happen to me the past few years as much as it is happening this year. I might be doing something wrong.

My last company is under the process of going insolvent and I was a part of mass layoffs and so I need to find another job ASAP in Germany but at the same time I need to learn the language too because I haven’t spent a lot of time learning it since was busy commuting 2.5 hours each way for work at times.

I am thinking if anyone has been in a similar situation and what would you suggest I do?

If I don’t find a job in marketing again a third time (which I have been lucky to do so in Germany without being fluent in german) then my visa will run out by February 2025.

I will then either try to go back to Dubai with my fiancé but we really want to try working in Singapore, always wanted to try it out.

What do you suggest I do in my case? Do I try and go under a period of self discovery where I try to go into tech? I do find computer science fascinating although my real heart lies in the field of psychology but that won’t put bread on the table as much as tech and psychology (being a psychiatrist and a career who helps people as i love helping people!) wont make me travel and be in demand as a skilled worker as much as tech.

1frh5bp,How to handle bullying in a job I don’t like ?,"
I recently started a new job in a position and industry I know I’m not passionate about. I only took the job because it paid decently well and was close to home, with the plan being to continue to find an entry level position in the finance industry, where my true passion lies.

Before being hired, I had multiple interviews where I set out my salary expectations and was told repeatedly that they were “easily doable”. Come to the job offer and I am offered 10% below what I was, at the very least, expecting. I decided to negotiate the offer to my minimum I ask and they decline, saying it’s 70k or nothing. Being a pay raise from my current position, I accepted. 

On my first day, my manager was totally unprepared and told me I was the one who had to setup all my work materials (laptop, phone) with the company IT department. After I figured everything out, they immediately threw me into the job without any formal orientation or training. I’m a quick learner, so I wasn’t bothered by it, only by the fact that nothing was organized. Then, they showed me to my office, which was a pig sty with papers scattered all over the floor and unlabelled car parts on the desk, and told me they expect it clean in a week (again, another area I thought should have been handled prior to me starting).

Now to the big issue; my manager is nice, if not a little disorganized and stressed (word is she won’t be there for much longer as most employees apparently only stay for a few years before they leave or fired by corporate), and most of my coworkers are helpful. However, the general manager for the business is not. When I had trouble setting up my work materials, I reached out to a couple coworkers who told me to ask the administrative assistant as they may save me from a call to IT. The assistant (my cousin) was unsure but decided to ask his manager (the GM) if her permission was needed for file access. I then hear the GM proceed to say in a nasty tone, emphasizing my name so I can hear the conversation, “well has xxx (me) spoken to his manager about this? Xxx needs to remember that in here, your *insert their name* not little cousin, so tell xxx to contact IT for themselves”. I was floored, as I’ve worked in many different workplaces across different industries and had never heard a superior speak that way. 

That conversation left me with a sour note but I decided to ignore it and carry on with my day and week. Later on in the day, I was introduced to the mechanics, whom I will be scheduling, and let them know that I have an open door policy to make their jobs easier in any way possible. They then proceed, throughout the week, to belittle me any time I see them with little comments like “hey it’s our little buddy xxx, you know the exits the other way if you wanted to leave early like you always do” (even though I haven’t worked under 9 hours a day so far) and talking amongst themselves in front of my manager and I with things like “we had a pool now long you’d last here, can you believe he’s still here, he didn’t look like he’d last a day” or when they were talking about their tools “hey you look like you could use some new tools, you look like you’ve never done manual labour in your life little guy”. I was shocked they were speaking to me like that in front of my manager and even more shocked my manager ignored it. Additionally, any time I try to talk to them about something pertaining to both of our jobs, they just ignore me in front of my manager, which directly impacts how well I’m able to do my job.

Long story short, I’m looking for some advice on how to proceed with coworkers who are bullying me in front of my manager, a GM who is rude and leads through intimidation, and a job that I’m not passionate about. 

I could go to HR, but my fear is that they’ll be even worse after, for essentially “ratting them out”. And, if I go to the GM, they’ll just tell me to take it up with my manager, who was there hearing it the whole time. I don’t want to quit without another job lined up, and I would hate to leave the position within the first few months as most of my coworkers are nice people and I would hate to screw them over, my cousin included, who would still have to work there.",LilBuffett99,2,0.75,8,1727538296,2024-09-28 15:44:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frh5bp/how_to_handle_bullying_in_a_job_i_dont_like/,9,2024

1frgjq1,Just got a job offer and I feel conflicted,"After months of searching for jobs with absolutely no luck even landing a phone interview, I managed to have an interview 4 of the 5 days last week and another one scheduled for next week. Of the 4 days I interviewed, 2 of them were for the same job (one phone interview and one Teams interview). After the interview concluded, I was told that I would probably have another interview set up with my boss' boss. Within 3 hours of the interview concluding, I received a phone call telling me that I would be getting the job offer on Monday. By end-of-day Friday, I had the job offer letter in my email inbox.

After the interview, I had a good feeling that I was going to get the job. Everything just seemed to go the way I wanted it to, and I had a good response to every question thrown my way. I did some digging and everything seemed to check out as legit as far as not being a scam or MLM, but I felt it was a little bit too easy. When asked for the salary I expected, I gave a range. I will be starting off at the top end of the range I gave, which is near the top end of the range for anyone in my position according to Glassdoor. I will also have good benefits starting from day one, pretty generous PTO and sick leave, and a hybrid work environment. My supervisor (the guy who interviewed me) also seemed like a genuinely good person to work for.

I'm worried that there is some sort of catch that I'm not seeing. The Glassdoor ratings tend to be around 2.9-3.3 with over 2000 reviews. I also see conflicting information such as some reviews saying there's a lot of overtime required (which would suck because the job is salary) and others saying that there are rarely weeks where you have to work above 40 hours. 

This job seems, on paper, to be much better than the place I work now. I have to relocate about two hours from where I live now, so coming back to my current job isn't an option if it doesn't work out. I'm still going to go to my interview next week, but I don't think I can turn this down.

1frenbu,I saw a folder in a shared drive that I wasn’t supposed to and am scared to get fired,"I am part of a management team (but do not manage folks, I’m an advisor) and was asked to look for a specific presentation from over a year ago for our executive director. After checking obvious folders I started kind of clicking through them all to see if I could find it hidden somewhere. I came across a duty to accommodate folder and while not related, thought it might be a policy piece I should be aware of. I clicked on it and saw folders with employee names. I mistakenly clicked (my hands were shaking from anxiety because the folder was not what I thought it was) on an employee’s name and immediately exited the entire browser. I didn’t click on any of the information included within that employee’s folder. I have a severe anxiety disorder and basically was having a huge panic attack about what I found and didn’t do any snooping inside the folder. 

Later that day, a manager (not mine) called and asked why I was in that folder because it has an audit trail. I said I was managing a new employee’s permissions that day (which is technically true but I was super caught off guard and wanted to talk to the union first). I didn’t tell her it was a mistake because this manager has been bullying me for the last year and I don’t trust her. For context, She has fully screamed at me for moving a desk slightly closer to the wall because the cables were a foot off the floor from being pulled taut and causing a health and safety issue. She moved the desk from its intended position because she felt like it should be facing a different direction. She then sent an email to all staff advising that nobody should be moving desks without her permission. She has fully berated me for sending requested information “without director approval” when the approval actually was in the email chain she just didn’t look, then sent an oops email, not a sorry email. She tried to get a manager to take away my permissions for a software used to track clients when I was doing a massive project for her (even though I’m not on her team, because nobody on her team was willing to take it on) that required me to used this software to ensure proper destruction dates were catalogued. It felt like she was trying to find anything that could stick to nail me with something. 

Anyway, I’m a unionized employee and reached out to my union. They said that if I don’t have a history of this stuff I should be ok as it was a mistake and I didn’t actually access any of the protected info within the folder. They also said the management team should have properly locked down the folder so people couldn’t happen upon it. I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m about to be fired for a stupid mistake and am too anxious to reach out to my actual manager.

I'm stressed, and on top of the constant disapproval of customers, I am in a training program to familiarize myself with the products and internal processes. 

I know the obvious choice might be to boomerang back to my old company, especially since they matched my offer. But I’m torn between the fear of looking like I’m running back at the first sign of trouble and wanting to make a smart, long-term career move. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Did you decide to stick it out, or did you go back to your old company, or even look for a new job? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1frdjqq,"Credit Analyst or Card Sales Manager ?
","Hello,

I am a recent graduate with a degree in Finance and currently have two job offers. The first is from a mid-tier bank for a Credit Analyst role, which offers a competitive salary at the entry level. The second is from a leading bank in the country for a Card Sales Manager position, offering nearly double the compensation and positioned three levels above entry.

I am uncertain about which opportunity to pursue. In the next 3-4 years, I plan to pursue an MBA, likely in the USA, Australia, or the Netherlands. My long-term goal is to build a solid career, and I’m trying to assess whether it’s more advantageous to stay in a finance-focused role or to take the sales position for higher compensation and quicker progression.

I would greatly appreciate any insights on which path might have better long-term potential.

Thank you.",fatgeralt_of_rivia,1,1.0,0,1727527714,2024-09-28 12:48:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frdjqq/credit_analyst_or_card_sales_manager/,9,2024

1frbl1v,Newly Hired vs Promoted,"Has anyone else noticed how vastly different the expectations are when you're promoted versus when you're newly hired for the same position? If you're a new hire, it's fine to make mistakes, you get time to adjust, and there's plenty of training. But if you're newly promoted, it's like you're expected to know everything right away—even if your old role was totally different.

The pressure can be intense, especially when the tasks in the new position aren't things you were responsible for before. And sometimes, there's no proper handover or training because they assume, ""You've been here for a while, you should know this by now."" But seriously? Just because I’ve been in the company for a while doesn’t mean I’m automatically an expert at this new job 🥲

I get that we have some company experience, but shouldn’t the learning curve be the same regardless? Has anyone else gone through this?

1frbea2,I’m getting the message I’m being potentially pushed out? Could also be my imposter syndrome though… long-ish one.,"Hi, I (26F) lucked out on a good career considering my “lack” of credentials and experience. I met an exec at my previous job (very different industry) 2.5 years ago. We became friends, and she hired me 1.5 years ago. 6 months after my hire, she gets fired… Mind you, it was only us two in the department (supply chain). My new boss is someone promoted within the company and has a close relationship with the other execs. I like her enough but there are a few things that are off?

Here are the “yellow flags” concerning me:
- I am the 2nd youngest employee and the only woman of color at this HQ. I feel a bit “othered” and there’s pressure to be more put together to avoid this. I tend to dress well. The culture is golf attire but most ppl are VERY casual… I dress business casual and I’m reasonably attractive - there’s a reason I’m bringing this up.  
- People watch me… a lot. I don’t go more than 2 or 3 days without a comment on my appearance (not usually negative ig?). “Oh your hair’s in a ponytail today! Oh you’re wearing jeans today! Oh those must be your everyday earrings blah blah blah”. I’ve been told I need some meat on my bones when I say I’m cold though - Yikes kinda? I’m at a healthy weight…
- At the beginning, I was included in many of the weekly exec meetings over teams. That no longer happens but I also don’t have much to contribute since I’m still learning. Shouldn’t I at least be listening in though…to learn?? I have “manager” in my title and it’s an important role. I support my entire sales team.

Red Flags:
- Again… people watch me…. With my former boss, I was told to come in at 9. This was decided in my interview. With this new exec, I’ve been told to come in at 8. We compromised for “by 8:30”. Mostly I’m there earlier, sometimes a little later. Here’s the thing- There have been times I’ve come in a little later, and my boss is not there (she comes and goes). But she’ll send me a text or call me about what time I’ve gotten to the office? That means I have someone watching me and reporting… very strange because respectfully, I don’t give 2 F’s when other people come in and I don’t even notice… I’ve been on time 95% the last 2 months since the last call.
- I was not invited to the yearly exec/sales meeting last month BUT I was invited to a major seminar 2 months prior. So I’m a bit confused… More than 10 people have asked why I didn’t go to the exec/sales meeting though and it’s concerning… I have a feeling I am “distracting”, though.
- Racists comments in the office every now and then… mostly towards other groups- not mine except for twice. I did address one of them (n word was said during an after hours happy-hour). I’m not that disturbed or surprised. I’ve dealt with this with every job I’ve had which is why my ultimate goal is ENTREPRENEURSHIP. I refuse to be at the mercy of these kind of people, again.

I’m trying to decide if I should talk to my boss about future plans for my role and also mentioning being left out of the sales/exec meeting. I have a bit of imposter syndrome because I didn’t finish school but networked my way into my position. I don’t know if I can get the same salary and benefits if I apply elsewhere while waiting for my business (product-based) to take off. My salary is great. I make a little over 100k with quarterly bonuses included. However, I recently won a lawsuit and have an extra 4k/month for basically the rest of my life (payments started this June). That, plus my salary will get me debt-free within the next 4 months - expenses would then be 3k/month. I have about 20k saved but it’s all going toward my business. 

Here are my options:
- Option 1) Staying and continuing to stack cash while taking care of my business (1-2 year plan). Risking burnout though.
- Option 2) Save as much as I can within the next 6 months and then quitting for a less stressful and time consuming job (maybe something remote? my current job is all in office) while working on the business. Could be less salary though or even worse environment.
- Option 3)Depends… if ya’ll think I’m on my way to being fired…. I should look for something else asap. Getting fired now would set back a lot of my plans for MONTHS. 

Let me know what you all think! Ultimately, I could be overthinking and slightly paranoid and I’m ok with “hearing” that. 
Also feel weird about how my friend/prior boss got fired seemingly abruptly.",Extreme-Low-8534,3,1.0,8,1727519481,2024-09-28 10:31:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1frbea2/im_getting_the_message_im_being_potentially/,9,2024

1frayec,SWE looking to switch to a less stressful job,"Hello, I am currently in my early 30s, i feel like this is going to be my last chance to change and settle for a career. But with the taste of the good pay as a swe. I am not sure what can I switch to that is still some level of expertise while I can do something more consistent and doesn’t have a fluctuating learning curve. I am highly aware of the unavoidable pay cut, but is there a job that could still pay decent but less stress?

I graduated with a BA degree 10 years ago, worked in different fields like customer success, admission sales for the first 4 5 years. After hearing about the good pay in swe, took a bootcamp, landed a faang level company as a dev. 

After working as a swe for around 3 years, I started to think this job is not for me, especially if I got lay off, I don’t think i am competitive enough or good at technical interview to land the next job and I am really not that into AI. 

Being the most junior swe in my team, I always got the most tedious migration work, tho I understand I am not going to be trusted for fast delivery. But even when I got some other work, I just feel like this job just requires you to always drive and never stop as if you own the company. 

Not trying to eat free lunch, but I don’t have a strong mind like everybody else in my team. I just wanted a job where I can accumulate knowledge and will be better at doing the more consistent thing and not having to go thru the learning curve again and again.

1fr9rs1,"Neurodivergence, PIPs, what job should I do now, and where to find it?","I'm in a bit of a predicament. Just to give a bit of background I am currently living in a foreign country, and still very far from being fluent in the language. I have a wife and two young children. Working for a company in the media/tech industry in technical support. I have worked a similar job before in related industry, as well as a more engineering type job in between these more in commercial audio visual. 

I moved to this job about a year and half ago, I could see my last job was taking a turn to taking up too much time, and not working with my wife's schedule where she was going to be away for several days at a time two or three times a month for work, once her maternity leave ended. 

Even before joining this company it started to look more and more like a pain in the ass, from them forcing their branding on my LinkedIn, asking if I could use my personal computer for work (thankfully was saved from this), asking me to sort out my own phone plan, but hey the money was way better, it was WFH and would allow me to take care of my kids when necessary. From then on it always felt like goalposts were constantly shifting and endlessly receiving conflicting information on things like KPIs and dealing with time management. 

My immediate boss is an ok guy, but he is not in my country. I have another boss in-country, and from day one he doesn't really communicate with me. I just hear from him when he wants me to do something for him. Typically this involves some kind of technical set up that usually ends up with me working late. Kinda negating some of the perceived benefits of the position.

In the first few months of working here, my probation was extended as they pulled up questions around my communication with colleagues, and abilities with the software that I had to learn for the position. Perhaps fair to some degree, but I ultimately pulled through that I have thought I was doing fine since. 

After my probation extension the communication stuff and a few other things mentioned really hit a nerve, and mixed with things people have told me about myself in the past started making me wonder why. In my mind I didn't think I communicated any differently to other people, maybe I'm quiet, but that doesn't explain everything. After a bit of research I started to come to the conclusion that I'm in some way neurodivergent, whether it be somewhere on the autism spectrum or ADHD or both I really don't know. The doctor I went to just characterised what I had as anxiety and just pushed pills on me. I was too scared to take them so I ended up being none the wiser.

But now my company pull me up on a PIP, again citing communication concerns. Now they are asking me to go in the office 2 days a week, which I can't really do and is nearly 2 hours away. Amongst a litany of other things I need to improve. Some perhaps valid, some less so. A lot of it sounds like my in-country boss has just splurged a load of resentments. I suspect as retaliation after I raised some concerns about his dealings with his biggest client. Feelings that were shared by HQ (again in another different country).

So now I find myself in a position I definitely did not want to be in. I've got three months to improve or...I don't know. They didn't actually say, though the implication is a firing. Ultimately I took that as three months to find a new job whether that was their intention or not. Really I'm just fed up with this company anyway, I've felt like leaving since pretty much the beginning. I was hoping to hang on until next year with the promise of a pretty decent chunk of money, but at this point I don't think my mental health can take it. 

I'm not sure what I really want to ask here, I just feel lost and cornered. I don't really feel like staying in this industry even if I *can* find a job where I don't need to speak the language. I feel like any company I join, somebody is going to take a disliking to me because I don't interact how they want me to, and I'll end up in the same position. 

Part of me wants to go solo and either freelance or start a business, but then I just run the risk of it being the same with clients not liking me for the same reasons. I've always been curious about using the creative video software I learnt in my past jobs to make money, but since I left University I just don't feel like I have a creative streak in me anymore. And even if I did I risk not being able to take care of my family.

I wonder if there's job I haven't considered yet that would work for someone who doesn't communicate too well? And where are people finding jobs these days anyway? I don't find anything much on LinkedIn or the few careers sites in this country.

1fr9eso,Which choice would you take?,"Would you take less pay to learn more or more pay to look good on your CV? 

Bit of background, I recently received a job offer from a global IT company who is offering to pay 10K more in salary + 44K OTE (114K total package). My sales role at the moment is in Distribution, but i genuinely enjoy the people and the job but pay has always been a bit of a bummer, only getting roughly 67K total package.

Current job has offered to look at ways to change my target and to look at ways to develop my career further in sales. Money has been discussed, but unfortunately due to the global market, they cannot promise anything yet, nor can they match the salary.

Here’s the dilema, whilst the potential company will pay more and has more of a greater name value on my CV, I am not sure whether I should sacrifice the potential learning I could receive from staying at this company and stick with the lower pay.

I can *kinda* read and write, but I attribute that mainly to having a basic understanding of Spanish syntax and grammar.

1fr81et,Help - Can I go to HR?,"To give some background, I have been in my current role for about 3 years. I wasn’t able to do the role I was originally hired to do for the first 2 years due to other needs of the company. I was able to finally start doing my role about a year ago now. A big part of my job requires me to work closely with… let’s call her Stacey. About 2 years ago, she was promised the role by folks who are no longer with the company even though she has no prior experience, schooling, etc. She has been with the company for over 10 years, so she has a lot of tribal knowledge, but unfortunately not the technical skills required for my role. Since I work with her on a daily basis, I interact with her quite a bit. Almost every time we are together, she makes a remark about how she’s not mad at me for stealing her job, how she’s not getting the promotion she was promised, even to the point where she throws it in my face that she is hourly where I am salary. I can usually let things like this go, but this has been going on for over a year. More back story, I had to move away from her to another part of the office because she would constantly listen to my meetings and tell me things I should have done/said, interrupt meetings she feels she should be a part of, and inserting herself into conversations. She is also notorious for being what you could call the office bully. She is constantly talking negatively about others in the office thinking we don’t know about it. I went to her manager with all of this a year ago, and because of this he created a document for the whole department to sign stating that if any of these (her) behaviors continue, we would be subject to termination. I met with him last week to let him know that I can give him an example for each bullet point on the document that is still continuing a year later. His response was that HR is aware of the issue, but that there are too many changes happening at the leadership level for them to help us. This is the same response I got at the beginning of the year when I spoke to his boss. I told him it felt like we are being put on the back burner, and that Stacey should be held accountable for her actions. I also told him I respect him enough that I wanted to go to him first before going to HR. He said he plans to meet with HR again next month, but at this point I’m not sure I believe him. I’ve even spoken to his boss, who said she is letting him figure it out. Am I going crazy? Do I just let it go? Or can I go to HR? Her constant remarks and behaviors are really taking a toll on my mental health to the point where I dread going into the office everyday. Any advice would be appreciated at this point.

I wanted the one who sustained my law school because it is so expensive, and when I fail, no pressure because it's my own money, but the problem is the psychology degree salary here in the Philippines is low because what if I don't want to pursue law out of laziness and academic exhaustion? Nganga ako? but based on what I have seen and read, law is very crucial and hell. I love reading, but only novels, not the educational ones. How do I become a lawyer then?

1fr5ini,Perspective on failure at work,"Hey there.

Don’t mean to be a drag, but I’ve been feeling pretty down about myself and my work.

In a nutshell, I work for a company where small details matter a lot. I feel like I’m qualified for the job (it’s a very specialized field) and one of a very, very, small percentage of people who could do it as well as I do. I’ve worked for the company for two years and have had many good moments.

That said, my boss (who’s the coolest guy in the world) is more or less something of a genius in this field and his eye for detail is shockingly good. Still, he’s been very understanding and supportive when I haven’t produced work as good as him.

Our goal has been to get me to 80-90% of the quality that he would produce, and I think I do that more than half of the time. Still, there are times that details are just slipping past me and I’m not sure how to handle it.

This last weekend, I had a project due. I raked over it for hours and hours, double and triple and quadruple checking for anything that could be critiqued and just couldn’t find anything that seemed noteworthy.

He’s been incredibly supportive, but sometimes recently I’ve felt like his tone has changed just a little, and maybe it’s starting to bug him more. He had multiple notes on all of my projects. Unfortunately I’m just not sure how to correct this. I really felt like I tried my hardest and I’m just not sure if I’m good enough to get to 90% of his level of work consistently.

How do you handle failure like this? This job means so much to me and losing it would break my heart. I’ve seen myself phrased in future plans (a project starting in 2025) and the company has invested a lot to get me in place… but I just worry that I won’t be enough someday.

Sorry for the rant. Maybe I’m paranoid. It’s been on my mind nonstop and I’ve been waking up in the middle of the night thinking about it.",Flashy_Contract_969,1,1.0,0,1727494349,2024-09-28 03:32:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fr5ini/perspective_on_failure_at_work/,9,2024

1fr4gn1,Dream School or Quick Graduation: Is My Next Move a Life-Changer or a Setback?,"I’m not sure if what I'm feeling is anxiety or depression, since I haven’t been diagnosed, but for weeks now, I haven't been able to sleep well because of constant overthinking. Please give me some advice.

Back in senior high school, I admit that I didn’t prioritize my future because I focused more on being heartbroken over my ex, so I neglected my college applications. By the time I realized it, I missed the cut-off for my dream university, and as a result, I had to enroll in a private university since it was the only one open and nearby at the time.

Fast forward, I was in my second year of college last December 2023, but due to financial struggles, I couldn’t continue with my second semester of that year. I ended up being idle for eight months. My mistake was, instead of helping myself by finding a job, I chose to drink, hang out with friends, and party because I was so sad that I had to stop studying. Back then, I felt like I wouldn’t achieve anything in life.

But last month, something significant happened that made me wake up to all the wrong things I was doing with my life. 

So, the first thing I did to help myself was find a job, and thank God, yesterday I received my first paycheck.

Now, here’s my problem. I have two choices.

Choice A: I have a chance to fulfill one of my dreams by getting into my dream university.

Pros:
- It's my dream university.
- It's a big and well-known school.
- It's a state university, so I can save money while studying. No tuition fee, goverment funded.

Cons:
- Enrollment opens in February to March, which is super late. If I choose this university, I need to be ready for the possibility that I might not pass the admission. If that happens, I won’t be able to start studying again until August, and life will leave me behind again.
- If I do pass, I’ll have to start over as a first-year student due to their policy. That means I’ll graduate by 2028 instead of 2026, and by then, I’ll be 24 years old.

Choice B: Enroll again in a private university but has the cheapest tuition fee. 

Pros:
- I won’t have to worry about whether or not I’ll pass.
- I can continue my second year without going back to first year, though I’ll be an irregular student.
- I’ll graduate sooner, in 2026, at 22 years old.

Cons:
- I won’t be able to save money for two years, as all my earnings will go toward school fees.
- I’ll need to be fully committed as a working student for two years.

That’s my dilemma, guys. I feel like these choices will either MAKE or BREAK me, and I’m really struggling to decide. Please let me know what you think. I need some advice because I’ve been overthinking this, and I don’t want to make any more mistakes in my life. I really want to set my future straight.",dixie_normus666,1,1.0,0,1727490572,2024-09-28 02:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fr4gn1/dream_school_or_quick_graduation_is_my_next_move/,9,2024
1fr4fbh,"Withdrew from university for a third time and wasted my financial aid due to mental health disabilities. I'm now ready to go back, but I don't know where to start.","Hello! 

I am one quarter away from graduation, but it's been an extremely rough path to get here. I used to be a straight A, Dean's list student until I began struggling with suicidal ideation and major depressive disorder. I have had to withdraw and re-apply for reinstatement \*and\* financial aid many times, and I don't know what would be wise to do next. I now have a great therapist and have found the right medication to address the worst of my struggles, so I believe I am ready to try again and complete my degree.

One issue is that I feel guilty taking financial aid that could go to students who will certainly make use of it--unlike me, who historically wasted a lot because I had to withdraw multiple times. I have gone back and withdrawn enough times that I don't know if I could possibly get financial aid again. I'm turning 27 soon and want to finish my degree, but finances are my main concern. I haven't been able to find a job besides my independent contracting work (which is not a stable nor consistent income). I even applied for part time retail jobs (with years of customer service experience on my resume) and didn't get any response so far. This is another reason why I want to finish my degree. I want to do work that is fulfilling and meaningful with a livable income, but the jobs that would allow me to do so typically require a bachelor's degree in the very least.

Has anyone been in a similar situation before? And can anyone share their success stories in pursuing a fulfilling career with mental health issues (like severe depression/suicidal ideation, anxiety, etc.)?

1fr1e7i,Contract Worker for 1 Year - Chance of Landing Full-Time Position?,"Hi everyone!

I am seeking advice on converting my contract role to a full-time position.

Here is my current situation:

* I have been working as a temporary support contract worker with a company for almost a year *(1-year mark this October)*
* My contract has been extended a total of 4 times, currently set to expire in early 2025.
* I currently support multiple departments in the company and reporting to various people when needed.
* Day-to-day job responsibilities involve administrative works, reports, and LOTS of Excel.
* I currently have gained a good understanding of what each department does as I have worked closely under them for over a year.
* I have expressed interest in a full-time position to HR and management multiple times. I had even been vocal about this in my first interview hiring process.
* If it helps, this is in Canada.

My questions:

1. Why do they just keep extending my contract instead of offering a full-time position?
2. A few months ago, I asked for sick days as I have been working with them for quite a while. They have been quite generous and gave me vacation pay and paid sick leaves. Why would they give me these new benefits if they plan to let me go in the future?
3. Is it common to be stuck in a cycle of contract extensions, or is there still hope for a full-time opportunity?

I would appreciate any insights, similar experiences, or advice on how to approach this situation.

I really love working for the company as it aligns very well with what I graduated with and has a good work-life balance.

Should I continue hoping for a full-time offer, or start looking elsewhere? Any strategies for converting my position to full-time?

1fqxmod,"Offered a promotion, fundamentally disagree with their approach ","I work for a large global organisation with my office based in the UK. I have been offered a role in the next pay band up in the same department. This is a back door promotion (12 month secondment) which I have been cherry picked for. It is for a team where vacancies are few and far between. 
It would be standard practice for this to go on the jobs board for everyone to apply for, but due to a project that is stretching their resources this needs to be filled at pace. 
My problem is, if a colleague was given this opportunity and I found it was done in this manner, I would be the first person calling bullshit (maybe that’s why they picked me). I also know a few colleagues who would love this opportunity so I feel it is going to cause unrest as they couldn't even declare interest.  My moral compass is telling me to say no, but my partner is saying everyone else would say yes and not give me a second thought. She is likely right but I'm a stubborn sod and want to keep my integrity (I hate double standards).

Last year, there was a company-wide update to job descriptions and some extra responsibilities were added to mine. I received a pay rise but this was not a promotion. 

This evening, I’ve been pulling together evidence to ask for a promotion. As part of this, I found the job description I applied for at Senior Executive level and when I compared this to my current Executive level job description I realised the entire job description is exactly the same, word for word, apart from mine has MORE responsibilities.

1fqwfdj,From Rock Bottom To Wealthy Mindset: How I Turned My Life Around And Found My PURPOSE (And How You Can Do It Too),"Hey Reddit,

I’m Darin Jackson Jr., and I’ve been on quite the rollercoaster ride in life. I tasted success early in my business journey, but then I lost it all—money, purpose, and even a sense of who I was. I hit rock bottom, feeling depressed and completely stuck. Honestly, it was one of the darkest times in my life.

But here’s the thing: I clawed my way back. I discovered my purpose, rebuilt my mindset, and regained success—not just financially, but in a way that brought genuine happiness and fulfillment. Now, I’m on a mission to help others do the same by showing people how to develop a “wealthy” mindset and find their true purpose.

What I’m All About:

I’ve learned that self-image is everything. How you see yourself influences how you navigate the world and how others perceive you. Many successful people understand this, and they use specific mindset techniques to thrive. I’ve spent years digging into these techniques and applying them in my own life, and now I want to share those secrets with you.

Through daily habits, mental shifts, and taking ownership of your journey, I’ll break down how you can use these principles to elevate your life, improve your mindset, and discover what truly drives you.

My Plan:


I’m launching high-quality content across TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram—all under my name, Darin Jackson Jr. I want to build a community where we lift each other up and push ourselves to live our best lives.

	•	TikTok: Expect short, punchy clips filled with mindset hacks, tips on finding your purpose, and insights on self-image. My goal? Create content that resonates so much, it goes viral and shifts perspectives.
	•	YouTube: Once a TikTok video gains traction, I’ll drop a deeper, more engaging video on YouTube, expanding on the viral topic and sharing even more insights. I’ll even dive into the comments I get from Reddit (how many creators do that?!).
	•	Reddit & Community Building: I see Reddit as a key part of this journey. I want to hear from you—your stories, your questions, and your experiences. This isn’t just about me; it’s about all of us growing together.
	•	Coaching & Ebooks: Eventually, I plan to offer coaching calls and create ebooks packed with everything I’ve learned from my own journey.

I Will Post: 



1. Playful Photography/Videography Challenges


2. Behind-the-Scenes Bloopers with a Twist


3. Lifestyle Vlogs with Humor 


4. Incorporate Playful Props in Shoots

	
5. Personality-Driven Tutorials

	
6. Engage Your Audience with Fun Challenges

Why It Matters:


This isn’t just about getting rich or flaunting a glamorous lifestyle. It’s about crafting a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling. I want to help those of you who feel lost or unsure about your next steps. If you’re struggling to find your purpose or if something feels off in your life, my content is for you. Trust me, I’ve been there, and I’m here to help you step into your light.

What You Will Get Out of It:

	•	Practical Mindset Shifts: Learn actionable techniques to change the way you think about yourself and your goals.
	•	Purpose Discovery: Gain insights and exercises that will help you identify what truly matters to you in life.
	•	Community Support: Join a like-minded group of individuals who are also on their journey to self-improvement and personal growth.
	•	Exclusive Content: Be the first to access deeper insights and strategies through my YouTube videos and other platforms.
	•	Inspiration and Motivation: Follow my journey from rock bottom to renewed purpose and let it inspire you to take charge of your own life.

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I’m super excited to start this journey with all of you, and I’d love to hear your thoughts or experiences. Drop any questions or ideas you have—I’ll make sure to include some of your insights in my next YouTube video.

Let’s make 2024 the year we all level up together!

– Darin Jackson Jr.

1fqupt9,New job and Offer Dilemma ,"A little backstory to this so you can have the full picture. I was laid off from gov. contractor company #1 (C1) at the beginning of July. They extended me until the end of September to keep my gov. credentials active so they could be transferred. I worked for them while the gov. manager (gov. side) was working on getting me the job I am currently at. This is gov. contactor company #2 (C2). I stayed relatively the same in terms of level. Moving from one team to another in the sameish department. I like it so far and have gone from 75k at C1 to 76k at C2.  Both C1 and C2 have been remote with the ever-looming possibility of being forced back into the office by the government. This is not super likely, but could happen in a couple of months (no one really has any answers, tragically). 

However, when I thought I would get laid off, I was rapidly applying for jobs, which is where the dilemma comes in. I applied to gov. contractor company #3 (C3). They got back to me the week before I started this job (last week) for the whole process of phone screening to reference check. They just extended me an offer on my fifth day at C2. The offer is for 100k; however, I learned that the team at C3 is in person Tuesday through Thursday and remote on Monday and Friday. The commute would be almost, if not more than an hour each way. C3 aligns a little more with the career goals. There is also a possibility of living with some other family for about a 40-minute commute.

I am very unsure of what I should do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know I would probably burn the bridge at C2, which would suck. I hoped they would let me continue as a sub-contractor on a project (not gov. contract), which was the plan if C1 ended before credentials could be transferred.

1fqupsv,Some words of wisdom would be much appreciated,"Hi all, I’ve recently changed a lot in my life and I am in a bit of a tough mental spot right now. Looking for some advice on a potential career switch. 

I’m 25, in the UK, living just outside of London and I went to University in a smaller town about an hour out from where I am now. At University I studied English Literature and then did an MA in Creative Producing. I ended up loving the town so much I stayed there for 3 years after I finished my degree, working as a manager in a restaurant. Unfortunately, there was little going for jobs outside of hospitality in the area, all paying around the same rate with little opportunity for progression. I decided it was time to make a change, both because I wasn’t putting away much money on the salary after rent and because I have creative interests like music and theatre I want to pursue but the job was too draining to also focus on those and there wasn’t much of a scene for it there anyway. 

So, a month ago I moved back in with my parents. Got a decently well paid part time job as a server where I only spend two days a week, the idea being I don’t fall back into it again and I can spend my time looking for other avenues. But I’m not settled at home, I’m not settled at this new job, and today I’ve spent all day fretting over completely revamping my Linkedin (and CV) but not getting much done. I’ve seen hundreds of jobs im equally under-qualified for as I am indifferent to, and just all round not sure what my solution could be. I’ve been working in hospitality since I was 16, and I’d really like to make the switch out of the industry, and I know that the perfect job doesn’t exist for everyone but I’m really not even sure what to look at to begin with.

1fqucc8,Should I quit my internship? ,"A month ago I started an Artificial Intelligence internship at a very well known European company. At first I was very excited about it, I was told that this is a new team and I will be part of deciding what is the project that I am going to implement. 
However, ever since I’ve started, I realized that my new team has 0 technical knowledge, my project is very low priority, and I have no mentoring or guidance about anything. 

The past few weeks have been mentally draining. I did not anticipate being the only one who needed to come up with project ideas and their AI feasibly, and i am constantly stressed about figuring out something to do while also realizing I might not be qualified to deal with an AI initiative all by myself. (I’m an AI Bachelors student in my final year, but we all know academia is just theory and no practical information). Not only do I feel like I’m not capable of undertaking something like this alone with no one to guide me, I’m also afraid to “expose” myself as a fraud. This is a huge company and even my manager doesn’t know exactly what’s going on, so even when I come up with ideas that she likes, I end up realizing that what I was thinking about was not feasible.

Since my manager is not technical and my project isn’t high priority, I am basically told to just do bullshit research about random things which bores me out of my mind. I literally drag out things that I could finish in 2 hours for the entire week because I hate just sitting at the office staring at the wall. 

In the background of all this, I’m still a student, and due to the mental toll from this internship I have fallen completely behind with my courses. I have exams in 3 weeks and I have not attended a single lecture. 

My question is: do you think I should just quit? I know the state of the job market in this industry is rough, but this internship is 6 months which is a long time to feel like I want to die every single day.

1fqu2kl,[US] NOLA as a Preferred Destination - Mechanical Engineering Career,"Hi all,

Mechanical Engineer with 5 YoE (depending on how you count, things have been weird

I recently took a job in Shreveport working as a Field Support Engineer making 90k. Shreveport is fine for now, but I don't want to live or buy property here. I visited New Orleans and I'm completely in love with the city. I grew up in a city and have been living rural for the last 15 years, I miss being in a city. 

What I'm wondering is: is NOLA a bad career move in general and especially given climate change? No way I would buy property here and paying rent forever while theoretically buying property somewhere else seems like a poor proposition.

I have experience with mechatronics, pcb design, AC and DC motors, mechanical design, documentation, and project management. I have gotten exposed to some technical program managers at my current company and I think that's the kind of role I want to aim for in the near to mid term. I am also hoping to get plc experience if I can at this job, as a hedge/extra skill.

Is planning to move to a city I'd never want to root myself in a bad idea for a career in mechanical engineering?

1fqtj2s,Considering moving states for more opportunities,"**TL;DR:**

Long story short, the current state I live in - Arkansas - does not have many part-time opportunities for my career field - Field Service Engineering. I am currently a part-time student taking in-person classes during the morning time and working some odd jobs later in the afternoon and evenings just to make ends meet. I have received multiple job offers from companies out of state given my hands-on experience and formal military vocational schooling that I used to keep rejecting thinking that I might find part-time opportunities within Arkansas. I want to start looking for opportunities out of state.

**Background:**

Age: 20; Gender: Male; Credentials: Certification of Completion of Biomedical Equipment Specialist from the US Army + Handyman experience working odd jobs for 1 year + Academic Tutor for (cumulatively) 1.5 years to include 6 months of volunteer experience; Money Saved for moving expenses: I am in a position where I can comfortably move;

**Story:**

My credentials entail completing a military school which gave me a certification to service electrical and mechanical malfunctions on every variant of medical equipment (yes, virtually every variation) down to a component-level with 1 year of hands-on experience. Basically, I can work as a BMET 1 or an FSE 1.

That being said, I have been researching the job market in the state of Arkansas for months and have gotten multiple offers via LinkedIn and indeed given my credentials of completing a military vocational school. Every single one of these offers have been from out of state, more specifically, the states of Colorado, Illinois, Washington, and a couple of other namely larger, well-known cities.

After looking at many of these offers and inevitably rejecting them since I chose to continue living within Arkansas. After looking at the job market via LinkedIn and Indeed (and, of course, reviewing my job offers) in just some of the aforementioned states, many of which have part-time or volunteering opportunities in my trained career field that I am more than open to pursue that are available to me only if I had moved there.

I am seriously considering moving out to state to pursue these opportunities.

However, I feel so drawn to art. I don’t actually possess any traditional art skills, but I enjoy… feeling it? idk. Watching others being creative inspires me so much, and it makes me feel like I can achieve anything if I truly want to.

And I want that lifestyle so badly: always creating art, analyzing the world, and interpreting it in my own way. Isn’t that true happiness?

Or maybe I am just afraid of living the “average adult life” (which I actually am, to a huge extent). Should I just stfu and do what I’m supposed to do or wha???😩 Give some advices pls

1fqt9jy,"I quit my toxic job without an offer. I have been consistently looking for jobs, recently got rejected by a big firm and I am feeling low today. Looking for some motivational stories. ","Hi everyone! I joined reddit so I can get some guidance. I have been a straight A student ever since I was a kid, have always thrived on academic validation and achievements. I don't ever remember just chilling or taking any time off ever, if I am not being productive I feel very horrible. So after completing my masters I landed a very demanding and hectic job. Initially I thought because this is the first time I am working, maybe that is why I don't enjoy the work, but as time passed I realised that the work I was doing had no impact what so ever, it never even saw the light of the day. My day consisted of fake urgencies followed by countless meetings and the output was nil, the team usually moved on to the next fake urgency. I was in a client facing role and over the time I could see how the leadership straight up lies to clients about our tech and features to achieve revenue target. In the first year I struggled alot, but whoever I talked to told me that this is how corporate is and wherever you go it will be the same, so why leave? As someone who was in their first job, I followed this advice. In the second year of my job I got used to everything, got a promotion, did everything no questions asked but still I was extremely unhappy. Unhappy to the point where I was anxious and irritable all the time, even in my dreams I only dreamt of office work. I could not bear the lies the company expected me to carry for the sake of revenue, every breathing moment I felt the client will detect the lies and my credibility will go down the drain. Apart from all this the behavior of the leadership was extremely toxic, they were micromanaging everything, getting personal with people, no vision, no strategy, just taking decisions on their whim, and when the decisions backfired they blamed others. And few months ago I was made the scapegoat for the failure of one of the decisions that backfired. I was constantly questioned, scolded publicly and even called as late as 12:00 Am for work, and then scolded again if I did not pick up the call. So one day I had it enough and I checked my savings which are enough to sustain me for an year, I put in my papers. Post that the leadership tried to harass me, questioned my integrity, called me unethical and what not. I turned a blind eye to all that and now I am free from that place. I am lucky that I have super supportive family so I don't have to worry about a job. I have been doing better mentally and physically, no more backpain, headache, or gut issues. Now I sleep without any anxiety and feel a lot happier. I am consistently applying for job from past 3 months, and have been giving interviews but haven't been able to convert anything. While usually I am optimistic, but recently I was in the final round of a very very big company, a dream company for a lot of people and I was rejected. I feel a little low and I worry what if I don't get another big chance... that is why I am here today, want to hear stories of people who quit without an offer, why did you quit, how much time did it take you to land your dream role and what happened after that?",MumenEngineer,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1727458278,2024-09-27 17:31:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqt9jy/i_quit_my_toxic_job_without_an_offer_i_have_been/,9,2024

1fqs9jy,What did your career look like at 23?,"I’m 23 going on 24 and i’ve been at my first job post college for about 8 months now. It’s a job that has nothing to do with my degree (media) or where I wanted to be (music industry). I’m basically an assistant at an office furniture company right now. I took it because I needed the money and figured if I keep volunteering and learning, something would come along eventually. 

I was finally given a big break and promised to be apart of the planning and media team at a new music venue but it seems I’ve been ghosted by them now. At this point, I just feel defeated and never felt like giving up more. 

Maybe I’m accepting I need to take a different path but nonetheless I just feel more lost than ever on what I want to do now. I’ve got a degree, done an internship at a music production company, countless volunteering, and even short term contract positions on top of my current full time job. It just seems like none of it matters.

I’m not really sure if i’m just being too hard on myself at this age or what to do now. Did anyone else feel like this at all at 23/24?",katsalzz,0,0.5,21,1727455681,2024-09-27 16:48:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqs9jy/what_did_your_career_look_like_at_23/,9,2024
1fqs06x,Coworker Crossing Boundaries?,"I recently got hired this month along with my coworker Sam (not real name) after being contractors together. I've known Sam for about a year, and I feel that we have a lot of similar traits that led to us being hired. We're both hard-working, and she's been great to work with on our contractor projects.

However, things have changed a bit since becoming employees. I had been shadowing a person who left the company, and I stepped into his position. Sam has not gotten any tasks that are solely hers, and I've noticed that all of my work outside of the daily tasks I inherited are joint projects with her.

This has rubbed me the wrong way, as I am trying to distinguish myself. We both have different technical skill-sets, and I have put much more time and effort into developing mine. People have been getting us mixed up, and it's usually them attributing my successes to her, which she doesn't correct.

I did talk with her one-on-one about establishing boundaries, but we've determined that it might be difficult to separate immediately, as we're still new to the job and we have a lot of the same questions/demonstrations to go over.

Here's the issue right now: As I'm working on getting better at my role...so is she. With my position. She asks to be in every meeting I set up, takes notes on the processes used in my position, and my coworker who's training me has started including her. She will be covering for me for one day in the future, but that's the extent of what her involvement in my position is supposed to be. It's almost like she's setting up to split this position with me.

She has no work of her own currently, but this is getting ridiculous. She is going to an absurd extent to prepare for substituting for me for one day, and she is now involved in all conversations related to MY position's duties.

So what should I do? I know my manager should probably get involved, but even he sees us as a duo, and it was a struggle to get work when we were contractors. Any advice would be most appreciated.",Agile-Term9020,1,1.0,1,1727454986,2024-09-27 16:36:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqs06x/coworker_crossing_boundaries/,9,2024
1fqrupf,"Please tell me if you think these are ""red flags"" for an employer, am trying to figure out if I want to leave the company","me:

- retired USAF, been at new civilian job for 8 months

what ive noticed:

- prevalent macho, type-A culture at work (IE, im always right, what i say goes, etc)

- they tend to treat new people like theyre idiots (have confirmed this with another co-worker)

- almost completely unable to ""change"" from what theyve ""always"" done

few specific things here:

- the ""trainer"" on my shift is an ultra micro-manager who babbles all shift long about how great he is (not kidding here)

- its to the point to where my 12hr shifts are miserable because he wont STFU and will constantly interrupt you while youre on-task, to give you other tasks or to you show you some dumb bullshit on his phone

- i emailed the manager about it, twice, and he does not reply via email or at all really but i think he has a ""talk"" with the ""shift trainer"" to shut his pie hole sometimes but if it's over text, he of course takes the trainer's side.

and a couple more things here which may go back to the level of respect i am getting:

- a call came over the police scanner (I am former LE), about a report of someone in all black stating he had a gun & wanted to ""shoot somebody"" at my work's exact physical address so i immediately call them and ask if theyre tracking it which they say they arent and act completely nonchalant about it (we do not have armed security). i then text my boss who calls in to make sure theyre safe and everything, but my ""trainer"" pretty much blows it off, even though this happened right at shift change and people are walking to/from their cars legit any minute. the subject was then arrested on an outstanding warrant after he started walking north of work. but like i said, the trainer said ""ok thans for letting us know, but he'd have to get through the front glass and then up to our floor"" implying it was no big deal when we legit have people working ON the first floor and going out for shift change....... so did he completely miss my point? was this him attempting to be ""right"" about something or be the superior by downplaying a report of a guy with a gun?

- after ive already been cleared to do a ""level one review"" of specific materials, one of the ""operators"" then randomly decided i was not qualified to do level one reviews, and decided i could only do them if he initialed beside me which hadnt happened for months

- another operator refused to actually let me use my own mind and mouth, to speak on a phone call that i answered, and instead said i would repeat after him. after i told him ""no,"" he said ""so wait you want me to wait until you make a mistake to interrupt you??"" i said yes... he said ""thats not how this works..."" which made me wonder, ok, so im going to repeat after you for....... how long? the logic there doesnt make any sense. everyone misspeaks on the phones every now and then. THAT's when you stop me. you dont pre-suppose i could ""mess up"" at any second and disallow me from using my own mind. hopefully this is making sense....

the good:

- boss is extremely flexible with PTO

- 83k/yr salary 12k/yr bonus

- 12hr shifts so 165ish shifts a year with PTO

- can take 2 nights of PTO & get 7 days off sometimes (2-2-3 schedule)

the bad:

- ""trainer"" who thinks he's gods gift to the industry who i shit you not, one time rambled for 120 minutes to everyone in our control room

- 2 out of every 5 weeks are night shifts

- 4/10 on our team act in a pompous & demeaning way in general to you. (have confirmed this with anothe co-worker)

- another trainer, call him trainer #2, seemed to get irritated when, during initial training, a new hire (me) would actually figure out the right answer. he then tried to twist the details to make you wrong (again, another new hire said this happened to them).

overall, there seem to be a LOT of red flags at this company but i would also like to know your thoughts.

1fqrj2m,pharmd or mls,"tldr: i cant decide between 6 year pharmd program or 4 year med lab science program



so i'm a junior in highschool right now and i have the option to take extra courses to graduate in 2025 instead of 2026, so now i have to start thinking about what i wanna do in college. 

i'm planning to apply to a 6 year pharmd program (2 years undergrad and 4 years pharmacy school) and a 4 year undergrad medical laboratory sciences program. 

both give me certification to work in a pharmacy or lab respectively. 

even though a pharmacist will make more money, i've been lurking on the r/pharmacy sub and everyone there seems absolutely miserable, from bad workplace conditions to low pay to rude customers to tiring schedules, etc... and the threat of retail after i finish my degree... not to mention the amount of debt i'll have with such a low ROI after graduation, it's all scary af.

i wouldn't say i'm passionate about either (or anything for that matter) but i'm interested in both equally so it isn't a matter of what i want to do.

either way i wanted to work as a traveler because i don't plan to stay in one place for a long time, and from what i've seen travel pharmacists make 2.5-3.5k/wk and travel med lab scientists make 1.5-2.5k/wk. (obviously this isn't 100% accurate but it's what i've seen on a travel agency's website)

i thought that maybe if i take pharmd and chew my way through a year or two of experience i'll be able to work as a traveler so i'd pay off any debts quicker and if i really hate where i'm working i can just tell the agency to put me somewhere else. eventually i'll find a good place that i can settle down in and i'll be making a good amount of money. then again i could also do all of this with the mls program and i'll have saved myself 2 years.

i've never shadowed or worked in a pharmacy before so i have no idea what it's like besides going off of what other people say. i have been to a lab where my mom works and i looked under the microscope and i do find cells and bacteria pretty interesting, but i don't know if i should pursue a career in it.

honestly i just don't want to regret my decision later in life because i literally hate that feeling, so i'm trying to figure out which is the safest option. so if anyone has any clue what i should pick plz help me out here.

thanks in advance!",elymei,1,1.0,0,1727453730,2024-09-27 16:15:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqrj2m/pharmd_or_mls/,9,2024

I'm at the point where I'm still waiting for access but I'm close to starting projects that i was given and honestly idk how to do any of these projects.

1fqqy7h,Not really enjoying my projects ,"For context I am a healthcare consultant at a really great firm love the work life balance etc. I’ve been in the role 7 months and I’m really just not enjoying my projects. I came from sort of a finance strategy role, and now I’m doing payment integrity with claims data. I have a background in healthcare administration and I feel Ike I’m getting too far into the payment side of things. Aka really micro level stuff that I just don’t think plays into my strengths or interests. 

Is my only option to leave or should I see if I can get placed maybe on some different projects that more align with my strengths/interests. My switch from my old job was because I really wanted to get into consulting. I feel like you can get a lot of great experience on different projects and that’s mostly true. I’m just not finding myself motivated on my projects specially! We have a staffing team that I can reach out to maybe and express maybe wanting to be on more general healthcare projects. I got hired as a “payment intelligence consultant” I’d really just rather be more of a generalist. I don’t even know if this is possible.

1fqqw5e,Need to Vent + Could Use Some Advice: Please Be Gentle ,"I’ve been holding this in and really need to vent. 



especiallyIt all started with a meeting between our marketing department and the marketing teams of our sister companies. The parent company was trying to push their marketing channels onto us and our sister companies because their marketing manager can’t finish anything she starts. They did this without having any real conversations with our managers or considering what our bandwidth looked like. For context, we were just acquired this past year and are still legally run as independent companies. The parent company is trying to consolidate us all without really understanding how we operate. I know part of this is because their marketing manager isn’t getting her work done, so they wanted to push their responsibilities onto us without discussing it with the individual teams.

I was already feeling stressed, and during a follow-up meeting, I freaked out and ended up embarrassing myself in front of everyone, especially the women who were there. After that, I scheduled a follow-up meeting with my boss and that same guy from the sister company. My boss reassured me that everything went fine, saying that our company contributes a huge chunk of their revenue, so it’s not a big deal. I tried to stay positive, thanked him, and mentioned that we’d be inviting people from our sister companies to future trade shows. But then he hung up without saying goodbye, and that’s when my anxiety started spiraling. Now I’m overthinking everything, wondering if my boss is mad at me or if I’ve done something wrong.

For context, I was my boss’s first hire. Since I started, every single person who was involved in ‘marketing’ has either yelled at me for not doing things their way—whether it was about email marketing laws or something else—or acted like they felt threatened by my role and took it out on me. They constantly tell me how to do my work and insist that I’m doing it wrong. It’s exhausting.

Bill, our VP of Sales, has been especially difficult. Everyone knows he’s a bully, but because he’s good at his job, he gets a pass to yell at people. My boss even told me not to let it bug me. But every interaction with Bill triggers so much anxiety. He thrives on targeting and shaming people, and it’s not just me. The whole environment feels toxic, and I’m too terrified to speak up. I know that if I make even the slightest mistake, Bill will go after me.

When I was hired, my role was to handle marketing with an outside agency, but now my responsibilities have ballooned. I’m managing social media, trade shows, website creation, and still working closely with the agency. We’re even doubling our trade shows for 2025, and that responsibility is on me. But again—no clear expectations have been communicated about my role or what that looks like. For now, I handle all the logistics, while my boss hosts the meetings with everyone involved to ensure we’re on the same page. Why wouldn’t he just address this with me directly?

One major issue was social media. My boss kept bringing it up in team meetings with the CEO, Voltermordt, product managers, and others, but he never had a direct talk with me about it. I started wondering if he was trying to publicly shame me. It didn’t feel like constructive feedback, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was undermining me in front of everyone. Instead of addressing the issue one-on-one, he just kept bringing it up in front of the whole team, which only made me more anxious.

The agency gave us recommendations for social media, and I presented their feedback to my boss. Even after following through with their suggestions, it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough. This week, he finally mentioned that the social media issue was resolved, but instead of feeling relieved, I’m terrified. I feel like I haven’t fully taken over the trade shows the way I should have, but my boss never communicates clear expectations to me. I even do the research for those trade shows, but I don’t even have a company card for expenses. I can’t help but think that people like Bill are gunning for me, and I wonder if my boss might’ve said something in passing that’s making it worse.

What makes it even harder is that, as an adult, I know that if someone—especially my boss—has an issue with me, they should address it directly. But my boss doesn’t talk to me at all. During our weekly 30-minute 1:1s, I just present a list of items I need his opinion on. He told me when I was hired that he doesn’t want much to do with me, so I don’t bug him during the week because I know he’s busy. But still—why doesn’t he bring up any concerns? I don’t pick up on subtle cues, and it’s part of my trauma. If something isn’t said outright, I don’t realize it’s a problem. And now I’m stuck in this loop of uncertainty, not knowing what’s really going on or what’s being said about me.

What bothers me most is how much I care about what my boss thinks. He has the power to make my life and work so much harder, and I can’t shake the fear that he’s judging me or that I’ve somehow let him down. His laughing and hanging up without saying goodbye just fueled all of this anxiety, and now I feel more lost than ever.

**td/lr:**

1. **Lack of Communication:** My boss doesn’t communicate directly or clearly about expectations, concerns, or feedback, which leaves me feeling anxious and uncertain about my role and performance.
2. **Toxic Work Environment:** Everyone is toxic, especially = Voldermort, the VP of Sales, is known for bullying and public shaming. His aggressive behavior creates a toxic environment, leaving me afraid of making even the smallest mistakes.
3. **Overwhelming Responsibilities:** My responsibilities have ballooned beyond my original role since I was hired. I’m now managing multiple aspects of the business (social media, trade shows, etc.) without clear guidance or support.
4. **Undermining in Meetings:** My boss brings up issues, like the social media problem, in team meetings without discussing them with me first. This makes me feel like he’s trying to publicly shame or undermine me.
5. **Struggle with Expectations:** The company is expanding its trade show efforts for 2025, but there has been no clear communication on how this affects my role or what’s expected of me, leaving me to manage the logistics without proper tools or support (e.g., no company card).
6. **Emotional Impact of Trauma:** I struggle with picking up on subtle cues due to past trauma, so when my boss doesn’t address issues directly, it leaves me in a loop of anxiety and confusion.
7. **Fear of Judgment:** I deeply care about what my boss thinks and worry about how he perceives me. His distant communication and lack of proper closure (like hanging up without saying goodbye) amplify my anxiety.",Actual-Simple-9787,1,1.0,0,1727452124,2024-09-27 15:48:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqqw5e/need_to_vent_could_use_some_advice_please_be/,9,2024

1fqqh28,"Boss (CEO) made a mistake I should have caught, but didn't - seeking advice on how to approach this","So, some brief background - in July I was hired as the senior scientist at a medical device startup. The company is trying to utilize government funding to help support product development through SBIR grants. If you aren't familiar with those, they're grants from the government to help support small businesses who develop new products/technologies for things like healthcare. As part of the grant application, you submit what are called ""biosketches"", which are basically summaries of your work and experience that show you're knowledgeable and capable of doing the things you say you want to do in the grant application.

When I was hired, there was a grant application due roughly 2 months after my hire date. I had a couple meetings with my predecessor (who was consulting for the business still) and was told that the application was pretty much set to go, so I didn't look too closely at any of the documents that had already been generated (including biosketches) and instead focused my time and energy on the remaining documents for the grant application. I submitted the application on time and it all looked great.

I got an email today that the application was rejected because one of the biosketches (specifically my boss's) included hyperlinks to a bunch of youtube videos and news articles about the company/products in his biosketch. Including hyperlinks anywhere in the application automatically disqualifies the application from consideration. I had caught the inclusion of hyperlinks in documents that were produced after I joined the company and removed them, but I didn't even think to go back and look through things like biosketches. I should also note that the government agency which funds these grants (NIH) has instructions for completing biosketches, and the *very first* thing in the biosketch instructions says that hyperlinks are URLs are not allowed, but my boss included a bunch anyway.

As the person responsible for submitting the grant, I feel like I'm ultimately responsible for ensuring everything in the application meets instructions and requirements. On the flip side, writing a biosketch is, in the scientific world, considered a *very* basic thing to do and there are literal instructions on the page you get the biosketch template from saying ""Hyperlinks and URLs aren't allowed"", which I feel my boss (who also has a PhD) should have followed. 

I need to tell my boss that the application was rejected (which isn't the end of the world as we can resubmit in January) because he screwed up his biosketch and I didn't catch it, but I'm not sure how to have that conversation",OddPressure7593,2,0.6299999952316284,8,1727451057,2024-09-27 15:30:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqqh28/boss_ceo_made_a_mistake_i_should_have_caught_but/,9,2024

1fqq1kj,"Stuck at a job I hate, but I need the money.","I have worked at the same company for 15 years, the last 6 of them in Tech Support. I hate my job. Like, HATE it. I was sort of forced into the Tech Support job because they eliminated my other position and they considered it part of IT, so here I am.

The problem is, I make good money for someone who doesn't have a college degree ( I think so anyways) and I have a great boss. I feel completely stuck because I need the money and I'm afraid of going anywhere else because I need a boss that is flexible ( I have a toddler in daycare, so yeah). I also want to get out of IT/Tech Support because it's drained me and I'm over it. I've applied for jobs elsewhere that are not in IT but I'm afraid people see my experience and don't even consider me.

1fqpthy,Isolation at First Job,"Hi! I just started my new corporate job two months ago right out of college and was super excited to meet new people and work on a team that had a really fun and young dynamic. I was hired on with three other new grad girls (I am also female) who I think are all very capable and interesting people. 

Unfortunately, one of them didn’t treat me very kindly from the beginning, dismissing everything I said, ignoring me in conversations, and making me feel dumb any time I tried to ask a question. I’m not sure where this dislike for me came from, but now it has spread to the whole group of girls. After a month of grabbing lunch every day, they’ve created a new group chat that I’m not in, and they no longer include me in lunch. When I’ve tried to initiate, ignored my messages and apologized after they’ve gotten lunch without me. I still say good morning and good night every evening, as I sit by two of them, but I have trouble integrating myself into other conversations. 

I know this may seem trivial, and I feel very grateful to have a job, but this kind of treatment is making me feel incredibly isolated and self conscious. I’m a very social person and am not usually disliked by people I meet, so this has really shaken my confidence. The team I was hired on is very social in their “classes” of new grads that were hired together, so I feel by being left out of this one, I’m having trouble making other connections on the team when that aspect of this job is so important. 

I wouldn’t usually bother trying to make friends with people who have no interest and are unkind to me, but with the team so socially based in these small groups I’m not sure what to do to integrate myself to the culture. And, as it’s a new job and I’m not very busy, I haven’t been able to put my head down and get through my work so there hasn’t been much else to preoccupy me. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Does anyone have any advice for approaching this social situation office wide? This isolation is affecting my mental health at work in my confidence in the office at my first job, so any tips anyone can share would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

1fqo0tu,Manager is reactionary and making me nervous,"I work at a great company, and provide support for employees. My manager is a pretty cool guy for the most part. We can chat, he gossips a bit too much, but not in a way that makes me uncomfortable, and he can say things a bit out of pocket but coming from a rougher environment it doesn’t bother me much. I still mind how I respond and how I speak. 

What gets me is when I come to him with any issues with our users he is incredibly reactionary, doesn’t listen, and will escalate the problem so much that it makes me want to hide most issues from him. Someone asking me if they can expense a charger and me telling them no (the exact answer I was trained to give, and the correct answer), the user saying okay that’s fine, no worries, suddenly becomes a sit down meeting with their manager and explaining policy and him making me seem like the catalyst for why we’re discussing it. Somehow I’m leading a meeting about something that didn’t bother me enough to have a meeting about it. It makes me really uncomfortable and makes me want to just make calls myself and not reach out to him. A few times I did avoid telling him about situations because I thought this may have been a way of him trying to tell me not to mention things if they aren’t a big deal. He was really angry about it even though it was once again, very small fires that I handled and were taken care of. Should I just continue to only mention things if I deem them important enough to be escalated? I appreciate that he wants to standup for myself and others on the team, but it’s so reactionary and most of the time unnecessary and creates weird friction between our team and everyone else’s. Leaving is NOT an option at the moment, I make good money, benefits are great, and I like everyone enough. Just this situation is uncomfortable.

1fqmz5b,**Seeking Career Advice: Should I Stay in Manufacturing or Transition to Tech?**,"Hi everyone! I could really use some career advice as I’m at a crossroads. For context, I’m highly **introverted**, **detail-oriented**, and extremely **organized**. I take pride in being **accurate** and efficient in my work, and I value structure and process-driven environments. 

Here's a brief overview of my work history:  
- **Current Role**: I’m working as a Customer Operations Coordinator, where I manage order lifecycles, streamline processes, and have implemented systems that have improved team efficiency significantly.  
- **Previous Experience**: I’ve held positions as a Client Support Specialist and Customer Service Representative, handling complex orders, improving client satisfaction, and developing training materials.

I'm now considering my next steps and would love some advice. My experience has primarily been in **manufacturing** and customer service and supply chain, but I’m wondering if I should switch to the **tech industry**, and if so, what role to aim for. I have a **vague interest** in roles such as **Project Management**, **Product Management**, **Customer Success**, or even **Procurement & Contracts**, but I’m unsure which would suit me best or how my skills might transfer.

TLDR: Should I stick to manufacturing and operational roles, or would a move to tech be a better long-term fit for someone with my skill set and personality? If a transition to tech makes sense, what types of roles would be a good match for my strengths (accuracy, detail-orientation, process optimization)? Also, would any certifications help me make this switch?

1fqmq3o,Not qualified for the job I am currently in,"I (26m) finished uni completing mechanical engineering in 2020 and hated it. I had plans to travel for a year before COVID hit, I then went on to do a masters in materials science more so because I had pressure from family to do something during lockdown instead of figuring out what career I actually want. This then led me to start a research job for a year that I was not qualified in and I left it for a more entry level role in a different industry (still engineering but a niche). After 6 months I got promoted to a different role but I am now in the company a year and feel very under qualified for the position I am in. I am having to train on software I don't understand and have no prior knowledge in the industry,, which has led me to stagnate in the training due to a lack of confidence. I don't feel like I am getting enough work completed for the job I am in and to justify being there. I know this is a common feeling around the office as it is a small team and the walls are thin, so I have heard people talk about me negatively. I know I should have sucked it up early and said I was having trouble earlier on but I think it is at a point now where this is not possible. I have failed in my role and I am debating just handing in my notice and doing the following. 

Get work in a company which give me more well rounded engineering experience (developing core skills more) and try to get in as a junior/graduate position. My only concern here is that because I have 2 years experience in engineering that I would not be looked at for this.

Retrain or try and intern in environmental engineering role, as this is more what I would want to work in and is as close to something I can see doing long term while still 'using' my degree.

I have a job outside of my 9-5 which is zero hours but it could hold me over for a while if I am looking for other work.

I am just a bit lost and am fed up of being a failure in my career. Any advice on how to navigate this would be greatly appreciated. I'm generally a quiet person so haven't spoke about this to anyone really.

1fqjluk,Question for people working remotely to the US and not wanting to be paid less for living in Canada. Any advice?,"I'm a US/CAD dual citizen and will soon be working as an employee for two US companies remotely. However, I will be living IN canada. For those doing this, how can I approach this for it to be as EASY as possible for my companies to pay me while also not withholding my Canadian taxes?

The main issue I have with doing it through a Canadian subsidiary is that they pay Canadian salary rather than US salary, which is MUCH less. On the other hand, they're also more likely to withhold US taxes without a Canadian subsidiary I'm assuming.

I want to make it as easy as possible for them not to withhold my taxes so I can pay the CRA but I also don't want to them to skimp me on salary. So I'm in a dilemma.

With that being the case, what are my best options? **Can I open up a sole proprietorship and work as a contractor in Canada and have them pay me my full taxes in USD to my US bank account but still not withhold my taxes so I can pay the CRA? How open are bigger or smaller companies to doing this usually? Has anyone successfully done this?**

As a heads up, I already know I have to file to the US and Canada as a US-CAD dual citizen. I file both taxes yearly and do the FBAR and all that fun stuff. I'm mainly stuck on how to approach this because I have the advantage of being a US citizen and being able to get a US salary but the tax withholding is going to hurt and will cause A LOT of issues with the CRA from what I've researched. I've heard people getting audited annually, and delays in getting refunds late from the IRS. That's also a full year of investing salary lost (I'd be taxed 50%).

1fqjbpg,Resign or HR hearing without payout. Is this ethical? ,"Hey everyone, so I started a new job 2 months ago and its been going great. Ive had to take on the responsibilities of the previous graphic designer and have been meeting all my deadlines. Ofcourse there was a learning curve but until two weeks ago they made me part of the marketing meetings again and a collaborating cosmetics company even asked that I sit into their meetings. I thought I was doing well and that they loved my ideas.

However, my department manager and I have not been getting along at all and I have had a few signs that she's trying to sabotage me, but today it was confirmed. They're letting me go because apparently shes reported me as not being sufficient in the skills on my CV (fucking lies) abd because apparently I dont follow orders sufficiently. This is such BS, ive been giving 200%.

So because it apparently isn't working out, they are giving me a choice of either resigning with two weeks payout or I can defend myself on Monday with an HR hearing (and not receive the two weeks payout) ... Is this ethical? The atmosphere at work has changed drastically all because of this b###. She wants to go into accounting, I wasn't even threatening her position!

1fqiosg,Career with a degree in Computing & IT and Mathematics ,"Hi,
I am a 27 year old, currently working as a Health Care Assistant. I have a bachelor's degree in Commerce, had to drop out from MBA(International Business course and choose this job due to circumstances. I would be doing this job for another 3 years, and would like to work towards another career path meantime. I have no interest in pursuing the MBA.
I used to be quite passionate about Mathematics.
Math and computer science were the subjects I used to enjoy most and was good at during high school, and when checked the open university, I came across this course (Bsc in IT & Computing and Mathematics), and though it would be a good fit, but I am not sure.
Am I doing the right thing ? 

What are my career choices if I move on with this course?

long story short, i ended up in tears and told him the way he was speaking to me made me uncomfortable. i decided to quit right there and then because i do not want to work for that kind of boss or in a toxic environment where that is okay. i didn’t tell him i’m quitting yet but wrote my resignation letter.

i get paid biweekly but haven’t received my first paycheck yet. i don’t know what day i will receive my paycheck and haven’t even finished onboarding fully. it will be my 10th day on friday.

i want to quit asap so i don’t have to continue their training and waste any of our time. i don’t mind not getting paid for the 10th day if i quit that morning. i don’t want him to fire me first either after that convo. i’m in california which is an at will state.

should i quit early in the morning or go through their training for the day and quit at 5pm? would i still be paid for my first 9 days of i do? is there anything i should do to prepare for quitting? thank you all!",dawntingthoughts,19,0.7300000190734863,70,1727423041,2024-09-27 07:44:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqiext/do_i_quit_in_the_morning_or_at_the_end_of_the_day/,9,2024
1fqhhzk,My Friend’s Family and Financial Crisis—What Can He Do?,"I'm seeking advice for a close friend who is going through an extremely tough time. His family’s financial situation has collapsed after his father's business partner cheated them, leaving the family without much money. To make things worse, his father has fallen seriously ill, and they’re struggling to cover the medical expenses.

My friend has just completed the first year of his MS in Sweden, but now he feels forced to discontinue his studies due to financial pressure and the need to support his family. He’s considering finding a job as soon as possible to help out. On top of this, he’s in a relationship with someone he deeply cares about, who is currently studying her MS in the U.S. She’s trying to support him emotionally, but her family is pressuring her to get married, and they want him to secure a job first.

Given these overwhelming circumstances, what are his options? Is there a way for him to pause his studies, get a job, and still support his family? Can he balance this with his relationship and the pressure they are both facing?

Any advice on how to navigate this complex situation—be it regarding job opportunities, financial support, or relationship management—would be greatly appreciated.

1fqhfx3,Listening to my replacements interview,"I’ve been working in a small office for a few years. Over the course of the last year, the relationship between myself and “Principal 1” has soured. My relationship with equal-level employees and interns is fantastic and always has been.

Last week had been miserable. Principal 1 and I have no reason to speak outside the rare project overlap. He’s crass and loud, I’m quiet and reseved. He told me i had no room left to grow my salary/benefits but expected more hours and wider scope/role in my responsibilities. He hosts meetings on his speakers behind my desk while I work against deadlines. I mention a problem with our software/hardware/peoject, he tells me it’s normal. His directions or questions are always broken sentences and abrasive. So, I reached out to Principal 2 last week for lunch.  While there, I end up unloading my stress on his plate regarding the toxic environment that Principal 1 and I are in.  Principal 2 was not receptive and I can’t fault him. He’s spread thin, and this is one more non-billable issue.  

Flash forward to today. I was supposed to be working out of the office this afternoon but ended up staying until the end of the day. At 4:00, Principal 2 asked if I was leaving. I said no, and asked what’s up? He mumbled and went back to work. At 5:00, the principals and a few others (which was everyone at the office except me) huddled around the conference table to interview a potential employee (news to me). She sounded like a great candidate with some good experience. She’d be moving across the country for this job. I’m excited for her, nervous she’s getting into something she may regret, but its none of that is really my business. Because, see above. I’m somewhat relieved at the thought of exiting the stressful situation, bummed I work in at-will state where I won’t be paid out for my accrued PTO. They haven’t cut me off yet and I work remote fridays. Do I go through the motions until they sever ties? Call in sick tomorrow and take my last day off?

1fqgehb,Laid off and not having the spirit to restart the job hunt. Seeking advice and support especially from been there done that folks.,"So long story short, I was laid off in restructuring or so I was told. Have spent 2.5 years at this agency. Point is I had great performance reviews and was given ESOP's also last year with a year of vesting. Hence I feel completely blindsided. It took me a month after internal dialogues to accept they are not going to give me new accounts, despite stating performance is not an issue!!. 

This is my second career stint, I have a gap of almost a decade for raising my family, changed industry and overall have clocked 10 years in this domain. I would say I'm at ""expert"" level. I have always looked out for and grabbed growth opportunities internal and external in the past and grown to a senior leadership position. I was really enjoying this role and had no intention to look out and was happy to ""vest"" in the company. The role was demanding and it drained me out last year and there was little to no work life balance. But still I was committed. 

So this lay off hurts a lot. I feel completely wiped out of any desire to search for another job.

Please give me suggestions to ride this phase. How can I recharge and get my mojo back?",ImNotABot26,4,1.0,1,1727414158,2024-09-27 05:15:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqgehb/laid_off_and_not_having_the_spirit_to_restart_the/,9,2024
1fqg64b,Which offer to choose? ,"I am in my second year of college to be a construction superintendent, but I need some advice on a offer I recently got. Last summer I worked for a company that I really enjoyed and would go back to in a heartbeat and I would like to go back to that company this next summer. The only issue is a much bigger company offered me a summer internship for this next summer for $4/hr more than the company I previously was with. I don't know the best way to go about this.

Do I just trade the culture for the money?

Do I try to get the company I would rather work for to match what the big company is paying? My only draw back to this is I don't really want to use that playing card right now. I would rather use that card when I graduate and the difference could be $4K-$5K a year. I don't want to be that guy that is asking too much too often.

Or do I just cut my loss of about $1K over the summer and work for the smaller company and not ask for more than the raise that they are already giving me to come back?

1fqfxfd,Switching from engineering to pharmacy,"Not sure if this is the right sub for this though I suppose it is somewhat related, so I apologise if the prior is true.

I'm (22M) currently a third-year mechanical engineering student. Since the start of my second year, I found myself struggling academically. I've failed multiple units (but retook them and fortunately passed). I honestly do feel that this major, if not the entire engineering degree, is not right for me and I can't help but feel I might have wasted my time. I chose engineering because I was avidly interested in working for a car manufacturer, though I can now safely conclude that I am not suited for this and have lost my initial passion for cars. It has really taken a toll on my mental capacity.

In terms of work experience, I have interned at an aftermarket services product company last year as part of my engineering course, and the job was alright though nothing spectacular. I did multiple CAD drawings and modelling of the company's products, such as spark plugs and coils, on top of regular office tasks.

I'm now considering to switch to a pharmacy course because, aside from physics, I really enjoyed and excelled more in biological sciences in my pre-university. I know it will also be difficult in its own way, but I know for sure that anything relating to physics is now not my cup of tea. If it helps, I additionally realised I'm more of a person with good interpersonal skills.

I'm just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience as I have since I'm really stuck, especially with finals coming up soon.

1fqfbhc,"Burnt out and can't find a new job, don't know where to go from here.","I've been working at my current company for six years. It's an advertising agency but to be honest I'd call them more of a content mill. Over the past few years I've been growing increasingly burnt out to the point my therapist and I are concerned I'm approaching a looming mental health crisis. At work I experience mental breakdowns at the drop of a hat, it's almost impossible for me to have a conversation with my boss. As long as nobody bothers me I can complete tasks but as soon as a coworker is rude or my boss micromanages me or there's a technical issue that prevents me from working properly I just panic, often for a period of hours. I rely heavily on weed to distract me after work but in the morning I regret opening my eyes. I've isolated myself from friends because I just don't have the energy to maintain relationships anymore. I experience suicidal ideation daily.

I've known I've needed to leave my job for a long time but my field just isn't viable anymore. I was an English major that went to become a copywriter and then my company moved me around to a bunch of SEO adjacent roles instead of actually promoting me. Now it's impossible to find writing work and I have no management experience to speak of.

I can tell my company us falling apart because they don't promote people anymore. Well, they do, but the only people getting promotions are the ones going from director to VP. There's no hope I could carve out a management path for myself anymore. Not to mention my boss is becoming increasingly aware that I'm burnt out. Just today she had me provide an itemized list of how I use my company communication time down to the minute. She's suspicious that I'm ""stealing time"" in a salaried role that I meet my quotas for but really I'm just starring into space for long periods of time because I can't focus on this job anymore.

I cannot stress enough that mentally I feel cooked. I can't pay attention to anything anymore, my brain us just blank when I try to do anything creative, I'm genuinely worried I have brain damage. I'm not sure if telling my boss about my burnout will get me help or just get me sent out onto the street but any help they might give me I'm sure it won't be enough. This job is basically just a panic trigger for me at this point and I'm starting to worry I might need in-patient care. I'm really worried when I'll be able to work normally again.

But I can't just choose not to work, I need to make money, so I need to take what I have a find a new job before my boss fires me. I have a useless degree with a professional portfolio made up entirely of SEO slop and for what little writing work there is out there I'm not getting any replies. At this point I don't know if I should go back to retail. I just don't want to give up for the sake of my family.

I'm working with a career counselor to help me through everything and the best solution I can see is just a complete career change. I have some ideas of what to do like teaching but I'm paralyzed in actually making a decision because I don't want to make the same mistake again of getting a bad degree. I just don't know what industries are thriving and where my interests lie within them. On top of it I just don't know how I'll manage my current job with grad school considering my mental health.

My wife has suggested I go into freelancing and I'm doing a gig I got from a friend who referred me to their company but I'm concerned for the viability of this path. If I could do it full time I'd love it but I know AI has decimated the job offers available.

I’m a 25-year-old woman with a BS in Medical Laboratory Sciences. I worked as a research assistant for a year post-graduation and have two publications under my belt. However, I had to pivot to work as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) for nearly three years. While I was good at it and the pay was solid, I never truly loved the role.

Now that I've moved to the U.S., I want to return to medical lab science, but I’m finding it challenging to land a job. The work environment here is vastly different from what I experienced back home, and it’s causing me to lose my passion for the field. I’ve applied to several med lab positions, had multiple interviews, and even received one job offer, but I can’t shake the feeling that I might be better off going back to RBT work, even though the pay isn’t as good.

I'm torn between the potential for growth in medical lab science and the comfort I found in RBT. I worry that if I return to RBT, I might get stuck there again, without the same sense of fulfillment. 

Has anyone faced a similar situation? How did you manage the transition? Should I stick it out in medical lab science despite my doubts, or should I pursue what feels more comfortable?

1fqe8e5,Is it better to tell a micromanager to kick rocks or just grin and bear it? ,"My boss is self-admittedly bossy and does not delegate well, however because of recent org changes she’s turned into a monster. Within the past week: 

- She’s hounding me after not responding to an email within 4 minutes or not replying to a chat within 7 minutes
- She’s asking me about my illness symptoms when I was out sick for two days, I assume to see if I was lying
- She’s reprimanding me for not sending her OTHER department’s deliverables for her to review. I would understand if she wanted to review what I was working on, but she wants to review what unrelated departments are working on also and have me give them her feedback, which is not within the scope of my or her role.  
- Wants me to CC her on every conversation I have with business partners and send her evidence of chats I’m having with business partners because if I tell her they said something, she doesn’t believe it until she sees it with her own eyes. 
- Doesn’t respect the way other business groups operate and wants me to have them change their ways to the way she feels is most appropriate. For example asking our dev partners to reorganize their sprint cycles to match with what she thinks is the most efficient way to do things, even though she has 0 technical experience.

I have a senior level role and should have the autonomy to make decisions myself. It feels ridiculous to say to her “this person said they don’t know the answer to my question, what should I do next?” instead of trying to just figure the answer out myself. Yet this is exactly what she expects me to do and got upset with me when I tried to find the answer myself. 

I’m stressed every day coming into the office because I know as soon as I log in there will be a series of chats or emails waiting for me giving me feedback on things she’s not happy with. And I should note that in the two years I’ve been reporting to her, she’s never given me any kind of verbal warnings about my job performance or any negative performance reviews. This has all started within the past month because she got a new boss. And I have asked my colleagues if she’s been “leaning in” more with their work to see if it’s just me suddenly becoming a shitty employee, and they agree there’s been a shift. 

Within the past week I’ve told her I’m looking to further develop my career and have posted to another role, which she can see I’ve done. Ideally I’ll get the job and never have to deal with her again, but it could be months until I transition and there’s no guarantee I’ll even get an interview. I’m trying to decide whether it’s better to ask her what’s up and let her know I’m frustrated, or just put on a happy face and send her literal photos of me in the bathroom so she knows exactly how I’m spending my time minute by minute.

1fqd4s7,Need advice for a chronic college student (26M),"I apologize in advance if this post is long. 

Background: I’ve been a college student since 2018 on and off. Been to multiple universities changed my major multiple times and have over 120 credits with nothing show except an A.S. in Aviation Science and no licenses. I was in the National Guard for eight years (three of this full-time) and military isn’t an option anymore due to mental health issues. 

The Problem: I don’t know what to do with myself at this point. If found a decent job that paid livable wages I’d drop out of school. I’ve using my G.I. Bill to pay for school (which I still pay a lot out of pocket). I was in a flight program at one university and dropped out after I failed to finish my private pilots license in 4 months and would have had to retake the whole class the following semester. Made it to 42 flight hours and soloing before I left. I know I’m not unteachable but it feels like without a degree I’ll be stuck in retail for the rest of my life. But I’m also sick college and sick of living paycheck to paycheck. 

College: I don’t learn well in an online environment and I hate online classes. I stayed at my previous university out of state and tried to do an online program. I transferred to a local university (satellite campus) to have more networking and in-person classes. I got stuck in online classes and the in-person classes are just video calls of the main campus classes. 

The Here and Now: I know not staying in a program or university is what got me here and I know it’s my own fault. I’m just sick of the low wage, college lifestyle and being a chronic student. I have nothing to show for the last few years of my life except a pile useless college credits (can’t really do anything with a bunch of aviation credits and no licenses, not to mention the hodgepodge of other credits). I’m a geography major with an emphasis on GIS and a compsci minor. I’ve felt nothing but stressed out because I don’t feel like I’m actually learning anything; just following instructions and getting low grades from not understanding. I have resorted to the Youtube and a free programming course to try to understand and my gpa is still sinking like a rock. Professor send generic “it’s in the textbook” and “study more” answers to my questions. I’m usually an A and B type of student. 

The Dream: My dream job is a desk job (I know) and I did well at in the army. I’ve looked into trades but that most likely means transferring to a trade school or community college and continuing the cycle. It seems like anything that pays remotely well ($40k/year is my goal) requires a degree. Any and all advice will be appreciated. 

Side Note: I feel like I’m turning into a stressed out, depressed, angry person. I know this not good but I started drinking most nights because it’s the only way can chill out and forget about everything. I’ve been trying improve myself and done a lot over the past year (quit all nicotine, getting the gym, leaving a toxic relationship, etc) but it all feels useless with my new hobby and the rest of my life going up in flames. I just feel worn out and I’m tired. 

Apologies for the long, depressing post. Thanks in advance for any advice. ",NumberOk8712,1,1.0,0,1727402742,2024-09-27 02:05:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqd4s7/need_advice_for_a_chronic_college_student_26m/,9,2024
1fqcz4t,Questions about work history and references before being a parent for 7 years,"Hello! I have a degree (BA) and worked for 7 years in another country before coming back to the US and being a stay at home parent. I’m now ready to re-enter the workforce but I want to switch careers. (Currently I’m getting another degree.) Since I haven’t worked for 7 years already, I am planning to get an entry level job (possibly a part-time one so I can study part-time), how worried should I be about the employment verification process?

My current problem is the jobs I used to have are not really related to the field I want to enter. Should I even bother putting all of them on my resume? And because I worked in another country before, is the employment check going to be more difficult? Do I need to contact my previous employers/bosses regarding this check/being my references? I don’t contact anybody from my home country since I came here and I doubt if they still remember me. And as far as I know, two companies closed their businesses already, but if I try hard enough, I’m sure I can contact the employers on LinkedIn.

1fqc4k7,Accept higher paying job offer or remain at current position?," 

At my current place the work life balance and stress is pretty low. I get paid 100k and I'm comfortable with low stress. I got a new job offer for 130k but I would be the only person in this company overseeing their website. It's is a late stage start up and they're pretty established so I don't think it will be as chaotic as a new startup.  

Pros of current employer:
- I like all my coworkers 
- low stress 
- decent pay
- team mates that I can ask questions about stuff if I get stuck
- ability to work abroad for a few months. I like to do this in the winters to get some sunshine and beach time

Cons of current employer: 
- none really, maybe pay? But like I said I'm comfortable atm more money would always be better


Pros of new company:
- more money
- expand my skillset/responsibility

Cons of new company:
- seems more stressful but I'm not 100% sure. Glassdoor reviews are good and have won awards for best workplaces
- if I mess something up I don't have a coworker to help or ask questions on how to fix
- not able to work abroad 
- 401k but no match

1fqbki2," After 5 years at my company, I got a surprise 15% raise and a new title. But instead of a celebration or even a “congrats,” my boss just handed me the paperwork like it was no big deal. No one knows, no recognition—just “sign here” and back to work. Grateful, but feeling pretty invisible!","I got a raise. A solid 10 percent, which honestly took me by surprise. I've been at the company for five years now, and I can say with confidence that I love what I do. The projects excite me, my colleagues are incredible, and the workplace culture has always been a huge plus. It’s the kind of place that makes Mondays not feel like Mondays, if you know what I mean.

I didn’t go into this quarter expecting anything special. I worked hard, hit all my goals, and stayed focused like I always do. But still, I wasn’t expecting a raise. So, when my boss called me in, I thought it might just be another routine check-in. Instead, I found out I was getting a 1010 percent bump in pay. After five years of dedication, it felt like a big moment—like all my efforts were finally being recognized.

But then...nothing. No announcement, no team celebration, not even a casual “congratulations” in passing. My boss barely looked up from their desk, sliding the paperwork over like it was just another task. “Can you sign this?” was all I got. No enthusiasm, no acknowledgment of the work I’d put in—just a form to sign and a subtle “move along” vibe.

It felt strange. I mean, five years in, and here I was with a raise and a title boost, yet I walked out of that office feeling...weirdly invisible. I should be on cloud nine, but without anyone even knowing about it, it feels a little hollow. Like, shouldn’t there be some kind of recognition? A moment to celebrate five years of hard work and this milestone? Instead, I got a signature on a piece of paper and a quick exit.

I’m grateful for the raise, don’t get me wrong, but I can’t help but wonder—isn't a promotion supposed to feel more...exciting, especially after five years?",Appointment_Glass,538,0.75,475,1727397782,2024-09-27 00:43:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fqbki2/after_5_years_at_my_company_i_got_a_surprise_15/,9,2024

1fqbcy6,Should I quit? Dreading return after maternity leave,"Looking for any advice. I’m in a sticky situation here. I’ve been on maternity leave for a few months now and have been going back and forth on whether I want to return to my job or not. 

I got pregnant pretty soon after being hired and had to leave because it was a high risk situation; I was still in my training period and not fully established. My training period was tense as the person teaching me didn’t really seem like they wanted to be doing it and I wasn’t learning quickly as a result. They left out many important details of the job and I had to learn from other people (even aspects that they implemented or created). They constantly left me alone without instruction in an environment where that shouldn’t happen (healthcare). 

I spoke with my supervisor and they are aware, but nobody else is qualified to train me. My supervisor is concerned I’m lacking initiative because I was having a hard time adjusting to this mismatched teaching and learning style. They want to see improvements but I don’t even know how to do that if I’m not being taught properly.

This all happened before I left for maternity leave. I only worked about 3 months before I left, and have been out for the same amount of time. I’m incredibly anxious about returning to this environment next week but I have no other options.

I’m only hesitating because I have bills and a lot of debt; I have high monthly payments for things every month and I can’t miss even a week of work. Especially just having had my baby girl, I can’t risk being out of work. My husband doesn’t make enough to support the three of us for a long stretch of time without me working. I had an interview two days ago but haven’t heard back yet, so there’s no hopes of me having another job by Monday.

1fqaeuo,"Life’s a Mess: ₹100K in Debt, No Degree, Batch Graduated Without Me – SOS for Advice! ","Hi everyone,

I’m really in need of some advice and guidance right now. My situation has become incredibly stressful, and I’m not sure what to do next. Here’s what happened:

I started college with a lot of enthusiasm, but after my first year, things started falling apart. Due to personal and financial issues, I stopped going to classes altogether. I figured I could catch up later, but it spiraled out of control, and I ended up getting detained in the 6th semester. Now, my batch has already graduated, and I’m stuck with ₹100,000 in unpaid fees, no degree, and no clear path forward.

Here’s where it gets even more complicated:

I never informed my family about any of this. They think everything is going fine, and I’ve been too scared and ashamed to tell them the truth.

On my resume, I listed my second-year CGPA and stated that I’m graduating in 2024. I felt like I had no choice but to put something there, even though it’s not accurate. Now, I’m worried about how this might affect my chances of getting hired.

I’m really struggling with these questions:

Is there any way I can still continue my degree? It’s been almost a year since my batch graduated. I’m not sure if my college will even allow me to re-enroll, or what steps I need to take to make that happen.

How should I approach finding a job in this situation? I’m eager to start working, but I’m terrified of being found out or not getting hired at all because of my current situation.

What can I do to improve my resume and chances of getting hired quickly? I’ll attach my resume in the post, and I would be so grateful if you could give me some tips or advice on how to present myself better.

Request for Help:

To everyone reading this, I’m really desperate for advice. If you’ve been in a similar situation or know someone who has, please share your experiences or suggestions. Any guidance on how to handle this with my family, my college, or potential employers would mean the world to me.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story and for any advice you can offer. I truly appreciate it.

I still have to pass the polygraph test, but as long as that goes well I’m pretty certain the job is mine. 

I’m wondering if this position is worth my time and if anyone could tell me how rough this might be. I’m interested in law and have just finished a class for paralegals, so this position is kind of in the same vein but not exactly that.

1fq9jr3,Turns out insurance wasn’t taken out of my paychecks for a year- now they say I owe them. ,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post!

I signed up for health and vision insurance last August. I’ve used the insurance several times over the last year as it’s the first time I’ve had insurance since I was like 18 (I’m 34 now.) 
I don’t often look at the details of my payslips since the total always looked pretty accurate. Yes, this was stupid of me.  I looked at my last paycheck more in depth on a whim and noticed I was getting charge for dental. I brought this to my supervisors attention and after she looked into it I got a call and she said “so it turns out we made a mistake on our end, the first paycheck after you signed up for insurance was correct in taking out Health and vision insurance. After that something happened and we started charging you for ONLY dental. So we need you to pay it back, we can do it in smaller payments to help.”
I did the rough math and total it should be a little above $3,000 that I owe. 
Best case scenario, I pay double for insurance over the next year to pay them back but unfortunately it won’t work for me because I can’t afford that. So I will have to cancel my insurance just to pay them back. Many people have told me that I shouldn’t have to pay them  since it was their error. But I’m aware life doesn’t work like that. 
Does anyone have any advice or am I just out of luck? 
If it helps- I’m an hourly + commission worker. I’m full time. And I live in Chicago. I have used my insurance with no problems.

Due to my low self esteem I even never could physically go to give interview rejecting myself then and there. Before even giving a chance to myself to get selected or rejected

I want a proper job and career how.

1fq8gg0,Choosing between two accounting jobs,"Will edit as I review the offers, benefits, & specifics 

Job one

Hospital/medical facility - Senior Accountant role (General accounting, month end & grants), remote save for department wide trainings & company wide meetings that aren't remote (I was told 1-2x a quarter). I live far enough away where it would be impractical to call me into the office on the reg. Much more structured of the two positions. The team is nice & I can see myself working for them. Manager didn't have experience with grants which is why they were looking for someone with my background. However, the manager I interviewed with just put in her notice, not sure why.  Someone internal to the company will take over the team, also who doesn't have a ton of grants experience. Company uses workday, which I had wanted to learn. Has a better retirement account match. Does however have a catchall for PTO (Sick, vacation, personal) that doesn't include holidays. I would have to use PTO for Christmas, NYE, thanksgiving etc

  
Job two

Small University - Staff accountant role, 3 person team including the position I'd be filling. Not very structured, job description has a lot of month end, general accounting, invoicing, but the opportunity to learn new things emphasized. Would be able to wear multiple hats, I know that will sounds like a red flag in most cases, but didn't seem horrible in context and I'm in a position now where I'm bored and wish I had more work. The CFO just retired, staying on until the end of year, and the manager is taking on his duties. The manager is young, possibly under 30, has been the company for 3 years and promoted twice. This is the only job on his LinkedIn. Old software and custom software used to bridge other systems and accounting software. Open to new system. Job posting I got said two days in office, but manager said everyone comes in a they feel like it, only a few people in office any given day. The position I'm in currently has a disconnect like that as well, management wants multiple days in office, but I only go in one day and other departments don't come in at all. Would sound like a red flag in some cases, but since there was no in the office while I interviewed I believed him when he said that. It is close enough to me to where I could go in if they enforced a hybrid policy. Manager seems like a good guy to work for, didn't meet the other person in the department. 

  
Both positions are client facing (internal & external). The hospital pays 5k more than the university

1fq7h2w,How do I convince my boss that our team doesn’t need a manager?,"I’ve worked for this company for over 10 years. During that time I’ve had a lot of Group Managers come and go, but I stuck around because I like the company and the work I do. Generally my bosses we always located in other cities anyway so I have almost always been independent. 

During COVID, we had a lot of people on my team get laid off or voluntarily leave. By 2021, we were down to two people left on the team. The company went through a restructuring and they decided our group didn’t need a group manager because there were only 2 of us. Instead, we started reporting directly to one of the Vice Presidents. 

The other employee on the team and I loved this dynamic. It gave us a lot of freedom to do things the way we wanted, and nobody bothered us (including the Vice President we report to) because we always got the job done. We’re both hard workers and never had any problems with anyone.

Lately our team has had a crazy influx in workload, resulting in us making two new hires in the past year. The Vice President is now feeling overwhelmed and now wants us to have the “in between” Group Manager that we’re supposed to have.

Interestingly I found out last week that new employee #1 also enjoys the independent dynamic of the group and doesn’t want a Group Manager either. It was new employee #2 who complained that they want a direct supervisor because they feel they aren’t getting enough attention from the Vice President. Granted, the Vice President does have a ton of other responsibilities and can’t dedicate enough time to us as a Group Manager would.

So that makes 3 out of 4 of us who don’t want a Group Manager hired. The two seasoned employees (me and the other remaining worker pre-COVID) don’t want to take the role because it will come with a slew of new responsibilities that neither of us want or have time for.

But because new employee #2 complained, and the Vice President can’t handle this guy’s incessant need for help, our company is going to look for a Group Manager for us in the next couple months. What really sucks about this whole thing is that new employee #2 has plenty of experience for his role (even more than me) and has been offered help. He’s just completely unable to work independently and apparently needs to be babysat and have constant contact with a supervisor for whatever reason. I don’t understand what kind of person would enjoy that sort of thing but that is not the point of this post.

I’m horrified of bringing a Group Manager from outside the company into our group because inevitably it’s going to change the whole dynamic of our team. I’m going to have to report to someone after 10 years of managing myself, essentially. So how do I convince the Vice President that we don’t need a Group Manager?",moody-manatee,2,0.6299999952316284,30,1727386048,2024-09-26 21:27:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fq7h2w/how_do_i_convince_my_boss_that_our_team_doesnt/,9,2024

1fq7bgp,I've been attending College since I was 15yrs old. Should I quit?,"I started attending community college right before I turned 16yrs old. I wanted to get all my GenEd's requirement out of the way along with all the classes I wasn't interested in or excited for. I then transferred to another college, of moderately high standing but great cost. However, after the extensive application process I was told that while they the college is part of a ""Articulation Initiative statewide transfer agreement,"" they'll ""accept"" my transfer credits, however, I have to retake all the classes in order to graduate along with my major's class requirements.

All in all, I'm not learning anything new. Not even at my former college. All the classes are either repeats of what I learned in middle school or high school or have nothing to do with the class topic. It's all about writing whatever the teacher feels like talking about, keeping up with the rapidly changing syllabuses and hoping the teacher bother to show up. I know this is just how college is. I've been told that it isn't about learning but about following instructions in order to receive a paper of completion. But, learning is more important to me that a degree.

My question is this. I have an opportunity to study my field under a group of Harvard and Cambridge professors in a special program, however, the classes aren't currently accredited (though they will be). So do I keep attending this college, without actually learning about my field in order to get a BA, or do I join this program and actually become proficient in my work?

I feel like ""I studied 'blah blah blah' under these professors from Cambridge and Harvard"" would look good on a resume however, I don't know if employers actually care about hiring someone proficient in their work or if they care about a BA degree more.

1fq79y3,Feeling lost as a creative in a government software job,"So I'm feeling a bit lost right now. I've been working in software development since the beginning of 2020. In 2022 I landed a really solid software engineer job at a great company that mostly deploys its workers out to various government software contracts. 

Toward the beginning of this year, I started a new contract with the same company. A new contract means a new team and a new manager. I started out feeling extremely exhausted by how much this new manager micro-manages. Normally I expect a daily stand-up meeting to take 10-15 minutes max. Our stand-ups regularly go over 30-45 minutes because my manager is constantly asking questions, asking developers to demo the smallest changes, having full conversations about bugs, so many things that could easily be handled outside stand-up. 

Aside from that, I just don't feel like I'm doing fulfilling work. The tasks I'm being given feel like admin tasks more than developer tasks (and yes I've brought this up to my manager and basically nothing changed). The customer of our team said in one meeting something about ""our adversaries in Russia and China"" and how our application will ""help us be better prepared for future conflict."" That was just so gross and demoralizing/demotivating for me (I'm not trying to get political, just wanted to state that as a reason for feeling exhausted by the environment of a government job in the US). There's lots of little examples of things that have made me feel completely demotivated at this job, but those are just a few main highlights. 

My original background and education is in music. I have a bachelor's degree in music and then switched to software development after graduation because I wanted a more sustainable career and I was extremely burned out by my music education. The problem now is that I'm utterly burned out by this new thing too, for a ton of completely different reasons. I still make time for creativity now. I make my own music and I have a really fulfilling photography hobby.

I think I'm just looking for some guidance. Is this just normal and I need to stick it out? Are there creative jobs within software engineering that might feel more fulfilling? Should I leave this field entirely or just look for a new job to freshen things up? I'm also feeling a bit jealous of people who have managed to make careers out of their creative interests, but I know that those kinds of careers tend to take the passion out of the creativity at times because it's a full-time job instead of a hobby. I don't know, I'm feeling aimless and completely demotivated. Any advice and guidance would be super appreciated.

When I negotiated this position, I had them put in the contract that at 6 mos they would do a review and give me a raise based on my performance to that point.

1fq6y22,I've Been Attending College Since 15. Should I Move On?,"I started community college right before I turned 16yrs old. I did three semesters part-time and then three full-time to complete my GenEd's and all the classes I didn't want to have to take. I then applied to a higher end college, with a much higher tuition rate, went through an extensive acceptance process and then found out that despite their agreement with IAI, they technically didn't have to accept my credits as legit so, while they'd ""accept"" the credits, they didn't qualify as GenEd's.

All in all, I'll need to retake all the classes I hate as well as my theatre and philosophy major requirements (that I'm actually excited about). The most important thing about school to me is learning. The degree or certification isn't as important as actual knowledge. However, I'm not learning anything. Everything for my last school and this one is just repeats from what I learned in middle school and high school and all the actual course work has nothing to do with the course it is just to appease the teachers who may or may not show up to class. Even the new classes aren't actually teaching anything. I get this is just how life is and I'm told that school isn't to learn it's just to socialize and prove that you're willing to do whatever for credit.

What I need advise on is this. I have an opportunity to study philosophy under Cambridge and Harvard professors in a special program. However, this wouldn't be a bachelors degree. Right now I'm not building much debt attending this school thanks to scholarships but I'm not learning anything either. Do I quit my attempt to earn a bachelors degree (for now) and study under professionals where I'll actually learn and become proficient in my field, or do I stick through this college process to acquire a degree without actually learning how to do the work?

I'm not sure what employers will prefer. A person who actually know what they're doing, or a person with a paper of completion.

1fq6wwy,Is applying for an internal product management role worth the risk of seeming like an uncommitted software engineer?,"I'm really interested in PM (product management) and pretty bored by my current software engineering role. ""What to build""/""why"" is so much more interesting to me than ""how"" to build something.

An internal entry level PM role opened up at my mid-sized company and I'm interested in applying. But I don't want to jeopardize a promotion that may come in the next few months by giving the impression of being an ""uncommited"" engineer (the engineering team would almost certainly find out about my applying). I have 3 YOE and not yet a ""senior"" engineer in title, so a promotion I feel would help a lot in giving me the ""gravitas"" to get into a PM position eventually (or worst case scenario, would help me get into a good MBA program from which I could get into PM).

I was given a ton of flak during my recent rounds of software engineering interviews for even mentioning that I was interested in PM. So I'm a bit wary about mentioning my interest in PM and applying for a PM role and then not getting it and seeming like ""not a true engineer"" and hurting my odds at advancement (advancement which would actually help me get into a PM role).

PM is after all a totally different function and engineers often look down upon it. So I've been afraid to even express to my manager my interest in it. So of course nobody from the product team (who I work with on a daily basis) has even approached me yet with regards to this product role I'd love to try.

My first experience doing anything related to Human Resources was a People Coordinating position in retail, and I currently work as an “HR Expert” at a Target store. 

I am trying to figure out what my next steps and goals should be following my bachelor’s degree. While my current job role is definitely at the bottom of the HR pyramid, I apprecite being able to learn about HR systems like Workday, Kronos, Greenfield and I have been dabbling with Excel. I’ve questioned my career choices a couple times, most often thinking about teaching English, but my experience as a paraprofessional really turned that around for me. I enjoy working with people, I love to be resourceful and the person that people come to for answers. For the first time in my life, I feel like I’m pretty certain about something, and that is my future in HR. I constantly learn from my higher manager, and the concepts and content of the field are of genuine interest to me. 

I’ve fallen down several reddit rabbitholes, I’ve read posts from folks who got HR certifications and a masters later on (SHRM, HRCI etc) I’ve also heard from folks who jumped straight into a masters. I’m a little hesitant to jump straight into a masters, considering that all expenses will come out of pocket, and there’s this tiny piece of me thats scared (and another part of me thats exhausted after a bachelors and wants some time before a masters). 

Do you think a certification or right to a masters is the right way to go? Are there any other next steps that I haven’t mentioned or considered? ANY feedback, thoughts, advice, tips are truly, GREATLY appreciated. I’m just 22 trying to figure this whole life thing out!

So, I confronted him today and told him the exact same thing, to which he replied- ""I know that you have completed your target"" but there are more. ""Why are you joining late?"" 
I then asked him to check the timesheet and see the amount of hours I am working and then he went silent. 
He asked me to remove my Holidays which I had taken tomorrow  because there aren't enough people. 

This is not how it works! 
We aren't required to go above our target! 
We are encouraged to take leaves, if we inform in advance.
It does not matter how much time it takes to complete a document, if it's done within the stipulated time!

I am employed just looking for something better and wanting more opportunities.

- Tell me about yourself? ( I am not sure where to go with this question)
- How would you encourage/promote DEI ( Diversity Equity Inclusion)? - I have never gotten this question before

1fq4boy,What business major to choose?,"Hi everyone, 

I’m currently doing my masters degree in Europe and I need to choose a major. I’m kinda stuck and I would like to have some advice. I initially picked digital organisation but I went to one class and I didn’t really like it so I’m looking for something else. I find marketing to be the most interesting but I hear that it’s saturated so I just took an elective in marketing.

These are all the majors from which I can choose:
Accounting-Data Science and Artificial Intelligence-Digital Organisation -Finance
-Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship
-Marketing
-Organisation, Strategy and International Business (is this too general?)
-Transport and Logistics

Thank you in advance!

1fq3euv,Is this a positive response to a pay negotiation?,"I got a job offer yesterday to work in a genetics testing lab. I have a couple years lab experience and a bachelors degree (which is required for the job). The pay was going to be 22/hour, which seemed a little low. I sent the following email to negotiate (some details have been removed to protect privacy):

Hi (hiring manager’s name), 

Thank you for offering me the position! I’m very excited about this opportunity and the chance to contribute to the team.

Before I formally accept the offer, I'd like to discuss the potential for adjusting the salary. Based on my previous pay and what I’ve seen for current market rates in (my city) I was hoping to get a bit closer to 26$ an hour. 

 I'm eager to discuss this further with you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

They responded with this:

Hi my name ,
 
Thank you for your email. I will need to work through your request which may take a few days. I will get back to you as soon as I can.
 
Thanks,

Does this seem like a positive response from them? Did I ask for too much money? I’ll still take the job even if they don’t accept my offer, but I figured I would at least try!

1fq2hvz,career change?,"Im in my 4th year of accounting and deciding whether I should go into masters + CPA (all done within 9 months in 2025). Deadline to apply is in less than a month. I've already made this decision of not doing it but I would like some encouragement or support. I've always been an art kid, drawing when I was younger up until now. In HS I didn't go with art because accounting was the stable path and a realistic thing to choose. I never liked it, I didnt take a single accounting class in HS either. Throughout undergrad I've had moments where I think I can't make it, that I should switch programs. But I made it through and I am graduating in December. However, I hate accounting, I never wanna do this forever in my life. I have my passion, which is art. Last year I started a tattooing business all by myself. Earned lots of money and gained clients, all through teaching myself. Throughout Uni I also started selling stuff I've made and earned money through those means (I stopped now, but you get the point). All this is just to say that I wanna pursue tattooing/starting a business and I believe I have the potential based on these accomplishments from the past. And if I go take masters + CPA (its short, but I can be using that time and money to invest into myself), I have a job offer in 2025 right after and I will never be able to focus on doing the thing I wanna do full time. I'd be working OT mondays to friday, staying as an amateur in tattooing and doing it on the weekends occasionally. And even if I were to get my CPA, most likely I will not use it in the future, I won't remeber the knowledge I gained or make that certification useful (since I'm viewing this as a backup). If anything I still have my undergrad degree that can land me a low paying accounting job in case I need the security. But I fear my mental health, time, and money invested into pursuing the accounting certification that I dont even plan on using will be a waste of time. I have thought that ""since im already here, might as well do it, or it's always safe to have a backup"". But I wanna make that jump and pursue my dreams.

For context, I applied to a position at Company A that more aligns with my future career goals earlier this month and was offered an interview last week. However, almost right after applying for the job at Company A, I was moved to a role in my current company that similarly aligns with my future career goals and is the in the same field as the position I applied for.

Company A offers better location, better commute, has a longer history in the field, and would provide better structure for me to learn and grow.

For the position at my current company, it is a brand-new role created specifically for me, I would have to be a pioneer and learn everything myself. In my previous position at the company, I had already been doing a lot of the work that this new role entails.

I think the position with Company A for is more appealing and would like to do my best at the interview. My main question is ""Should I mention this new role I've moved into in the interview even though it wasn't on my resume?"" I think the role and responsibilities are quite relevant to position at Company A, but I've only been in the role for 3 weeks.

How can I approach them to find out if they really are serious about me coming to work for them?

Full story:
My department works closely with a lot of other departments and I’ve been in this company for a long time (~15 years) in various roles, so I know a lot of people and a lot of people know my work. I’m good if I do say so myself and it’s noticed.

One department we’ve been working very closely with over the last 6-8 months has repeatedly made joking statements in joint meetings along the lines of “when are you coming to work for us?”/“you should come work for us” and the like. And this is in front of my boss, btw.

We all know there’s a bit of truth in every joke and those comments have always been preceded by me demonstrating some knowledge of their department’s work, policies, etc. so it’s not pandering. And I’ve never heard them say it to anyone else in these meetings.

1fpyex2,How to best approach company founders/friends regarding compensation/title change?,"Hi all, I'm seeking guidance on how to approach discussing my current compensation with my company. Here's the context:

* I'm an experienced Recruitment Professional (Agency) with 10 years of experience as a Senior Recruiter and Senior Trainer.
* I am the first employee at a startup staffing agency founded by friends from a previous company. We now have a headcount of 10.
* Initially hired as Senior Recruiter, I learned the industry and transitioned to ""Senior Sales Enablement Manager"" in July of 2023. We settled on the title as we did not have all the responsibilities of the position ironed out, but the founders know my passion for training and support. My role has evolved into more of an Operations Management position.

Key responsibilities and projects over the past year:

1. Created in-house training content and onboard all new hires
2. Developed an internal job board to address CRM issues
3. Serve as first point of contact for marketing-generated leads
4. Implemented company cell phone system
5. Handle day-to-day IT troubleshooting, and CRM Troubleshooting
6. Provide candidate/client sourcing assistance
7. Contract Drafting/Review
8. Offer coaching support to recruiters
9. Researched and contracted a new marketing company, review and approve all marketing posts and efforts.
10. Other Miscellaneous projects and matters as they come up in and outside of office hours.

The main issue: My current compensation is $75k all-in, with no bonuses. We're based in Ft. Lauderdale, where the cost of living has significantly increased.

According to [BLS.GOV](http://bls.gov/) & Onetonline, the median salary for Operations Managers in Ft. Lauderdale is $102,610, with the 75th percentile at $164,100. I don't need to be at the 75th Percentile, but I definitely need to be in the median area.

I want to be reasonable and don't want to sound greedy, but I'm currently not even in the 50% bracket for compensation for this type of role.

I believe my role aligns more with a ""Recruitment Operations Manager"" than just sales enablement. Based on the conversations with the founders, it seems that they agree with the ""Operations"" title vs. ""Sales Enablement"" as I wear many hats other than just Training/Onboarding our sales team. While I enjoy working with the founders and consider them friends, I need to be compensated fairly.

How should I approach this conversation to request at least the median salary for my position? Any advice on presenting my case effectively would be greatly appreciated.",ReachNo5384,1,1.0,0,1727363172,2024-09-26 15:06:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fpyex2/how_to_best_approach_company_foundersfriends/,9,2024

1fpxkhk,(UK) I have two job offers but I’m in a bit of a pickle…,"Right. 

I have two job offers. One contract, One full time. Different companies. I prefer the full time role. 

I accepted the contract role a week ago. I wanted to wait until I heard back from the full time role but the contract role company needed an answer and the recruiter advised me to accept the job and then pull out if I needed. 

Here’s my issue:

I’m skint. I need cash desperately. 

I start the contract role next week technically and it’s paid on a weekly basis. 

I won’t start the full time role for at least another 2 weeks due to referencing. Maybe longer and I may need to wait a whole month before getting paid. 

-

My ideal situation is to work a few weeks in the contract role until my start date at the full time role just to get some cash in. 

(Not bothered about pissing off the contract role company - I’m in desperate need of cash and have to be selfish)

How do I go about this in the right way? Should I tell the company who offered me the full time role that I intend to do this or should I just stay quiet about it?

I have really enjoyed the flexibility and ability to WFH, and I’ve been exploring other jobs for more than a year, both in the mental health world and outside.

I guess I’m feeling a bit lost on what kinds of jobs to even look for at this time. Does anyone here know or have ideas about what lines of work would realistically hire someone with a clinical, mental health background? I think I offer an excellent understanding of human psychology, communication, and people skills, as well as organizational and administrative knowledge.

Frankly speaking, I'm hating maths and science. It's not just difficult, my mind is not accepting it.


In 10th class, physics and chemistry were okay because there was more theory, but maths was always a problem. Other subjects like English, Social, Telugu, Hindi, and Sanskrit are easy for me.


My parents, teachers, and relatives always told me to take PCM or BiPC, saying other courses have no value. Now I'm worried and feeling demotivated.


At home also, things are not good. My father's business is not doing well because of COVID and he had a heart attack. I'm the only child, so all responsibility is on me. And I have anxiety problem.


I want to get a good job with good salary, but maths and science are making me suffocate. I will complete PCM, but what after that?


Please help me find:


What courses are there after 12th except science, medical, law and defence?
Are there careers that don't need much maths and science?
How to manage anxiety and demotivation?
How to convince my parents for other options?


In my college, students are either very good in PCM or just trying to pass. I'm struggling, feeling hopeless.


Please help me. Your advice will be valuable.

1fptdme,Nike's top boss went from intern to CEO — but loyalty doesn't always pay off,"Between 1988 and 2020, Elliott Hill had 14 different job titles at Nike alone, getting promoted to a new role every two to four years, sometimes even within the space of a year. 

On X, many have commented on how his CV is a wonderful example of company loyalty paying off, but it does beg the question: **how long should you really stay in one job for?** 

Amanda Augustine, a careers expert at TopCV, doesn’t believe Elliott’s career progression is an example of the ‘norm’ when it comes to promotions these days.

While she claims there’s no hard and fast rule about how long to stay with one company for, she does believe there are some questions we should all be asking ourselves when it comes to career growth, especially if we’re looking to get ahead. 

‘If you’re trying to work out whether it’s time to leave your job and find work elsewhere, ask yourself the following questions: When was my last promotion? If it’s been more than three years since your last promotion — or a significant pay rise — consider why,' she told [Metro.co.uk](http://Metro.co.uk)

‘Have you made your desire to be promoted clear to your boss? What feedback have you received about your performance in the past 12-18 months? (Hint: if you haven’t received feedback in awhile, this is your sign to schedule a 1-to-1 with your boss and ask for it). Have you advanced as far as possible until your manager is promoted or leaves? 

If you realise you’ve been doing the same tasks for several years without advancement, it might be time to explore other opportunities within or outside of your current company.’ 

However, Amanda doesn’t think staying put is a mistake or the ‘wrong’ decision, just as long as you can demonstrate on your CV that you have continued to steadily progress throughout your time there.

And before you decide to throw the towel in on your current job as you haven’t been promoted in a few years, do have a think about the industry you’re working in.

‘In some industries, job hopping every two to three years is normal, especially in tech, startups, and creative fields,’ Amanda adds.",Metro-UK,1,0.5400000214576721,4,1727348206,2024-09-26 10:56:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fptdme/nikes_top_boss_went_from_intern_to_ceo_but/,9,2024

1fpsy7r,Should I stay in my new 'IT support manager' role or switch to a help desk position for better career experience/growth? ,"Posted in r/ITCareerQuestions  without much luck/response...

29 y/o, London.  
I recently started as an ""IT Support Manager"" (£30k) at a football stadium, despite having limited IT experience (basic IT troubleshooting, network, PC fixing etc). The chairman couldn’t hire me for the *IT Manager* role due to lack of experience and felt I was overqualified for the *Junior IT* role, so he essentially created a *mid-level IT* support role for me, calling it 'Stadium Support Manager.' He really liked my personality and gave me a chance!

However, after just over a week, I’ve realized the job environment is quite disorganized. There’s no real IT department—just one overworked IT *Manager*—and no formal training or structure for me. Other teams and departments are also complaining about the lack of support and organization, and even the new HR person is leaving this week because the workload is too overwhelming. Now, I’m unsure if I should stay for a year to gain experience or move to an IT Help Desk position to build a stronger foundation in the field.

I have read every single FAQ/post/clickable link/text on the r/ITCareerQuestions  [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/wiki/index/), and it's really helped open up my mind about the 'IT career/field' and understand it better.

 Is it a wise choice to start working in Quality Control and/or Research and Development (R&D) and while doing so try completing (without frequenting; yes I can, this week I also have an appointment with the master of the faculty) a bachelor in Economics and Management ? 

I know that maybe also a future MBA could be useful. 


Please be kind Ahhaha, consider that university in Italy is really cheap.

Thank you for your attention.

1fpsowb,19 and Lost: Seeking Advice on Finding My Path,"Hi everyone,

I’m 19 years old and feeling pretty lost about what I want to do with my life. I genuinely don’t know what I enjoy, and while I feel smarter than most, school has been a frustrating experience for me. It’s not that I find it difficult; I just really dislike it and feel like I’m not gaining any valuable knowledge.

The only thing I’ve really enjoyed in the past is video games, but I realize that pursuing a career in that field probably won’t lead to a good income. Beyond that, I struggle to find things that excite me. I’m not a lazy person; I know that if I can find a field I enjoy, I could put in the effort and succeed.

I attended college for business for a year and a half but hated it. However, I’m open to going back to school if it means pursuing something I actually want to do. The clock is ticking, and I see my peers heading off to typical fields like engineering, finance, or real estate. Real estate seems like a potential path for me, but I dread the idea of spending 15 years climbing a corporate ladder in a job I don’t enjoy—it feels like a nightmare.

Ultimately, I want to make six figures within 2-5 years and have the potential to grow my income to $200,000+ quickly. If anyone has advice on how to find my passion or suggestions for fields that align with my goals, I would greatly appreciate it.",Pers0n987,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1727345330,2024-09-26 10:08:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fpsowb/19_and_lost_seeking_advice_on_finding_my_path/,9,2024
1fpsbem,Wondering which to tackle first?,"Hello Internet ,

I'm (25M) absolutely lazy and always try to cut corners. That's just who I've been, but everyone needs an income to properly live and be respected. I can't reach thirty, still making the same excuses and working the least skillful jobs. That's why after thinking the hardest I have about what I would enjoy as a career, (lifelong and realistically), I realized creativity is the oil in my cogs. It is what puts the smile on my face and if I can't get creative in sales, I'll go back to working on my art; which I haven't been doing for a while. 

Just self loathing and lowering my expectations.

This brings me to my question and hopefully I'll get some solid advice. After being broke for so long with no real college education, I think setting up three different incomes is what I aim to do, going forward in the rest of my twenties. Rather than continuing trying at one min. wage relentlessly, pinching pennies, gambling and riding on others coattails.for the remainder of this time. I don't mean three different degrees, also. In fact, these ""hustles"" would actually fund my schooling in my 30s, which I figure would either be Culinary or Law. 

Anyways here's the golden goose, I'm thinking of getting licensed in bartending asap, then obtain a barber license shortly after, and finally as a third income either apprentice in tattooing or join a local union. All in that exact order (and hopefully start earning in all 3 before I turn 31). 

Please don't send hate. I'm at a low point in my life and barely have the energy to say nice things to myself, as it is.

I just thought today of pursuing these as soon as possible and hopefully get to a place where I can compartmentalize my work week schedule finding time for all three rather than just dedicating to one because I'm fortunately in a position, (financially no debt and physically capable) and have a good mindset where I'm able to NOW. Before I have a kid, Id just like to say that I tried my hand at these things. Obviously, the hardest one (joining a union for skilled manual labor) will be the last one, maybe around age 28 or so but I'm here right now asking for advice on what is necessary to start successfully at my age. 

Anyone in any of these professions, please share any advice you'd give your younger self just staring out.

A couple of Q's:
Is school legitimately required for all of these or can I train myself then test for license/permit in one or two of these jobs? 

Which tools are the most expensive to upkeep and maintain?

What common misconceptions and hurdles in the beginning should I look out for?

What's THE way to begin working for myself in any, if not all, of these professions by the time I'm 40?

I guess since this is a new idea to me and (if not this, it would be the AF Reserves), I wonder if there's anything someone out there would change or add in regard to their choices who has experience in one of these professions? 
Or maybe you'd just simply suggest the Reserves at this age?

I'm all ears. Please, no hate.",Ralphsterss,1,1.0,0,1727343755,2024-09-26 09:42:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fpsbem/wondering_which_to_tackle_first/,9,2024

Then I talked with a friend and told me to wait to be rejected but I was like why? Even if they accepted me and wanted to hire me I think I'd say no and I'd just stay with my current job and keep searching.

So recently I was laid off from a job that I loved. I worked in a very niche field so not many opportunities.

Obviously I’m going to take that over having to relocate, but I (rightfully) feel like a total asshole.

1fpqc25,'MBB' strategic consulting,"Just a doubt about these companies. They are probably well known for a reason, do you think they are worth the money they cost ? can you produce some examples ? Do they really do analysis that no one else can do, with instruments that no one else has or can use in that way ? do they have the smartest brains on earth ?

The outcome of such business analysis they do is often a set of slides, so I'm not saying they are paid a lot to just produce a few slides, maybe there's much work BEFORE that. That's just the summary for the final customer, who can't get bored with all the details unless it asks for them.

Only the bad stories come out and not the good ones, but we all know New York city paid a few millions (some say 1.6, some other 4) to face the garbage problem, and the answer was 'put many more trashes in the city'. Yes, it can happen that after many studies the outcome is the most simple one. But maybe for all those money, you are supposed to produce something smarter. Even Macron was attacked because of spending 2.4 millions for these consultancies.

1fppl9b,Which job should I choose?,"
I’m an EMT-B.

Job A:
- Position: On-site medic for a construction site.
- Pay: $23/hr + $750 mobilization pay upfront + $1,400 travel stipend every two weeks.
- Schedule: M-F, 10-12 hours between 6 AM and 6 PM. 50 hours a week minimum
- Commute: 68 miles, about 1 hour and 13 minutes.
- Contract Length: Seasonal, site has 6 months left, so until March 2025. Live in southeast US where we have had some cold snaps
- Pros: Potential for minimum 10 hours of overtime weekly, could net an extra $15K over 6 months.
- Cons: Disorganized company, potential for smaller checks due to weather-related delays, seeing as if the construction site won’t be open, I won’t work. We’re heading into winter…There might not be another contract for him in 6 months, and it would probably be somewhere random in another state, like NY or Texas.

Job B (Amazon OMR via Spectraforce):
- Position: On-site medic.
- Pay: 25/hr.
- Schedule: Wed-Sat, 7 AM to 5:30 PM.
- Commute: 30 miles, about 44 minutes.
- Contract Length: 6 months, with possible full-time conversion from contractor 
-Pros: Organized company, no worry about hours being cut because the site is unworkable. 
- Cons: Job security unknown after 6 months.

I’ve completed onboarding and background checks for Amazon, and I have an official start date, 10/7. If I choose Job A, do you think I'd burn a bridge with Amazon by leaving so soon? I’m worried I won’t have the Amazon job or comparable available after these 6 months.
(Everything considered, I’m looking at about $15k more over the six months at the Arkansas construction job.)

I study mechanical engineering, focus on energy. I’ll soon be done with my bachelors degree. So I’ll have to decide which master to take. 

I love thermodynamics. It’s fun and makes sense to me. 

I’m find dokumentation and management interesting. And I like it. Just not as much. 

The problem is I have two future paths ahead of me. 

One is become a engineer in the field that I like most and start a career there. 

The other is to take over the family company. Which does technical documentation. 

My father isn’t getting any younger so if I want to do this proper I have to study something that will actually help me along the way. 


So do I take the path that interests me most or become a CEO at the age of 30?

Two months ago her supervisor told her she was going to be converted to full-time, but that it would be hybrid; we live in another state. Initially they asked her to be on site at the end of August and she said no, they then said they needed her on site by the end of September. She didn't hear anything for weeks after this conversation, so she finally got the name of a HR contact and reached out to them to get more info, he told her he didn't know anything and asked her if she had a number in mind for her salary and that he would get back to her when he had more info. Again, she didn't hear anything for weeks, but meanwhile kept asking her supervisor and manager for updates, which they didn't have. A month ago she met with her manager and told him she didn't have an offer, an orientation date, a start date, etc., he said he would get more info and get back to her, he didn't. She kept reaching out to her HR contact and when they finally met again last week he gave her more info on benefits and a salary estimate, stating she would be moved to a SD1 but the salary would only be $10,000 more a year, and informed her they wouldn't provide relocation. He asked her for a start date and she said December as we both just started fall term for our college courses. He said that start date should work and he would get back to her. 

Today, her manager met with her and asked her what's going on, that he just heard she can't be on-site until December and that they had already converted the position and she needs to be there at the end of October. He kept pressuring her to say she will be there at the end of October, she said she could if she had an offer. Her manager made this all out to be her fault and that she should have been more insistent with her HR contact. She stood her ground that she needed an offer and was told that when she meets with her HR contact tell him she can start at the end of October and then he will give her an offer number. 

We are both getting a lot of red flags from this whole situation and are trying to get more of an idea of what could be going on and how to proceed.

I'm in a dilemma with multiple job offers atm. I interviewed both A and B.

A: Verbal offer, they said they would send me a confirmed email today and an offer next week.

B: Received the contract, waiting to get signed.

Can I ask to return the contract to B next week while I'm waiting for the contract from A? In this way, I don't have to reject B while waiting for A.

1fpmros,How do I quit this job?,"So for some background I recently graduated in May with a bachelors in Computer Science. The internships and job I have now have been at the same company that was acquired by another company in May. I was told in May after the acquisition by the VP of the developer service line that they would have something in software development for me soon. But for the meantime to go work for their IT side until a new position became available. Now it being 4 almost 5 months later, still no position in development. However a new contract was won, that I was put on. This contract is doing workflow development for the client mainly using atlassian/jira. This contract isn’t the work I want to be doing, but at the same time the PM is an awesome guy who has really looked out for me. He came over the company acquisition also. I don’t want to mess up his project since it’s in such an early stage. We really haven’t don’t any work yet, since the government takes a while to issue access. My main question is how do I quit this job and will that potentially mess up the contract? There are only 3 other workflow people on the contract.

1fpmh99,"My Co-Worker Earns More Than Me - How Do I Go About Asking For a Match in Pay, If I Am Even Justified In Doing So?","I work in a pretty competitive industry at an agency, and found out a few months ago that my coworker makes 5k more than I do. For context:

- I started off at this company as an intern last September and became a full time coordinator in March of this year. Prior to September, i had about a year and a half of internship experience (all in the same or adjacent kind of industry. for example lets say i currently work in pet care - public relations. my internships were all in pet care pr, pet care social media, etc.)

- my coworker started working full time towards the end of November / early December. she did not intern at this company but did have about two years of prior full time coordinator experience, but not in the same category. for example, music - public relations)

- me and my coworker both work in the same roles. at my agency, there’s really not much of a difference between what an intern and a coordinator does. everything is just based off of your capability - if you’re a more capable intern, you get more involved workload in addition to your grunt work. because of this, when my coworker began as a coordinator, i was her main trainer and taught her everything she needed to know for the first 1-2 months, despite me still being an intern. 

ever since she got hired, we’ve both done the exact same job and have had the exact same responsibilities - and we both do it extremely well. she is talented and deserves the pay she gets, i just don’t see why i don’t too given we are both capable of the exact same things. of course, our job history plays a part, but i feel as though that’s moot if i had to train her, our roles were identical even when i was technically below her and still are, and ive been at the company and in the industry longer. with that being said, her one year is in a few months and i know she will most likely be receiving a raise - putting our pay gap even further apart. when my one year comes in march, i want to ask for a 10k raise + 4 extra pto days to hopefully make up for that extra gap (i am pretty sure she has extra pto days as well!). i am scared that they will feel that is a huge jump, and i wish i could just say that i know my coworker made 5k more and most likely got a raise that puts our pay gap further for the exact same job, so i am justified here. i dont want to throw her under the bus, however, so what do you guys think about negotiating here? for reference, my salary is within the 40-65k range. if yall could provide exact verbiage to use, that would be super helpful - thank you!! 

—————

TLDR: My coworker in the same role makes 5k more than me, and is due for a raise sooner than I. we do the exact same job, and i have been at the company longer despite starting off as an intern and getting officially hired after she started. she, however, has more prior job experience, although my internship experience is slightly more relevant. how do i go about asking for equal pay come my one year review in march?

1fpksw9,"Burned out from a toxic company, should I up and quit and take a break or transition to another job?","I have a high pressure corporate job that I've been doing for years and the working conditions are unbearable. I'm completely burned out, mental and physical health deteriorating, and I can't take it much longer. All my friends and family agree that I should quit.

I've decided that I have to leave but the thought of starting a new job right now seems daunting since I barely have enough energy to even take a shower at the end of the day. Can't imagine starting at a new company, learning everything from scratch, meeting new people and the amount of energy that takes.

Ive considered just quitting and taking time off to rest and get my sanity back after working in this toxic hellhole but I'm afraid that once I'm ready to get back in the job market it'll take too long to find one. 

I can afford to be unemployed for about 6 months, but would prefer to find another job in 3. However, Im afraid that my plan will backfire and I'll end up being unemployed for an entire year which I can't weather. 

On the other hand, I'm wondering if I should jump into another job instead in the hopes that just getting out of my current company will better my energy and state of mind. Plus, it's easier to find a job while you still have a job.

1fpkb41,Struggling mentally with not being able to return to work,"Hey all, I'm 3 months post ACL surgery and doing really well. I work part-time in juvenile corrections and have had no income since surgery. Thankfully I am young and have no major bills, but I have been burning through the little amount of savings I have and need income.

My doctor cleared me to return only to night shift because the kids are sleeping and I basically sit around for 8 hours. The letter to my employer stated I can ""return with the following restrictions: night shift only and must wear ACL functional brace"". Now my boss is saying due to policy, he needs a letter stating I can return full duty with no restrictions, although I will still *only be working night shift*. 

I told my doctor this and she said she can't do that and that it has to state my restrictions. In response, my employer told me to go to another doctor or urgent care to get a letter but I'm pretty sure it does not work like that???

But is this because of liability? Just to be clear, I understand my doctor's reasoning way more than my employer's.

1fpjyeh,Can I call it out at a team dinner if the manager is micromanaging at that moment?,"Not too long ago, I experienced a moment that still leaves me feeling uneasy, and I could really use some advice on how to handle similar situations in the future.  
  
A few weeks ago, I found myself on a project with a completely new team. For context, I work in a project-based company where teams are shuffled around regularly. Sometimes, you’re teamed up with familiar faces; other times, you’re thrown into the mix with complete strangers. This time, it was the latter.  
  
To celebrate our progress, our small team of five decided to have a “Nice Dinner.” In hindsight, it was probably the wrong choice given the looming deadlines and the stress we were all under. We were all putting on our best faces, pretending that this was a great idea. But as we sat waiting for our food—which took an eternity, thanks to the slow service—the atmosphere shifted.  
  
Someone jokingly suggested, “Don’t hate me if I pull out my laptop to work here.” Suddenly, as if on cue, the rest of the group enthusiastically chimed in, “Oh, yeah! Go ahead!” Before I knew it, our cozy dinner had transformed into an impromptu work session, and the dining table became a makeshift office.  
  
I felt trapped. I didn’t want to be the odd one out, sitting there scrolling through my phone while everyone else was typing away. So, reluctantly, I pulled out my laptop too.  
  
But that’s when things took a turn for the worse. My junior manager, who was seated next to me, kept glancing over at my screen. At first, it was a few quick looks, but then her gaze lingered longer and longer, as if she were scrutinizing every keystroke. It was beyond uncomfortable; I felt her eyes boring into me, and the weight of her gaze settled heavily on my chest thru the entire project!!!!  
  
I wanted to speak up—wanted to say, “Hey, could you please stop staring at my laptop? It makes me really uncomfortable.” But the truth is, I’m a people pleaser. Confrontation isn’t my strong suit, and I hesitated, feeling like I was being drawn into a web of awkwardness.  
  
As the night wore on, I couldn’t shake the feeling that her behavior was a form of micromanagement. I could already picture her justifying it later with something like, “Oh, I just want to help you be more productive!” It made my skin crawl.  
  
Fast forward a few weeks, and I’ve mentally added her to my blacklist of people I’d prefer not to work with again. But now I’m left wondering: how do I handle situations like this in the future? How can I assert myself without feeling like the bad guy? I’d love to hear your stories and advice on standing up for oneself in a professional setting.

Brief rundown to keep this short: I have no qualifications and am currently working making around 70k a year. This is a lot more than average in my age group and due to my life circumstances which I won't go into for the sake of brevity, I need to sustain this wage or similar. 

  
The only issue is that I do not enjoy my current job. At all. It is having a severe impact on my mental wellbeing and though I have only had this job for around 3 months, I genuinely do not think I can do it anymore. 

  
Here comes my question. I do wish to get further qualifications to pursue a career in the medical field. These courses will be extensive and take a while, so my line of thinking is that I can get a certificate to study something like childcare- where (where I live) the pay will be similar to what I get now, and the study is no where near as long/ intense as what I wish to do later. Essentially I need to study for something now while in my job I hate, so that I can get a different job to study the medical course I actually want to do (hope this made sense, was hard to explain.)

  
My main question is- should I do this? And if no- what should I do? as I genuienly cannot keep my current job for much longer but need the money (I know a lot of people are in this same situation but please be kind as I have struggled with my mental health for a long time and just need a job that does not affect me THIS much.) if yes, what ""middle"" career should I do?

1fpj4pa,Feeling Stuck in Property Management – Need Advice on How to Pivot,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 30-year-old who's spent the last four years working in Property Management as an Assistant Property Manager. I've worked at two companies so far. At my first company, I made an entry-level salary of $50k and stayed there for three years. However, I witnessed a lot of unethical behavior, including close colleagues being sexually harassed (one of my managers and friends), then fired because the person responsible was too valuable to the company. Friends of mine were also bullied out of the company by higher-ups. Naturally, this led to a lot of dissatisfaction.

I eventually left for a similar position at a more corporate company with a higher salary of $75k, and I've been here for about a year. While I have a strong work ethic, am personable, adaptable, and have made great connections in the industry, I'm absolutely miserable in this field.

For those unfamiliar with Property Management, it's like someone turns on a faucet, and it doesn't stop running until you quit or leave the company. There's constant pressure, endless tasks, and aggressive clients to manage week after week. My boss is passive-aggressive, stressed out, and often abrasive. It feels like the only way to succeed is to let the job consume your personal life.

I attended a prestigious private university but had to drop out eight years ago due to personal reasons. Since then, I've become complacent, focused on collecting a paycheck, and haven’t really explored what else I could be doing or how to successfully transition out of this field.

Has anyone been in a similar situation—feeling trapped in an industry they dislike? How did you make the shift? Where are you now?

I’m an administrative assistant/customer service rep at an insurance agency. I send cancellation notices/ file paperwork/ process payments/ auto and home quotes(no commission). I do the basic things except for corporate stuff because I’m not a licensed agent yet. When I turn 18 I want to become an agent and my boss loves me A LOT. She’s willing to pay for my classes, exams, all of my licensing; she’s told me before she loves my sharpness and motivation and the fact that I’m a perfectionist. 

With school, homework and work it’s starting to become a lot. I get home at 2:40 and have to leave at 2:52 to get to work on time and by the time I get home it’s 5:10 and I have to do a lot of school work, shower, eat. I’m starting to get used to the routine a bit but it’s starting to stress me. 

My dad passed away in January so I was already stressed as it is and with work and school it’s just more stress. Luckily I get a break from November to February because I’m on the swim team but I’ll still be getting home at around 5:30. 

Don’t get me wrong this is a great opportunity and I basically have a career already set for me since my boss is mentoring me and she sees a lot of potential in me. I just see my friends always hanging out and partying while I’m stuck at work or doing school work. 

I don’t want to quit because I need to buy a car soon since I’m turning 16 in may but should I change my hours? I just need some advice because I’m new to the workforce and the corporate world. Are there any brokers or agents out there that actually like their job and think it’s worth the stress because it’s definitely stressful. I have to make sure everything is perfect because there is always a possibility of something going wrong and it being a liability on the company😭",Terrible_Delay6964,1,1.0,0,1727308306,2024-09-25 23:51:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fpix69/should_i_continue_working_or_quit/,9,2024
1fpir5i,Casual Pool agreement- why?,"Hi workers and work seekers. I have a dilemma. I accepted a job offer for a FT position with benefits, PTO etc. Signed the offer letter. Have not officially started yet.

During onboarding they want me to sign a ""Casual Pool"" agreement form that says I am *not* in a regular position, *not* eligible for benefits, have no guarantees for shift/location or hours per week-  an on call, basically.

I asked why? They say it's ""in case"", if I change to this  Casual Pool status instead of FT in the future ""we already have the signed form"". (?) 

Have you ever seen or heard of such a thing? Is this common? Would you sign it?

1fpimyi,I’m being paid significantly less than my coworkers and the department was just bought out,"Backstory - I have been working for my company for 8 years. The STEM job I am in has high turn over, so 8 years is quite a decent amount of time. I know a part of my problem is I haven’t played the game and left the company for better pay. 

I’ve generally liked my company. I had an amazing boss for 6 years, good benefits, I’ve accrued 26 days of PTO a year with ability to roll over 5 days. I have flexibility in my roll such as I can make up work on weekends or pull different department work to make up hours. Also until recently I could work weekends for incentive pay to cushion high expenses. 

Because of my tenure, I have received a lot of training other employees haven’t. I am a huge asset for the group because I can be flexible and perform many tasks. Many that new hires and junior level people should be doing. But of course I’m trusted so I get stuck doing these jobs. There are two others in my group at my level, who do not perform all the same tasks that I do - AND they have half the amount of training I do. Probably been with the company ~2 years. 

I job found out about a year ago I am making at least 7k less than the other two coworkers. I brought this issue up to my current boss back in February and again in April. Didn’t hear anything. I was busy getting married in late spring so I didn’t follow up. 

End of fiscal year hit end of June and I have my 1:1. Boss likes my work, nothing to complain about and mentioned my lack of equal pay was noted and they are working on getting that fixed. Nothing in writing. But I have another coworker in the same boat but at a junior level and they were told the same thing. 

Well, now the whole department has been sold to a new company. I’ll be receiving a new title, same pay. And when I asked about pay situation I was basically told: “well their fiscal year is in December” and we can have a discussion.

My old boss, whom I was hired by for this position originally, reached out recently from her new company. Her group is expanding and she wants me to be a part of the group. 

I’ve interviewed with this other company in the past, and they did not offer me any kind of pay increase. And I know they won’t match PTO or other benefits. I do know they are not as flexible as I am used to in terms of how I can make up time or work from home if I need to. 

I feel I’ve gotten so used to being where I am, I won’t ever leave. I don’t know if I should try to interview again, or wait and see what this new company will offer or if I’ve just really screwed myself over in the long run. 

TL;DR: current job pays me less for more work, promised to pay me more and hasn’t and is now purchased by another company. Have an old boss that wants me but previously her company didn’t offer me more money. I feel screwed.

1fpils1,"1y without a salary raise, finally got a call booked for tomorrow","so, I’ve been working with this firm for almost two years now. I’m a content team manager/senior writer. in the first year, I had a different team lead who was very nice to me and I had minor but still decent salary raises every 4m or so, which surely kept the motivation going

then, the cool team lead quit and I, as an experienced and valuable member of the team, asked the higher management for a promotion to the team lead position. they said they weren’t hiring for the position at the moment and wanted to let the team do our thing without a lead (wtf but ok). then, I asked about some extra responsibility and a salary raise. they said it was okay and kept telling me about some ‘new projects’ coming soon that they’d assign for me

fast forward to today, almost a year since my last paycheck raise and nearly SIX months after that “give me more stuff to do” convo, I still haven’t got any raise. got some extra responsibilities tho lol, but nothing too big. I’m bored as fuck, unmotivated, and actively looking for other jobs and opportunities. however, being the kind of person I am, I just kept reminding my management about my request, like every month or so. being all like “hey! any update?” and everything. finally, they scheduled a call for tomorrow to ‘discuss it in more detail’

any tips and ideas on what should I tell them? I honestly don’t even care about the raise I asked for 6 months ago anymore, they lost my interest with all that postponing and my ambitions are bigger now after I’ve talked to some of the other companies, but it’d still be nice to get a little extra something for now, bc the job market is b r u t a l nowadays as we all know and it might take me a while to find something decent to switch to ",loulouana,0,0.5,3,1727307355,2024-09-25 23:35:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fpils1/1y_without_a_salary_raise_finally_got_a_call/,9,2024

1fpg6dg,"Job posting taken down a week after a great interview, should I be concerned? ","Job posting taken down a week after a great interview, should I be concerned? 

Exactly one week ago I had, what I thought, to be an awesome interview for my dream position. The interview went over the allotted hour by about 20 minutes, conversation flowed so well, every question I answered I gave an example and the interviewers mentioned that I had just touched on their next question through my response. One interviewer commented that my experience aligned with the position very well. 

I really thought I nailed this one. 

To add to the excitement, a contact I know, who held this position previously, recommended that I apply to this position, and took herself out of the hiring team so that she could recommend me as her #1 choice for this role. 

We ended the interview with the team telling me they’d be in touch shortly - within a week or so. They are looking to have someone in the position by mid October. I immediately followed up (within 24 hours) with a thoughtful thank you for the interview, and have been waiting eagerly ever since. 

Today, I checked the webpage and the posting was down. It had been up as recently as yesterday.

Should I be worried that the posting has been taken down and I haven’t heard anything? I really thought I nailed this one, and want it so badly, but am worried that this might not be a good sign.

1fpfu16,Mental health is struggling trying to find a new job.,"I was fired from my job 3 weeks ago and have filed for unemployment and have been filling put 10+ applications a day. 

For context I was an esthetician working at a med spa that was extremely toxic and I was bullied like crazy. I dealt with it and took the abuse. But they ended up letting me go because she said her business isn't able to afford an esthetician anymore. It was honestly for the best because they treated me so badly. 
I've decided I want to find an office job. Idk doing what just some kind of desk job. I live in an area with several corporate offices for large companies. So I'm hoping for that. Ive been applying for all the entry level rolls. 

So far I've had 2 interviews with corporate offices in town. 1 job didn't give me the job. But the other job I had a phone interview with 2 says after losing my jobs. A little over 2 weeks later they sent me an email and said they wanted me to do an in person interview and asked my availability for it. I immediately wrote back with my availability that week. That was 2 days ago and I haven't gotten a response to that yet. However i had 4 people I know that work there tell me that their hiring process takes forever and to not stress about it and they say if you make it past that it's an amazing job. So I'm not giving up on that yet. I may wait 1 full week and send a follow up email that says what you availability for that week is. 

I'm getting so discouraged I've never lost a job before and I've never had a hard time finding a new job. My mental health is declining because I'm so stressed about it all. I'm unsure what to do or how to cheer myself up. I know it's only been 3 weeks but it feels like a life time. It feels hopeless. Can someone just reassure me that they've been where I am and that they made it through it. Maybe some advice too.

I'm struggling with what to put on my linkedin and resume as I don't have any experience.

 I've done quite a few projects for classes but they're not relevant (i.e. a journalism video presentation or a UX heuristics evaluation) or, in my eyes, not impressive enough. So I guess I have a lot of very small/simple projects in a lot of fields. My degree covers a lot of different fields for variety but taking just one class in each doesn't allow me to build those skills further. I don't think employers would hire me off of an HTML only website project. 

My degree is online with my school 4 hours away so while they offer on campus jobs/internships, I can't apply due to distance (plus it's very very rural). I live in a metropolitan city so there's a lot of opportunity here. 

I've seen recommendations to put volunteer work, which I have. I have had multiple hourly wage jobs, mostly in vet clinics, so I possess a ton of soft skills.

1fpeqyv,Advice on quitting a job...,"Hello all. I wanted to come to you all for some advice. I have come to the realization that I have severely over-extended myself. For context, I am a 24M, married, 3yo son, and I work two jobs. I am also enrolled in community college working on finishing up my AS in Business Administration. This coming spring I will be starting at University to pursue a Bachelors and eventual Masters degree in Accounting. The problem that I have run into is that I feel I have severely over-extended myself. My morning job, (I work at a very well known green-themed international coffee chain), starts at 4:30 AM, I get off work at around 11, I have a Calculus class that starts at 12:30 and runs until 1:45, and then I go to work at my second job at the community college from 2PM to 6PM, M-F. I am also taking a 16 week Meteorology class to fulfill a science req. for my degree. These are my last two classes before I graduate. Mondays I also have something that I do after work that I don't get done with until around 8 PM. What's more is that my days off do not line up so I never have a true day off to rest and recoup. I realize that the amount of hours I am working isn't far off from full time, but the range of hours is what is killing me. I have considered trying to change my hours, but the way the rest of my schedule is set up makes this not possible. As a result, I am exhausted. I have begun to shirk classes when I am almost done with them. I hardly feel like doing anything when I have any free time because I am so tired. I love cooking, but by the time I get home I don't feel like cooking and usually end up picking up dinner for the family. My wife also works full time. I don't usually get to see my wife or son very much because I am always so busy. Another issue that I have run into with my morning job is that I have trouble getting up so early. I usually *try* and get up around 3 AM so that I have time to get ready and make the 20 minute drive from our house to my job. However, this usually doesn't work out this way and I end up being late and getting in trouble.

So, now that I have given some context, here is my issue: I have already made up my mind that I need to leave my morning job. As much as I enjoy it, I realize that it is not the end of the world, and my main reasons for getting the job no longer exist. I really only keep it for the perks and extra money. I feel guilty for wanting to quit, but know that it would be for the best. However, because of the time frame of my classes, I really need to quit sooner rather than waiting two weeks. Ideally, before the week is over. I feel really bad for doing this and don't want people to be upset with me, but know that people will be.

Over the past year, my role changed and I’m doing things really quickly. This leaves way too much time to just sit around during the day. 

I used to have more responsibilities, but they changed this around this year. Our management team does not communicate with the lower level workers well so even though I was doing a great job, they took work away without adding more. My manager and everyone I work with knows I do a great job, but the top people in the company have their own ideas in their head about how they want things to be and don’t tend to listen to anyone who could provide good feedback on a lower level.

I would take on more work. But I’ve been advise by my boss not to ask because management is unstable right now and it could put me in the crosshairs. One thing I strongly worry about is seeming like I’m not necessary because I’m asking for more work. That’s how our management might see it because they don’t actually know or appreciate what I do.

For as long as I can remember, I wanted to work in the film industry and even went to school for it. My college education was not great and I didn't get career advice or help while I was a student. Once I dipped my toes in the waters of a couple feature productions, short films, and even broadcast work, I'm realizing it might not be the career for me.

1fpdpv1,Am I giving up?,"Hey everyone, M19 from Germany here.

Since I am 12 years old, I have been producing electronic music, never really breaking through, but also never taking it seriously as a business either. I would say I am satisfied where I am at musically and can create any sound I want to create.

However, the business aspect of music turns out to be very difficult for me. I don't do a lot of social media, which is kind of what you're supposed to do as a musician in this day and age, I rarely send stuff out to labels and I rarely put stuff out.

Of course, combined, I have put a lot out over the years, but never really anything solid, which I would want on my Wikipedia page.

When I finished school, I went to University and am currently studying Sociology, which to me was the subject that I was the most interested in apart from music production (which would have been pricey), and because the more liberating time structure (in comparison to german schools) would have allowed me to put all of my free time into music, which yeah, a lot of the time I did.

What's frustrating is that in my City, there is no real ground, no ""scene"" for electronic music except techno, and I am NOT a techno producer.

Fast forward 2 years. I have studied Sociology for two years now (2024).

My music hasn't gotten anywhere. I feel like it's ""be a superstar or be a nobody"" in music. No real grey zone of being able to have a stable income.

Eventually supporting a family and being able to afford a home have gotten more important to me. I don't have either of them right now yet, but that's where I see my future some day.

Now, working for the government, specifically the BKA (german FBI) or the Bundespolizei (Federal Police) have become interesting to me. They offer a unique workday each and every day and a secure workplace where I don't have to be afraid of not earning money each month.

In fact, I have kind of gotten obsessed with that. Every day, I watch videos on what the officers and detectives have to do, just as much as I am seeing myself in DJs when I watch their recorded sets, and have gotten more interested in the job. I would now count being a police detective or officer as my second career goal.

For years now I have not lost the drive to be the best musician I can. I maxed out my skills. I felt like a talent even when no one saw me as that. Doing something that ""makes more sense"" to people feels like giving up, giving them what they want. I know it's more stable. But I have built my whole life around a dream, and I feel like I would be abandoning it if I joined the police.

I have the feeling I have never given my music career a fair shot business-wise. But something else is almost as good as that and way more realistic.

What do I do?

Am I giving up? \*Should\* I give up?

Edit:

TL;DR:

I have been following my passion of music production for 7 years and police work has gotten almost as interesting as that, yet is WAY safer money-wise.

Since I am 12 years old, I have been producing electronic music, never really breaking through, but also never taking it seriously as a business either. I would say I am satisfied where I am at musically and can create any sound I want to create.

However, the business aspect of music turns out to be very difficult for me. I don't do a lot of social media, which is kind of what you're supposed to do as a musician in this day and age, I rarely send stuff out to labels and I rarely put stuff out.

1fpaw8x,4yrs Unemployed and Hopeless,"I (31) have been unemployed for nearly 4yrs. My last job was as an e-commerce manager at a mom-and-pop home goods store, which I stupidly resigned from after my dad died suddenly in Nov. 2020. (I know, big mistake. I kick myself every single day.) I was paid $18/hr, which I considered a fortune at the time, and I felt endebted to my bosses. (I was coming from a part-time Visitor Services job at a museum, which paid $10/hr at time of hire. The director of the museum later raised our pay to $11/hr to ""support a living wage."" 🙃)

Now, 4yrs since my dad's death, my savings have dwindled, I've used up the vast majority of my dad's life insurance payout, and my mental illnesses have worsened. I've had a few job interviews, but nothing has panned out. Granted, I've been selective when it comes to my search, as I don't want to create the same conditions that led to me leaving my original job. 

At this point in time, I want to find a position that requires minimal social interaction (specifically with customers, as I'm just not mentally ready for that) and involves mainly independent work. I don't want to put a strain  on my mental health. I'd be happy with $40-60k, and I don't expect to make any more than that.

I am open to pursuing certification programs if it more or less guarantees an income, but I'm otherwise weary of spending too much money. 

Does anyone have suggestions on what fields I should look into? What sort of companies would even consider someone who's be unemployed for so long? What about career paths that are friendly to folks who struggle with anxiety/depression? Are career coachs worth it?

All constructive advice is welcomed! Just be kind, please. I already think very poorly of myself.

1fpa8b9,Boss caused a panic attack during a meeting. ,"I 31f had a meeting with my 40sM boss. It was a video monthly meeting to allow employees to provide feedback on the work, company direction and other aspects. We are a small remote company so these meetings make sense. 

I dont have much use of these meetings since most of my professional needs are met through other means. 
For me; these meetings are surface level and scraping bottom of the barrel for negative feedback. 


During this zoom meeting; I made the mistake of mentioning that meetings in general cause me anxiety. Followed up with a comment like; “my Anxiety was like an old fixture in my brain that im used to now. “ he kept asking more questions about it; i followd up with; “my anxiety triggers are outside of work.” I also mentioned that as long as I knew a head of time what the meeting was about; I would be fine. The more he pressed to know more; the more i thought he wanted me to trauma dump everything. 

In hindsight; it seemed like he was begging for me to “bleed” every single horror for himself. 

What broke my professionalism and tore my brain into a panic; was his attempt to bond with me by telling me that he caused someone trauma.  It made me have painful flashbacks. 

I was immediately furious that I lost composure, started to cry and wanted to feel anything other than this prodding. 

I like my professional and personal life separate. My professional life is sometimes an escape. 

Through what sounded like a broken whimper; I asked if my professional work has suffered in anyway? He responded in the negative. 

For fear of  punching my screen or breaking his ears with a full scream; I kept my head down. 

I answered a few of his previously mentioned questions in between sobs. After that; i hung up and flung my headset into the wall (they still work)

But I don't find the guy particularly incompetent or difficult to get along with. What I really see is a reluctance for anyone in charge of him to take responsibility in training him. I've been cordial with him but didn't stick my neck out for him earlier because I was busy and I figured the grumbling would cease eventually.

Now I hear that management is building a case to fire him, even meeting with HR and planning to assign him a project destined to fail so that they can protect themselves from a potential lawsuit. I'm profoundly disappointed in my coworkers, who I thought were friends and decent people, and the management, who I expected would see through all the high school drama. It's sick to mess with somebody's job, their first job, just because you don't like them, no?

I'm disappointed in myself for not speaking up sooner and at this point, it's become way more delicate than I know how to handle.

I want to transition to an AI-focused career, possibly in ethical AI development. Need advice on potential career paths and how to stand out in this competitive field.

*A bit about me and where I'm coming from*

I'm 26 years old, live in a HCOL area with decent savings (like $35k), graduated from a top 25 university for my major (Supply Chain) but...

***I never went into Supply Chain!*** 🥴 

Instead, because I had some bills I had to pay while in school and I loved numbers, I ended up building a highly successful career as a freelance business in content writing and SEO strategy (still do this for side income, average like $60,000 or so a year doing this). During my time doing this, I really honed my knack for creating content strategies and then actually executing the deliverables themselves (since I loved writing). Practicing my writing also led me into a few pretty successful stints on contract for some top companies within a few niches like fashion and construction where I wrote ads that helped drive 3x - 6x ROAS. 

That being said, though, I needed things like health benefits and private insurance is wicked expensive, so I eventually took up a job as a copywriter with a top 100 nonprofit. This was a really good job, I'm still there (more about that later), and I did things like rewrite the entire website, lead the brand voice redux as part of an org-wide rebrand, wrote a few personal giving campaigns that beat previous records, and took ownership of the blog. 

Eventually, my accomplishments led me to being the owner of the main website and also the SEO strategy. During my two years doing this, my strategy and actual writing increased our organic search presence for key terms by more than 800% and grew our newsletter audience from 4,500 to 21,000. 

This, paired with my knack for writing high-performing ads, led me to also be the primary marketing owner of our eCommerce store, where I led a team consisting of a designer and copywriter to redesign the entire store, also led the writer through implementing a content strategy that helped increased its search traffic by about 600%, created and implemented a subscriber membership program that's grown from 0 to 5,000 in our first year, and, most importantly led our contract team of four developers to make a series of ongoing CRO improvements + our products team of two people that boosted our yearly revenue from about $120,000 the first year to being on track to hit $500,000 this year. 

But, and this is where we really start changing things up, all while I was doing this, I was investing a LOT more into learning about ML and NLP because I'd gotten interested in it during my time as a freelancer since I'd read some books that suggested that auto text prediction was going to give way to programs that could eventually write whole books off of simple commands. So, by the time that ChatGPT came out, I'd already been reading papers about things like transformers in my free time. 

***IMPORTANT NOTE***: Everything I'm about to talk about from here is relating to work that relies on low-code and no-code tools, I am not a programmer. 

This led me to become instantly recognized within my org as the AI whiz, and to them I certainly was. Using my knowledge and project management skills and willingness to learn tools / skills I'd never touched before, I was able to do some really cool stuff for them like:
 
* Build a RAG-enabled bot for custom product recommendations for our eCommerce store that directly led to an additional $50,000 in revenue

* Build a prompt-chain guide for our philanthropy team that they used to speed up their grant writing which they directly cited as being the reason they've secured over $10M in federal funding that they otherwise wouldn't have had the capacity to go chase

* Create pitches for three different grants for social impact programs that foundations of F50 companies have successfully funded to empower people with or through AI, ranging from $250,000 to $1.33M, and some more on top of that. Next year, I'll be leading a dev team consisting of a newly-hired chatbot developer (already managing him as of a few weeks ago) + quality assurance engineer to make even more enhancements to our chatbot! 

As a freelancer in the AI space, my skills let me build an interactive text-based RPG for a creative licensing agency's top IP (think a step below a Marvel character) that had like 45,000 people play it in its first ten days and got one rave review from a top gaming mag online, got to work with a top game studio to build a browser-based tavern fighter / dungeon crawler video game (soon to be released!), and just closed a contract to work with one of the largest game IPs to work with their devs to create some DLC for one of their most successful modules just out of beta that will use LLMs to enable dynamic NPC conversation. 

*What I Need Help With*

Well, to be honest, I need some understanding of what career could even be open to me from here? I feel like because some of my grants just closed I still need to see them through and maximize their impact before I can claim them as successes for an AI-forward career (which is what is most interesting to me, most specifically a career focused on forcing the labs producing the frontier models to abide by holistically ethical development guidelines) but at the same time something within me feels itching for a change now - I just wouldn't know where to go or what to even look for, especially with such stiff competition out there right now.",Phelps1576,1,1.0,0,1727282035,2024-09-25 16:33:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fp8tqq/what_job_titles_should_i_be_chasing/,9,2024

Need help deciding ,"So basically I have a pretty big family emergency which means my family who I live with must move out of the city. I just started this job 2 weeks ago and haven’t even worked 2 weeks cause I’ve been working part time. I really like the job and it’s great experience. It’s a small place and I work with the boss and everyone is pretty nice. If I quit I am supposed to give 2 weeks notice. But if I leave the city now I will be leaving asap and I’d only give like 2 days notice. And I know they can get pretty busy so I guess that’d be a pain for them. 

However, I could stay here another 3 months while my family lives wherever they are going to. But would working for 3 months, part time, and then moving benefit anyone? Would it just be more of a burden for them if I stayed longer and then quit? I’m not even making thaaaat much money since it’s part time. It’s mostly about the experience which is hard to come by. 

Tbh leaving my family would be kinda stressful, and then having to take a plane to where they are after the 3 months would be quite stressful too since I’ve never done that before….

1fp85rp,Need Help! How to present a short Unpaid Internship on my Resume and LinkedIn?,"Hi everyone,

I need some **advice** on how to present my recent work experience on my resume and LinkedIn. Here’s my situation:

I graduated in October 2023 with a master’s degree in Data Science and after working briefly at Boots, I landed a **two-month unpaid internship** at a small startup from April to June this year. I did data analysis, worked on social media data, and handled much more than the typical “data science” role (i worked on SMM, content creation, administrative tasks etc). The company was small—just the CEO, her husband which was the co-founder, the  CTO, one other woman dealing with marketing and operations and a small team in India that worked remotely.

The CEO couldn’t offer me a permanent role afterward due to budget constraints, and the other woman (who was paid below minimum wage, only 1100£) left soon after I did.

My questions:

1. Should I list this internship as full-time work on my resume or mention it as an unpaid internship?

2. **Can I extend the work period** to look like 4-6 months on my resume/LinkedIn, even though I only worked for 2 months?

3. **Will future employers ask for payslips,** or is the contract enough to prove my experience?

4. **How should I express this on LinkedIn**—should I remove the “present” tag since I no longer work there?

I’m on a graduate visa, so I’m trying to present my experience in the best light possible for future job applications. Any advice on how to go about this would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",aestheticdatagal,1,1.0,0,1727280367,2024-09-25 16:06:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fp85rp/need_help_how_to_present_a_short_unpaid/,9,2024

1fp6qrp,"44 years old.. 20-year career in I.T. . Currently Director of Operations for an MSP. Been here for 12 years. Tons of experience. Bachelor's degree in Technology Management... I need a career change, can't even get a call back for an admin position... ","Title says it all.

I have worked for a mid-sized tech consulting company for the last 12 years. I have worked my way through the organization and for the last 2 years held the position of Director of Operations. (Senior Network Technician, I.T. Service Manager, Project Manager, now DoO) I have no more growth available to me where I work now. 

I rarely miss work. I work hard when I am working. I prefer to stay in one company and get promotions rather than job hop. These are the traits that got me where I am, promoted over others, and I feel that a potential employer would consider ideal. 

Previous to this I worked at a manufacture as a PC Tech and then promoted to Applications Programmer. I spent some time doing internet sales for a Harley-Dealership when the economy crashed in 2009 and couldn't find an I.T. job. 

I live in a semi-rural area. Not a lot of Tech jobs here and most are under my current position. I'm about 1.5 hours drive from THREE major US cities, plus several smaller cities that are closer. I'm willing to do Hybrid 2-3 days a week for the bigger cities, full time onsite for anything within an hour drive. Other than that, looking for remote work. Salaries in the cities are double my current wages. 

I have had my resume vetting by a consultant. Multiple people tell me it looks great. I've had SOME interviews, but nothing has stuck... I am tired of applying to 15 jobs a week for the last 18 months on jobs that have 300+ applicants already and getting nowhere. 

Logic states that there is something wrong with my approach, but I hire people for my company and if someone walked in with my resume, I would hire them on the spot. 

Is there something better I can do to engage potential employers? Honestly, I don't even care if my future career path involves I.T. or not. I just know it's hard to change careers at this point.

1fp6l5p,Should I go for this job?,"I have been an A/V Technician for a Large School District in Texas for almost 3 years now. I am the Technical Liason between our school district’s Events Center and our Technology Department - so I technically work for 2 departments. To explain my job in short - over at our Events Center, I run our Audio PA system as well as our Jumbotron and Digital Signage Systems as well as provide technical support for our Conference Center. We host the most Graduation Ceremonies in the state and I work every single one of them. Over with my Technology Department, I basically provide technical A/V Support in all school district buildings (70+ buildings). Meaning I maintenance teacher’s TV’s, laptops/desktops, projection systems, I replace Fiber Optic cables if need be, the job can become pretty labor intensive. 

Lately these past 12-18 months, work here has turned extremely bitter. From favor nepotist hires (who now manage me) to training these exact people that were given favor hires how to do their job while getting paid 2 to 3 times more than me to micro managers to hostile environments to budget cuts and mediocre pay raises (1% to 4% raises on average) every year, I am no longer happy at my job and school district. I managed to already land a job offer to be an A/V Technician for the City of the School District I just so happen to work for, so I luckily don’t have a longer commute - if anything, the commute is probably a bit shorter. So I am potentially going from a School District Employee to a City Employee. Seems like the job was consisting a lot on Conference/Meeting Room Microsoft Teams A/V equipment troubleshooting and whatnot. 


Here are my current job’s pay, benefits, PTO info, etc.: (School District)

- Monday to Friday 8am to 4:30pm, occasional weekends
- $26.81/hour
- 2 weeks of Sick Leave (renewed yearly)
- 2 weeks of Vacation (renewed yearly)
- Off on all Holidays
- Off for half a week of Thanksgiving Week
- Off for 2 weeks during Christmas Break
- Medical, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance and much more all offered
- TRS (Teacher Retirement System of Texas)
- 457(b) and/or 403(b) offered
- Overtime is almost never an option, school districts DO NOT LIKE people working overtime
- I work on occasional weekends


Here are the offered job’s pay, benefits, PTO info, etc.: (City Employee)

- Monday to Friday 8am to 5pm, no work on weekends
- $30.14/hour - going to try to negotiate to $32/hour
- 1 weeks of Sick Leave (renewed yearly), upgrades to 2 weeks of Sick Leave after one year
- 2 weeks of Vacation (renewed yearly), upgrades to 3 weeks Vacation after 5 years
- Off for half a week of Thanksgiving Week
- Off on all Holidays
- Medical, Dental, Vision, Life Insurance and much more all offered
- TMRS (Texas Municipal Retirement System)
    - 7% of my gross pay goes to TMRS, I become vested after 5 years and the City matches contributions monthly at a 2:1 ratio
    - Since I am already a School District Employee, my TRS can easily be transferred to the TMRS AND my service credit time can be combined to the TMRS - meaning I only need 2 more years instead of 5 years in order to be vested. 
- 457(b) offered
- Overtime is every now and then expected. I am given Comp time. 

What do you guys think? Is this a good job upgrade? Let me know, any and all advice is appreciated!!!

Its not that I hate it, bios alright (ugh papers), the chem is awful (mostly because of the memorization and the math), and every time I try to think of my own future, i cant feel anything. I try to imagine myself going into the medical field and working there and I just can't see myself there. I used to work in a hospital (lab), and it was an alright job but it never really excited me. Yes the pay was great, but idk, i guess it wasnt fulfilling?? 

I love art. Art's the only thing that gives me joy. No, Im not talking about just making drawings and paintings and whatnot. I wanna make movies, animated films, stories. I wanna make something meaningful for once and inspire people. Bad thing is, actual getting into the entertainment industry is hard, especially with how hectic it is rn. Plus, everyone knows just how little art majors actually make after they get their degree.

But then again, everyone knows the amount of debt and the amount of schooling premed students go into (8 to 14 years of schooling). I don't have a lot of money, and yes I can get a scholarship but that isnt a guarantee. Most likely, I'll have to take a loan in order to pay for medical school and then I have to pay for 10-30 years. And THE FIELDS. Sure, going to med school is hard and actually PICKING a career is harder. Will i even survive med school??? Will i even get in?? Will i survive working at a hospital??

I've been with this company for 1.5 years. 

My main position is interpreting, but I also do HR stuff and other things. 

Even though I'm quitting next month, I can't help but think about how weird this company is. 

1. We were supposed to go on a business trip the other day. The day before, I notice that everyone had canceled their flight, as well as their hotel reservations. I called my boss asking him if I should cancel the reservations as well, and he says yes. Is it normal for a boss to not tell you a business trip to another state has been canceled?  

2. I don't have a work PC. When I first started working, they asked me if I have a laptop. When I told them ""I have a Macbook from uni"", they said ""great! install this app on your Macbook and you can do all the work that needs to be done"". 

3. They're attending a career fair when they don't speak English. So I know this sounds a bit a condescending, but hear me out. Last year my team and I attended the career fair, and it was the most stressful thing ever because three people are just chatting and gossiping with each other, while I'm trying to explain our company and job to 3\~5 students at once. Because I'm quitting, they're trying to ""cover"" for me, but I feel like attending a career fair with only non-English speakers is a risky move. 

4. All the people from management are not assertive at all. They're clueless about time management, and when they need to talk to someone that only speaks English, they literally stop walking. For example, we would have a reservation for a rental car and would head towards the counter together. However, the closer we get to the counter, the slower their pace becomes. At first I thought they were trying to pull up a confirmation email on their phone or something, but they just stand there, waiting for me to go to the counter. 

I know I'm just yapping here, but I wanna know how management is like at other workplaces. For my case, I'm the only English speaker, so I fully understand they need to rely on me for a lot of things, and I don't blame them for that. However, I am not part of management, I need orders/directions. Once again, I know it doesn't matter anymore because I'm quitting, I just think my workplace is weird.

1fp3tmu,Can I achieve my dream job as a fashion designer?,"So I (17F), have discovered that I want to become a fashion designer. After looking into the career, I found that it is pretty much all I want in a career, so it's perfect for me. 
I picked my a-level subjects in 2023 (I'm now in year 13) but at that time I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I wanted to take art, drama and music, as I've always been a creative person and dreamed of a creative career. But for other reasons I couldn't take them, so instead I took sociology, psychology and law (I'm also fairly interested in them). I dropped law after a month because it was too complicated and I had no interest in it, so now I'm now doing the other two subjects. 

Over the summer holidays, I thought of dropping out and doing a fashion course but my parents said no as I'm already so far into them and by September I would only have 9 months of school left until a-levels so I might as well finish them. They said they would help me get fashion related experience outside school and we decided that an apprenticeship would be best for me as it fits my personal needs better, as university is a definite no for me. I already design my own things in my free time, which I really enjoy. I need to work on sewing so my parents said they would get me into sewing lessons or some type of sewing class and would also help me get a fashion related part time job (like working at a clothing shop).

Recently I had a talk with my parents and we decided that an apprenticeship for costume design would be easier. As I've always been interested in theatre and film, so I could design for theatre companies and on film sets. My ultimate dream would be to have my own brand, so starting out a costume designer for films and theatres would help get my name out there and hopefully I could open my own brand with all that experience.

Does all of this sound realistic?? Like could I actually achieve my dream even though I'm taking subjects that don't relate at all to fashion? Some extra advice would also be appreciated.",luhvprincsss,1,1.0,0,1727269128,2024-09-25 12:58:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fp3tmu/can_i_achieve_my_dream_job_as_a_fashion_designer/,9,2024

1fp3664,Need advice: Certifications and tips for breaking into the data field in Sweden,"Hi everyone,

I recently moved to Sweden and I'm struggling to find a job in data analytics or data engineering. Back in my home country, I was working as a support engineer, but I actually hold an engineering degree in Business Intelligence. The challenge is that I didn't work in that field before coming here, so I’m finding it difficult to get started.

I secured an internship as a data analyst here in Sweden, and I’m confident in my abilities—I’m really good with SQL, Power BI, Azure Databricks, and pretty much anything data-related. However, I haven’t been able to land a job since then, and I'm facing two main issues:  
1. I don’t speak Swedish, which seems to be a barrier for some support engineer roles.  
2. I don’t have a lot of professional experience in data analytics or data engineering, even though I’ve been self-learning and practicing at home.

I’m now focusing on getting certifications, but I’m unsure which ones would be the most valuable to boost my chances of getting hired. Does anyone have recommendations for certifications that are highly valued in Sweden or in the data field in general?

Also, if anyone has advice or tips on how to at least get an interview or how to prove my skills in the Swedish job market, I would really appreciate it! I’m passionate about this field, and I know I can excel in it—I just need the opportunity to prove myself.

1fp0zzv,[Master's Degree] Computer Science,"I have a Bachelor's Degree in Electronic and Automatic Engineering, and I'm looking to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science or any related field (Data Science, AI, etc.) in Europe. I say in Europe because overseas tuition is mad crazy (I'm not paying 120k for a piece of paper when I could have it for 5k or less.

Here's a list of what I'm looking for:

* Good reputation (Shanghai Ranking for reference)
* Updated curriculum (that is, modern)
* Part-time (I'd be working at the same time)
* **Fully online**
* Low cost or with financial aid

The main issue is that there aren't many universities (of good reputation) that offer online masters. And those who do have admission requirements I don't meet. I have a 6.5/10 grade, which makes it harder - I know - and while I do have experience in programming, my Bachelor's didn't offer any theory classes on Architecture or Algorithms, which are sadly a requirement in most Master's of Comp Sci and related disciplines.

Curriculum-wise, I've been working on EU Commission AI projects for over 4 years, and done an internship at an IT Consulting company for 8 months (just recently been hired as a backend developer). I'm proficient in 5 languages (B2 certificates in German, Chinese, and French; C1 certificate in English; native Spanish). And I also studied abroad as an Erasmus student in Berlin for one year.

1fp09dl,My colleague doesn't accept my boundaries regarding planning,"I'm bad at handling chaos. If I plan to work on a report, I want to work on a report. My colleague has a habit to come into my workspace and fires questions about a lot of different topics, sucks me into conversations about topics that are interesting and usefull, but not my priority that day. So I usually, after a while, cut it off with something like ""this is very interesting, but I'd really like to proceed working on my report again."" 

Sometimes he does back off, but sometimes he says ""Yes I know it's not planned, but this is also very important!"" 

I usually respond with, ""let's plan a moment so we can discuss this topic.""

He keeps doing it, and he thinks this is the kind of thing that he should be able to do. I don't come to our office anymore to write reports, because I know it'll be a day full of interruptions.   
  
It's really messing with my productivity. I get annoyed with him (I think he's noticed by now), and I come off as stupid, because he usually catches me off guard with a topic that I haven't been focused on and he has.

In spring I had a talk with my team leader about my degree, and she told management. After an improvised interview they decided to put me on a project, while promising to get me a permanent position ""as soon as possible"". This project has now been extended, first until August, then October and now until January.

Also, since it's just a project, they can send me back to retail at any point. 

It's also way more than the project I was originally told about. I've been a vital part in production for multiple locations, no oversight, basically managing on my own. 

Apparently my bosses boss is denying the position. 
I love the job, but the pay is not only below average, it's horrendous.

Should I keep trying to get the position, working overtime and such to impress and show I'm needed, or cut my losses and apply elsewhere?

I’ve been told within my company to get the fastest MBA possible to get a promotion b/c they do not care once I’m in the company. However, I do not know if I want to stay working here. Which brings along the problem that they will help pay for a part of further education, but I’m locked in with the company for 2 years after I finish the degree.

Another option is to do an online MBA. I think I’d enjoy my job more if I ended up relocating within my company. An online MBA/accelerated online mba/online post-bacc would give me the flexibility. However, I don’t get the opportunity to network as well with this option.

There’s so many other options out there in the finance world, and a lot that would be better pay. A professional MBA could help find those opportunities, but I’d be locked in with my current company unfortunately.

I have always been interested in learning how to code and I believe it would pair well with a finance background.

1fox3hr,Am I getting scammed? E-commerce ,"Long story short I randomly connected with a guy on LinkedIn and one day he messaged me about my career and how it was going. I was honest and told him the industry I worked in (sports) was something I no longer desire to be in because of the pay and long hours, working nights and weekends. He gained my trust since he was also in that industry and had the same major (sport management) and I wanted to pick his brain so he offered to talk to me. Saw that he transitioned to a different career (Finance) and wanted to know how I could do the same, but when chatting with him he was more focused on side ventures (e-commerce). We agreed to chat again and he gave me his approach that he used to be successful. It was very broad and not detailed.

During this time I have no idea what business he runs, and he is reluctant to bring on just anyone as they must share common goals. He mentioned how during our talks he is evaluating me to see if I would be a good candidate since he does not want to share his knowledge to just anyone and he and his wife pick a few people each year that seem to be the “right fit”. I agreed to talk to him again next week since it’s not costing me anything except an hour of my time, but I am sort of worried. His big selling point is how he ended up being debt free by his early 30s and looking to quit his job in the next few years, all before turning 40.

1fox2x2,My coworker told my boss that I’m not doing enough. Advice please! ,"I could really use some advice on this situation.

I (22F) work at a doctor's office as a front desk receptionist, handling checkout duties, phone calls, voicemails, letter writing, etc.. and managing some medication. My coworker (74F) works in the check-in position, which involves checking in patients, handling insurance, answering calls, and checking voicemails (which has recently fallen on me).

Recently, she asked to switch schedules so she could go on later morning walks, which I was fine with. However, she then informed me we’d be switching positions too, and I’d take over insurance duties. This wasn’t discussed with me and seemed unfair, as it would add significantly more work to my plate. I spoke with my boss, who had me list my responsibilities, and ultimately, we only switched schedules, not positions.

Now, here’s where the problem starts. Over the past couple of days, I’ve noticed my coworker watching me throughout the day, seemingly to monitor my work. She stares at me when the phone rings, expecting me to answer even when I’m already busy. I had multiple calls on hold at once today while she was doing very little to help. Despite this, I’ve stayed quiet to avoid creating tension.

After work, another coworker texted me, saying my coworker had been complaining about me to our boss, making comments about how I wasn’t doing enough. This bothers me because I’m working hard. We typically split the front desk work equally, but I also manage medication, answer most calls, and handle voicemails, which she has neglected.

This coworker has a history of causing issues with everyone, and while she improved for a bit after almost getting fired recently, she’s now back to her old ways. I’ve asked my boss about my performance before, and she assured me I’m doing well, so I feel unsure whether to bring this up again or let it play out.

1fox2o7,Is a job/money worth your happiness? (UK),"Hi all, sorry if this has been posted a lot as I presume it has, I’ve been prolonging it but I honestly can’t take how this job is making me feel any longer. 

I started working here in April of 2023. I was hired through an agency for £12/hr, increased to 12.62 after 3 months of employment. I didn’t mind the job at first, it’s 12 hour shifts, 6am-6pm x2, then 6pm-6am x2, after finishing at 6am on the second nigntshify you got the remainder of said day off and also the following day, before the cycle starts again. It does sound tiring, well, it is, but we only work 146 shifts a year. Sounds great of course, and the time off is something I really don’t mind. For example, we will work for 3 lots or 4 lots of the 4 shifts (12/16 a month) then have a week or so off at the end of each month, and also we get around 4/5 weeks off multiple times through the year, so it does have its perks. 

I was made permanent in September of the same year, with a gross salary of £35,680 before tax, coming out with around £2,360 monthly. I was chuffed to bits, almost 1000 higher monthly than any job I’ve been at before. So anyways fast forward a few months, and I get moved departments in work by the managers. Exact same money, but I barely even get a break doing this job now, where before I would 110% get my guaranteed 3x30 min breaks a shift. All shift is spent constsntly back and forth to the forklift, loading conveyors with bails of paper/fibre glass/wool, cutting the metal banding straps with bolt cutters, sending them down the conveyor, filling up starch hoppers with a crane lift, over and over, to ensure the line keeps running. If you get ahead of your work you will get a good 10/15 minutes before repeating again, that is if nothing goes wrong, and the machinery in that workplace is so dated and fucked, they fix one thing and it’s almost as if it has a domino effect around the entire place. 

It’s just getting me down lately, the hours, the shitty job, but I keep telling myself I won’t be able to get a job (without any specific higher qualifications) for the same kind of money. But even then, I would honeslty debate a couple hundred a month loss to find something more convenient in terms of working hours, I have a 3 year old daughter and as much as we can do stuff together when I have my time off, it’s almost like I can never be bothered as the hours are just wearing me down. 

What is the current minimum wage in the UK please if anyone could share? I’ve seen a few posts/comments of people saying it is around £11.44/hr, a dramatic pay cut from where I am now but I feel like my life is being ran by this job.

My India manager informed me of this and seemed to indicate that my promotion this year doesn't seem like a probability due to this.

I am due to have a call with my onshore manager soon. I want to strategize how shall I salvage the situation and get right by my onshore manager.

All, please help and guide. I need this promotion as I am under a lot of financial duress.

1fows91,My boss got laid off and I don’t know how to talk to my new manager about my mental health. ,"My company just had a restructure and my boss was let go effectively immediately, to his and my surprise. My role will be expanding, but right now everything is still all over the place and likely will be for a while as new roles are being filled and new responsibilities need to be established.

I’m really sad to see my boss go for many reasons. I worked very closely with him for the last two years and he was great in providing guidance not just in my career, but support in my personal life. 6 months into the job, my boyfriend passed away. The grief is still strong a year and a half later, and he was very understanding and patient with me. He was able to push me, but also not rush me. There was definitely a period I wasn’t as productive or ambitious as I could’ve been because of the pain and he never weaponized that against me. He always encouraged me to find ways to level up in the role, but also understood when my mental health had to take priority.

I know I have to step up in the next month or so and push myself in ways I haven’t before as the restructure takes place. In addition to the heightened workload given he was let go with no transition period, I will be having conversations with his boss and others to establish what my new role would be.

I know right now isn’t the right time, but I’m wondering when/how I should bring up my mental health issues. Given the events happened in real time with former boss, he was able to have a greater understanding of the situation and how it impacted my overall mental health (depression, anxiety, PTSD). I don’t know how my new team would react and how to even bring it up, especially when right now I’m trying to prove my competency. I had an increased WFH accommodation form I already sent to HR and he was going to approve, but I now told them to hold off sending it to anyone as I want to get to know them first. Any advice on how to approach this topic would be appreciated.

1fowggx,"Help me decide on joining trade school, are they worth it? ","Hello all I'm 21M, Im in india.

I joined mechanical engineering course after my high-school in which i wasnt able to do well, I didn't pass many exams and have a lot of backlogs pending it's been 3 months after finishing my course and honestly I don't see myself completing this anytime, I'm bad in academics honestly not interested at all in the subjects and I want to quit, I am good in practicals and am very passionate about cars and motorcycles and want to become an automotive technician, but here in india the pay is very poor and there is no respect in this field here it's seen as lower class job.
My dad wants me to somehow clear my backlogs and go for MBA or Mtech, which honestly I just can't and dont want to, some people like me don't really want to work in a big company behind a computer labelled as a manager/ ceo in a AC room, I want to get my hand dirty and work.

I have found via youtube and all that abroad especially in USA, GERMANY and UK there is a great car culture and many automotive garages and the pay is reasonably good. So I researched a bit and found trade schools which specialises you in that particular field and I can land on a job.

But there were some reviews where some said trade schools are a scam.

Plz help me, as I want to know if I could apply for trade schools and get a job in USA.

My parents kind of forced me into engineering, I didn't have much options they gave me 2 options either medical or engineering out of which I took mechanical as I liked cars, but then realised it was not the one I thought it would have been, I don't think it's even worth for me to go study for MBA or MTech as I know I'll fail in them again and just am not interested in it. But my parents are very manipulative and pressuring me to reconsider.
They say such jobs like auto technician/electrition/plumbing are poor jobs and thats not our family do.

I'm 21 man plz let me do what I want.
It's okay I'll do some labour intensive jobs yes they pay will be far lower than what CEO/ manager in a company earns but man do I love getting my hands dirty.

1fowfl2,HR has been telling people misleading things about me… ,"Hi, 

I work at a medium company. We have a small HR team. One of the coordinators is very messy and known to gossip. A couple of months ago, a new person came in and eventually, her and I became very close. She then confided in me that the HR coordinator on her FIRST day of work gave her a negative run down of the team. 

For example, she told her that our manager is weak and insecure. She then told her that I was a negative person and that I had been in trouble with the company countless times but thing is… I never have?😭 never once had I been called in HR. I’m so confused why she told her that. I’ve been with the company almost 2 years and got a promotion last month. So it doesn’t add up. 

She also told my co worker that my own manager doesn’t like me much and tbh, that one stung. Mainly because my manager has always treated me with respect and understanding. Just crazy because I never really talked to that HR person much only in passing or surface level? One time, work was slow and I went downstairs to relax and the HR person also went down to relax and then started telling me about who had weak annual reviews and also how much co workers were getting paid (I never asked, she overshares a lot) I was a bit uncomfortable. 

My co worker also shared that HR person brags about calling my own manager for over an hour about me once (I’m a designer and our print issue at that time was hectic) I get it’s normal to vent about work but idk why she shared that :/ again, I’m a top performer here and always receive praise from c suite. 

I am moving soon and will be getting a new job (new state). I was wondering if I should bring this incident up to the higher ups on my exit interview? We’re a medium company but I still meet with them occasionally so it’s not uncalled for to speak to them. I’m not sure if I should let this go or how should I go about it? I’m afraid it’ll hurt my manager (who apparently hates me but is strangely so kind to me). But same time, I’m just so mad how HR has portrayed me and honestly, I want her fired.

The years prior, and my previous jobs I worked as a kids English teacher and nanny, since I had the skills and opportunity. I have never worked or had an internship in a corporate environment. 

Currently I’m struggling finding an internship in any Business related field because of my previous jobs and probably lack of skills/ courses. I also don’t know which path to follow, I’m 2 years into my major and I feel like I learned basically nothing. My university is not the best too unfortunately, it lacks financial resources and was recently on strike for 3 months.

I never saw him doing this to anyone else.

So I do it as a FYI card, which is to be deleted after explaining to the team, which is common for small side tasks. 

But instead of the fix, he hang over on that the card is FYI, and make up a new rule about not deleting an FYI card, nor putting it into In Progress status, even though I am working on it.

1foro81,Bachelor's in CS and MBA?,"I need some guidance.

I am about to finish my bachelor's in CS with a minor in applied math, but I realized I don't really like coding/computer science that much. I am capable of understanding the concepts and l am pretty okay at coding. I don't see myself ever being happy as a software engineer. I can't see myself looking at code all day, I would be miserable. I want to like what I do and be great at my job. I see other CS students around me that seem to love CS and are amazing coders, I've never felt like that, but I know that's how I want to feel about my career. This has made me consider getting my MBA.

I find the business side of the tech industry to be way more interesting. Something like tech sales, product management, or anything that requires you to be an extrovert. I consider myself a people person and I love communicating with people. For the past 6 years, I have ran a small restaurant business with my father. I feel that my natural strengths are more useful in a business environment. I have ADHD and sometimes coding feels unnatural. For the entirety of my major, it's felt like I am swimming against the current or cutting against the grain. The only thing that really helps is my medication, which I initially started because the CS course work requires you to be sitting at a desk for hours. I eventually want to get off medication because I feel that is suppresses who I really am.

I am not too sure what to do now. I haven't been able to get an internship, so my resume isn't that great. I could graduate with just my bachelor's, grind interview prep, get a software engineering job, and then hate my job until I can find one that is a better fit for how my brain works.

Also, if the situation ends up being that you get started on the project but it becomes really unmanageable like expected, how should I deal with it then. Would there be any way out? I’m worried that there may be no way out once I start, but something uncertain and unfavorable happens.

In the last meeting I had with my team my boss said she wasn’t expecting much from me other than to listen and I kind of got ahead of myself, so in this one I took a bit of a step back, but that ended up feeling wrong. Instead it felt like I was too quiet and not contributing much. 

I’m really in my head, doubting myself. Something that makes this more complicated is that I’m the only person in my role on my team, so I kind of feel as if I don’t really have anyone to model myself after or see doing what I’m doing successfully. I’m a bit of a pioneer, and while it’d exciting, it’s also at times scary and leaves me with a lot of doubt that I’m not “doing it right”

I kind of feel like I don’t fully understand my role and what comes next in the process. My boss even said to me that she’s still figuring out my role, and that kind of leaves me feeling lost too. If she’s figuring it out then I don’t want to overstep. But also if she doesn’t have it figured out how am I supposed to have it figured out? I can’t tell if she’s waiting to see what my strengths are and how they define my role or what.

I'm currently in an LNA (CNA) program and I'll be working at the hospital while going to school to become a Nurse. While working a shift i met a nurse that came in for her last day of work at the hospital as she's recently just began her new career as an Air Force pilot and to cut it short it seriously inspired me. I was in awe and she was living a dream of mine I never thought could even happen. 

I haven't even begone Nursing School let alone my prerequisites and here I am thinking about adding becoming a pilot to that list. It doesn't have to be military, I seriously don't mind working for airlines. Either is good.

1foqhj9,Bringing Job Offers to my boss,"I (24M) have been with my company for over 2 years now. Generally speaking I enjoy the position. It’s hybrid/remote and offers a large amount of PTO which is very nice for someone my age. However, one of the few issues I do have is the pay. 

Because of this, I’ve done a fair bit of applying and have consistently received offers 6-11K higher than what I am currently making. So far I haven’t brought any of these to my boss and have turned them down because usually the new companies are full time in person and a pretty far drive from where I live. This leaves me stuck in a tough spot of wanting to make more money, and knowing what other companies can offer, while simultaneously enjoying my current work life structure. Is there any way I could bring this up to my boss in a good way?

1foq8gs,How to ask for a future promised promotion in writing? ,"I'm in negotiations to be rehired at a non-profit. During talks with my former boss over the past few months, he said I would rejoin the org as a manager, which would be a higher position than the one I had when I left. 

The org is dependent on an external grant which they receive annually but is delayed right now. They fully expect to receive it soon but don't yet have it. 

My boss's boss now decided that I can't be a manager until they receive funding, so they're offering to rehire me under my previous job title, saying I can be promoted to manager once they receive funding. (Salary is a separate issue and not what I'm asking for help with here.)

I really want to just quit even though I know it’s a terrible idea,"28M - I’ve been at this job almost 5 years, but during the past year or so things have gotten more frantic than they were before, still in the same position as I’ve been in, it’s not like I got promoted or anything. The workload and expectations have just increased to what I’d argue is unreasonable, but maybe I’m just inefficient.

I’m stressing very often the past few months, even outside work hours . My blood pressure is up, which is scary to me because my father had a pretty bad heart attack at 50 which as I understand was largely stress induced. He survived but his heart is just not as strong as it used to be. I’ve been exercising a lot and now starting to eat healthier but the stress seems to negate those positives.

The tough job market right now is the main thing deterring me from quitting and I’d probably only make it harder for myself later on. I just don’t have energy during my time off right now to apply for other jobs and want to do things that put my mind at ease. I feel like I need a big mental reset.

1fonpr1, How do I break into this growing banking and nuclear intersection? ,"As you may have seen in recent news, some of the world’s largest banks have pledged support for nuclear power, following major moves like Microsoft’s deal to use the Three Mile Island Nuclear Plant for power. Among the financial institutions stepping up are big names like Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, Ares Management, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Brookfield, Citi, Credit Agricole CIB, Goldman Sachs, Guggenheim Securities, Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co., Segra Capital, and Societe Generale.

Now, I’m currently based in England, working for an investment firm in Canary Wharf as a Client Account Coordinator and Client Operations Associate (basically a project manager for on boarding new clients), though I am an American citizen. I also have an MSc in Medical Biotechnology and Business Management from a British University. Unfortunately, I never had the math skills for a career in engineering, so I went down the biological sciences route instead. My dissertation was even on Radiation Hormesis, which shows my long-standing interest in nuclear power.

I'm working in an invstment firm purely because I needed a Visa and Money, I have 0 interest in finance and I have no long term goals of staying in finance, however, with these news I am now excited about using my experience in finance to transition into the nuclear industry, especially now that there’s momentum building around it.

I’m hoping to get advice on how to make that pivot. Should I focus on nuclear financing, work directly with energy companies, or consider roles within government/regulatory bodies that deal with nuclear projects? Or is there a completely different path I haven’t considered that could combine my background in finance and my passion for nuclear energy?

I would appreciate any insights or suggestions from anyone who has made a similar transition or has experience in the nuclear sector!

1folxoh,Fell into engineering and failing at it,"TL;DR - I have almost 10 years of electrical ""design"" experience with no degree, who is failing every project at their company. No idea where to go from here.   
  
I fell into engineering by attending a career center in high school and learning AutoCAD. Then I had a couple internships doing civil Cad work but relocated to be closer to my wife (then gf). I originally applied in the mechanical space but they said I would be a better fit for electrical drafting/designing.

From that point on in my career, I learned MicroStation (forgot Autocad) and solely focused on drafting 2D/3D modeling in T&D. I was about to transition into a PM role when I got recruited for a larger company to almost double my pay for designer work. 

I took the pay raise, but it was evidently clear, the two companies had different expectations on their ""designer"" title. Years later, I have a mortgage, a family, and no degree currently failing my role. I wasn't trained properly, I hadn't had enough time to learn the ""whys"" or its just not coming together in my head. 

I am stuck in a situation where I make too much to leave freely, but I am failing on every project, and its only a matter of time that I'll be terminated. I don't have a degree, I am limited to MicroStation and I cant handle the humiliation much more. I don't enjoy what I do, but I cant make an industry change without losing 20k+ salary that I cant afford to lose.

1folddq,Need Advice on Choosing Between Two Job Offers with Very Different Paths,"Hey everyone, I’m currently in a tough spot trying to decide between two job offers, and I could really use some outside perspective. For context, I live in Florida and work as a roofing salesman, earning around $75k per year, commission-only. I’ve recently received two new job offers and each has very different pros and cons. Here’s the breakdown:

Offer 1: Personal Banker

	•	Pay: $21.7 per hour + up to $2,500/month in commission
	•	Long-term Potential: If I stick with it, I could move up to branch manager or loan officer roles, which pay over $100k annually.
	•	My Concern: The pay is lower than what I currently make, and while I’d be okay living on it, things will be tight financially. The big upside is that this seems like a real career path, with growth and stability.

Offer 2: Sales Representative (Flooring)

	•	Pay: $60k base salary + 20% commission on total gross profit
	•	Immediate Comfort: The base salary gives me a much better cushion, and with commissions, I could make more than what I do now.
	•	My Concern: There doesn’t seem to be much room for advancement beyond a managerial position. It’s more of a lateral move in terms of career growth, and I’m not sure I want to stay in sales forever.

Let me start by this : 
1- I have FOMO(fear of missing out), and I’m learning to say no to things 
2- I’m 25 years old ,and have been in this company since 3 years, it was my first job after college
3-my salary adjustment was delayed since 
oct 2023, I got only 15% at oct 2023
4- the hard rule is bring an offer and you get what you want.
So giving that it was devastating been told you will get your adjustment next month over and over, while my colleague got 42% because he got an offer in 2023,although I do all the work.

I want to experience working in a consulting company(since my avg +10hours already , with no compensation).
I’m the most senior and my boss told me I should prove my self to be a manager at the  beginning of next year(he is a nice guy 
 and depends on me but still I don’t get paid enough, and find it hard to discuss with him )
Working with dumb teammates and tolerating being the smartest person in the room with no one to discuss with is hard.

I fear going out and miss a learning opportunity.

1fokikp,I have an amazing job opportunity that may be ruined due to getting fired from my previous job and don't know how to handle it.,"First off, I apologize for the wall of text here and if this isn't the place to post this.

I work in an industry that leaves very little room for upward career advancement. I found a job posting for a position that feels like an amazing opportunity for me- I like the company and the position is at least a couple steps up from what I'm used to. I've had two interviews so far and was told they feel great about moving forward with me. I have another one tomorrow that I'm getting very nervous about.

I was fired from my previous job for a harassment claim made against me. It is the first instance of anything like this ever being levied against me. I won't lie to you and say I'm innocent. I fucked up and let my anger get the best of me but I do believe the story HR was told may not be entirely true. I understand they should protect victims in harassment cases but even so they refused to say anything specific about my behavior that justified my termination beyond ""harassment violates company policy"". I should stress it is harassment and not sexual harassment.

For context on what I believe is the reason for my termination, I developed a completely consensual, brief sexual relationship with a co-worker who I later found out had been cheating on her boyfriend with me. I had no idea about him. I saw pictures of him on her phone and she told me he was her uncle who had recently passed away. About a month before being fired, she told me she wants to just be friends which I understood. I've been in that position before so I told her I'd need some time to get over her before we can continue as friends. Luckily we worked in different departments so it was pretty easy to avoid her, which caused her to text me to call me a bitch for ignoring her. A couple weeks after that, I put everything together and asked her to talk after work one day. I told her I know about her boyfriend and how it made me feel to be lied to. She was cold and dismissive and took the opportunity to further gaslight me about the whole thing, so I walked away crying. I texted her within a few hours of that and called her pathetic for being so two-faced. Within a week of that, I was called to HR for my termination.

So anyway, I don't know how to handle this if it comes up in tomorrow's interview. They asked in my first interview why I'm seeking work with them which I was able to answer honestly without addressing my termination. However, I'm worried it will come up tomorrow and the word 'harassment' will completely ruin my chance at landing this position. I don't know what to do.

I'd appreciate any feedback on my situation, even if it's a hard dose of reality I won't like reading. Thank you all.",Easy_Savings_8660,1,0.6700000166893005,18,1727204758,2024-09-24 19:05:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fokikp/i_have_an_amazing_job_opportunity_that_may_be/,9,2024

1fokcgh,Proper Etiquette for LOR?,"So my whole time in graduate school, I’ve also been working full time as an environmental specialist/chemist at a public health lab, responsible for analysis of insecticides in urine and water as well as analysis of cannabinoids in medical cannabis products among other things. 

I’m about to graduate with my PhD in Human Toxicology, and I am seeking out a position as a visiting scientist in a prestigious government lab. The position requires 2 recommendations. One is obviously going to be my PhD studies advisor.

The people that know the most about how I do with the analytical chemistry skills I’ll need for  this position are probably those that I work with now at my specialist job. 

Is it unacceptable to ask my current boss at work (not school) to write a recommendation for me? It’s important that it clearly outlines my analytical skills and problem solving abilities and I think my current boss would be able to speak to that. But is that rude? I think everyone at my work fully anticipates I’ll leave after I graduate anyway. 

I did have a contract analytical chemist position before this, so I could ask my boss from there. But I wasn’t there very long and I don’t think it’d be as good of a letter (although I know my old boss had nothing against me, he wanted me to stay after my contract).

1fojuh8,"26, and feel like I have no idea where to go after self employment","I’ve been self employed since 19. Was a full time content creator who had some highs (a $5k month once or twice), and even saved up to $60k before spending most it moving place to place living on my own (I’ve moved many times).

A few years later I became a video editor as it seemed more fitting; I actually like to live a private life, and editing gave me the chance to transmute my love for media; I love watching artistic film & have a diverse music taste. This seemed decent, & I even regrew my savings reliving w/ family…before moving out the state and running into similar issues as before.

You see…I’ve been at war w/ myself with the whole self employed thing for so long. While I love some aspects (the freedom - I traveled extensively to places like Japan solo for ex). I absolutely hate the business side. And the turbulent nature. At a current salary of almost $40k untaxed, I’ve had so many inconsistent months where a client or 2 might not send work, and although there are many ways to promote your work I’m simply the type to prefer cold approaches; I’ve sent 200 emails and have only gotten 3 clients since. I don’t know if I like all the pressure being on me to make this work, especially when I’ve been at it so long.

I’ve done an endless amount of self reflection and just don’t think I want the self employed thing bad enough. I don’t want to post Reels & tik toks. It’s made me wonder about other career paths, but after multiple bouts attempting diff college majors over the years, along with asking many people what they do…I just don’t know what else I’d gravitate to. Tried Tech cause that’s the popular thing a lot of people seem to be trying now but it just didn’t feel like me when I tried studying those certifications. 
It stresses me bad how much I make, as I want to provide for my future family one day.

I’m planning on traveling the world next year as not only a last “hurrah”, but in hopes of learning  more/ getting inspiration for what my career could be. I’m excited, but even then I sometimes feel bad I’m not getting closer to a 100k salary as my peers might be with age.

Despite everything I said I’ve become a pretty positive person these days and tend to think glass half full than empty…I just still have my bad days which seems to come with the nature of who I am (an anxious person), and the “job” I do.  
I absolutely love the thrill of traveling, love talking to new people more than most. I love movies & music as said before, and I enjoy a deep conversation - I’m big on mental health.

1fojkh8,Starting a new job and my manager is not responding regarding my start date,"Hi everyone, new to this sub, so sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this question, but I'm really stressed and need some advice. I've just graduated this summer, and like most graduates, I spent most of my summer applying for jobs. I got an interview for a non-clinical role in a hospital, and a day after I had it, I got told I got the job. I couldn't believe it. The role involves sensitive information, so along with the usual checks, it took a month for me to be offered the contract of employment, and HR asked me to select a start date from a list of options. I chose to start in the beginning of November, as the role is in a different city from where I am from and I need to sort out accommodation. My manager sent an email asking when I plan on starting on the same day. After discussing with my family, I decided to select the aforesaid option to provide me with some time to find and settle into my new home and city. 

After emailing my manager confirming my start, I received an email back outlined below: ""Have you now confirmed this as your start date? We would be keen to get you started before this date if at all possible and would aim to facilitate this if HR induction date was proving the main challenge.

Please let me know whether starting earlier than November 4th is a realistic possibility.

If easier to have a call, I would be more than happy to do this."". 

To this I replied (excluding email formalities): ""I chose 4/11/24 as my start date as I am still in the process of sorting out accommodation. However, if necessary, I should be able to start on the earlier trust induction option. Please let me know if that's okay with you, and I will request HR to move up the date."" 

I didn't get a response for over a day, so I sent a follow-up email: ""Further to my previous email, I’m more than happy to discuss other potential start dates or any other details over a call if that would be easier. Please feel free to let me know a convenient time for you to reach out."" 

It has now been two whole day following the second email (excluding weekend) and I have not received a reply. Did I say something wrong or come across as rude or inflexible? was looking forward to starting soon, and now I feel like my higher-ups don't like me even before I've started.

1foigtx,Looking at quiting my job but I have guilt ,"I have been at my company for a little over 4 years now, which is a health insurance company. I started during the pandemic as a customer service representative and moved to utilization management. Customer service was taking a mental toll on me. Imagine being yelled at for 8 hours for basically the same thing but just the caller changes. I moved to utilization management 1.5 years into being at the company. It was a lateral transfer so I didn't move up and my pay didn't change. But I had a bit more freedom and it helped not being on the phone all day. I barely make any calls and don't really talk to members, it's mostly providers. However, after being in utilization and for more than 2 years, I have not been able to move up or to another department. I keep getting rejected for internal positions. I hate logging into work everyday. I was crying and dreading doing more work for this company. I don't even care about reviewing services anymore. I want to just approve every single request that comes my way. I can't because I would get in major trouble but I just do not care anymore. What hit me the most was at our last monthly team meeting my name was on a slide as saying I was with the company for 4 years along with three other people who were there for almost a decade. A decade doing entry level work. I just can't be there for that long but I need out ASAP. I also asked my supervisor for support for a management program I signed up for, and she didn't do anything so I missed out. I feel like I am being held back because I am great at my job. My productivity is over the required number of 10 requests per hour, and my audits are always 100%.

I have a BA in Psychology and a dual MBA in Human Resources and Strategic Management, so the management program would have been perfect for me. I am also in school for a Master of Science in Cybersecurity which I am planning on finishing sometime in the next few months but my mental health is terrible at the moment that I have to put a pause on it.  

I really love my company because of the benefits (144 hours of vacation every year, plus 120 hours of sick time). We had other benefits but they were taken away (such as Internet reimbursement since we all became remote; the company sold off all real estate, so it was permanent). I just feel like this is the devil you know. I can't know if the environment would be better somewhere else, but I also do not have anything else lined up. I don't have the energy to do anything after work because it's so mentally draining. I just want to sleep. 

So how do I make myself make the decision to quit and get another job? I have a savings which I planned on using to move abroad, but that may have to wait. Though I want to move right now. I also live with family, so my costs are basically non-existent. I don't want to use my savings but I need to get out of here (the job). 

Suggestions are appreciated on what I should do and suggestions for career paths would be appreciated as well. I was planning on starting a consulting position with a classmate since they have a lot of experience with IT and cybersecurity. I do not have as much experience so I'd do less technical stuff (at least for the time being but he would teach me things hands-on). I am just anxious about it because I hate failure.

I am the lead teacher in the Two’s room, which is ages 1-2. This is my second job at a Preschool and the reason why I always settle for this type of job is because I am good at it, but I have been starting to hate it more and more every SINGLE day. 

The office puts as many kids as they can in the classroom. So imagine 20 1-2yr olds running around, screaming, crying, etc. It is IMPOSSIBLE to get any learning done. We still do the best we can, but some days are extremely difficult and worse than others. I have kids that scream and cry at the top of their lungs for the entire day and I have been starting to catch myself dazing off into space because when you hear that nonstop all day, it really starts to take a toll. It is not fun for me, and I have been feeling stuck for a year now and have been scrolling through Linkedin and Indeed the past week.

The pay makes me hate it even more. We deal with so much and the pay is TERRIBLE. I am so unhappy and am trying to make a change, I just don’t know what to go with or start. Childcare workers do not get enough credit, along with pay. I live in NJ, so the living here is pretty expensive. Luckily, I live with my boyfriend and we split the rent, but I can’t even give him the full amount because that’s my entire paycheck, lol. 

I am very aware that I am in control of this situation and can change my life, it just is taking a bit of time. I am a good worker. I show up on time, I do what I have to do, I am a very good speaker and I am quick to learn new things. I want to get out of here FAST. I think what makes it worse is the office. They don’t care about us and make it obvious. I cannot wait to leave and give my two weeks. On top of that, they put assistants in my room who have no clue or sense in the world. They will hire anyone off the street and that is also what makes it worse. They are just that desperate because no one wants to work here, especially with a low pay for all the work you have to do.

1fogw0l,How to rebuild my business after a stroke?,"Sorry if this is rambly, it's all still pretty new.

I (31m) suffered a stroke three weeks ago. I own my own IT contracting business and was working 5 corporate contracts and contracted with a few local businesses as well in a MSP capacity. 

The stroke has left my brain foggy and me very fatigued as well as affecting my visual processing. The business relied on me being too many places at once and in the span of three weeks all of the corporate contracts are gone but one and I have my 2 easiest local contracts remaining. My two employees have been let go. My landlord is letting me exit the lease on my office early at no penalty.

For the next year or so I will be pausing all investments and just working what I currently have. I should bring in roughly 40k a year during this time working two days a week, enough to cover my personal expenses without hitting savings, so I can focus on my recovery. I have decent savings but my company was only making a good profit for the last year so I don't have an endless pool of capital.

My question is, once I've spent a year recovering, what should I do? I've gone from making 130k last year with a growing business to a third of that at an easy but dead end contract. Part of me wonders if I should look for a sys admin or CTO job at a smaller company, but it would be a drastic change.

I've also considered starting my business back up once I'm more recovered, but I'm unsure if I'll have 60-80 hour weeks in me ever again, and I need to build in more corporate redundancy so the company doesn't go belly up if I have a health issue again. 

My question is this, what would you be looking at doing if you had to medically take a year or so at limited work for recovery? How would you restart?",cuddly_degenerate,1,1.0,3,1727195791,2024-09-24 16:36:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fogw0l/how_to_rebuild_my_business_after_a_stroke/,9,2024
1fognhs,Caught Between Dreams and Expectations: Is This the End?,"
I have always been a bright student, deeply appreciated by my family and loved by everyone around me. As the ideal son and student, I consistently maintained excellent academic performance, achieving first rank throughout school, scoring 95% in my matriculation and 92% in F.Sc. Pre-Medical. 

From the beginning of my F.Sc., I felt the pressure of expectations. Everyone around me, instilled in me the belief that as a good student, I was destined to become a doctor. It was ingrained in my mind that those who secured admission in medical college were the only ones who achieved true success. By the end of my 10th grade, I was convinced that, as a top student, nothing could stop me from becoming a doctor.

However, once I entered college, reality set in. I realized that this path was not my passion; it was a dream crafted by the expectations of others. As I began to explore my interests, I recognized that I lacked the qualities necessary to become a doctor. It became increasingly clear to me that I needed to seek other options. After a lot of introspection, I made the difficult decision to abandon the idea of pursuing a medical career.

Despite scoring 92% in F.Sc., my heart was not in biology or any medical field. I began to face immense pressure from my family, especially my father, who felt that my decision was an insult. He insisted that if I didn’t prepare for the MDCAT, he would withdraw financial support for my education. I tried to convince them of my aspirations, but being dependent on them made it challenging.

I reluctantly began preparing for the MDCAT, but those four months were the most distressing of my life. I found myself crying every night, overwhelmed by the feeling that I was destroying my future by adhering to someone else's dreams. I had always been a dedicated student, studying tirelessly on my own, but during this phase, I struggled to focus. My MDCAT score of 176 wasn’t bad, but my aggregate was only around 90 , which did not meet the required standards for a government MBBS college.

When I shared the news with my parents, the reaction was devastating. My father accused me of sabotaging my future, publicly humiliating me in front of family members and expressing his disappointment. He stated that I had wasted his money and time, labeling me as a failure. He called me “ NAFARMAN “ and said that I scored bad intentionally. His obsession with the title of “doctor” led him to suggest alternative paths like D-Pharmacy or DVM, but I firmly refused.

I explained to him that I wanted to pursue computer science, a field I feel passionate about. I told him about my aspiration to study at LUMS and that I was aware of the challenges, but I believed I could work hard to get there. Despite our decent financial situation—owning around 31 Acre  land, a dairy farm, and rental shops , a car , a house worth 4-5 crores , he insisted that financial aid was my only option for LUMS. 

Feeling undeserving of financial aid, I expressed my willingness to pay my own fees, but my father flatly refused, stating that I was a humiliation to him and that he preferred to invest in my younger brothers, who he believed would fulfill his dreams of becoming doctors.

Now, I face an uncertain future. My father has made it clear that he won’t support my education at LUMS even at NUST, or FAST, insisting that I should enroll at COMSATS Vehari if I want to do CS , a university I believe is beneath my potential. I fear that if I take out loans for my bachelor's degree, I will struggle to manage my master's education later on.

I’m at a crossroads, feeling lost and hopeless. Should I give up on my dreams altogether? I find myself contemplating the darkest thoughts, feeling as though I am trapped in a life I never chose. How do I move forward when my aspirations clash with my family’s expectations?

1fof89x,Struggling with Career Dilemma: sales vs programming,"A little background: I worked as a Java dev for about a year after I graduated. Eventually, I made a big switch and started working as a sales rep for a small company selling construction materials. It’s a small place, fewer than 15 employees, and without any HR. While some colleagues are fine, a few of them are downright rude, which has made the work environment pretty toxic at times.

On top of that, even when I’m hitting great sales numbers, I’m still making less than I did as a Java dev—even on my best months. It’s frustrating to work so hard and still not see the financial reward.

Recently, I’ve been coding again in my spare time and found myself really enjoying React and Next.js. However, the dilemma is that in Central Europe, there’s not much demand for these technologies (practically not existent). Most of the enterprise projects are focused on Java for backend and Angular for frontend.

Here’s where it gets tricky: I’m considering whether I should go back to Java, revise my skills, and pick up something like Kafka or Angular (even though I enjoy it less). But at the same time, I’m worried that if I return to a programming job, I’ll eventually get bored again, especially if I’m stuck working on legacy Java projects that don’t excite me.

So, do I stick with what I enjoy—React/Next.js—even though the demand is lower (not existent)? Or do I prioritize what the job market needs, even if it means potentially dealing with the same burnout and dissatisfaction that led me to switch out of tech in the first place?

Would love to hear your thoughts and advice on this. What would you do in my situation?

Thanks a lot! 🙏",Affectionate-Wing899,2,1.0,2,1727191608,2024-09-24 15:26:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fof89x/struggling_with_career_dilemma_sales_vs/,9,2024
1foekgp,Advice on Pursuing healthcare career as a single mom,"To start, I’m a 29F with a 4 year old daughter in preschool. We live in GA (Atlanta surrounding area) in the US. 

I want to finish school to secure a stable financial future for us both. 

This is my last chance to get it together so I need to be 100% solid on the degrees I get. I can’t afford to get a degree and not use it or end up in a low paying job (“career”) again. 

I’m approaching 30, currently living with family (low rent) so I can get myself financially stable with a career. 

This is temporary as I was given a 5 year deadline (starting this past august) to move out or pay market rent.

I’ve read hundreds of related posts in the last 48 hours and felt compelled to join Reddit and try for more personalized advice. This is my first post.

For the last decade I’ve been working low wage (<$17/hr) restaurant and retail jobs (except one year working as a life and health insurance sales agent, I was trying to improve our lives but can’t afford to work on commission being a single mom, my license is expired since 2023)

I understand I have to start from the bottom and work my way up. I just don’t want to wait until I have a masters before I can get my foot in the door with a decent wage. I’m starting school as a freshman and have to take one class at a time. (Which means it’ll be over a decade before I get the masters, ***torn between MHA, MBA or both***)

I’m hoping to work for the state or VA somehow. My reason is stability for my daughter and job security for myself.

My current plan is to get an associates in health information administration to land a job as a healthcare admin tech, then get a bachelors in business administration to move into an entry management role (I’ll be attending GSU for all of this, they don’t have bachelors available in health admin). Then the MBA/MHA to go from entry to upper management. 

I’m not sure about this plan which is why I’m on Reddit. 

I’ll also be a transfer student, current gpa 2.6 (I tried to go to school at 18 then again at 21, and again at 27. Dropped out for mental and financial reasons, which is why this time I can only take one class at a time). 

I have a possible new (fast casual) restaurant shift supervisor job starting next week (1st shift, 7am-2pm). 
I’ll have before-care set up for my daughter and be off in time to pick her up after school. This time I want to try and work my way up to store manager then district while pursuing my degrees. 

She’ll be 21 by the time I finish my masters and I want to give her a good life before then, our own home and help her fund college. 

I think the MBA would give me flexibility to move between healthcare and restaurant management.

I just know that I want to eventually be in upper management (because it pays)  in healthcare (for job security). I also looked into working for DHS/DHR but I don’t want to box myself in with a degree in social work. 

Aside from a roof over my head, I’m on my own with parenting. So I can’t work nights or weekends. The only reason I’m still hanging on to this restaurant track is because of the 7am-2pm shift. It works with my life right now. And the idea of working my way up into management will be more feasible as my daughter gets older. 

I don’t want to be stuck in the restaurant industry. 

I’m willing and ready to work hard and graduate. Math is not a strong point,  which is why I’m pursuing admin instead of something like accounting. 

I’m hoping to get the right degrees and transfer my management skills from restaurant over to healthcare or related field. 

I plan to work until retirement age and want to eventually move away from the physical demands of the restaurant industry. 

Any advice to help me clarify my education/career path would be immensely appreciated.

1foegbc,I’ve been promoted quickly but now working way out of my league. Any advice?,"So I’ve been at a nyc based PR agency for 3 years now. I understand the type of work is high pressure but I’ve been excelling and have been promoted multiple times out of cycle in my three years here making me a higher level than some of those I started with/ are around my age group.

I think the work is interesting so I think that’s been helping me move up a lot but with this last promotion I feel like I am way out of water in what I’m supposed to be doing. I get a lot more questions I have zero context to and often find myself in a position where I don’t even know what questions to ask to get clarification. I’m leading more junior people now which is fine but it’s been weird being the “boss” to people my own age or older than myself, and I think they feel the same and often don’t take my delegating of tasks as seriously as they do if someone older than me tells them to do something.

I’m young and eager I supposed so maybe I just need to give myself some grace into my new role but I’m so overwhelmed with the new responsibilities I cannot sleep at night. This was not the case a few promotions ago.

Is there any way I can communicate to superiors that I need them to lean in more while I get my footing without making it seem like I’m not up for the challenge? Honestly I really don’t think I am up for the challenge but I don’t know what to do. 

I feel like I’m fumbling around like a fool all day sending out random emails and moving things along that I have no idea what they actually are. I want to do well in my role and be able to feel genuinely confident, which I felt in the past but do not now.

Maybe imposter syndrome? I don’t know. I hate this and hate feeling like I’m the bottle neck or one causing confusion.

1foddgw,What marketing jobs are there that are less stressful and less cutthroat?,"Hi guys, 

I have a bachelor’s degree in marketing and about 3 years of experience working in really fast paced, stressful environments. I tend to draw roles that require a lot of event planning, logistical planning and catering to executive schedules. Lately, I have been finding it hard to get out of bed and go to work. I don’t feel like I was built for this environment where all eyes are on me to make a quick decision. All of my role titles have been “marketing coordinator”. 

I don’t spend a lot of time content writing, campaign managing and working on branding initiatives. Some of my favorite things I’ve done are writing case studies, working on brand commercials and videos and overall increasing brand awareness. 

Instead I get stuck booking travel, booking dinners, registering venues, creating communicative documentation so everyone is on the same page and so on and so forth. I plan a lot of events, gatherings, and am usually the point of contact when things go wrong. I do understand this is necessary from a project management perspective, but it feels like I spend about 95% of my time doing this. 

Am I being unrealistic here in feeling like I keep entering the wrong role for my personality? I am VERY timid, I get nervous quickly, and I am very sensitive. I can take feedback, but I often find myself getting really flustered and overwhelmed. 

Please be honest if you feel like this is just apart of the job, and there is no industry or sector of marketing where I will not experience so much of the issues above. 

I guess I’m just feeling lost at the moment and looking for some guidance/advice. ",Salty-Alternative330,2,1.0,9,1727186857,2024-09-24 14:07:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1foddgw/what_marketing_jobs_are_there_that_are_less/,9,2024

A job I was at 3 years ago, who has had a change of management since I worked there, has refused to give me a reference
I asked him very politely beforehand during this job process and he said he would, before my
employer even sought the references out.

When my employer asked why he said the following:

“I’ll give you the start and finish dates but I won’t give a reference for someone who caused problems”

Now this could cause huge issues for me with this job offer, which is my dream job and I am genuinely baffled and upset.
I never did anything wrong at that job, all of my monthly reviews were good, I was never disciplined, I was not terminated and I don’t understand why he has said that about me.

I think my new prospective employer could see the genuine shock in my face at the meeting today

I’m just wondering if there is anything I can do, he didn’t provide a formal reference (he’s sly and clever, he knows he has no evidence for his claims it seems like he’s trying to drive his foot in the way of my career) so I have no way to bring legal action but I am genuinely so frightened that I’m going to lose my job offer.

1foawqr,Stay or leave?,"Hi all, this is complex but I’ll try to make the story simple. I’ve been working as a development director (fundraising, communications, relationship and project management) and as with many nonprofits it’s a huge struggle due to poor management and leadership. I’m a salaried employee making 58k annually with health insurance (I pay partially for my health and dental/vision) which takes a few hundred from my paycheck so it’s not fully funded.

I have about a decade in this field and decided about a year ago I’m trying to become a biologist or environmental scientist because it would make me happy and give me a better salary/work-lifebalance/retirement. My bachelors is in art history. I’ve been back to school part time now for a year and a half. It’s hard, especially because I also have 4 kids (8 to 18). So life is busy! 

After a semester I asked our ED if I could lower to about 32 hours to keep my benefits and all that but just be working a little less, and be in the office less. She agreed but stopped paying my salary and just paid me for the hours worked as an hourly rate. This rate for my salary translated to about 27.88z

I often take on payroll and other responsibilities when the ED is away and recently when I was running payroll (and dealing with a bunch of emergency situation for the org while she was away) I noticed that the staff person I manage (comms manager) is making $3.75 more than me hourly. 

She is a part time employee making almost $32 hourly and has years less experience than I do and just started at the org. I chose her and hired her and have been supervising her. When my hours went down again this semester (I go back up to 40 to make my salary when I’m not in school) I advocated for her to “take my extra hours” thinking that if I couldn’t be paid for them because of my schedule, she could use the hours, which she wanted. 

Long story short I confronted our EXecutive Director about why I was making almost $4 less hourly than someone I am managing. Also, if she could explain whether I am exempt or not because I wondered why I wouldn’t still earn my salary if I’m working at minimum full time hours and getting my work complete.

She responded that the comms manager negotiated this when she was hired because she didn’t received benefits. So, she gave her a higher rate because the position didn’t include benefits.

I get benefits but am definitely struggling to feed my family. It feels so upsetting to learn I am in meetings with my staff person and they are earning more every minute we meet than I do! 

I feel really undervalued and almost so insulted that I want to quit because I have really bent over backwards for this org in ways not everyone here does. 

I am seeking other positions but they don’t often pay more than 60k. They also would not likely give me the flexibility I have w my employer, so I feel like our ED knows this and is sort of exploiting the fact that they know if I leave I will have a hard time continuing my education so I can get a higher earning career.

I am just wondering what others would do in this situation. How would you respond to your boss? Obviously I shouldn’t say anything to my comms manager… but I feel really hurt and embarrassed.

Here is her response to me questioning the arrangement:

 “Happy to talk more about this but here are some initial answers to your questions.  
Their hourly rate is higher because she only works 20 hours, does not receive health insurance and she also negotiated this rate with me when she was hired.  My understanding is that you are a non-exempt employee as you do not hit the salary requirement to be exempt.  I am happy to talk about a raise... based on merit,  you deserve one!
The flexibility to reduce your hours so you could go to school is not something every employer would do and which could be considered a benefit.  Also even though you are getting your work done in 32 hours,  I would say there are things you are not available for and things that are less prioritized because of your reduced hours. Let's set up a time to talk.  Thanks”

I definitely am in the office more than most staff who don’t go to school. I am absolutely the most reliable person on staff and the person people go to for help. I have been offloading some facility rentals to other staff but otherwise operating at a higher capacity than most coworkers, which the ED frequently acknowledges which is why I’m so upset about the “things that are less prioritized” comment because I am constantly going above and beyond and am honestly just getting burnt out.

Anyway… I have one interview lined up and my resume ready to go. I don’t really want to stop school but maybe I should… 
Is there any way to negotiate and save my situation at work? What would you do? Am I overreacting?

It all just feels really hopeless and exhausting…",it5l8,1,1.0,0,1727179814,2024-09-24 12:10:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1foawqr/stay_or_leave/,9,2024

1foahjf,My job is draining me mentally and physically and I want to quit immediately ,"ve been working my 8-5 job for a little over 2 years now. I can’t remember the last time I woke up and wasn’t filled with existential dread. I’ve become very depressed and anxious all the time. My job is very stressful and is only getting worse. 

I don’t have a job lined up but I’ve applied to several other jobs lately. I have about $13k in savings which would last me 6 months or so. I also resell online and make around $1k a month doing that. I feel like I’m way past my breaking point with my job and like I’m gonna snap at any second and quit. That’s what I want to do at this point. My boyfriend is extremely unsupportive of that. We share a lease but I pay for all my own stuff. I would have quit now if he was ok with it. I don’t know what to do but I can’t work another day in this role. It’s perpetual stress. I also have an auto immune disorder that has been flaring up bad lately because of stress. I can’t take this anymore and need advice. I want to quit but I know it would be very risky at this point in time but so is risking my mental and physical health.

1fo95wk,How can I pick the right engineering major?,"I am a high school student trying to pick out a major for college and, specifically, I'm mostly interested in engineering. The thing is, I have a hard time choosing which one is the most suitable for me. In particular I am torn between electrical, mechanical, civil and chemical engineering, as are many other of my friends with who I have discussed this.

The biggest problem is that I can't figure out exactly what each branch of engineering does. Apart from their basic differences, that is, I want to know over time what the daily life of each engineer includes. Of course, I know there are various different branches but still, the engineering field is relatively complicated to me and to several of my classmates. I feel like I have neither enough information nor a clear image to make a good decision and I don't know where to find it or who to ask.

Also, it's still very early and I'm not sure what direction I want to follow in my professional life, so it's even harder to choose. I'm incredibly interested in physics and math, so electrical and mechanical would seem like a good choice for sure. But in an actual job, the things that such an engineer deals with have nothing to do with high school courses, so how do I know I'|l like it? But also, civil engineering (relatively the most straightforward amongst the others) seems very interesting to me, as does chemical engineering, that, from what I have understood, is mainly employed in industry??

But in general I feel particularly confused and indecisive and as time goes by, my anxiety increases. How can I choose the right major among the aforementioned? How can I know just by my interests in high school courses which profession will suit me best? Where can I find more information about the jobs of engineers and what they actually do in their jobs??

1fo8re3,Done with work after PIP - wanting to resign tomorrow,"I am in the UK and need some advice on how to get garden leave or the best outcome at the end of a PIP.

I have my final outcome meeting tomorrow with HR however I would be entitled to a second PIP as I am over 2 years. I would not be able to pursue the 2nd as this first PIP has destroyed me mentally so I have commited to travelling to see family abroad with no leave left (as I want to be gone) at the end of October.

I have passed 2 years of service at my large organisation.

I want to go into the meeting with HR and see if I can negotiate or leverage myself into garden leave, if I should just resign, or if I would be dismissed with leave if I didn't want to agree to a second PIP.

I had expressed the urge to resign last week but was told to wait until the outcome to see if negotiating for garden leave is possible by my manager (no when previously requested).

Some factors:
- I have had workplace adjustments that were only fully implemented halfway through the PIP.
- I have had been bullied/harassed by a higher up, raised this informally and not yet pursued this as the time commitment and retaliation after I leave would not be worth it.
- My wellbeing has been a point of contention throughout the process that I have raised several times.

Is there anything I can do in this situation? I don't want to deal with another month of this prolonged torture when I would rather be free to focus on finding a new role before travelling to see family.

TLDR:
How can I get garden leave without ruining my references with misconduct?

1fo8ckk,"Going to be super rich, what would you if you were me? (age 26)","Hi everyone, 

My dad is working class-ish (UK), he invested in property and is now a multi-millionaire. He gave me a property to get started in life, which is obviously extremely lucky. It's invested in a property with rent being paid into a tax free ISA in index funds. I don't know if I'll inherit much more, but most likely around £500k-1,000,000 over my lifetime as there'll be a lot of inheritance tax to pay and I have siblings etc. 

My partner is from a ***much*** richer family. They will most likely inherit well in excess of £10m and they are rich enough that they have advisors / managers to help them avoid tax and manage everything, so they really don't need to do anything at all. The simplest way to put it, is that we will probably live off our own incomes, but our families will basically end up paying for where we live, school fees etc, which means the big costs basically disappear, and money we earn ourselves is pure spending money. Pretty rad. 

So, despite most people that I know being pretty close to the average Brit financially, I find myself in a situation where I'm young and basically likely to be in the top 0.1% or whatever it is. 

My wife's family are very hard working, one continues to work even though they don't need to, the other has a vocation that is meaningful (genuinely meaningful, not some fluff). They seem to have figured out how to be very rich and still live a meaningful life, that doesn't unravel itself as so many do with excessive freedom and a lack of reason to do anything. They are not flashy or anything, quite the opposite. To be clear, these people have never needed to work their entire lives, they are not people that have made a lot of money themselves, it's very different. 

HOWEVER - I have always been incredibly driven to build my own business, and have been psychologically gearing myself up for this my whole life.

  
So, my pathetic problem is this: 

I really cannot motivate myself to get a job. All jobs look shit, and in the end I won't need one. However, I also know that I must work, otherwise I will go nuts and my life would unravel. Besides, I do actually need to earn money, as I have no intention of living off anyone else. 

I can see how hard my own father has worked, and there is a futility to it. It's been great for his kids, but he has never stopped working. Yes, he has much more freedom and independence than most, but it's extraordinarily hard to use that freedom constructively - in his case, he continues to work himself to the bone well into his 60's. That's what he's always done, what else would he do now?

I used to find the idea of building a business and then one day buying a nice farmhouse and being able to play loud music etc really appealing - but now, the process of doing that seems like spending all my youth on something that I've already experienced and seen is not really that amazing. 

It's like, I don't think being rich is that great, I just think it sucks to be poor. So, I don't really have much motivation to do anything, as I don't need more money, and I will never be poor.  I am increasingly realising that the world of jobs is almost entirely shit, and that most people only do their job because they have to.

  
**If you were in my situation, what would you do now?** Would you ignore the money and pretend it isn't there, or would you choose to pursue something that doesn't make a lot of money, relying on the very high probability you end up rich anyway?

The issue is, I don't think I would feel self-respect if I didn't make my own money, but at the same time, it seems pointless to spend my life struggling when I just don't need to, particularly when even £2m wouldn't make a huge amount of difference in the end. 

  
One final comment, I think that very rich people appreciate the value of time more than most. It becomes the new currency, because it's a lot more finite and precious. We're all going to be old as fuck soon, and I want to be wise about how I live this life.

1fo5n6r,Absolute Dilemma over what I should be doing in my career After graduating as a Mechanical Engineer. Any advices please? (PS: I'm from India),"I'm a May 2024 Mechanical Engineering graduate from VTU, navigating a significant career dilemma. Throughout my school years, I was a bright student, excelling in mathematics and academics without much effort. However, during 9th grade, I became distracted by typical teenage pursuits, which negatively impacted my focus and grades. Around this time, I developed a strong passion for cricket, which led me to prioritize sports over studies.

In high school, I studied PCMB due to family pressure, but I disliked it. My focus on cricket continued during my PU days, ultimately resulting in a modest 68% in my 12th-grade exams. After high school, I initially considered switching to commerce to pursue a BBA and eventually an MBA, but I ended up in Mechanical Engineering instead. By this point, my interest in academics had waned significantly, leading to three backlogs in my first year.

The struggle to keep up with my studies was exhausting. While I gradually cleared my backlogs, the experience was challenging, and my overall disinterest in engineering persisted. A turning point came when I faced disappointment in cricket; I was repeatedly put on reserves for the college team, which made me reevaluate my priorities. This heartbreak motivated me to leave cricket behind and commit to my studies.

After hard work, I successfully graduated in May 2024. A month later, I landed a job as a Production Engineer in Bangalore, despite my reservations about the contract nature of the position. Family encouragement played a significant role in my decision to accept this job. However, I soon realized that mechanical engineering is not for me, and I’m starting to feel increasingly dissatisfied with my role.

I initially planned to work for two years and then pursue an MBA through exams like CAT, MAT, or SMAT. However, I am having second thoughts about this path. I’m contemplating quitting my job to study for the CAT while taking valuable courses in areas of interest. My family has suggested a Data Analytics course as a potential career shift, but I’m uncertain about my true interests and direction.

Ultimately, I want to avoid making hasty decisions again, as my previous choices have led to significant challenges. I’m reaching out for guidance on how to navigate this critical juncture in my career, seeking clarity about my interests and the best path forward.

1fo4e2p,"Two Job Offers - Can't Decide, Please Help","Maybe I'm just too close to these decisions that I can't see somthing obvious, but it would nice to hear what other people think.

I (27F) finished my bachelor's degree in Field A four years ago. I worked for two years in Field A, and decided I can't stand it. I'm now currently a student getting a new bachelor's degree in Field B, which is more creatively fulfilling despite the fact it pays less. I currently live with my partner (27M) who is looking for a better job but currently works a low-paying part-time job. Any money I can take home is a net positive.

I'm only about a year from graduating, and I'd like to be able to work alongside getting my degree, especially with the state of the economy. That being said, I need flexibility in order to attend my classes and attend industry events to network with someone for a more permanent position later on. Recently I got two job opportunities in one day and they are Very Different.

Job 1 is a position in Field A, the one I left on purpose to start a new career path. As mentioned, that field pays more, despite the fact that the company is small. Based on the interview, I may be compensated around $30/per hour. Job 1 is intended to be a full-time position, but I cannot work full-time due to school. They are offering me the ability to work part-time, but even working 32 hours per week makes me worry that I won't have enough time to work on my large scale projects for multiple classes. Working part-time also makes me currently ineligible for their benefits. As of writing, I've been scheduled for a 2nd interview and have not received a formal offer yet, but the company is small and the manager is eager to hire someone soon. Because the company is so small, it's hard to find any reviews on glassdoor, and some of the few there are say there 's not much opportunity for growth and there may be office drama sometimes.

Job 2 is a position in Field B, the one I want to work in when I graduate. The position is a mix of sales and practicing what I learned in school. However, this position is entirely sales-based commission, with bonuses available for reaching 60% of monthly goals. Based on reviews on glassdoor, the job appears very hit-or-miss with most people, and also dependent on which branch location you work at. Some people make Very Good money (potentially more than Job 1) doing this while others say they made very little. Job 2 does offer flexibility, which is the main thing holding me back from most of the jobs I've applied for. I can set my own schedule and receive appointments (no cold calling required), and the manager told me they offer benefits after the first 60 days. They also provide a week of non-paid training to understand the job and how to sell to clients. This position is a W-2 form, so I would be providing my own transportion, gas, tolls, phone bill, etc. I have already received an offer from this company.

Both jobs have a similar commute time, and neither of the interviews made me feel suspicious, sketchy, etc. Obviously the solid paycheck at a high rate from Job 1 sounds better off the top, but doing an 8-5 most days of the week is not ideal and may hold me back from graduating within the year. Job 2 offers the flexibility I need to finish school and is actually related to the field I want to work in, but is a high-risk high-reward opportunity. 

Is it even worth choosing between these two? Should I pick one or should I decline both and keep looking?

1fo34pv,Need advice - WIP cases are being taken away from me,"Hi, 
Please advice me as I have no idea how to tackle this situation.

Background - I work for small company of 12 people and 4 of us are part of Team 1 and report to B1. B1 and his right hand man M assigns us cases depending on the work load and our queues. No problem there, they are pretty chill and considerate of the work load one has and only push us for very urgent cases.
Worth mentioning that I am more experienced in the team, (except B1 and M) but I am the most recent hiring and all of us work remotely.
. They will assign me the more complex cases which I am able to handle but they usually take more time since, apart from the individual clients, the cases required involvement and discussions with multiple people like the client's accountants, tax advisors, legal team, etc. Since we all work remotely, all the client meetings and discussions and handled by B1 and I am only invited in the meeting so that I can implement what is being discussed and make changes to the case so it is not like I can push through my way through the case. And this is major roadblock which adds to my time so safe to say that these case take upto 3x times than a regular case which the other team members are allotted. 

Now, if I have 2 of these cases in my queue, B1 and M do not allot me any new cases until one of them moves. Or if there is a sudden influx or urgent cases, I get an easy case alloted that are out of my queue in max 3 days.

The issue here is that for the past 3 months I have started noticing this repeat occurrence where if a case is 80% done and all parties are aligned and the only thing left to do is data correction and submission, the cases are taken away from me and given to another team member with the excuse that I have other cases in my queue where some development has been made and need urgent attention. Now, not only do I have to giveaway all my hardwork away, but also have to debrief the other person and I am also the go-to member for any queries they may have since B1 and M are always otherwise occupied. The point is, this anyways eats into my time during which I could have easily managed to close the case myself.
And the worst part is, we all have targets for the month. I always fall short of them since I have time consuming cases and now on top of that, rhe fruit of my work is being reaped by the other member.

I have gone to B1 and have asked him for an honest review and he always assures me I am the most valuable team member and have impeccable work ethics and overall positive feedback. I have also gone to other bosses and they have also given me a similar feedback. B1 has also assured me that I should not worry about my targets too much as he is aware of the complexity the cases I handle but has refused to lower them accordingly. And when I see cases not moving forwarded, I have gone to M and B1 and have asked for easy non urgent cases to be assigned to me saying I can handle it but they always refuse.

I am not able to make the sense of this situation and have no idea what more can I do here. Changing teams is not possible and frankly, that is not something I want to do either.

Please can someone guide me on what I can do differently to make sure I can stay on my own cases and can also meet the targets?",ID_Earthling,2,1.0,2,1727148108,2024-09-24 03:21:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fo34pv/need_advice_wip_cases_are_being_taken_away_from_me/,9,2024

1fo2sef,Presenting at work for the first time - seeking advice to be confident and do well!,"I am nervous about an upcoming presentation at work. I took a training class with some other people from the company and we are giving presentations on the skills that we learned from the class. It is a corporate setting. I am young and in my first year with the company.

I present after my coworker, who is super talented and obviously smart. Her presentation is top notch and she is great at speaking and explaining things. We worked on a project together, but her part was more in depth than mine, which makes sense since she already had some experience with the skills from the class. This makes me nervous because I don't want to look like a slacker after her presentation. When I listen to her during the practice sessions, I start to doubt my presentation and what I am going to say.

There is a Q&A at the end of each presentation, and I’m worried that I might get questions that I don’t know how to answer, especially if people saved questions from my coworker’s presentation until mine was finished.

I am already a little nervous about presenting in general and presenting to execs. I don’t want to present after her and look like a slacker or look dumb because my project isn’t as good. I presented the project to my manager and team and received good feedback and some changes that I incorporated, so I know it isn’t actually terrible.

I am trying to tell myself that people won’t have high expectations and that I am just presenting about what I did, but I can’t help but compare my project to the others and feel like I’m dumb.

What tips do you have for me for presenting with confidence knowing that the person before me totally knocked it out of the park?",igpay-atinlay-,2,1.0,1,1727146987,2024-09-24 03:03:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fo2sef/presenting_at_work_for_the_first_time_seeking/,9,2024
1fo1tgi,Got an interview for the perfect job but I might have a problem ,I interview tomorrow for a role I would absolutely love however I’m in a pickle right now. I left my job of 10 years 2 weeks ago to take on a completely different type of job due to my previous employer being in a complete free fall and extremely toxic. So I have been with this new employer a week and I got an email to interview for a job I applied for right around the time I left my long time job. Not sure how to handle this. The employer I am interviewing with is a major retailer but one that is a discount retailer but the role is corporate and in my wheelhouse so to speak. I am not even sure if they would see the new employer since I’ve been there a week but if they did an employment check on the role I was in when I applied they would see an end date of a week ago so I am worried about how to approach tomorrow. Can anyone lend me some advice? The company I am interviewing with doesn’t even do drug screens so I am wondering if they even do anything beyond criminal background but I’ve only had a few jobs in the last 20 years so this is a new thing for me.

1fo08pl,"I miss my old job only after 6 months, am I crazy for thinking like this?","I’m 28 years old with a bachelors degree in creative writing and English from SNHU. Back in April I decided to quit my first “big girl” job out of college. I was a legal document/word processor and worked from home. The pay was $18.02 after I left. I genuinely enjoyed the work I did too. However, I rotated weekends/holidays with my team, the raises could have been better, and not a lot of growth opportunity.

I left to work for a hospital system call center. I make appointments and send messages to the offices for the patients/third parties. I get paid $18.72 and the benefits are great, being at a hospital system of course. I don’t work weekends, holidays, and have to work in an office. I got referred by my ex’s aunt who works there.

The thing is…I genuinely miss my old job. I miss working on word formatting, PDF conversions, PowerPoint presentations, proofreading legal documents. Yes I didn’t get paid the best but who is nowadays? And sure there weren’t a lot of growth opportunities but I’m at the point where I’m not into climbing the corporate ladder. I understand that’s how you make more money and whatnot, but honestly, I’m not into climbing it. I feel like my happiness is what matters most. Yes I have to survive in this world and making money helps with that, but I feel like I shouldn’t be feeling drained at my job just because I make a little bit more money per hour. 

Am I silly for thinking like this? If I’m not happy at my job, I feel like I need to take my happiness back and care about that.

1fo03t1,Sales Job Advice ,"
Hi everyone, looking for some advice. I am entering the sales field and have two offers on the table.

The first is HVAC sales with a starting salary of 60k. The company is large with about 10,000 employees. I would be working in the warehouse and rotating through a sales training program before transitioning to an Account Representative position with commission (unknown OTE) after 6-9 months. I would be in office the entire time.

The second is a Tech Sales position, fully remote, with a company size of about 90. The starting salary is 50k with OTE landing at about 75k. They say I would be expected to promote within 18-24 months. 

For the first job, I would need to bring my car and pay for parking (~$400 monthly +gas) although the training program is comprehensive. 

The second has a lower base with higher earning potential and is fully remote. Smaller company and less training.

I would love some advice on which to choose!",Electrical-Common723,2,1.0,0,1727138660,2024-09-24 00:44:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fo03t1/sales_job_advice/,9,2024

I then wrote back and asked some more questions are benefits. I’m trying to justify to myself for leaving my current position for this one, even though the pay isn’t as good as I was hoping.

That was Friday afternoon and it’s Monday evening and I’ve heard crickets.  The offer is set to expire tomorrow 9/24.

1fnzanu,Reminder that education is not as important as experience!!,"Every once in a while I regret studying what I studied in college because of where I am in life (which really isn't even a bad place). So I go to linkedin and search my old classmates from college who studied the same areas as me. Some have gone onto grad school and still haven't gotten a job out of retail or the food industry. College is what you make of it, and if you REALLY DO NOT want to go and are just going to class and getting good grades, please leave. Do something else! Literally anything that lets you learn a skill. Before you take on anything, ask yourself: what skills can I learn? Don't just think of the future trajectory and how much money you could make if you finish. I speaking from personal experience and sort of typing out my thoughts to help myself as well as others. Besides learning to write and think critically, I didn't really learn any hard skills. I mainly went to get out of a bad home situation for a guaranteed 4 years (and there were other routes I did not know of that I do now). I personally feel like there are WAY too many people going to college in the US, and it is a SHAME that it has become a business in this country. It seems like professors will do anything to keep their job. I read an article from my school where a student was convinced by a professor to change her major to Spanish if she wanted to become fluent in Spanish. Really?? Professors I have had personally would tell us that our degree can take us into fields such as business, international development, and government. They failed to mention grad school and the pairing of the degree with another that teaches hard skills. 

My advice: find entry level jobs that will teach you a technical skill. I graduated college 3 years ago and stepped into an entry level job 2 months ago that is surprisingly teaching me a lot about business! Before this I was working entry level childcare positions, and if I want I can always become a behavioral therapist or teacher because I was forced to learn a lot in understaffed facilities. The business officer of the place I used to work at told me how much more valuable experience is compared to education. Yes you can study anything and hypothetically do anything, but that will get you no where if you ONLY have the education. PLEASE WORK. LITERALLY ANYWHERE THAT TEACHES YOU SOMETHING NEW. I really hope this helps someone and if you're feeling lost about what you should do, message me! I have looked into a few things and might be able to offer some ideas.

I can leave and find any basic job over there to survive in the  meantime, and then start establishing myself and applying to jobs from and in the US...OR leave Argentina only when I land a US-based entry sales job. I don't know if this last option is viable tho, here are some reasons for doubting being able to land a US job from abroad: (1) I don't have a US local address which would scare off employers and would also mean no permanent residency and no  drivers license (limiting job opportunities); (2) my foreign university/not very demanded social science degree and little/no job experience also might scare off recruiters; (3) not having a US bank account ready for when needed; (4) not having a US address & state residence might not only scare off employers but also be a problem for them because of the whole tax-related things and who knows what other legal issues. 

People recommend opening up a PO mail box or UPS mailbox (which supposedly sometimes gives you the advantage of a real address with 'Apt/Suite'). But I have a feeling this won't work much, companies would still find out or be hesitant and it might bring tax filing problems or who knows what else (just assuming here, I know nothing about these services).

1fnyyte,I’m going through a career change and a quarter (mid?) life crisis. ,"A little background, I (28f) got an industrial and systems engineering degree with no intention to pursue engineering because I commissioned into the Navy where I went through flight school and eventually got my wings of gold as a naval aviator. However, less than a year into my operational squadron, my mental health issues finally caught up with me to the point that I got medically retired after just under 5 years in the Navy and 0 deployments (yay me, nothing to show for my time in -.-). I have spent most, if not all, of my life with anxiety and depression (at times). I just chalked it up to being a perfectionist, a high achiever with impossible standards. This led me to doing well in my endeavors as a pilot, but ultimately was not sustainable, hence mental breakdown lol. I didn’t give myself time to reflect as I was transitioning out of the military and started looking into applying for Anesthesiology Assistant school. I completely underestimated the competitiveness of this program and am almost through this application cycle and having to face the reality that I will probably not get in. This is after spending thousands of dollars and a year and a half completing prerequisites. After facing this reality and actually taking a breathe, I’m starting to think I don’t actually want to pursue this career. I’m afraid of AA school. I think I can do it, but I figure the cost will be similar to that of flight school — my mental health. It’s a very high paying job with great pto, but I worry about the level of stress. Also… I probably wont even get in this cycle and I don’t know if I have It in me to try another cycle. I’m starting to consider other jobs, but I don’t know what’s important to me anymore. 

  
After my experience in the navy and reaching an all time low with my mental health, I am realizing that I don’t want to put myself through that again. I don’t want to experience overwhelming stress that consumes my every being. I get that this is also a personal problem and I‘m trying to deal with this in therapy. But I’m finding it hard to let go of the idea of who I thought I was— this high achieving, high performing, successful individual. I put a lot of my self worth into my performance and what I do for a living. I just want to be happy and live my life without wasting away. I wish that I could just be content with doing a job that maybe doesn’t make people go “wow” when I tell them, but gives me mental peace and freedom to live my life. But I’m also afraid that a year or two down the road, I’m going to look at myself and be disappointed. I’m considering paths like guidance counselor, sonography, medical coding, and of course AA (if i get in and decide I want to do it??) I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has also struggled reconciling different wants/needs when it comes to figuring out what to do with their life. If you made it this far in my post, you’re a real one. Thank you for reading and I appreciate any thoughts or feedback.

1fny1y1,Is it too late for me to change? ,"Hi Reddit Community, 

I'm writing to ask for some advice and encouragement regarding my career. I'm 31 years old and have had a mix of career successes and failures throughout my life. I've always felt relatively smart (tested in 97th percentile in the SATs and the 98th percentile in the GMAT), but the truth is, my grades in college and grad school were middling (mix of As, Bs, Cs, and Fs in classes I didn't do the work for). 

I studided econ in undergrad and my first job out of college was in wealth management. I found the job painfully boring but it was the only place that would hire me with my mediocre grades. I earned my Series 6 & Series 77 certifications while on the job and took a week off work to attend a financial modeling bootcamp. I absolutely loved the bootcamp and felt like I found my calling. After 4 mediocre years in wealth management I quit my job and spent 4 months job searching until I landed an amazing job corporate banking were I wound up becoming a star employee on my team. I worked really hard, was passionate about the work, and I loved my colleagues. 

After 4 years and two promotions at my corporate banking job I decided to apply to business school. I was worried I wouldn't get in anywhere because of my poor undergraduate GPA, but my work experience and high GMAT score were enough to get me accepted into a top 20 and top 10 business school with scholarships.

During business school, I was the first person in my entire class to land an internship at a top tier investment bank. I also received a special grant from the bank to entice me to sign on full time after my summer internship. I also landed a private equity internship during my MBA and worked 20-30 hours a week at that firm for a full year while also taking a full courseload. 

I ended up hating my summer internship at the investment bank. I was working 80-90 hours a week (the firm has a reputation for being a sweatshop) and I didn't like my colleagues. Most of them were edgy, high strung, and sleep deprived and there was very little camaraderie. If anything, I felt like my associate cohort saw me as competition (I'm naturally pretty bubbly and outgoing). I eneded up being the only one in my cohort not to receive a return offer. 

I also didn't recieve a full time offer from the private equity firm, but that's because PE internships rarely convert into full time offers. The PE firm I interned at hasn't hired a single intern straight out of business school, so I didn't feel like that was as much of a reflection on me. 

I graduated from business school a couple months ago and am feeling down about myself and my career prospects as I'm still looking for a job. I thrive in environments where I feel supported, but in environments that are hyper-competitive and filled with people with sharp elbows, I get overwhelmed and withdraw from people. On top of that, I can't help but feel like my career failures are a result of me being low in conscientiousness. I've experienced episodes of depression and anxiety in the past and generally am not very communicative with friends and colleagues when I'm struggling mentally. 

My sisters are very conscientious, and when I compare myself to them I feel like a loser. It's not that I'm lazy - I worked my ass off at my corporate banking job and all throughout my MBA. I just feel like I'm missing some fundamental personality trait that people with straight As and spotless resumes have. I've always been able to grasp difficult concepts with enough effort, and I genuinely love financial analysis and writing. I feel like I'm smart, as past professors have told me I'm a gifted writer and asked me if I would ever consider a career in academia. But I just never was consistent enough with my homework and studying to get good grades.  

I'm starting to feel hopeless about my ability to change my degree of conscientiousness and dependability. I feel like these traits are essential if I want to succeed in my career, and I wonder if it's too late to change these things about myself. My strengths are that I'm smart and get along really well with people, but I can't help but feel like this is a major achilles heel of mine. 

Does anyone have any advice or stories they can share about how they've overcome being low in contientiousness? Is there hope for me still? Or do I just need to accept this about myself and lower my professional goals? Any advice and words of wisdom are welcome. 

  
TLDR - I'm a smart 31 year old with a semi-successful career, but my success has also been very inconsistent due to my anxiety and low degree of contientiousness. Is there hope for me to change this about myself? Any advice on how to improve my contientiousness?

1fnvyo8,"Do FBI checks strictly look for criminal and safety reports, or do they also contact every previously employer ever?","I started a new job today and was also fingerprinted and submitted my driver's license and SSN for my background check. I'm wondering if FBI or BCI checks require that all previous employers are called? If so, does anyone actually know what questions are asked? 

I'm worried because I just resigned from a job prior to starting this one. I gave formal notice, in a written letter and spoke with my manager via email. I documented all of this and saved it all as proof onto my computer. I offered a 2 week notice, mostly because I did not have clients and was still in my training/probationary period. It was at will employment. The reason I resigned during my training/probationary period is because it was entirely a bait and switch. I was more than lied to throughout the interview process, and found out once I started onboarding. Despite offering a 2 week notice, I was told not to come back. I documented that, too. However, I'm worried this employer will try to lie about that, next, should they be called in any of the above background checks. I am fearful if they try to do this, this might damage my reputation and trust at this new job.

1fnvjm5,What do I say to coworker who is incessantly negative?,"Just got a new job, and I've worked with one coworker twice. A cumulative 8 hours. Every minute of those 8 hours was spent complaining about how much they ""fucking hate"" this job and how I'm ""gonna fucking hate this job, just watch"". Thing is, they're a teenager who, while I'm sympathetic to them not being happy, does not have real world, valid complaints. They got written up for dress code. Like, just wear what we're supposed to wear, and you wouldn't have gotten written up. Stay off your phone during the shift, etc... 

And I'm 29. It's not even like I'm old lol. But I am an adult who needs this job, desperately. And I'm grateful to have it, it's the best job I could've gotten given my situation. I just want to work and keep my head down. This is not my full time job, nor will it ever be. It's a means to an end while my small business becomes profitable again.

My concern is that this is causing me such unnecessary stress. I dread working with her because I don't want to hear the incessant complaining. I usually avoid confrontations *at all costs*, but I can feel that I'm going to say something next time she does this. What would be the appropriate thing to say? I don't want her or anyone to turn on me or hate me. I have to work with her. But I can't keep listening to it or worse, be caught talking to her and complaining when I should be working. I'm too honest by nature, so having a plan of what to say may alleviate some stress. This is my first time working with others in 10 years, so just not sure.

1fnvd6v,Looking for options in a more solo field.,"It's becoming more and more apparent that I need a career change, and I'm looking for advice on what is out there.

I currently work as a cashier where I handle customers, clean, and do paperwork, mainly. My job isn't physically strenuous, which is good because I have a lot of health problems. But I've been in retail for almost 12 years now, and because of unexpected occurrences and some bad decisions on my part, I make a bit more than entry level, but I feel I've been here too long. I'm burnt out being where I am. The dealing with customers is my main issue, I think.

I know I want something away from dealing with the general public. In office or work from home, neither really bothers me, but having never been in one, I don't know what there is to offer as employment there. I've recently been put on to medical coding which seems like something I can do. I like the feeling of taking a bunch of ""material"" and making it into a finished ""product"". I tried making youtube videos a few years ago and the editing was my favorite part.

Medical coding, though, I keep reading from people that you have to be passionate about it or it's not for you. I don't feel I'm ""passionate"" about anything. I like things. I have hobbies. But none of those hobbies, even, am I passionate about. I flip between a different video game a week. I've only finished maybe 10% of any games I've started. I used to read, but now I find it difficult. It takes me 3 tries to finish a movie. I need a career that is different enough to not be mind-numbingly boring, but I don't feel I'll ever bring ""passion"" to a job interview.

I don't really know what I'm hoping for people to comment.

1fnvd61,There's so many options in the Trades - Where do I start?,"I wanna get into the trades and out of IT. My father is a mechanical engineer and offered many times as I graduated High School to get me in with a local Plumbing and Pipefitting union, which I declined thinking I'd survive a CS degree. Well, 3 semesters of useless debt and a series of jobs later (starting in foodservice, diverting into electronics repair at a Dave & Buster's, and most recently healthcare IT for the last 4 years) I'm seeing that he had some good insight. I'm happiest when I get to work out a problem with my hands - leveraging tools and knowledge gained and learned to create elegant and novel solutions to problems.

My problem is, I don't even know where to start. I've looked at lists of trade unions, types of work that exists, and all sorts of stuff... I'm just getting overwhelmed. There's many fields I think look interesting, and a number that I have some level of experience with, but none that I've ever actually engaged with in a way that would make me know for certain whether I'd actually enjoy doing them professionally. Like sure, I've put a few 2x4's up in my basement to install a hangboard to train for rock climbing, but that's not exactly carpentry. I've got around 11 years of experience doing 3D printing and 6 years of amateur CAD under my belt - maybe it'd be good for me to get into Machining. I worked at Dave & Buster's for 18 months and spent most of that time as a game tech, administering swift justice to electrical faults in the name of customer service. But does that mean I'd stand a chance of competency swapping out a magnum-sized fuse for an entire building's power?

I used to love fixing computers. Working in IT killed that for me. If possible I'd really like to avoid going through that cycle again, but I'm not sure anyone can guarantee that. Instead - can anyone advise what steps I should be taking at this point?

1fnuepk,Soon be be graduated ,"Hello everyone, 

I am at a loss on what to do with my life. For the longest time I have felt like I cannot do anything right. As soon as I graduated high school I attended trade school and after finishing found I didn’t enjoy the work. I studied as a traditional bench jewelry. After I attended college and because of factors outside of my control had to drop out for a few years. During that time I tried my hand at corporate America. I hated that and started back college as soon as possible. During this time I started working for my school and have acquired a handful of skills. During this time I also had a child and began struggling financially. Now, turning 30 soon, I am about to finish college and am not sure exactly what to do. I’m graduating with an environmental science degree with a focus in plant science. I currently work at a research station and am a licensed drone operator. I also have picked up some experience in programing in both R and Python. I like the idea of attending grad school but am not 100 percent sold on the idea. I would like a break from education to spend time with my family. I am afraid though that if I leave I won’t be able to find the time to return later. I also know that to really make money in many fields of science I do need a PhD. I recently went away for a work trip where I was surrounded by professors and pi from other universities and many expressed that they are lacking funding for graduate students currently. This was discouraging to me.

My spouse has been carrying the weight of providing for our family while I’ve been in school and I am eternally grateful. I know she eventually would like to step down in her company to a less stressful role but 
 prefers I finish all my schooling first. 

Before this phase of life I have worked in many different fields. I worked in restaurants, was a bike mechanic, did IT work and computer repairs, and have a long history with CAD design and 3d printing. I feel I have knowledge in many different skills but lack the ability to utilize them. 

I am at a loss because I don’t know what to do next in life. I’m tired of struggling but don’t mind a few more years of education for the added benefits. As mentioned many schools I’ve talked to are lacking funding to take on new graduate students. I’m having a hard time feeling like I made the right decision going back to  school and just want do right by my wife and child. I’m not expecting this post to have all the answers but some advice would be nice.

1fnubmm,Job Opportunity has me stressing,"I have been with the same company for my entire adult life, about 15 years, outside of that summer I worked at Dairy Queen after finishing college and beginning my job search. I started out in a customer service position, moved into accounting for almost 10 years with various promotions, and have recently moved into a corporate systems implementation and administration role.

An opportunity has come up at one of the previous properties I worked with that is no longer affiliated with the corporation. I like the role. It takes away all of the items I dislike from my current role, allows me to gain much more in depth and marketable knowledge/certifications within the system, and gives me much more control over the direction and success of the projects.

The problem are glaring though. When I first started discussing this role with my previous boss, it was pitched as a director role, with a certain salary. Now the job is posted and it is a manager role and they only want to match my current salary. I expressed my concerns about this and they said they can't get a director role approved right now, but it would definitely happen in the near future. Red flags I know. They have a streak of refusing to pay to keep talent. Though my former boss did tell me to negotiate whatever I felt was reasonable and she would support it. I was considering negotiating guaranteed salary increases for each certification I obtain, along with them paying for the certifications, to offset the loss in director bonus and initial base pay.

Whereas in my current role, they offered me more than I was asking for at the time of hire, along with several accommodations I requested. 

My current position is work from home, which is okay but to be honest I prefer to be in the office. I am also primarily working on a system I do not enjoy, the support team is difficult to deal with, and we have no direct control over many setup and integration functions. It is an important system, but I wanted to be much more involved with the primary ERP system.

I also brought this up to my VP when the position was first verbally offered to me as a heads up. This was a few months ago, so if I don't follow up I could be in a tough spot as well. I anticipate the official offer within a week or two, and I'm really torn on what to do.

1fntkti,Needing Guidance - How can I apply my skills?,"Greetings, Redditors. This post may be a little lengthy, but I’m trying to be as comprehensive as possible. Any thoughtful and constructive feedback is highly appreciated.

My educational and professional background: I graduated from college a little over a decade ago with academic distinction and honors from a state university, obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. While in school, I received recognition and awards for student leadership and was inducted into Sigma Theta Tau, an honors society for nursing graduates. 

In the decade following graduation, in my professional practice of nursing, I had an extremely successful and distinguished career. Within months of starting my first job in the Cardiovascular ICU, I was designated as a “unit leader”. Within 9 months, I was trained in cardiovascular surgical recovery (immediate post-operative open-heart surgery recovery), an achievement unprecedented at the facility I worked at. I continued practicing in the CVICU setting for 5 years, during which time I received superior performance evaluations on an annual basis, trained and mentored dozens of nurses (both in critical care and cardiovascular perioperative care), was recognized by hospital administration (the entire executive administrative staff - CEO, COO, CNO, etc.) for the quality of care provided (after receiving 7 consecutive patient nominations within a single month), and had become specialty and sub-specialty certified in critical care and cardiovascular surgical nursing. 

After the 5 years I spent developing my career in the CVICU setting, I moved to a *major* metropolitan area in the US (one of the top 5 cities by population), and continued to excel in my roles. My first role upon relocation was in a highly-specialized niche, in which I saw patients both in outpatient and inpatient settings, provided training to clinicians and patients, and coordinated comprehensive medical care for our patient demographic. After one year, I took a job in the cardiovascular operating room at another health system in the city, an extremely renowned, nationally top-ranking (for cardiovascular surgery) organization. While employed there, I was promoted to the same clinical ladder position as the director of cardiovascular perioperative services, was elected to serve as the “magnet champion” for our unit (system-wide committee representative), continued to receive superior performance evaluations, served on several additional hospital-wide and system-wide committees (quality assurance, performance improvement, perioperative, etc). During the initial outbreak of COVID-19, I was given the honor of providing system-wide critical care, hemodynamic, and advanced life support training to all of the nurses employed within the organization over a several week period.

Here’s where things take a turn. Shortly after the COVID-19 outbreak, my ex-wife and I decided to relocate back to our home city, and we started a company (commercial cannabis cultivation). She and I bootstrapped the creation of this business, along with our friends (a husband and wife). I was responsible for spearheading nearly every aspect of development of this company, from drafting legal documents (operating agreement, etc.), obtaining all requisite licensure (state medical marijuana licensure, bureau of narcotics licensure, agricultural licensure, etc), website development, facility design, etc. Indeed, we became fully-licensed by every requisite entity, and even obtained banking services (notoriously difficult and extremely particular requirements due to the federal legal status of marijuana), etc. 

After about 9 months, our business was fully licensed and in a state of operational readiness. However, my marriage was failing, and my wife and I separated and I ultimately filed for divorce. I voluntarily sold my share of ownership in the business back to my ex-wife and our other partners, and I relocated, trying to reestablish some sort of life anew. 

The following months were the darkest and most difficult of my entire life. 2 months before separating, while working on my business, I fell through a drywall ceiling and fractured 3 of my vertebrate (to this day, I’m still in a pretty consistent state of pain and discomfort), and for the first year after that event, I was in extreme, relentless physical pain. Additionally, I was extremely depressed, and in an extreme amount of emotional and mental anguish as well, having lost my marriage and in the midst of a contentious divorce. 

I reached a breaking point, and I made what ultimately would be the worst, most foolish, most costly mistake of my entire life. Desperate for escape and in a state of hopelessness, wrestling with active suicidal ideation, I ordered a mass quantity of designer Chinese benzodiazepines. Once I received them, over a two week period, absolute chaos unfolded. Within a 3-day period, I was first admitted to the hospital with a BAC of .3 (I had dissolved nearly 2,000 mg of the designer benzodiazepine Flubromazepam in a 1L bottle of Everclear - which, I had intended to take very little of, but after ingesting a small amount, I guess I completely blacked out and started compulsively re-dosing) after drinking half a bottle of Everclear chalk full of benzos. I was cleared the next morning to leave the hospital, but I was still completely blacked out (turns out, the half-life of the drug is a whopping 100+ hours). The next evening, I completely destroyed my car (totaled it, repeatedly striking the guardrails on the highway), and in the process, was arrested for DWI. I was not jailed though, unfortunately, and the next day, still blacked out, ended up shooting my shotgun in a field at my apartment complex (in city limits), and the people that I encountered on the path from my apartment to said field were absolutely terrified, and rightfully so. As a result, I picked up felony charges for “menacing”. 

In the aftermath of all of that, I did receive a misdemeanor charge of reckless with a gun, but the felony charges were placed on deferred judgment and sentencing (the court and DA graciously allowed me an opportunity to avoid felony convictions because I had never had so much as a single other criminal charge in my life, and I was determined to be in the lowest category for risk of re-offense), and I was placed on probation for 3 years. Things had gone from the lowest point in my life prior to all of the events of those two weeks, to even lower than I could have ever imagined. 

I am now 2 months away from completion of my probation and dismissal of those charges, and also eligible to seal the misdemeanor charge as well; the only permanently remaining item on my criminal record in December will be the misdemeanor DWAI (driving while ability impaired) charge. As you can imagine, the last 3 years have been extremely difficult, and I had opted not to renew my nursing license due to the background check requirement. In the initial aftermath, I was so incredibly ashamed, depressed, and defeated that I didn’t even work in any capacity for nearly a year, feeling like a pariah and in the worst state of depression I’ve ever been in. Eventually, I began working again, and two years in to my probation, took the job which I still presently hold at a local restaurant. 

With my depression lifting, and healing from all of the trauma I went through regarding my divorce, and the trauma I put myself through in the aftermath, I finally started to feel like myself again. I began to perform like I have had a history of doing throughout my life, and even though working at this restaurant is a far cry from the pinnacle of my professional success, I have managed to, at this point, receive 4 promotions. I am a shift-leader, a mentor, a trainer, and a bartender, and I enjoy my job. 

I guess a large part of this post is about asking for guidance on where to go from here, and how to apply my skills, ambition, and leadership ability to something more meaningful moving forward. I’m 2 months away from mostly restoring my record, and having an opportunity to find success again in my life. A large part of my battle has been versus myself, having dealt with so much shame and embarrassment over the things that happened following my divorce, and I still honestly in the back of my head feel like a failure and like I’ll never be able to fully recover from the things that happened years ago, but I’m trying, and I’m hoping that there is indeed a successful and meaningful professional future for me.

1fntfei,Is there a good road map to enter Data Analytics / AWS? ,"Hi All,

I'm 35 and desperately looking to change up my lifestyle. Was a bartender for many years and have spent the last 5 years in sales. I've been trying to break into the tech/cloud field but don't want to waste time/make the wrong choices. I've been studying for Cloud Practitioner cert but upon looking into it this, it seems (I could just be reading bias posts) it's not a good first step.

I'm willing to go to school, do certs on side, and I even signed up for a year on code academy to learn the basics of python and/or SQL.

My dilemma is, I need to earn a set salary because of the rent/bills. Min of 60k a year. Should I continue with AWS approach? I've even considered Data Analytics because that field just seems like something I'd enjoy. I've been told CS degree would open tons of doors and on the flip side told CS is insanely hard and would take many years to produce results.

I'd love any and all advice to consider.

1fntbnl,Masters career guidance?,"Hello,

I‘m an international student currently doing my masters in Strategy Economics in Netherlands and will be finishing my masters next year. I did my bachelors in Business Economics from the Netherlands as well. During my bachelor study, I did a few part time jobs but only have 1 additional internship related to my degree.

Therefore, I wanted your advice on how to go about my masters studies(1 year duration). Therefore I compiled a list of questions I had and any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

* What should I be doing to get a decent job right out of uni? What skills should I be learning that may make me more employable? How should I be positioning myself to be a good candidate in the job market?
* Is a GPA important ? 
* Should I get an internship during the masters studies 

 - Is there some extracurriculars I should do?

1fnsv69,"Career Questioning as an EA
","Lately, I’ve been questioning my career choices and would appreciate some perspective.

I graduated from college in 2020 and started my career in sales, where I was promoted fairly quickly. Looking back, though, I realize I was too immature to be an Account Executive at that time. After some layoffs at my company while being an EA, I was fortunate to land a role as an Executive Assistant (EA). I’ve been in this role for two years at two different companies, but I’m starting to have some regrets I’d like to discuss.

1. Everyone I meet tells me I’m a people person, often surprised by how friendly and communicative I am. Some even suggest I should return to sales, believing I’d be very successful. My fiancé's partner, who has an EA, frequently encourages me to consider it too.
2. I currently work at a private equity firm with about ten people. While I get along well with everyone and contribute to the company culture, I often feel isolated. I worry about how I’ll feel as I grow older—will being an EA still be fulfilling when I’m not in my twenties anymore?
3. Respect is important to me. While I understand that I’m the right hand to my boss, there’s still a stigma attached to the EA role that makes me question how seriously I’m taken. People sometimes make comments saying they are shocked how smart I am etc.
4. I make $110k now, and my life is pretty good, but I’m curious about the earning potential in this role without sacrificing my personal life. It often feels like a direct correlation to working weekends and being on call 24/7. I know that with higher pay comes more responsibility, but as an EA, it feels particularly challenging.
5. Lastly, I wonder if I want to spend the next 10+ years doing tasks like calendar management and expense reports. Won’t I want something more fulfilling at some point?
6. It also could be that I am at the wrong company. It is private equity not much for me to do here. More of a traditional EA role.

I know this may sound a bit negative and I am not trying to play into the EA stereotypes I am just thinking out loud , but I’m curious if anyone has faced similar questions and what they did about it. Do you regret your choices, or have you found a path that worked for you?

I also want to add I am grateful to have a  job right now, but I am just thinking 5/10 years ahead.

I’d appreciate any advice or insights from those who have been in similar situations!",Ok-Jeweler-6400,1,1.0,1,1727119162,2024-09-23 19:19:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnsv69/career_questioning_as_an_ea/,9,2024
1fnst0u,Burnout,"I work as a web developer for a large company in the UK.

Before working here, I worked at an amazing company, remote first, lots of smart people surrounding you, learning and growth opportunities. It was great!

At the end of last year (2023) - they lost alot of clients, made massive layoffs, and rather than waiting to be let go, I jumped ship and moved jobs, which was a really tough call for me.

From day one at my new company, I've had issues. It's all very sales promotion led, lots of high churn rate for work. Old school approaches to work, I'm really busy and get told I HAVE to attend an off-site day to hear about sales figures and eat pizza. This happens once a month on average. Senior leadership are all old stale male and pale - if you aren't 'seen' in the office, how can you be doing your job?! 

Last week, someone said to me 'not to be a prick, but just get it done' when I was told to do some very 'urgent' last minute work for a sales promotion running on the site... It's really effecting me, my partner has been quite concerned about my mental well being because of this job.

It's just not a good environment to be in and I'm really getting burnt out on it. Especially after leaving my last company.

I understand I'm lucky to have a job, but the burnout is real.

I've been applying for roles, but with how the job market is at the moment, it's not easy finding work. And I'm not sure if I want to jump into another development role within a company right now.

I have a three month notice period - I started in February, so handing my notice in soonish will get me to a year's experience within this company. But I don't have a job lined up. 

I'm half tempted to hand my notice in, get a bar/cafe job to get a break from cooperate life, ensuring steady income and work freelance around it. With an idea that I'd jump back into a Dev role at a company once the job market picks up again.

Not sure if this would be risky, if anyone has done something similar. Has some advice to offer.

TL:DR; 

I've been in this job for nearly a year, I have a 3 months notice period - should I just leave without a job lined up and figure out what I'm doing within my notice period?

- would look good on my resume and gives me direct work experience
- the work might be more fulfilling than what I do now

- it pays $2/hr less than what I make now (although that might be negotiable)
- it’s not a unionized position so I could be let go anytime
- no benefits

Read till the end so that you understand i need guidance as i am not flexing.
I am 26 Y Software Engineer in a MNC.
I get 1.5 L pm + 25 L of stocks per year which i can sell anytime and i will get it for next 2 Years also and  last years stocks are already vested.
I have this money only:
Mutual funds: 15 L
Indian Direct Stocks: 15L
USA Stocks : 3L
Mnc vested shares value right now : 50 L
Running expense: 80K per month of complete family( parents and sibling)

So overall money is : 83 Lakhs right now.
Money i will save from salary in next 2 years : 65 Lakhs ( Through my salary + stocks) 
No more cash flow.
Above amount is less than 2 Crores and i want to try a investment to get 6 crores at age 31 ( next 5 Years plan) which seems impossible through mutual funds, stocks and mnc stocks appreciation of my current amount.
I want to invest in 2 properties in Noida from Jan'25 .
I already selected both properties in my mind.
1. Residential Property ( 2 crores) ( Pre Launch Property as it appreciates more) : i have to give 40 Lakhs every year for next 5 Years because property will be ready in 5 Years.
2. Commercial property 1.2 crore ( possession in 1.5 Years): i have to give 40 L now and 60 lakhs after 1.5 Years( at the time of possession). I will get fixed rent of 80K per month from the date of possession till life time. 
I can exit from both properties after paying 40% of amount each.
How 6 crore??
I have less than 2 crore but investment is 3.2 crore and in these 5 years both properties will get 80% - 100% of appreciation which will make my investment value 3.2 crore to 6 crores. I will put all 6 crores in Mutual funds at the age of 31 and live on rent and become financially independent.

Guide me how is this plan and how should i use my current money to execute this. Read every investment and return seriously because i  need real guidance now.
Please advise each and every thing related to this investment.
Loan or not?
What to sell?

1fnqj65,Need advice on transitioning to a new career,"Posting for my husband. 

My husband has spent the past 15 years working as a professional dancer. Recently, he had a serious injury that has essentially taken him out of the game permanently. He can still work as a teacher, but it's really not a reliable source of income as compared to before.

He's looking to transition to something else. The only caveat is that he can't have it be super physically active—lifting heavy objects, spending the entire day on your feet, etc.—because of his injury.

Before he was a dancer, he got a BA in marketing and worked in an advertising firm for about 3 years (before leaving to pursue dance). Beyond that, he has a lot of experience in event planning (has hosted his own events every year for awhile now), and he speaks 3 different languages.

Any suggestions for what he could pursue that *doesn't* require a 4-year degree? We've been looking down a few different avenues: namely, paralegal, event planning, or something in real estate (probably not an agent; this is just because one of our best friends is a REA and might be able to help). But he's a bit lost as to what his skillset could apply to. He's a very hard worker, he's smart, and he's willing to put the hours in. It's just that his resume has been just dance for over a decade, and it's really tough to imagine reentering the job market with that.

I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs - getting denied, take skill tests i keep failing.

Lost 45k day trading.

I’m thinking about going back to school for psychology because that’s what I’m good at, guiding people or start my own online coaching business.

Plus my brother died of a heroin overdose and I had a severe porn addiction so it makes sense I’d go down that route.

Accounting is not my skill - I struggle everyday to focus on this job.

My spiritual side is well intact: i do hot yoga 4 days a week, i go to breath work retreats.

So my mental health is great but im still stressed about the money aspect .

Follow what you’re good at at this stage and turn into a wild business or follow the herd get another shitty accounting job?",ExistingPepper9107,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1727108414,2024-09-23 16:20:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnoh5u/advice_for_a_30_year_old/,9,2024
1fnoe9c,Too much work - what to do?,"Long story short, I’ve been running my own small business for almost ten years. It’s a cafe in a small town, and I work there alone, meaning that I’ve been doing from 60 to 120 hours per week for the last years. I’ve reduced a little the opening hours, but it’s still an exhausting job, and now I am at the point that I cannot stand it anymore. The business is going pretty well, and it would be impossible for me to find another job that pays me so well, but it’s also true that I don’t earn enough to hire an help. What should I do? Keep a job that I’m starting to hate just for money’s sake? Hire somebody and settle for very low earnings? Or close the business I gave blood and sweat to build?

1fno4qh,Tech Job VS Family Business,"
I am currently working as a Software Engineer at a product-based company, where I have completed a year and have 11 LPA CTC. While I appreciate the experience, I haven't seen significant professional growth during this period.

My father has been running a small manufacturing business focused on the automobile industry and foundries for the past 15 years. Recently, the business has seen positive growth. The company generates over 50 LPA in revenue and my father takes home around 20 LPA. The situation is difficult because my father's health is failing and I don't know if I'll get enough years to learn the ropes of the business. I have always been inclined towards entrepreneurship and have a strong desire to contribute to and expand the business.

However, I do not have an educational background in our business domain, such as a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I am at a crossroads and considering resigning from my current role to fully immerse myself in the business for the next couple of years. I want to learn and eventually improve the business. While I understand the risks involved, I believe I have age on my side (I am currently 23) to either revert to a job or explore other entrepreneurial ventures if things don't work out as planned in the next few years. 

Moreover, I have a deep attachment to my hometown and prefer not to relocate my family to a metro city. I seek valuable insights about this career decision.

Should I take the leap?",thisistrial,2,1.0,0,1727107550,2024-09-23 16:05:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fno4qh/tech_job_vs_family_business/,9,2024

1fnn8ra,Did I make the wrong decision?,"Hi everyone, Didn’t think I’d be looking for advice so early on in my new role but here I am… I was laid off early this year. About a month ago, I got two competing offers.

Offer 1 - 65,000. 1 year contract but full time afterwards. Fully remote anywhere in the world. No benefits. 3 weeks time off plus holiday office closure. Tech start up with 30 employees. Room to climb the ladder since it’s a smaller team.

Offer 2 - 74,000. 15 month mat leave coverage but potential for a full time role after. Fully remote in Canada. Full benefits. 4+ weeks of time off. Additional day off during long weekend (if a holiday falls on a Monday, we’re also closed on the Friday). Established company with 500+ employees. Not sure about career progression.

I took offer 1 because I have dreams of being a digital nomad and thought finally this is my chance. Today is my third week and things are already going left… last Wednesday the CEO called a last minute team meeting and told us that we are scaling back on spending money on anything because if things keep going how they’re going, they’ll have to close the business in November. The CEO made sure to mention she was taking a 50% pay cut so should hold us off until January but advised us layoffs are coming. The next day, another random team meeting but she told the team how she let go of the lead consultant (their first ever employee that has been there from the beginning). When we asked why him, she mentioned his salary cost was above market value and apparently he wasn’t performing and they spoke to him about that. There are more layoffs to come. Around the same time, I also found out there’s quite a bit of nepotism going on here. Lots of people hiring their families. I almost feel like I was lied to about the room for growth because why would they pick me over their sister for a promotion?

The offer that I turned down is still on the table. I’m heavily considering taking it and leaving this role but I just don’t know. It sucks to give up the digital nomad dream but being out of a job again would probably suck more….

1fnn6wg,Embarrassed & devastated - professional dress,"I work in sales for a third party administrator (TPA) firm for retirement plans. I have been a TPA for 5 years and just transitioned to the sales team a few months ago. I essentially meet with financial advisors and sell my companies services in hopes they’ll recommend us as a TPA for the companies plans they service. 

I did my first big meeting without my boss where I presented in front of about 10 advisors (9 men and 1 woman). I felt so confident and elated after that meeting and didn’t think anything could take away from that. 

Today I was on a call with the woman advisor and she told me she had something a little uncomfortable to discuss with me. She indicated my skirt was extremely short and everyone was very uncomfortable with it. She indicated the men she works with are very Christian. 

To say I’m devastated is a complete understatement. I’ve been bawling my eyes out since she told me. I have long legs and am petite so I know clothes have always been challenging for me but I always wear skirts to my fingertips just as I had to in high school. I felt so confident after that meeting and would never have thought my clothes could take away from that. I’ve never been told anything about how I dress before so to know everyone was gossiping about me… I’m distraught. 

Remaining confident and secure as a brand-new younger female sales representative in a field dominated by men poses its own struggles but this takes the cake. I was already reconsidering this career promotion because I don’t feel salesy (I’m more servicy) but this is pushing me over the edge. 

I guess I came on here for advice, to hopefully hear from someone who’s been through this before and how they handled it and didn’t give up, and just to vent because I’ve never felt so embarrassed in my life. 

In short: young female told by client her skirt was too short after presenting in front of a group of men. Any and all advice needed. Devastated and embarrassed. Reconsidering career. All the things.

1fnmtu3,"Need some advice, I have to choose between two job offers, which one would you choose?","Hi everyone,

To give some context, I am based in Spain and I am 45 years old. I have been always providing technical support, although last year I decided to go into Data Analytics and I have been studying for that in my free time.

I have been looking for a job since the beginning of this year, and between this and next week I will have to choose one of them, which one would you choose?

**1) First Job.**

This company's punctuation is low on Glassdoor, and according to Linkedin the average of people leaving the company is around 2 years.

I will be the only technician providing 2nd line support to around 200 users on-site.

15 minutes driving from home.

Salary is around 38k per year, 2300 euros per month after taxes. Not sure about other perks.

**2) Second Job.**

Service desk analyst in a well-known company, high punctuation in Glassdoor and according to Linkedin the average of people leaving the company is around 5 years.

100% remote.

Base salary: 25k per year, 1600 euros per month after taxes + X amount extra per night shift.

High chances of moving to another department (perhaps to work in data analytics in the future).

Private health insurance. + 50 euros for utility bills. Restaurant tickets. Private pension schema.

 

The main motivation for me to choose the 1st one is money, but I have the feeling that in the second one I will be happier even if I am getting paid less, plus I will have more opportunities to grow.

  
Which one would you choose?

1fnmbl7,Quit dream job for my side hustle?,"I thought I’d come here for some guidance. For you to understand my position, I need to give some context:

Currently, I’m 21 years old and live in Germany. Not in a big city; in an average small town. Live with parents. 100k+ saved. 

I do my dream job, in a dream position that I have built up to for years. It’s using a digital skill e.g graphic designer. (Remote)

The salary is around $50k per year. 

BUT 
I have my own online business that has done just under 6 figs in the past year. I started a year ago and it’s done ~5-10k per month consistently. Just had my best month at $15k profit.

My situation:

Even though my job isn’t very demanding whatsoever and when I do the work I’m very capable. Lately, it has been very hard to bring myself to actually do it, so my time is just spent procrastinating.

My business makes money passively (once the initial work of 1-2 hours is put in per day). It’s so hard to bring myself to do my job each day when I know I could be scaling my business if I put more of my time into it. I even have a small team currently. It’s very difficult to keep selling my time when there’s the potential of my business.

HOWEVER, I have been trying to get to this job position since I was about 13 years old. So by ‘quitting’, I’m throwing it away in theory. I took a risk by not going to college to find a role like this, and even prayed to be in this kind of position. It’s a super competitive space. I used to love doing it, but now I’ve got bored with it. Definitely not burnt out as I take plenty of holidays. Despite it being more volatile, the business is fun and gives me energy.

I would appreciate some thoughts and guidance. ",maf1234567,1,1.0,1,1727103089,2024-09-23 14:51:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnmbl7/quit_dream_job_for_my_side_hustle/,9,2024

I work in a remote org, and we've got a company meet planned for 27th December, right in the middle of the holiday season (smh). The senior management has proposed that we work together in person for a full day during the outing. While it's understandable the intent behind this ""to bond and collaborate"", everyone will be in holiday mode and won’t be excited about working all day, especially during Christmas.

I have talked to few employees about this idea. Everyone is of the same opinion - we can do a few hours, not full day. if Its full day - then count us out. Management is like - No is not an option. Everyone has to come.

We've suggested an alternative: work for 4 hours in a booked room, have focused discussions, and then let everyone unwind for the rest of the evening. Atleast, this way we can balance productivity and allow the team to enjoy the outing and bond more casually. However, management isn't budging.

I am a foreigner and recently (March) I received my work permit. I am an engineer with a specialization in food science and I have a master's degree in the same area, with 4 years of experience in the industry.



I recently received a call from a recruiting firm (the one that starts with K) to start a position. In fact, it would be 2 days of work, something like a ""work interview"", to see how I would perform my techniques.



When I got there, the manager immediately turned me down, because my commute was 2 hours - by car - and that wouldn't work. I immediately tried to respond, but she cut me off and I just went back home.



When I got home, I sent a polite email to the recruiter, explaining what had happened. Two days later, she called me, trying to blame me, saying that I was the one who was wrong (?), if I couldn't move into a room while my wife spent the whole week alone in our apartment. This was for an entry-level position, paying the minimum possible, and with no benefits.



Is this the norm here in the US? I'm really upset, because I have qualifications that I've fought for my whole life and they seem to be worth nothing here.

1fnl68o,Next step in my career? (Data),"Hi guys!

Long story short otherwise this would be a very long post (probably still will be).

1 year ago I(now 29M) was managing a Casino and was extremely stressed out and decided I wanted to make a career change.

 I completed two quick online courses in Excel and SQL, and started looking for jobs in Data. A couple of months later I landed a job as a Data Assistant at a school, and I have since gained significant experience (LookerStudio, BigQuery, I can now say I am an advanced Excel user, SIMS, and I have been playing around with PowerBI as well).


It has been 9 months and I believe I have now gotten to the point where I am not learning that much, as every academic year tends to be similar and I'm hitting the 1y mark.

I would stay longer for CV purposes and to see if I could learn more skills before moving on, but this career change did come with a significant paycut, so I'm keen to move on. (Only accepted the paycut as I was desperate to leave the previous job and had no experience in Data so I was willing to accept it to gain some experience).

Now, there is a slight chance I could be promoted to Data Manager relatively soon, but there are no guarantees, and there is another factor that is pushing me to find a new job: I commute 1h20 each way, every day.

What next step would you take? I'm at a point where I feel like I have the necessary experience, and I know I'm a smart guy, quick learner, who would be a great asset to whoever hired me, but obviously with 10 months experience in Data and 2 certificates I'm not going to rank high among other candidates.

I've thought about a Bootcamp, but most of them are intensive 16 weeks and I can't really go 4 months without a paycheck. I've though about uni as well, but I don't think I'm at a point in life where I could afford to be working a part-time for another 3y while studying.

Opinions?

Thanks!

1fnl0b8,Micromanaging boss who contradicts himself,"Not really a rant because it doesn't really bug me but I just think its weird. Also in my defense for not being perfect at writing reports is I was initially hired for software dev and am having to run our IT department as well and am being asked to generate these reports which I've never done before. My boss is a older guy and sometimes doing a task for him can like working in circles.

For instance I sent him an expense report Friday and midday Sunday he wants changes by 9 AM Monday. I'm peeved but also not really doing anything so I go ahead and decide to make the changes. However what was annoying was the fact he wanted the report in a specific template but didn't share that template till Sunday afternoon. I will admit that there was a small error on the first one but he did point it out and I fixed it. Afterword's I just decided to build a python script to regenerate his format, it took longer then it would of to make the form but every report should only take 5 mins from now on.

So after making the script I send him the new version and he immediately wants several users removed, the sheet renamed, and something was inaccurate but it turned out I just had two column names swapped which was a quick fix. and a column sorted in decided order and he wants me to change my note which summarized the entirety of the changes in a short paragraph. It was a very black and white paragraph of our price was this and now it is this and we can expect these savings over the next quarter, a super simple sentence.

The column sort request seemed dumb off the bat because anyone can do that but I do it cause why not. I drop the guest and rename the sheet and change my note from explaining the total now since he wanted the note updated. I finish up his request and shoot it back to him scheduled for 7:30 because I already know from experience when he says 9 he wants it before so he can look at it incase something is wrong so there's time to edit before the requested time.

So today I wake up to his email and his still complaining about my note not having enough information and request that I show the before, current, and future price, so essentially what I previously had every other edit of this form. He also takes the time to explain his frustrated that his having to check my work so many times and hopes in the future this wont happen. However I feel like there we're really only two major issues on my side, the first bit of data having a inaccuracy and then the name swapped columns and the  rest we're very simple semantics that just weren't shared till I already turned in the form. His behavior doesn't really stress me out it just seems kind of silly and a waste of time.

However I am aware that people can be biased and wanted to get a 3rd party opinion and see if maybe I'm just not being insightful enough and need to step it up.

1fnjlbi,Help,"To make a long story short, I was with a company I loved for two years. I ended up getting laid off and a coworker who dodged the layoffs gave me a recommendation to a job he worked previously and liked. I ended up landing the job, it was a new field and I was excited but a bit hesitant because I didn’t know much about it. After 90 days it really wasn’t for me, I didn’t like the work or the people and decided to move in a different direction. I left on great terms and everyone understood. 

I then landed a new job in a field that is similar to what I did for 2 years but a little different. I love the work, but I work for a INSANE guy. I am two weeks in and no one trained me, I still don’t have health insurance, I get torn apart at work because he meets with me and gives me a huge pile of work that I need to get done but not a ton of information so I do it the best I can and its never right. I have another co worker who does nothing but talks to me and distracts me all day and refuses to help or train. The only way to compare it is to the devil wears Prada but no free clothing and the pay is bad for the field and goes what gets said goes against every HR standard. For instance, on my second day the other coworker told me how much turn over there is and told me horror stories of our boss and what’s he’s said to previous associates 

I understand that all work is stressful but this is a new level. The last review refers to the boss as “wicked witch of the west”. I am terrified that two jobs in 1 year is absolutely insane and don’t know what to do ",Low_Coffee_2693,2,1.0,2,1727095671,2024-09-23 12:47:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnjlbi/help/,9,2024

1fnj7fc,Internships as a Senior SUMMER 2025,"Need some advice. I am currently a senior. I transferred mid sophomore year which put me behind in some classes and I have the option to graduate either in Summer 2025 or Fall 2025.

The problem is that for Summer 2025 internships, most companies are looking for juniors and sophomores. I really want to get a summer 2025 internship since I have no previous internships but I don’t know what I should do.

Would it make more sense to put graduating in Summer 2025 on my resume or postpone my graduation to Fall 2025 in hopes of landing a Summer 2025 internship?

I know that most companies expect you to go back to college for at least 1 semester after an internship. However, many people have told me that it might be looked down upon if I graduate 1 semester later as a “super senior” which is why I wanted to graduate in Summer. 

The problem with graduating in Summer 2025 is that I will be in school during any internships which also might affect my chances of landing one.

Overall, I am really lost on this whole situation and I’m not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",Intelligent_Site_498,1,1.0,0,1727094534,2024-09-23 12:28:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnj7fc/internships_as_a_senior_summer_2025/,9,2024
1fnj0g1,I am in my final year of college and am do not know which career I am interested in. This particular job is under my consideration. Any thoughts and suggestions? Thank you! :),"Hello everyone!

I am a final year college student, 19 years of age, studying Financial Markets at a reputed institute.

Third Bridge, an investment research firm is hiring. The roles are in different divisions such as 1) Consulting 2) Private Equity 3) Public Equity.

I am more interested in the Consulting one as I believe it would give me good exposure to different industries, rather than something like Private Equity. If I join Public Equity I won't be allowed to invest in the stock market as per laws, so thats a no.   
I am not sure what career I want to grow in life. I am not sure about my career interests.

But I have the opportunity to take this job. The work involves significant amount of cold-calling/reaching out to industry experts and get them to help Third Bridge's clients with their investment and business decisions. And, there are targets. Its like Sales, but the title of the role isn't Sales. 

  
I might get good exposure by working here. I was thinking of studying for MBA, but I wouldn't know what Master's degree to pursue. So, I decided to gain some work experience.



Shall I go for this? What do you guys think? What advice do you all have for me?

(P.S. My degree is related to Finance but I've never really enjoyed the course. Of course, I've not worked in Finance so I can't say if I dislike or like the work, but financial modelling, and calculations on an Excel sheet isn't my dream job presently.

1fnizxz,Working at an Agency: Do I work unpaid overtime to make my boss happy or actually have a life?,"I started at an agency as a graphic designer couple of months ago and man had it been a rude awakening. At first it wasn’t so bad, the work was manageable. But now, it’s become insane. 

We have a lot of time tracking/billing processes we use and I’m always assigned between 50-65hrs of work each week. My Art Director is well aware of this. Her advice is “just go faster” so that I can get it done within my 35 hour work week.  At this point, I’m putting in 9-12 hour days. I’m salaried so even though my time sheet shows me working overtime, my CEO has said it’s time in lieu. 

I have absolutely no life outside of work because of the insane hours I work. I can feel my mental and physical health start to deteriorate. The money is good (~$80k) and my colleagues are great too. It is remote which is really nice too. I truly love my job as a designer - I feel like I’m one of the lucky ones who gets to do what they love every day. 

Now one of the designers is taking a month off for vacation. So now we are going from 3 to 2 which will ultimately end up on my plate. 

My question is, how do I approach the situation? At what point do I say “enough is enough”? If I stop working at 5pm, the work isn’t going to get done resulting in missing deadlines and having disciplinary actions. But also not having a life outside the computer is killing me.

1fni64q,Projecting the Next 5–10 Years in Computer Science & Cybersecurity: Most Money?,"Hey Reddit!

I’m an international student from Southeast Asia, entering & graduating university in 6 years with a bachelor’s, planning to pursue a career in *computer science* or *cybersecurity*, and I’m looking for advice on how to make the best long-term decisions. I want to minimize effort and maximize income, especially after graduating. Over the next 5 to 10 years, I’m hoping to hear your thoughts, stories, and suggestions on the following:

1. Projected Growth in Computer Science & Cybersecurity

How do you see the growth trends playing out over the next 5 to 10 years in these fields? Will demand for computer scientists and cybersecurity professionals remain as strong as it is now? Are there specific industries or regions that will see the biggest growth?

2. Job Market for Fresh Graduates

If you graduated recently or are currently working, how tough was it to find your first job? Do you think it will become harder or easier to find a job in these fields in the next decade? Also, is there a certain country where job availability for fresh grads is particularly high?

3. Salaries in 5–10 Years

Looking ahead, what can I expect in terms of salary? How much should I realistically be aiming for as an entry-level computer science or cybersecurity graduate in the U.S., Canada, Europe, or Australia? Do you think salaries will increase significantly in the next decade, and which regions offer the best earning potential compared to the cost of living?

4. Visa & Immigration Options

Which countries are currently (or will likely be) the easiest to immigrate to as a tech worker over the next 5 to 10 years? I know tech skills are in demand, but I’m wondering which countries offer the best visa options for international graduates. If you’ve gone through this process, how smooth was it? Also, are there any countries with major tech talent shortages that make immigration easier?

5. Geopolitical & Economic Factors
With changing political landscapes, which countries are the safest bets for long-term stability in tech jobs? Some countries have aging populations and labor shortages—will this open up more opportunities for immigrants? Which countries would you avoid, given the current or projected economic conditions?

6. Culture & How International Students Are Treated

This is a big one for me: what’s the work culture like for international students in different countries? Are we treated well, or is it hard to fit in? If you’re from Southeast Asia and have studied or worked abroad, how were you treated in terms of work, culture, and social life? Are there any countries where international students are welcomed and supported, or where we face more challenges?

7. Ease of Finding a Job as an International Student

Once I finish my studies, how easy is it to get a job as an international student in the tech sector? Are certain countries more friendly in terms of hiring foreign workers, especially in tech? Salary? Any advice on navigating networking opportunities, internships, or programs that make finding jobs easier for international graduates?

8. University Tuition, Living Costs, & Part-Time Work

I’m looking for the least expensive options for quality education. Which countries or universities have low tuition fees but good job prospects afterward? Also, how easy is it to work part-time while studying to cover living costs, and what’s the minimum effort required to maintain a decent standard of living?

I’d love to hear your stories, experiences, and any advice you have about these questions! Especially if you’ve navigated similar choices or know what the trends will be like over the next decade. Thanks in advance for your insights! 😊",Nectarch,4,0.8299999833106995,1,1727091092,2024-09-23 11:31:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fni64q/projecting_the_next_510_years_in_computer_science/,9,2024
1fnhqxc,Becoming a commercial pilot after 12th Grade.,"Hey everyone, I'm 16 (turning 17 soon), living in India, and currently in 12th grade CBSE (Science stream). I’ve always wanted to become a commercial pilot, and now that I’m finishing school, I’m looking for guidance on how to get started. I plan to do my flight training abroad (specifically Miami) and would appreciate any advice.
For context, I was a JEE student but realized halfway that it wasn’t for me. I switched to self-study for 12th grade. My parents are supportive of my decision.

Here are my main questions:

1. How do I become a commercial pilot after finishing 12th?
2. What subjects/qualifications are required for flying schools abroad?
3. *Important* What are the details of the cadet program? Because I am considering that option.
4. *Important* I wear spectacles (myopic -3 in both eyes). Is LASIK surgery allowed for aspiring pilots, or will it disqualify me?
5. Do I need to take classes or coaching to clear exams? If so, when and where should I start?
6. What’s the cost of flight school abroad, and what should I budget for overall expenses?
7. Are there any medical or physical requirements I need to know?
8. Is becoming a pilot a good career choice, and are there sufficient job opportunities?

1fnh66b,Next Career Move: AE or AM?,"Hi everyone, 

I would really appreciate some advice here. I’ve been a BDR at a SaaS company for 3 years and primarily targeted enterprises for the past year.
I now have two job offers for either a Junior AE role or an Account Manager role with a similar pay range.

Offer 1: Junior (SMB) AE at a small SaaS Startup which is in the same industry as my previous company, full-cycle (no SDRs), heavy focus on outbound/prospecting

Offer 2: Account Manager, non-tech industry but their work is for a good cause, typical AM tasks but with a focus on project management

Quite frankly, my previous job fucked me over, they were still figuring out how to do outbound, so it was quite tough for BDRs and right now I’m not too keen on doing the same stuff again. I am tired of the BDR job, however it would obviously be great to get some closing experience. I just have no idea what would be the best next move. 

I’m still in my mid twenties and haven’t found my path yet. I thought and still think that sales is good experience to have, but I’m also thinking of going back to uni in a few years and do something else. What are your thoughts on this?

Thank you for reading and any advice that you might have for me!",zreauxx,1,1.0,0,1727087180,2024-09-23 10:26:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fnh66b/next_career_move_ae_or_am/,9,2024
1fngtfz,What should I do,"I was made redundant in June. I got three second stage interviews and because I was so exhausted, I dropped out the other two as soon as I got an offer (which wasn’t my first choice). I was just done and in my head I thought I’d make it work. 

Anyway, three weeks in to this new job and I’m really not enjoying it. It’s chaotic, and the role doesn’t seem to be what was advertised. I feel like it’s going to be stressful and a real “working out of hours” culture. I was working until 6:30pm on Friday (on my second week!) which has never been normal for any job I’ve been in. I was tasked with getting a campaign over the line with next to no support from my boss. I managed to get it done but turned myself inside out to do it. 

I’ve (miraculously!) managed to get back into the interview process for the other two roles, but the one I really want is 12 month FTC at a very good, global company. The recruiter said there might be a possibility to extend at the end but she can’t promise so has to tell me this. I’d work hard in the role to try and make myself indispensable, or possibly rotate into another area of the company. 

So now I don’t know what to do. My brain feels like it’s fizzing with trying to work out the right path.

So I’ve come to Reddit to help me unpick this.

1fng2ly,My location is a turn-off…,"Hi all,

I’m 24 years old, have 3 years of experience as a Sales Consultant and cannot move on from my current position no matter how hard I try.

I’m currently living an hour and a half away from a major city, and have been applying to various roles based in this city for about a year and a half now. I always get that first initial call from recruiters/employers with no problems but once they ask me where I currently reside, that’s when any chance I had at securing an interview is dissipated, or it’s met with great hesitation.

For context: I work at a relatively small company that has branches everywhere but this city, so I think it’s normal that recruiters are curious where I live.

I always reassure them that I have absolutely no problem travelling to this city as I travel to and from the city almost every weekend, I travelled there daily for university, I and used to live in that particular city for 15 years. But still, I’ve been told by way too many recruiters/employers that my location is a “turn-off”.

I even promise them that I’ll be able to move to the city once I secure a job (I don’t really see a point moving to an area that will cost double my current rent without a job to get me by) but again, they’re not interested.

I honestly feel hopeless. Any goals I have of moving back into the city and taking the next step forward in my career are slowly dissolving. I feel like it’s really unfair to base my current residency status on potential bad past experiences with people who have lived “far away”.

I’ve had a couple recruiters suggest that I move to the city and try reapplying, but like I said before, it just seems too risky.

If anyone has any experience or advice, I’d greatly appreciate it.",madelinebot,3,0.6200000047683716,11,1727082270,2024-09-23 09:04:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fng2ly/my_location_is_a_turnoff/,9,2024
1fnfo6d,How to leverage my unique experiences and skills for an unconventional career in healthcare/tech?,"I’m a 5th year medical student, I failed two years of medical school so will probably graduate a 6 year course in 8 or 9 years. I have pretty much just experience related to medicine which pretty much just includes following doctors around watching them without doing anything. I speak English and Hebrew fluently and German French Italian and Thai at around B1-2. 

I spent those extra years in medical school getting therapy and working on a lot of the underlying issues in my life. Medical school required me to work on a lot of areas of my life all at once in order to make progress, which seems like a big red flag on my resume but I also see it as a big growth phase in my life. I’ve always had and have developed a deep level of introspection and emotional awareness, communication skills, empathic communication. I have interests in biological sciences, philosophy, psychology, tech, and statistics. I am quite smart and am able to understand things very deeply and am quite good at critical thinking when I can take my time and ask questions without being judged. I’m very enthusiastic and curious but I tend to get discouraged by expectations and judgments from others, but this is something I have been working on. 

I think with all of that in mind I could be an incredibly valuable asset to the right team with a supportive environment even outside of a degree in medicine. But the problem is that these skills are mostly not present in a CV at all. I’m worried that even if I have these valuable skills and would make a great member of a team, that the failed 2 years of medical school and a lack of experience will make it difficult for employers to appreciate my abilities. 

Assuming I finish my degree in 8-9 years and I want to take an alternate path that isn’t directly being a doctor, how difficult will it be to find an employer that will accept me with my current skills and CV and work in a supportive environment? What can I do to make myself a better candidate for recruiters? I’d ideally like to find work that makes use of a combination of my skills and interest to provide value in a way that I’m uniquely capable of, even if it doesn’t fit conventional career paths. So in the process I’d like to work in different careers to solve problems that are meaningful to me and over time develop a fulfilling career.

Couldn't be taken seriously in any different job application. Received zero interview calls in my life but in sales. Followed the trend of AI and data science. So i took a bootcamp and followed few online courses. 

I came to understand by time that this field is for computer science graduates. Any company would't consider a mechanical engineer with sales career into this field.(i know exception exists but very low and depends on location too)

Again no calls, no opportunity. I am slowly shattered between learning different things on my own trying to escape the sales matrix. I started to lose my sanity in the process. Doubted my choices, trying to get into any technical field, whether in tech or in mechanical engineering. I don't know what to do at this point.

I have no respect nor sense of achievement in sales. It is a risky unstable career that i can't consider it a real job. But it has been years now that i am trying to leave it.

Now i am not trying anything. just smoking a lot and barely doing my job. Waiting for the time to go home sleep and repeat. I am on the edge to end my life. Because it seems there is no solution to move to a western country where there is more opportunities (both in manufacturing and in tech even with training programs) i feel like I am a jack of all trades but a master of none. Some might say, follow your passion and define what you want. What if the market is changing and as an attempt to adapt you lose everything. I have no guidance as everyone I ask is either incapable of help, busy, or trying to sell me some course or some service. I am just writing this to tell myself that i tried everything on my way. I can't live like this. I could have done much much better. I wish someone can just give me the hand to stand up. Because at this point, i am too tired to get up and do anything. 

Maybe i am just too bad at job searching and only good for learning and sitting for exams.

1fncnkr,"Leaving current job for a better paying one, when should I give my notice? ","I have been at my current job as an Assistant Manager for a luxury beauty salon for about 1 1/2 now. I love the people, the clients and my manager, they have treated me very well, however, the pay is just not enough for me. I got invited to interview for a company in a different industry (still retail) and they ended up giving me a contingent offer right on the spot. The new job pays $8 more than my current, and will give me full benefits, 3 weeks PTO and bonus opportunities, so it’s something I definitely cannot turn down. 

My question is - when should I give my notice? My manager is nice and I am sure she will not fire me before the two weeks is up, and part of me wants to let her know now even before my background check and paperwork are completed so I can help train whoever will replace me.

I got a call from my new employer today too and asked if October 14 is a good day to start, which means ideally I give my notice by Wednesday. I know nothing is going to come up in my background check but I get paranoid sometimes.

I’m 24 and got a bit of a late start with college after spending a few years in dead-end jobs. Right now, I’m majoring in accounting, and the original plan was to go all the way and become a CPA.

But honestly, the thought of waiting another 3-4 years to get there is starting to feel overwhelming. I just want to hit a solid $100k salary as soon as possible and live a little, but from what I’ve seen, accounting in Canada doesn’t get me there quickly—salaries here are lower compared to other places.

So, I’m at a crossroads. I’ve been looking at switching to something like project management or supply chain, thinking that maybe one of those paths could speed things up. But I’m not sure if that’s the right move or if I should just tough it out in accounting.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation or made a career switch, I’d love to hear what you did and how it worked out. Any advice or personal experiences would be really appreciated!

I’m 25 y.o. and graduated in ‘21 with a degree majoring in Bio, minor Chem, from Texas State University. I was pursuing further education to a new career, as that was the path I’ve been on, but am in an internal struggle if that is what I really want to do in life.

I’ve wanted to be a doctor since I was super small, I think four? Doc McStuffins was my favorite show; she was a girl who looked like me and helped people and made others feel better. I wanted to be just like her when I grew up. I’ve carried that want to be a doctor for the past 11 years. I love learning about the human body and enjoy my science and biomed related classes in high school. I’ve never questioned myself until the summer between my sophomore and junior year. As I‘ve done more research into the job and gotten some hospital experience, I really don’t know if the years of schooling and (lack of) a work-life balance is really what I want, though the money is nice.

As a junior currently, I know have time to really figure out what I want with my life, but I can’t help but feel a bit nervous as college applications are around the corner.

I’ve gotten good grades in all my classes throughout high school so far. I didn’t like chemistry and don’t really like physics. However I loved biology, and I’m also really liking the biomedical science and anatomy classes I’m taking this year. Aside from that, I’ve always really enjoyed writing, and English in general. I like writing analytical essays about texts,  writing short stories, and i’ve always gotten some of my highest grades in English and win school-wide awards for English. I’m just not sure how to combine my two interests.

1fnamac,Should I switch a toxic remote job to hybrid 2-3 days in the office job?,"Should I switch a toxic remote job to hybrid 2-3 days in the office job?

I’m currently pregnant and am due in February. Unfortunately, my current job is so toxic. My manager just left at the end of August due to burnout and poor management. I’m now being managed by people who don’t know how to do my job which is working on an HR software. I’m currently doing the work of my manager and 2 other people so the stress I feel daily is a lot. I also have no time to do actual work because of the constant meetings I’m in. They seem to not understand that and will schedule several meetings all day. We have several big projects coming up and are also backfilling my previous manager’s role. However, the company has done numerous layoffs some of which include laying off people right before their maternity leave or right after. So my job doesn’t feel very secure. They also seem to truly not care about associates and the work they do. It’s very top heavy. I would get a 4 month paid leave unless they lay me off before.

I may have an opportunity to go to a new company. The culture seems great as well as their benefits. However, the downside is that I’d have to go into the office 2-3 a week which is an hour away from me. They said you can do half days which is nice but with a new baby coming and being a first time mom, I’m not sure I can handle it. Right now I’d be fine but once the baby is here, I don’t think I’d want to go back to the office. Also, I wouldn’t qualify for FMLA so my job and benefits aren’t necessarily protected. However, I do think I’d get some sort of paid leave.

Also, do you think a masters in cs would open more doors as opposed to a masters in bioinformatics? For bioinformatics, Juniata has an affordable program, but Northeastern seems more reputable.

1fn9cey,Just had my one year annual review and have mixed feelings. Am I overthinking this?,"This is my first full time office job so I apologize for my ignorance on this topic. But I just had my one year review and I think I got a pretty good raise... but I was wondering what this sub thinks? For some reason, I feel a tad nervous about it.

I came to this company with zero experience in the field. They offered me $22/hour. I was grateful but attempted to get a higher pay as I live in a HCOL state (CA). I tried to get $24/hour but they denied it, citing a lack of experience.

I accepted the offer anyways as I felt this job would be a good foot in the door and it would look good on a resume, and maybe a stepping stone to something better in a few years. I'd be getting some good experience and new skills. Plus the benefits are really good (full medical and dental, lots of PTO, paid holidays, 401k matching etc).

So fast forward a year later. Over the course of the year, $22 an hour in a HCOL area turned out to be harder than I thought it would be. I ended up getting a second job waiting tables to help me get by. I like my office job but the pay was just really low for this area. I'm single, have no kids, and live with roommates, so I have been getting by fine, but I've definitely been penny pinching a bit.

I started to thinking maybe I should job hunt and looking for something with higher pay. But changing jobs can be a paid, so I figured I'd at least TRY to get more money at my current job before bailing, as I do like it there and the people are cool.

I decided during my annual review, I would try to fight for a bit more money, as I know the norm for annual raises are like capped at about 5% (right...??). I figured I'd have nothing to lose anyways. My supervisors liked me and I've been getting praise all year long so I figured it was maybe worth a shot.

So the annual review came around. As expected, I got a good review and then I saw the raise they were giving me. Sure enough, it was 5% (from $22, to $23.10).

I then opened the discussion up about my pay. I said I don't think this pay aligns with my value to the team, and I'd like to see if $24.50 or $25 would be possible.

My supervisor seemed receptive and supportive and he definitely was encouraging about it. He said he's have to talk to the higher ups to see what they'd say.

I left his office feeling nervous but also hopeful.

The next day, the CFO emailed me asking me to come to his office. I then got even MORE nervous. I mean, the CFO?! I was sweating bullets.

I went to his office and he said, ""So... you want $25.00 huh?""

My voice was kind of shaking, and I said ""Yes...""

He said ""DONE"". And he presented me with the paperwork for me to sign off on it.

I was thrilled and couldn't believe it. I kept thanking him and he was so nice about it. He said, ""Well, I had to fight HR a little bit. I probably owe them a favor now. But you deserve it. You're great buddy.""

I was so grateful and happy.

Is this very unusual? I know $25/hour still isn't amazing or anything, but I'm happy I was able to get a $3.00 raise. I feel this is going to give me more breathing room and it definitely makes me want to stay with the company a bit longer to see how much more I can grow.

On the other hand, that little tidbit he said about HR is making me nervous as I definitely overanalyze. Could HR be mad at me? Could this end up screwing me over later on, maybe at my 2 year review. I'm scared they'll be like, ""Well, we gave you a generous raise last year, so this year you won't get one."" or something like that...

Idk, I'm happy but part of me just feels anxious for some reason. What do you guys think? Am I overthinking this?",BluebirdMaximum8210,4,0.8299999833106995,5,1727055668,2024-09-23 01:41:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fn9cey/just_had_my_one_year_annual_review_and_have_mixed/,9,2024
1fn7ypz,"ive worked 4 jobs before and just quit my current training for a new job, only 19, hopeless mentality","19M. i dont wanna give my life story here but its been pretty rough and im currently booked to see a psychiatrist soon. i think i have an issue where i quit a job the second i find it stressful. i might have depression or anxiety, but thats the whole point of booking a psychiatrist so moot point. i was extremely hyped and motivated on my first day (friday) and even when i got home it was fine for me. the next morning i was dreading going back in today to the point of tears so i called in and poured my heart out. saying i appreciate them giving me a chance and hiring me so fast and that im sorry for letting them down but its a me problem and i just let it all out to them while being as kind as possible.

i have a year of retail experience stocking and cashiering and being a closer (total all added up). 

i quit my first job because i was basically cross trained onto register and on my FIRST ever day there the boss threatened to drop my hours (only 8 fucking hours that week) if i couldnt sell enough store credit cards. he made me pitch to an obviously senile old lady and i was fed up with it about a week in.

my second job was fine, but my boss was a dick and rude to me toward the end and i cried in the bathroom, flat out couldnt handle it. i held this job down for 5 months.

third one i held for 6. i closed the store down and basically did everything but there was shit being talked about behind my back and there were too many responsibilities without enough appreciation. i could make 2 entire pages of bullets listing my responsibilities.

4th job, boss was a dick. it was overnight stocking so the hours made me depressed and think horrible things. messed with my cidcadian rhythm. 

so on paper, im looking for a job where i can apply skills ive already learned, a job thats during the day, a job with a boss that isnt a dickhead, a job where my responsibilities match my pay, and a job where im not constantly micromanaged.

could i have some advice or ideas? maybe stay away until i see my psych? i know this many jobs at this age is horrible but i am trying to be better or maybe even change my mentality. i only started to doubt myself my 3rd job in, i know im capable of working...

I actually love what I do. It’s fun, it’s fulfilling and everything I’ve wanted in a career. But My boss tells me I couldn’t move up again without him. Says that since he’s “the best at it , nobody else would be able to get me there.”The problem is, i hate working for him. I want to work for my bosses boss. He’s direct, straight to the point, and extremely business minded, and someone I want to learn from. If I move to any other people under the big boss I fear I will hate the environment based on everything I’ve heard. The current environment I’m working in just doesn’t work for me. There’s no morals, no team work, and my peers are just stuck up. See , no matter how far I get I will never forget where I came from and that’s their problem. The big boss said next year to try to move up, but I don’t think I can just stay till next year to try. I’m tired of working under someone that can’t apply the same pressure, has actually no loyalty at all so the relationship is rocky, doesn’t have the same energy to put into the team, can’t stand on business. And they sleep with a lot of employees which is a major 🚩but they just fire ppl under them.

Lesson learned.)( + there’s been fraud and whole bunch of other things that just get rewarded and promoted for doing it and it baffles me.)
I wish I could just take my current location and work for myself (bc it’s a beyond perfect creation I did here since I’ve fixed it) And I simply don’t know what to do.

1fn6ksw,Need advice desperately ,"Long story short, 2 years under an extremely abusive narcissistic boss. The mental gymnastics has consumed me. Not my first rodeo with a bad boss but I have never experienced this kind of treatment in my life. Its just evil honestly. You will have to take my word on that one. A decade of stellar high performance reviews in different departments at the same company. This person hates me on a personal level and is quite literally ruining my life.

I started to have some health problems I never experienced when the mental/verbal abuse started. Needed multiple procedures, tests, time off. Then my brother unexpectedly died in the most traumatic way. I took FMLA (manager was pissed about this tried to tell me I couldn't) the issue completely healed when I was on FMLA despite the grief I was dealing with. When I came back the health problem came back. This health issue is scary and it impacts my ability to work. My doctors have ran every test possible and the only explanation they came to was its my manager and this toxic environment. I kept asking if the Dr was sure and he said 100%, its in my medical file now. I do not sleep at night because I dread this constant state of anxiety I am in. I try to ignore it but over time abuse does a number on the mind and body. 

Quitting is not an option but an exit strategy and a fast one is crucial. 

Can I request a reassignment as an accommodation and attach my medical file where my doctor literally says this?

I am working as a software engineer for several years, and I am in the autonomous perception field (C++ + ML + etc). Recently, my company offered ""opt-out"" program so that people who are not aligned with the company goal can quit the job but can get 4-weeks salary + money for unused PTO.

The more I work on this field, the more I like doing system programming + low-level C/C++ coding rather than studying and researching Machine Learning. So, I was thinking that what if I can switch the field from ML to more of a system-related field(kernel dev or sensor device driver dev,... etc).

And, I have enough savings for minimum 6 months. (1 year is fine too)

Here are two choices,

1. Don't quit the job, do work for money, and after work, you can spend time on preparing interviews and learn kernel or system related stuff.
2. Quit the job, and spend my whole time doing leet-code for interviews and studying / developing kernel stuff. and find the related job!

I recently received an offer from a FAANG-like company based in Amsterdam, and I’ve signed it.

I did attempt to negotiate, but I feel like I didn’t do well. I was only able to secure a few extra RSUs, though not a significant amount. I really wanted to push for a signing bonus or a higher RSU package. I also tried to negotiate the base salary, but I wasn’t able to make any progress there and was at the end of the band they offered for this position (perhaps because I wasn’t sure how to approach it). That said, it’s still an above-average base salary for a high cost of living city like Amsterdam, with solid perks and a permanent contract. Plus, I don’t have a strong brand on my CV, having mostly worked for smaller companies.

Before I signed, the recruiter put a bit of pressure on me, mentioning that they had other candidates lined up. Fearing they might pull the offer and go with someone else, I decided to sign. 

The very next day, I got another offer from a company in Vienna, which, when adjusted for the cost of living, would be about the same in terms of take-home pay. Then, the day after that, my current company almost matched the FAANG-like offer in terms of base salary, although I don’t want to stay there. My current company would normally pay a yearly bonus (equivalent to roughly two months’ salary) on a pro-rated basis when someone leaves. I was counting on that, but after I declined their revised offer, they suddenly informed me that I would only receive it if I stay until January.

I’m having for an informal chat with the hiring manager soon.

**My question is**: Is it possible to tactfully ask for a signing bonus/extra RSUs after the contract is signed during my conversation with the hiring manager, or through the recruiter? Any ideas how to approach it or what to negotiate?  I realise this might fire back.  
  
Thanks for any insights!",throwaway_9_99,1,1.0,0,1727041497,2024-09-22 21:44:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fn4jbq/ask_for_joining_bonushigher_compensation_review/,9,2024
1fn4h45,Feeling disillusioned with my career ,"I left a very toxic job after 6 months and have been at a new job for 3 months now.

This new job is better but…not great. My manager is rude to our stakeholders, micromanages us (we have to track what we do each half hour on a spreadsheet despite the fact that we are all in our 30s with 10+ years of exeperience ), and he has zero empathy for our team (has unrealistic expectations) . It’s better than the last one— where my manager screamed at and berated employees— but it’s still not ideal.

I can’t leave this job because I was only at my last one for six months so I should probably stick here for at least two years (I was at my previous two jobs for six years each, but those were now two and three jobs ago).

I feel so disillusioned. I used to have a job that I loved until I moved, and am hopeless I will ever enjoy my job again.

This may be a dumb post…but is it possible to be happy with your job? Or is something not toxic the best I can hope for?",Vyse51,7,0.8899999856948853,5,1727041333,2024-09-22 21:42:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fn4h45/feeling_disillusioned_with_my_career/,9,2024
1fn4e5n,How do get 'leadership' experience?,"I work for a company that makes a very specific set of softwares that is used worldwide (GIS). I am an engineer with 4 yrs of consulting + 2 years working on product development.

I have been trying to get into companies ( civil engineering and/or  consulting)that use our software and I believe I am a great candidate since not only do I have diverse consulting experience, but also programming and development for the company that makes the very software.

Thrice I have been picked up for a call with hiring manager and the conversation goes great and I am told my skillsets are very unique and they'd love someone like me and then the conversation goes to leadership where they want to know how many people work under me. Except...I am not a manager! I am an engineer. In my company, going the manager direction is a complete departure from tech which is why I never pursued it even though I have been offered the position.


I talk about how I have managed projects with our distributiors and led various individual projects with a unique team under me( with examples) and I help with recruiting and training efforts.

Alas, thrice I have been rejected telling me that while they love my unique profile and my skillset, they would not proceed with me because they are looking for someone with more direct management skills with people reporting to them or working under them.


Is there anything I can do to get 'direct management' experience or some sort of certification to meet the criteria? 


TLDR: Rejected thrice because I don't have 'direct managerial'' experience. How do I get experience with management? I am already working on a scrum master certification.

1fn4dtx,38M in need of some direction!,"Hi,

I'm currently on a 2 year career break, it's for health reasons. I'm now in a much better position to start working again but I've lost a lot of confidence. I did study for Full Stack Software Development during my time off. I love software, love troubleshooting, problem solving, helping people. 

I used to work at a SaaS company for 14 years straight. It was a small start up vibe and I did everything from Customer/Tech Support, some Sales, Customer Success, Onboarding... that kind of stuff! Man who wears many hats, Jack of all trades, master of none kind of thing. I've a whole load of experience at this stage. I hate sales though is the only thing!

When I look at roles, I'm looking for Customer Success Manager roles but feel like I'm just under-qualified. I never specifically had a Customer Success 'title', apart from a small 6 month worth of experience in another company, just prior to my career break. I feel like this 6 month stint combined with a 2 year career break is a major red flag on the CV.

As a result, confidence... impostor syndrome is at an all time high. Now I want to set my targets lower and move into Customer Support again or Technical Support would be even better. It heavily leans into my love of tech, helping people and problem solving. Salary won't be great but that doesn't matter. 

Sorry about that long ramble. Here are my questions;

1 - How much of a red flag is the 6 month job combined with a 2 year career break. Do I bother adding that role to my CV or does it hinder me more? 

2 - Are there any other roles I could be looking out for, given my years of experience? (Anything but sales!).

The job market is tough right now, I enjoyed software development but a 1 year diploma just isn't enough to get a job right now. I'm thinking going into Customer Support/Tech Support with the hopes of transitioning to a developer role within the company down the line.

1fn4d6c,"Did I scam an old lady?
","Hey everyone! I found myself in an environment where the goal was to scam people, especially the elderly, and I wanted to vent a bit and see if anyone else has had similar experiences to the one I'm about to share. We've all encountered those door-to-door salespeople pushing energy contracts, right? Recently, I had a trial day and, believe it or not, we ended up scamming an elderly woman.

Let me start from the beginning: I’m a 22-year-old university student from northern Italy, with three years of experience in SEO analysis and copywriting. I was looking for a part-time job and after sending my resume to various marketing agencies, one of them reached out for an interview. The job ad was vague and didn’t specify the roles clearly, which didn’t surprise me since many ads are like that.

The interview took place at a well-known energy distribution company, and I soon learned that they managed several offices across Italy. I performed well and was offered a trial day for a ""Promoter Marketer"" position, which sounded vague. When I asked for clarification, the interviewer gave me a generic response about working systematically in sales, which seemed absurd to me. The interview ended with a hasty goodbye.

With only a few exams left, I decided to show up for the trial, even though it felt suspicious. I thought I’d be doing office work, but I was paired with a younger guy and our ""supervisor."" We took a bus to a rough area of the city, which struck me as odd. During the ride, they asked me a lot of personal questions while avoiding talk about the job until we stopped at a café. Instead of discussing the work, they talked about growth opportunities and how our ""supervisor"" became a team leader from the ground up. Finally, I realized it was a door-to-door sales job.

I always wondered whether these door-to-door energy sellers were independent contractors or actually employed by the companies. I learned that some of them were more ""legitimate,"" but regardless, their actions were still shady.

Now, about the trial day: it was unpaid, from 8 AM to 6 PM with one hour for lunch. As we went door-to-door, I noticed my partner was aggressively approaching potential clients. His main tactic was to say he was there because of a missed response on their bills, which was a lie. He claimed they needed to check if their last bill had only one rate, insisting that the other rates were illegal. It felt ridiculous, yet he was so confident. He misled clients into thinking they had to sign documents for their bills when it was actually automatic.

During our visits, he told customers the protection market was ending and they had to switch to the free market, distorting the truth. He preyed on the confusion surrounding changes coming in early 2024, disregarding that seniors over 75 could still remain in the protection market. Watching this unfold filled me with discomfort while he continued his web of deceit, convinced he was doing a great job.

I struggled to hold back tears when an elderly lady welcomed us in. He charmed her, gained her trust, and manipulated her, becoming aggressive if she showed any suspicion. Her husband had recently passed, and he leveraged that, telling her she needed to switch immediately or face legal issues. Eventually, she signed a contract with insurance attached.

Angry, I decided to waste his time and stuck around until the end of the day. I got hired due to my communication skills, but on my first official day, I didn’t show up, wasting their time. There were three other candidates sent away because I was chosen, and I hope they don’t fall for it again. I suspect the whole competition thing was just a manipulation tactic.

Now, I'm considering what actions to take—whether to report them or complain to the parent company. I’m open to suggestions! I’d also love to hear your experiences with dishonest companies like this one.

Just to clarify, I knew it was a scam and got involved out of boredom and a lack of self-preservation instincts! HAHAHA.",Snoo-67870,0,0.5,3,1727041035,2024-09-22 21:37:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fn4d6c/did_i_scam_an_old_lady/,9,2024

I finally saw my doctor a week later Friday the 20th after being fired and he wrote a note stating ""Patient was seen today, but has been sick since Friday the 13th"". Is that good enough?

1fn1whz,Should I tell my manager that I'm already burnt out?," I (27M) have recently been hired by a big company for a CS-related position . It involves taking calls from people who've had breakdowns or crashed their car, so it's more like an emergency service than actual CS. Long story short, I have come to the realisation that I'm simply not cut out for the job and it's causing me several issues.

 Though at first it was fine, over the course of 3 months I have started feeling more and more anxious about my tasks, which basically means i'm in a constant state of ""panic"" due to the fact that I never know what's gonna happen with my next call. It could be someone who's in a dangerous situation, or some pissed off guy who's going to shout at me for what feels like forever (I'm particularly sensitive which of course doesn't help).

That said, over time I have started experiencing lack of motivation to do anything, general tiredness, panic attacks, and I have started leaning more and more towards weed, binge eating and nicotine. 

I want to talk to my manager about how I feel and ask whether she would be fine with me seeking a position in other departments (there's a constant flow of new positions opening up so it shouldn't take too long). Possibly something more backoffice-oriented or where there's less pressure.

My manager is someone who generally appreciates honesty and whom I've seen helping out her employees on several occasions. What's holding me back is the fact that i've been here for a very short time and I haven't ever talked much to my manager, so I l'm not really sure how she would react..

1fn1u08,Is an MS the correct next step?,"I graduated from a tier 1 college in India with a dual major in physics and electronics with decent grades. I had a good number of projects and internships in software and ML (no publications tho).
I got a job right out of college as a data engineer/ steward at a top tier financial company and l've been here for 2 years now. I recently found out that I wouldn't have much growth where I work because of oversaturation of folks in my role and very few openings for a people leader position (this is the only next step at the company). A lot of my work functions stopped involving coding applications a few months ago. I was a little confused about what to do about it and the market wasn’t conducive to a job switch at the time so l stayed hoping that things would work out. (I also got promoted in that time so that motivated me to stay a little longer i guess). My team is a little toxic too. I had an opportunity to switch roles internally a few months ago after I was promoted and the leaders tried to convince me to stop the shift. Eventually I had to say yes because I figured id go to grad school and I needed an LoR. (Idk if this helps but I’m a girl and something I’ve noticed the past 2 years was that a lot of the folks here tend to either behave creepily or condescend and treat your career like it’s a hobby. Wanting to leave the country also slightly contributed to me wanting to go to grand school) 
I almost decided to go for an MBA because I hadn’t had the opportunity to contribute to anything tech related for a while. l've had some free time the past couple of months where I got to thinking and figured I want to get back into ML. My projects and related internships were the only times where I could remember truly enjoying my work. I didn't have a lot of time to get into research back in undergrad due to the extensive course work since I had a double major and I needed to get good grades. I still picked up some projects and have an undergrad thesis in the field (unpublished). I am thinking of applying for a masters in data science or similar programs (something like an MSCS/MS EECS with an ML track) but I am a little worried about it looking like I’ve been all over the place. I know that this is what I want to do but I am concerned that the whole thing might sound a bit erratic to an admissions committee/potential emplover. 

Am I doing the right thing here? What can I do to solidify my profile in this area given my background? I am open to taking up MOOCs and projects. I would happily pick up something from mit ocw or YouTube but I understand that anything certified might help my case more in the current situation. Any suggestions here would be greatly appreciated.

I have recently been having some thoughts about my current position and moving on. This has brought a couple of problems (they seem like good problems to have) to the front of my attention. I stumbled into this job (got promoted in my time here) as my second job out of college with only ~1 YOE in an unrelated field before hand. This position has been great for my career growth and allowed me to end up in a operations/engineering manager position very early in my career (~3 years total out of college). In this position I am paid well for my role and experience however I'm considering leaving due to location and some of the politics around the role and the small company it's a part of. The problem I run into when looking/applying for positions is anything considered a lateral move(in title/responsibilities/pay) requires many more years of experience than I have to show on my resume even if I preform the same job functions. This has all left me feeling a little stuck. I'm not very keen on the idea of taking a non-management role as that is one of the biggest hurdles in a career that I have already crossed but I'm not sure I can stay here much longer. I feel that if I could get in the room passed a resume screen I would be able to navigate an interview fairly efficiently but that doesn't seem like it will happen at this point. All of this to say, I'm looking for some general advise on what I can do in this position? Do I just need to keep applying? Do I need to hold out and just grind through my early career?

1fn0iuo,Does anyone take two 30 minute lunches (unpaid) instead of one 60 minute? ,"I'm just feeling out of this is worth asking my boss. I'm newer to this position, and don't want to seem unreasonable.

I have an 8-5 job which involves a morning meeting and afternoon meeting and at least a couple hours of documentation for each. The meetings often start later than scheduled, and can take longer than expected as well. I much prefer to do as much of my documentation right after the meeting so I don't confuse the two at the end of the day. By the time I'm ready to take a lunch I don't have enough time for a full hour. It makes \*a lot\* more sense to take two half hour lunches. 

My boss is very hands off and works across town. The workplace culture seems that as long as you do your 8 hours and start your lunch before 3:30pm you're good. Obviously the law wouldn't say that, but if the individual wants to do it that way, they don't care. As long as you're not taking your lunch the last hour of the day and leaving early...

I just haven't heard anyone take two 30 minute lunches.  I feel like some places wouldn't like that because its harder to track who's had their full lunch and guaranteed to be around...

Does anyone do their lunch hour this way? ",papayameow,4,0.6499999761581421,10,1727031047,2024-09-22 18:50:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fn0iuo/does_anyone_take_two_30_minute_lunches_unpaid/,9,2024

1fmzu4o,"My fiancée (27/F) is having conflicting feelings about her current career-path, and continues to have thoughts on completely changing careers. I will always support her, but it’s also important to be realistic. What would you do?","Hello everyone.

My fiancée (27/F) currently works in accounting/cost-compliance, having received her BS and MS in accounting, as well as having gone through the grueling process of becoming a licensed CPA. Her journey has been an incredible, absolutely impressive set of accomplishments.

She's been in her current job for a little over a year now. And, truthfully, it's the corporate-version of hitting the jackpot: she makes around $140K gross; she gets along great with her boss and coworkers; she only goes to the office once a week (is able to WFH for the rest of the time), and -- truthfully -- she typically works only around 25-30 hours a week.

Lately, she has expressed that she has felt bored with her job/career-choice, to which I believe the latter aspect in my preceding paragraph is playing a huge role in her feeling this way. She has mentioned on a few occasions that she has considered exploring other career-opportunities to further ""challenge herself"". Specifically, she has expressed interest in learning more above the various science-related fields and geology.

A quick aside, that I think is to specify here:

• She sleeps a LOT -- it's typical that she needs at least 9 hours a day to ""properly function"", if not more. She also has an incredibly hard time waking up early. What's been typical with her current job, is that she'll wake up at 8am, login to check her e-mails, then go back to sleep for another ~2 hours or so.

• She despises going into the office. She is all aboard on the WFH-train. I can understand that, lol.

• She is not a great traveler.

• She is a bit of a germaphobe.

• This sounds a bit random, but she gets overheated and chilly VERY easily. It's a thin temperature-band in which she is comfortable.

Okay, back to the situation at hand. She has expressed wanting to learn more about the various sciences/geology fields as potential career-switches. Meanwhile, my gut feeling is that, even if she were to pursue those various fields, she will grow to hate them over time.

I believe that a given career/job can be broken down into the following aspects: the subject-matter at hand, and the day-to-day processes that support the subject-matter at hand. I 100% believe that she has the mental aptitude to learn and go after whatever she wants. However, as harsh as it might sound, I believe the day-to-day processes of being a scientist/geologist is something that is not properly tailored to her strengths.

I know from one of my closest friends, that being a geologist -- a field in which the subject-matter, in my opinion, is absolutely fucking cool and fascinating -- is GRUELING work. A lot of the job entails field-work, for which I believe she would easily fall ill due to being too cold or too hot. Also, geologists have to travel a LOT for work -- which, again, she is not good at. And, the fact that she's outside, is going to make her VERY dirty.

Meanwhile, I would imagine that being some sort of scientist involves primarily working in some sort of laboratory-environment. So, WFH seems out of the picture. Also, there's probably a lot of gross-stuff that goes on in these labs that would make her squeamish. And, she'd probably have to travel a lot for that, too.

I mention all of this, and I haven't even touched upon the fact that you'd likely have to go back to school and get a whole new Bachelor's AND Master's or PhD to even pursue these fields.

I want to do whatever I can to help her, other than just listen to her and give the aforementioned advice. A recommendation that I had was for her to train herself on how to program -- a very in-demand skill set to have; low upfront-cost (e.g., certificates compared to a full-fledged degree); it would absolutely challenge her but she'd have the mental aptitude to pursue it; and is probably the likeliest field that will allow her the flexibility to WFH.

Wow, long-winded… if you were her -- OR me -- what would you do in this situation?

Thanks for listening.",DatesAndCornfused,5,0.8600000143051147,6,1727029290,2024-09-22 18:21:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmzu4o/my_fiancée_27f_is_having_conflicting_feelings/,9,2024

1fmylhq,"How to Politely Decline Additional Tasks at work
","Hello Everyone ! 

  
TLDR: I am looking for a bit of advice on how to tell my manager I won't do the extra task he's put on my already full plate.



Good Evening all !

Background: I work in the MENA region, where everyone specially brown people (majority of the population here), in their early career years are ""expected"" to ""over - perform and over work"", due to their ""replace-ability"". 

I work at a pretty huge MNC here who can very much afford to pay me a good enough sum of monthly salary that I believe I deserve, but doesn't due to my boss. everyone at the company makes good enough money for their hours of work, except the department that I am a part of which is Operations, that is because of my boss ! ... I know this, because I see their monthly salaries get debited, so I am a 100% sure of this. 

  
Problem : Long story short, my boss keeps putting more and more shit on my plate, despite of me telling him that we need a new hire, but he wants the ""yearly bonus"" to himself so keeps avoiding my concerns, so I've left telling him that. For context, there are 2 people managing the entire accounting work, me & him, and there is **ALOT** of work, let me tell you that. now, last Wednesday while I was working from home, he had arranged a call for a ""new task"" , that I would be taking over from another employee within our team, I was unaware of the same, and the online call was during lunch time, so I told my boss , if he could take this call and brief me on the same later, that's when he said, ""No you gotta be on the call, since you'll do this new XYZ task here on"" .. I was shocked ! because just in July of this year he manipulated me into taking on a whole new task which takes a lot of my time and paid me peanuts for the same, since I'm pretty new at this corporate crap, I wasn't able to understand back than, but for the ""raise"" I said, sure , signed the new job descriptions etc. now fast forward to this new ""task"", I dont want to take this on , because : 

1. This is an admin related task, and I hate doing admin work since I'm good at only accounting work, shout out to all those in the admin field, but just that my brain doesn't work the best at this type of work.

2. I want to create ""boundries"", the more I take on work wise from him, the more he'll keep putting on my pate, instead of hiring new employees, thinking I have ""capacity"". 

  
Therefore, please suggest how I should tell him a **NO** for the new task, I haven't spoken to him about this yet, as I plan to do it in person , when I'm at the office next , which would be tomorrow (Monday). 



Thanks ! ",Significant-Row486,1,0.6600000262260437,4,1727026019,2024-09-22 17:26:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmylhq/how_to_politely_decline_additional_tasks_at_work/,9,2024
1fmyfcf,Career Anxiety ,"
Hey everyone,

I need to vent a little today because I'm feeling pretty anxious about my career. As the title suggests, I'm really worried about where things are headed. I'm 25 and working in a well-known core company, earning around 60k a month. The pay is decent, but the problem is, I feel stuck. I’ve been doing the same work since I started, and there’s no real opportunity for upward growth.

Unlike the IT field, where job switching seems easier, I don’t have that flexibility. Sometimes I see the salaries in the IT sector, and it's hard not to compare. They’re earning lakhs each month, and while I know money isn’t everything, it’s hard not to think about it. My annual raise is only about 8%, and to be honest, I’m not even sure I like this job—I’m just doing it for the paycheck.

The thing is, I don’t even know what I want out of my career. I feel lost and confused about what I’m passionate about, and I don’t understand how people end up finding jobs they genuinely love.

Has anyone else felt stuck or unhappy in their career? How did you manage to move forward? ",Wild-Memory1002,1,1.0,0,1727025559,2024-09-22 17:19:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmyfcf/career_anxiety/,9,2024
1fmy72f,Should i fake my reference?,"Joined a small family run business where the directors were openly abusive, sexist, racist and vindictive.

It was a remote job and i was fired for literally answering questions but those answers they didn't agree with. Fired on charges of underperformance.

The work was directly relevant to my career and I have to put it down on my CV because I actually did learn a lot.

These a holes are so vindictive, that they haven't provided me with an experience certificate since 6 months.

Now I need a reference - if they even respond, they will make the worst stuff about me and present me as unhireable. All ex employees have either deleted their LinkedIn or not updated it as they are known to contact the new employer and mess things up for them.

I can't get a reference from my colleagues as all outgoing mail is monitored. A link where they can put down my details has worked before but not every HR is flexible enough to do that.

I know this is highly unethical but what if i register a domain and create a similar email id, provide that to the new company and write the reference myself. 

Most companies won't bother verifying if its the right email ID, some might.

What should I do?

1fmy44l,Interviewing for new Sales Role at top SaaS firm - should I make the switch?,"I currently work at a top hardware tech firm, was an account manager and recently moved laterally to SDR/outbound focused role to improve sales acumen in hopes of getting high-paying AE position internally or externally in a few years. Switching would lead to lower base pay but higher overall earnings potential. Current base pay is 80k (no quota for now), new position projects around 110k-125k OTE per glassdoor (60/40 split). 

I have experience working in sales and managing existing relationships, but the outbound and cold-calling domain is still relatively new to me, it wasn't a huge priority in my account manager role. I am not sure how good I will be at this skill but believe I will learn with enough time. New role is AE title and similar outbound responsibility, current role is associate title, but clear 9 month timeline to promotion + already invested 1 month of training. 

I have good existing relationships at current firm from my prior role, but fear that leaving so soon after moving to a new role + over a month of training invested would leave a sour taste in their mouth. This sour taste would mainly be with new management - old management and co-workers would still vouch for me. 

Other considerations - current role is 3 days in office a week with lots of flexibility on when I can come and go, 25 min commute one way. New role is 4-5 days a week in office, unsure how flexibility on when I can come and go and 1-hour commute one way - but would move closer to the job site so that the commute would be cut down to less than 15 mins ideally. 

Any insights or considerations that I may have missed would be greatly appreciated. I believe if I can convince the new firm to get to the higher range of pay, I will leave my current role. What do you think?

1fmwsy3,What online certification should i invest in ,"I graduated high school five months ago, and throughout that time, I said I was going to get into tech. But now that I’m out, I’m not sure if that’s really for me. What I want is a stable job. I’m not looking to become a millionaire or anything like that. I also don’t want to deal with a lot of competition. 

I’m not a bad learner, but I don’t want to go to school for too long. Plus, I don’t want to work a traditional 9-to-5 job, five days a week. I’ve been considering becoming a radiology technician and going to school for two years to do it. Hospital jobs tend to be stable, and the idea of working three 12-hour shifts a week really appeals to me. 

However, while I’m still deciding if that’s what I really want to do, I need a job to support myself in the meantime. I’ve noticed that no one is hiring for basic jobs right now, and for the better jobs, you need to have some sort of skill. I want to earn a certificate or learn a skill that can help me get a good job while I’m in school or figuring out my career path.

In terms of a long-term career, I know I don’t want to sit around all day—I like moving around and being active. I’d also love a job where I can travel, and I prefer hands-on work. I’m not competitive, but I know that if I put my mind to something, I’ll be good at it.

I have heard that insurance companies like to hire people with my degree especially after they have their Certified Rehabilitation Counselor (CRC) certification. It also sounds like there are advancement opportunities in the area of insurance and chances to earn more with more experience, moving into more senior positions, etc. what are some good areas I could get in the area of insurance?

 I have looked at some jobs in the university setting, but the pay is only little better than I am making now. While I see more advance or lateral move opportunities that could earn more money than my current job, I feel worried about my income increases being subject to the government signing off on it. I have heard that sometimes university employees go years without getting a raise or cost of living increase. Also, due to the compounding inflation and wages not keeping up, I feel like I should consider all of my options.

1fmw7qa,Interviewing for a new position that is only $7k more than my current role.. same job. Do I take it?,"TLDR: is making a lateral move for only $7k more and no bonus plan worth it for potential growth?

I’ve been at my current company for 7 years. They are so cheap and I’ve had to use offer letters to get my last big raise, 5 years ago. I was promoted to PM from PC and it entailed a $5k raise for 10x more amount of work, 100x the stress and 70% more hours. They matched the offer but since then my annual raises have been $1.5k. A $7k increase would take another 5 years to achieve, and I’m not that patient. We do have a quarterly bonus plan and it can be nice- it’s based off profit margins. I got $9k in bonuses this year but I’ve told management countless times I rather have an increase in salary than a bonus because I count on my bonuses to make ends meet. 

I’ve been interviewing with this company, which happens to be a competitor and that was NOT intentional.. just so happens to be the only company to reach back out as I’ve been looking for a new job for 3 years now. 

I’ve been on maternity leave for 4 months and go back tomorrow. This new company would want me to start in early October and they said there is growth but I’m afraid to ask about the timeline for that to avoid sounding desperate. 

I’m afraid to make the switch because:
1- it’s a lateral move and sounds just as stressful as my current job
2- it’s not a big increase and still below average market value. I’m hoping I can still negotiate this
3- I will need to learn a new job while watching my baby (I can’t afford daycare and my husband commutes). They said there’s a 2 year learning curve.
4- no bonus plan but they have stock options 

But I also want to make the switch because:
1- $7k increase = 5 years of raises at my current company 
2 - I need growth. I’ve been showing current employer why I deserve promotion to senior pm. I make them A LOT of money
3- I’ve been job hunting for 3 years and this is the first bite. The job market seems to really suck and probably my resume lol ..
4- hoping annual raises will be more


I really don’t know what to do and I’m hoping more experienced folks could possibly chime in?? I don’t think my current employer will match again and they know I struggle to make ends meet with my current salary.

I have been in similar roles (csm, account management) years ago getting paid much more so I feel very confident in saying my salary should be minimum 80k + from my current 70k pay rate.


My manager also told me I was expected to be comfortable around 6 months to 1 year with leading client meetings and I have already done that month two and I am managing multiple projects leading big deployments on my own.I also tend to overextend and jump on new projects to streamline and better processes. For instance I asked to join the technical meetings to understand everything my customer is pursuing and was intending on managing the software deployment opportunity.

I recently asked HR to adjust my salary from 70k to 80k and I brought up my points. I felt a bit gaslit because both HR and my manager said I am just doing what I am expected to do. But my point is I need to pay more especially because I problem solve for my whole team and step in for other employees constantly. She said shell get back to me next week but I was wondering if she brings a number that I would be really displeased by - is it crass to ask to drop some of my projects and straight up say since this is above my pay grade I do not see myself needed here.

Please advise my heads in circles!! Thank you

I have enough savings to quit but with this brutal job market I rather just stay and stop overachieving?

I'm good with numbers, language (english, mainly), and I'm great at arguing. I prefer working alone to in a group. So, high on creativity and logic, low on tolerance for people (i can work 1 on 1 with clients/coworkers and have experience but don't want to end up stuck in constant group work). Mainly, I don't want to be so bored I consider dying but I also want to have a stable and at least decently paying career (that leaves time/flexibility for other things in life, or where i can be choosy about my hours and how i deal with my workload). 

After writing/editing, some jobs/paths I've thought about wanting to do have been:
-law (concerns mainly about needing to leave my country and the education no longer applying)
-business/finance (main concern is that i'd become deathly bored)
-cybersecurity (not really my first choice but i've heard it's a good, stable option)
-engineering (never caught my interest before, but i think it's in demand and applicable to several fields)

Please give me some advice on what career paths can suit my strengths and weaknesses, and if you have any of the above careers please tell me how it's going for you and what you like/dislike about it. Thank you!

1fmspzg,"Career advice, Product manager here in a US based firm. ","Hello there ! 

I am currently working as a VP (lead product manager) at the third or fourth largest bank in the US. I recently got a promotion (a month ago) along with team change and the work is exciting as it’s pertaining to the usecases in GenAI (which is pretty hot right now). Prior to this, I was working on Payment products (again, great experience). 

I decided to go for an internal job opening because I sensed that the market hasn’t been great. 

Now the dilemma I have is that day before a recruiter from the top/best bank in the US called me for the same VP role on a payments product ( I have already worked on this exact product before, but I think there might be added responsibilities like managing more than one teams - I am not sure). The brand of this company is great, and one to have on the resume. 

What should I do ? Should I even attempt the interview process? Let’s say if I do get through, as I feel that there are chances as I have the exact skill set that they’re looking for, should I accept the offer ? It’ll obviously come with a good hike. But on the other hand is my current team where I am working on a hot technology of GenAI. 

So on one hand there’s this hot technology, and a great team. On the other hand there’s the best bank, best company, good money. 

I have a hunch that I should stick it out here even if it’s lesser money because having a hot technology in the armour might give me good long term opportunities. And hope that after a year even if I don’t like the current role and work, or if the GenAI hype goes down, I can still try by applying at the other firm (for whatever options will be available at that time). I just hope the delayed gratification works in my favour somehow. 

Note - both roles are in India. ",AspectNo9211,2,1.0,1,1727010044,2024-09-22 13:00:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmspzg/career_advice_product_manager_here_in_a_us_based/,9,2024
1fmsobc,Looking for Advice - Career Change,"Earlier this year, I sold my business after 8 years. We had an insurance agency that was profitable and growing, but due to contract changes, underwriting adjustments, commission reductions, and brain dead management, I decided to pursue a new opportunity with a much larger company. 

After 9 months I am realizing that the new company sold me on many of their systems and processes. I “drank the kool aid”. I am still doing well and achieving mid pack levels of success. 

More recently I was approached for a management position with a different company. My role would include recruiting, training, and assisting junior level advisors. This is the direction I have wanted to go in for years now. You could say this is my “dream” job. With that being said, what questions should I be asking? What type of operational processes should I be concerning myself with? Any other advice would be great.

1fmsbnu,"I work for my dad, and things are not good at work/at home and I am trying to decide what to do?","(25M) So here is the context: My dad owns a sign company where we manufacture custom signage for business. I used to work in production for a few years to learn the business etc, then I went to college and got my degree in Business Administration. Graduated, came back to work for him as an outside sales rep. My sales numbers are pretty good, however I basically don't have 8 hours of work to do during the day. The company is struggling due to debt and its just not something that can be solved by myself getting more sales. There is a LOT of debt. He let go our receptionist, and now the other sales person runs around doing everybody elses job instead of her own. So now, instead of helping me grow into a leadership position I am our defacto secretary for the other sales rep, which requires me to have to sit in my office 8 hours a day with nothing to do, just to wait and see if the phone rings. Remember I am an outside sales rep on salary which means my main responsibilites are to sell signage and go chase leads physically out of the building. Now, not only do i not have 8 hours of work, I also am forced to just sit in the office and wait for the phone. 

Many times over the last 6 months I have been paid late, had my paychecks bounce, received commission late etc. I have trouble paying my bills and loans on time which results in late fees and trouble budgeting because commission is already uncertain, but when it arrives late it causes even more stress on me. Not only that, my projects are consistently late because the other sales rep, who my dad is engaged to, consistently undermines me when trying to manage my projects and my dad and her have basically stripped me of any responsibility. Over the past 8-9 months I've politely and professionally brought this to his attention and he literally screamed and raged at me in the office about it saying if i wasnt his son I would have already been fired. This makes no sense to me because I'm literally ASKING for more work to do and more responsibility. Since then, I have decided to apply to law school for next year and forget this company and its mismanaged character. My dad also made me sell my car in order to receive a company car, which means when I leave I will have to get a car. I don't know what to do as I've been having no luck getting interviews for a new job, and even if I did I don't have a car. I'm debating taking my next commission check on friday and getting a beater car for like 2500 bucks and then getting a new job ASAP. There is much more than just what I've mentioned here but what is the smartest thing to do here, objectively?

1fmrgu2,"i want to switch career paths, but im scared","im currently a med student. although im proud to have made it this far, i dont think i can do another 4-6 years of this for basically nothing but debt until after residency. the workload and the isolation has destroyed my physical and mental wellbeing. my loved ones see nothing but a husk of a man. i cant keep lying to myself- i cant do this anymore. however, if i continue in medicine, i will be able to secure a better future for myself and my family in a world that is increasingly expensive. i feel stuck here, as ive already loaned out well over $100k, and i do really enjoy medicine. but the demands of this particular university program are making me miserable. at the end of the day- if i cant secure a suitable alternative, im not going to risk the switch.

im looking for career path that is more affordable, has a healthy work life balance, and will be able to sustain a lifestyle in a major city. i am able to afford another type of education- my main issue is the time off my life that medicine requires before returning a profit. so i just wanna be transparent about limitations.

a couple of deal breakers...

1) no government jobs: i am from a country that is definitely not aligned with the government of the country i currently live in. my background could cost me the ability to apply for these jobs or truely perform well in them. by extension, the military is absolutely out of the question, on solid moral ground.

2) excessive commuting: unless its highly rewarding, i cant afford travel expenses (in terms of time and money). i also have terrible motion sickness- i can pop a dramamine to sleep through flights, but long drives would be torture. i do genuinely love traveling regardless, but as a career it will simply depend on the logistics of required travel. i guess its not truely a deal breaker, but it is a factor that causes reduced flexibility.

3) tech savvy: quite frankly- i dont like technology very much. im of a generation that should be technologically adept, but im not. i also find staring at a screen all day extremely depressing and boring, but in this day and age, i might have to live with that. remote work im very happy to do, but not working in tech bc realistically i do not have the aptitude for it. if i were to give a reference for my technological competence- i can work with the bare bone basics of coding. outside of technology, in academic or non academic fields, i would be able to adapt. i am fortunate to have a wide set of interests and skillsets to aid in many lines of work, from quantum physics to traditional art.

4) seeing hurt children/animals: emotionally, i cant handle it. if i have to i will but over an extended period of time, it would crush me. its also the reason why even in medicine, i never wanted to be a pediatrician, and before medicine, i never wanted to be a veterinarian.

5) longer education: if it will take another 4+ years to get another education for it, i might as well stay in medicine. getting a phd or going into law wont be the best idea in terms of practicality, though if it helps suggestions, law has been reccomended to fit my strengths many times. as with medicine, the path to get there requires a sacrafice of time and wellbeing to an extent in which i debate its worth, but if i am misinformed, id love to hear from those who work in the legal field as well.

6) 100k+ salary: i know the job market is extremely terrible regardless of my degrees and experience, and this might not be realistic. a big draw in medicine was relative job security, and sacraficing that is something i need to be ready for. but in turn, i dont want to settle for pennies and would like to make 6 figures upon entry or within the first 2 years. the salary limit is not bc i am materialistic, but because i need to pay off my debt and i want to support my parents so they can retire. they deserve better than working themselves ragged into their 60s and 70s. i want to do right by them while still maintaining my independence and not having to move back in with them.

7) sex work, marijuana, alcohol, ect: i wish i didnt have to explicitly say this, but after reflecting on a few weird responses ive gotten, unfortunately i have to. i mean absolutely no disrespect to these types of workers, but it is not something i can see myself being comfortable with. i want a professional career i can be proud of, so these subjects are not tolerable to bring into my life. even if it is the difference of millions, compromising my morals is not worth the money.

i cant think of anything else, but ill update as needed. i think once i know what options exist out there for me, ill be able to narrow it down based on my qualifications. currently, i cant find anything that fits my goals that isnt a government job, so im opening the question to the collective societal experience of others. thank you all so much for taking the time to read this and providing your advice, help, and input- i deeply appreciate it :)",snorlax_tgap,4,0.8299999833106995,4,1727005958,2024-09-22 11:52:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmrgu2/i_want_to_switch_career_paths_but_im_scared/,9,2024

","I am 22 years old and recently graduated college with a major in Sociology. Searching for jobs for the time-being hasn't been great so I wanted to use my ""free-time"" and learn pressure washing/window cleaning. I found a company (that I accepted the offer) to learn the skills for a few months and hopefully branch off into my own venture/starting a business from it. My parents and finance want me to look for a a career with better opportunities but I want to be flexible with my time, pay is higher, and I love to hustle and communicate with people! I want to make the most of my time and offer services that feels fulfilling while building my brand. I like being comfortable but I just see myself doing a ""9-5"" or at an office job. $100,000 would be awesome but I would be really comfortable with $70,000 at least. And I know that I can get that with my business if I hustle and grind hard enough.

I am lost and just want guidance if what I am doing is out of the norm. I just want to provide for my family in the future and just want the flexibility because I would hate to tell my kids that ""I will miss their recital because of work."" My parents and sister are just bashing my idea of running a business and how I would have to be on the clock 24/7 and that it is not good for when I am 50 or 60 years old.

As of right now, my plan is to work for the pressure washing company (learning everything I can) while applying for jobs. But will do the pressure washing on the side until it takes off hopefully.

I'm open to exploring various option as I don't think there are a lot of options for my passion 'Racing' (Rally Racing mainly). I found Chauffeur, Personal Driver, and various other options like DriveU etc...

I was thinking about Racing, but I have no idea where to go or what to do or even where to start. It would be really helpful if you could lead me some path or ways. It is really my passion and I will be really grateful for any advices you can give me.

If not Racing, I am also looking for a role that offers Growth Prospects, Decent Pay (enough to support family), Opportunities to learn new skills etc... Considered joining taxi services like DriveU, but DriveU is not in my state and in Banglore I heard from a friend that drivers are more than customers and it's near to impossible to make a decent pay with that little work. I considered DriveU because it really offers flexibility and all. I am exploring into Chauffeur Services as I have a lots of experience with long drives.

Has anyone pursued a Driving Career? If so, what are your experiences? Any advice or leads are greatly appreciated.

However, I know quants are meant to have academic excellence and do maths competitions, have multiple A*s in relevant subjects etc.

However, my A level subjects were English Literature, History and Maths for which I got A*, A, B

I also haven't competed in any maths competitions or started to learn coding yet

Do you think I can still become a quant given my irrelevant A level subjects and the fact that I got a B for maths, and haven't really showcased exceptional maths abilities?

1fmnji7,"Was offered a lateral position within same company, informed manager, and they countered with a promo to the next level which is about a 30% salary increase. Should I take an internal counter","I have been looking for a new role for about a year now, internally within my company... I was able to land 2 offers, but both are lateral moves (same band level). I am willing to take one of them due to the scope of projects/perceived work-life balance etc.. 

I informed my manager of these offers and he was excited for me, assuming I had landed 2 offers at the above band level as this was apart of my development that we have been working on for the past year. I informed that it was a lateral move, and he quickly countered by stating that it'd be smarter to just take a counter on my current team of the promo into the new band level to allow for me to move within the company at that band level much easier.

This at a quick glance looks like a great deal  
1. I take a lateral and get a 5% salary increase (I cant move internally for 12 months)  
2. I take the counter offer and get a promo into the next band and a 30% salary increase (I must sit in the role for 18 months before looking elsewhere internally)

The reason(s) I wanted to search elsewhere: 

1. I got bored of my current project scope.. I ultimately want to take on new projects and on my current team its same project every year
   1. This would be something I want to inform my manager of if I were to accept the counter.. This is the main reason for looking elsewhere
2. Work-life balance: This role sometimes required after work hours and even weekend crunch to launch projects... the new team (lateral move) does not seem to have this issue
   1. For 30% more increase, this might not be that much of an issue, at least in the short term 12months or so

  
Those are the main reasons I looked elsewhere.. My question here is: Based on what everyone on the internet usually tells you.. to never take a counter offer from your current employer, because it will cause friction, more responsibility, etc... In the event that this is a internal move.. would you suggest maybe taking this counter offer to get an extreme salary increase of \~30% (this is comparable to external offers), or would you think this is a bad move and to ultimately take the lateral and grind up from there to maybe get a shot in a year's time at that band level promo",Technical_Drawing_45,1,1.0,3,1726989463,2024-09-22 07:17:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmnji7/was_offered_a_lateral_position_within_same/,9,2024

I've considered going into some type of trade, but they don't seem like the answer people present them as. I've tried researching how to get into trades in my area such as electrical or plumbing, but I haven't gotten a clear straightforward answer. It seems like a lot of people who get into trades have someone to help get them into it which is something I don't have. People have said to join something called a trade union, which I've researched that, and from I've gathered, it can literally take months just to get an interview for one, and many people still get rejected.

1fmlmyh,"Recently accepted a contract role, noticed they updated the JD with a range higher than what i was told","I had an old coworker reach out asking if I’d be interested in a contract role and that it would be mine if i did. Whilst casually meeting the team, I was told by the manager to apply through the portal to satisfy the HR process. During this meeting he also mentioned the salary would be 75-85k. I asked if 85k was the highest and he mentioned he could probably squeeze for 90k.

When officially offered the role he said he got my 90k approved. Honestly, I still wanted more but decided to accept it because I respected he offered me what I thought was the top end. 

Later, I noticed the job posting on a different website which included a range of 95k - 116k. This was my first time seeing this and I made sure to look through the job posting for it when I was applying… so I’m not sure when it was updated.

I’ve already accepted the role but am curious what you would do in this situation. ",Sad-Competition9062,4,0.75,7,1726981497,2024-09-22 05:04:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmlmyh/recently_accepted_a_contract_role_noticed_they/,9,2024
1fml64t,Finished UPSC Coaching... Now I'm Stuck. What Should I Do?,"

Hey folks,

So here I am, fresh out of UPSC coaching with a bag full of notes, 100 hours of lectures, and an existential crisis. 😵‍💫 I thought coaching would be my golden ticket to IAS land, but now it feels like I’ve been dropped into the Bhool Bhulaiyaa of self-study, with no guide except Google and my old school ""wing it"" strategies.

Here’s the deal:

Coaching ka jhakaas promise vs. my reality: Coaching was like those “Before” and “After” transformation ads. In class, everything felt like a smooth journey to Lal Bahadur Shastri Academy, but now I’m at home, staring at my desk like, “Yeh sab kuch coaching mein toh tha, par padhna kaise hai bhai?” 😐

Notes ka bhandar, dimaag ka andar: My coaching notes look like the Bhagavad Gita, Bible, and Quran all merged into one. Every time I open them, my brain says, ""Main kaun hoon, main kahaan hoon?"" How am I supposed to revise this mountain of information without losing my mind?

Syllabus is a never-ending Game of Thrones episode: Just when you think you’re done, boom—there’s another kingdom (or subject) to conquer. Coaching sort of covered the plot, but now that I’m on my own, the syllabus is as confusing as understanding the Dark timeline.

Self-study = ""Main khud ko dhundh raha hoon!"": Everyone and their chacha keeps saying, “Beta, self-study is key!” Yeah, okay, BUT HOW THO?! Is there a hidden instruction manual no one gave me? Right now, self-study feels like walking into a gym, seeing all the machines, and wondering if I should just leave before anyone notices.

Current Affairs = My personal Scam 1992: I have 6 months of current affairs to catch up on. Do I go back and cover it all, or just hope the UPSC board doesn’t care about what happened before I woke up from my Taarak Mehta marathon?

Basically, I’m feeling like Kabir Singh without Preeti—just full of rage, confusion, and a lack of purpose. 😩 Help me out, my fellow aspirants! How do I go from “I paid for coaching” to “I’m actually ready for this exam”?

I need some actionable advice or even some motivational memes because right now, the only thing I’ve mastered is procrastination—and trust me, I’m a topper at that. 🙃",Shubham2415,2,1.0,0,1726979676,2024-09-22 04:34:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fml64t/finished_upsc_coaching_now_im_stuck_what_should_i/,9,2024
1fmkvnu,Should I take a 90 Day Part Time Trial with a Former Boss at Their New Company or Stay at the New Job I Just Started That's Made Me Severely Depressed?,"A little over 2 months ago, I started a new job. I was initially excited because it sounded like an interesting role at a growing company. 

What I ended up getting is an extreme micromanaging boss who has a very inefficient way of doing things that they can't let go. Additionally, my department is full of extreme workaholics, which hasn't been a great fit for me.

The job also has a daily standup meeting at 7am my time which has taken an extreme toll on my mental and physical health. I thought I could handle an early meeting like this, but I can't.

I usually end up working 7am-5pm almost every day. It's been more brutal than I ever could've imagined. I'm constantly exhausted, and even after only 2 months I feel burnt out.

I've been experiencing severe depressive symptoms (crying for no reason throughout the day) as well as severe anxiety feeling constantly on edge. 

A few weeks ago, a former boss contacted me about a part time trial at her new company. She stressed repeatedly that there's no guarantee this will work out, and there's a real possibility that I might not get a full time offer. She said she would advocate for me, but I'm unsure how far that will go. 

There's also a slight chance that this company will have an RTO mandate, and the location is not commutable for me. 

I'm torn. I can't decide if I should continue to suffer at a safe job, or take a risk and potentially end up unemployed in one of the worst job markets in recent years. 

If anyone has any advice or thoughts on my situation, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I could use any help I can possibly get right now. I've been pretty stressed over this decision.

1fmk2ko,Seeking Guidance on Transitioning from Auto Sales,"
I have spent the past six years in automotive sales at a large Honda dealership. Recently, I have been reflecting on my career and have grown increasingly weary of the long hours, office politics, and commission-based compensation structure. 

Throughout my time in this role, I have developed strong relationships with customers and have found success in cold calling. I am now exploring opportunities in different sales sectors that may offer a more stable income and work-life balance.

If any former car sales professionals have successfully transitioned into other sales roles, I would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

1fmiyl4,Advice on how/when/if I should ask for a raise,"I’m conflicted on whether or not it’s the right move to ask for a raise. I work as a supervisor of software development, current salary is 150k annual. 

Back story, I just got promoted in February, my salary was 125k. The promotion came with a 20k raise to 145k. Then in July I also got the standard annual raise for another 5k. During the merit conversation my director let slipped that my salary is at 88% compa-ratio and that I should be closer to a 100%. Doing the math, he was basically saying my salary should be closer to $165k. 

I am conflicted because on the one hand I already got 2 raises this year and I don’t want to come off greedy asking for more. On the other hand I know a couple people whose positions are below mine and with less experience are currently making $145k, and due to the crazy system my company has, my direct reports are getting a 10k raise annually while my level and up are getting 3%-4% raise annually. The result is a couple of my direct reports will out earn me in two years and continue to widening that gap. 

While 150k is a ton of money, it’s also the base for my future raises (since instead of a flat 10k it’s a percentage based of the current number) and i want a good foundation to build from. What do you guys think is appropriate here? If I asked and get rejected, have I burned my chance to ask for a raise for another 12 months?

1fmivvx,"[Europe - EU] I want to work as a Software Developer. My path hasn't been linear. I certainly made mistakes. I may have messed up. Is there a way to get help through the whole process of getting a job, which I hate? Maybe something like ""I'll pay you X% of the net salary you help me getting""?","TL;DR: I want to start a career but I made a huge mess. I need help.

I really want to work as a Software Developer. I'll be considered a beginner (0yoe) but I know my knowledge is much closer to someone almost at an intermediate level.

I know I wouldn't have any issues getting and holding a job, but a series of unlucky past events, many doubts and some bad decisions got me into the current position where I'm stuck and I need help. I would start working tomorrow if I could. I really want it.

My learning and working experiences have not been linear, and that has been my main obstacle, even in terms of self-confidence.

I struggled, experimented, hesitated, reconsidered, etc and now I know I'm not appealing (at least not without help).

My main issues are a poor Resume, no Portfolio (I've been trying to work towards building it but I'm still lacking - I know I was irresponsible about this) and inability to handle the whole Interview process (for now, I know I have to practice a lot).

Regarding the Resume, I asked for help in my local employment services twice and they did a really poor job.

I know if I could show how I work, individually and as a team member, I would get hired relatively fast. I can solve complex problems, I can research even highly complex topics and I can translate ideas into code. i can adjust, I can collaborate.

I know how to listen and how to communicate. I really enjoy helping others and get the work done. Wanting to add value is not just a cliche, I really want to do that and be paid for doing that. Having some mentors would be incredible.

I also know how to juggle many technologies and I'm aware of even more of them and their major use cases, if I ever need them I know how to basically handle them and quickly dive in and catch up.

Depending on the company and the contract, who hires me will have benefits from the government, I will put that in the motivation letter.

I know after the first year of experience everything will be better. But I'm also looking for a very long term connection with my future employer as long as evolution keeps being possible.

In my middle 30's, I hold a European level 5 in Programming (aka ""Specialist Technician"" - for reference, high school is L3, technical high school is L4, Bachelors is L6).

Incomplete Bachelors in Maths (completed around 140 out of 180 credits - I still want to finish it later) but I chose as many programming courses as I could. I even got A grades in the most recent ones I took, about Algorithms and Data Structures, one in Java the other in Python. I helped colleagues and helped the teacher thoroughly, pointing out dozens of needed corrections in the courses' materials.

Over time, I also helped dozens or even hundreds of people online. I wish I had been consistent contributing to Open Source projects as I always planed to do, but I failed doing so. I still intend doing it if I get the chance, even if just very modestly.

Once settled and familiar with the ins and outs of my job, I know I can help the company and the team onboarding new colleagues.

I truly believe I have a huge margin of progress ahead of me.

I mainly know ReactJs and NodeJs, ExpressJs. I want to learn Typescript. I've seen some superficial stuff about Next.js, willing to learn. I'm a beginner in Docker. I'm not afraid of Nginx if I ever need to touch it. I have exposed myself to Microservices and I'm on the process of learning about Modular Monoliths. AWS (or other cloud providers) has been on my horizon too. I'll gladly jump into that if that's what brings value. I had previous experience with .NET and C# (great language, I'm leaving it behind though). I learned Matlab in college, I touched softly in C and its pointers. I know solid Git/Github stuff. I took some time to read about OWASP, HelmetJs, and Content Security Policy (CSP) but haven't practice yet.

I know SQL, some NoSql (MongoDB, eager to learn Redis). I have exposed myself to Testing libraries like Jest and Mocha but I haven't practiced much.

And let's keep Excel out of this conversation, I'll keep that a secret and say I don't have experience, just in case :p

Of course I'm not an expert yet in any of these technologies. I know I have to list only a few of them and I need to curate my Resume according to the Job description.

I have 6 months of internships (3 months + 3 months). These were really poor experiences that contributed heavily to the huge impostor syndrome that followed.

The second one was integrated in the ""Specialist Technician"" program.

The school promised me a job. I worked hard and got A grades. During the apprenticeship/internship on a local company, I didn't have any guidance, I still worked hard, had to learn their stack from scratch because it was completely unrelated to the classes, I helped a colleague who was the worst student in that same class, and they graded me like a D- and graded him a D.

I tried to dispute this but the school said they couldn't do anything. When I asked for another job opportunity, they basically gave me a yellow post-it with the name of a company. I hurried to leave all that behind and returned to my home town, which didn't have IT jobs. Then some personal bad decisions followed, although they did look the right thing at the time. I was naive and too trusting.

I don't have professional certificates other than the ""Specialist Technician"" in Programming (bad decision I know).

Career wise, my long term goal is still flexible, but for now the idea of working towards becoming a Software Architect excites me a lot. I never had this kind of long term clarity before. Of course some years down the line I may prefer following other sub-areas in Software Engineering, like management, but for now I'll just adapt to the job and steadily move things in the SA direction.

English is not my mother tongue but I think I'm very decent. 99% of the content I consume is in English, most of the time it's technical stuff. Speaking, I'm not so great but I'll ""fly"" if I practice daily.

I know I'm probably leaving some important info out and probably expanding too much on some less important stuff already, but this is my first draft. I can edit it and even ask for help in other subs.

I wonder how common is it, the idea of paying someone experienced a % of my net salary for a year, possibly higher if it's fast and in a good company with a good contract, possibly extending that if they help me negotiating a couple of raises, etc. If so, how can I find someone who works with me?

And the problem is...I keep making mistakes. The first month was awful, because something always seemed to go wrong when I did it.

 First it was technical stuff, and I did my best to learn it. Then my manager said I was 'robotic' and 'slow' with clients and 'no offense, you act like you have autism' (I have bad social anxiety but clients have had nothing but good things to say about me) while at the same time mentioning that having me on the team was like having one less person on the team and treating me quite harshly in general. I sucked it up and did my best to improve on my social skills too.

Of course, with every mistake and reproach, I was assigned the least busy shifts because my boss did not trust me to handle the hard ones (and who could blame him?), so everytime I made a mistake I was also terrified this meant being 'punished' by having my role and tasks reduced. Or being insulted again, or being told off in front of clients. I couldn't send emails or pick up the phone without some sort of supervision, and I know it was all on me. But it was still disheartening.

Things got a bit better with time, but as my responsibilities grew, I kept making mistakes. Just different ones. Today, for instance, I repeated a mistake I made three weeks ago, and instead of asking for help tried to solve it myself (and I did, to an extent). However, I still reported the mistake and apologized to the owner of the business (my manager was away). But I know it's no good. I can't go one week without making some sort of mistake, and I just know tomorrow I am going to suffer the consequences of this one.

1fmfido,Toxic Boss Vs Incredible Flexible Working - Help! ,"Hi Everyone, I feel like I'm in between a bit of a rock and a hard place at the moment and those close to me (friends and family) are simply advising me to do ""what feels right"" but I feel like I need something a bit more tangible to go on! 

I'm currently working as an analyst/consultant for a small firm in a rural area of the UK. I got the job after a previous redundancy and hoped it would be a good next step/ bridge to my dream job - but never saw it as a longer term option. Recently I've felt exhausted and unmotivated by the role.

Alongside this I am also doing my PhD part-time. This isn't necessarily an essential step for my career but based on the roles I'm looking for is often desired and has also been a life time goal of mine. The PhD is part time and by distance to only requires 1 day off a week at the moment. 

My current job is paying my full salary and benefits but for part time work in effort to support my PhD. I also have work from home option half the week plus Flexi working hours to take time for appointments etc. This is incredibly important for me as I have a chronic health conditions meaning I typically have to take time out for appointments at least a few times a month. 

These are all wonderful perks of the job. 

However my direct manager and only manager in the company is toxic. On some days she can be kind and thoughtful but most of the time she is micro-managing, rude, critical for the sake of being critical, unrealistic expectations, requesting the completion of work completly outside the remit of my role, using me as a scapegoat, she gaslights and more. My colleague feels the same about her and feels like she makes the job 10 x harder than needs to be. We've both agreed outside of work that it is an unhealthy environment and that it can't be long term. She doesn't take feedback on her behaviour well and there is noone to escalate issues to because of how small the organisation is. Every Sunday evening before the week starts again I feel physically ill and can't sleep because of the anxiety of the office environment. 

I'm therefore feeling challenged. Will I find another role with flexibility for appointments and PhD study, are all bosses going to be toxic, is the grass really greener on the other side or will I be shooting myself in the foot if I leave! I feel like deep down the job I'm in is bad for my mental health and isn't really what I want to be doing long term so naturally I should leave... But based on my current circumstances of PhD and illnesses is it really the best time! 

I know this is a decision that I need to make for myself...but I was hoping that there may be someone out there who has experienced something similar or can look from a completey detached lens and provide some insight.

1fmezng,Constantly being looked down due to my education.. ,"Hi all 

I’m seeking some advice from an issue that keeps popping up every time it’s mentioned. 

So a little groundwork first, I’m not a well spoken guy, I’m not wealthy nor look it, I don’t act arrogant, I’m quite playful and friendly and none serious.

My career is production management, and I possess a usual amount of education - bsc MSc, mba and LSSBB. I’m constantly trying to improve wherever I can.

Now the issue I have that angers me is that when someone asks my background or if I’ve been to university or what ever I’m honest and I tell them my past as a point of conversation, I never upfront offer it due to the reactions I’ve received. 

I seem to be met with the same barrage of questions as if I’m lying and dirty looks, and in my mind I gather this is a unconscious “does this guy think he’s better than me? Fuck you” 
Or “you’re lying I’m gonna question dates and topics etc until you slip up”

I think because I don’t came across as a serious stern academic it baffles people into thinking I’m full of shit.

How do I address this? Or is this something that I will always be stuck with. I’ve gotten to the point of not wanting to answer questions and simply lie about my accomplishments to avoid the shit

1fmea0q,"Need Career Advice: Intern Title with Manager Responsibilities, On Call 18 Hours a Day.","Hey everyone,

I work in NYC in the logistics and tech department, managing a dispatch team of 8 people and nearly 30 drivers. My responsibilities go far beyond basic operations management, and I could use some career advice. Here’s what I do:

- Manage the dispatch operations and the logistics team.
- Handle risk management to minimize losses and monitor the project’s finances, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.
- I coordinate with software developers to ensure proper data management and oversee software procurement, making sure our team has the right tools.
- I’m responsible for resume screening, conducting interviews, hiring, onboarding, and training. I also manage driver and dispatch invoices.
- I have to ensure my team provides the service with 0 errors.
- I have to collaborate with sales reps and meet their expectations. 
- I have to expand the operations to different states keeping in mind profits and cost efficiency. 
- I also had to conduct interviews to hire medical assistants for a new service that was being launched. 
- Any error that happens within the team of around 38 people, I am held accountable. 


I’m also **on call 18 hours a day** because our operations run during that time, and I get called for any escalations.

Despite all these responsibilities, my job title is still “intern.” I earn $18 an hour with no benefits (hybrid job) while working around 52 hours a week without overtime pay, even though my actual hours are supposed to be 40.

With my current experience, should I switch jobs? Could I transition into roles like **Program Manager** or **Operations Analyst**? Am I being underpaid and taken advantage of?

1fmdl7q,Two Week Notice Question,"What is everyone’s thoughts on placing a two weeks notice but leaving a few days before. 

For instance, my friend and I are having an argument on if this is considered “rage quitting”.

An example would included: 
Placing a two weeks on Wednesday of the week. Completing that week fully, completing the following week fully, but then not returning the week that follows due to an already planned vacation. (Even before knowing you would be transitioning employment) 

Is this considered rage quitting, and is this bad? 
Also if it is needed the schedule is 4 x10s, no work on Monday.

1fmdbrh,"Where does the data from The Work Number report (about you), being sold to recruiters, come from?  ","The Work Number report (used by recruiters and HR) is quite comprehensive, and includes information on a job seeker’s employment dates, salary history, paystub information, health care provider, whether someone has dental insurance, and if they’ve ever filed an unemployment claim. It also now shows business income, which I suspect is being sold by QuickBooks. Previously, procuring this data was illegal, but Equifax found a work-around, and sells it as an HR product. 

How does Equifax obtain this sensitive information? With the willing aid of thousands of U.S. businesses, including much of the Fortune 500. Government agencies (as much as 80-85% of the federal civilian workforce) use the service, including schools and healthcare workers. In order to access the data, these organizations also allow a quid pro quo - they allow Equifax to tap directly into their HR systems so the credit bureau can sell the information to others. In other words, these organizations actually pay Equifax for the privilege of giving away their employees' personal information.

Equifax also sells this data to third parties, including debt collectors and other financial services companies. This blog details why companies provide that consent, and what you can do to stop it:[ https://backgroundproof.com/twn-compendium/#why-job-seekers-must-be-aware](https://backgroundproof.com/twn-compendium/#why-job-seekers-must-be-aware)",jirashap,1,1.0,10,1726953884,2024-09-21 21:24:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmdbrh/where_does_the_data_from_the_work_number_report/,9,2024

Everyone always asks what my plans are, where I’m going, what I’ll become… I’m starting to go crazy.

I’ve always been indecisive, but now I particularly feel like I shouldn’t mess this up.

I would probably be good in applied or fine arts, but… somehow, I still feel like I want a “proper” (useful) job. I also don’t know how feasible it is to make a living from it. I probably won’t be able to take the advanced exam in physics, but I plan to do so in biology. I thought about becoming a dentist, but I won’t have the necessary qualifications for that (this year, at least). I can imagine myself doing almost anything. However, I don’t want to pursue music professionally because I’m afraid I’ll end up hating it if it becomes my job. I also can’t let go of the idea that people should respect me, at least a little… and stereotypically, artists are seen as failures…

I also applied to another posting directly, for a job that has turned out to be the same one that the agency is representing. This was genuinely a mistake - the agency posting was rather secretive as was the posting from the company. The company posting was listed through its parent company, and did not specify which subsidiary it would be for, hence my confusion.

I've seen, no joke, at least 15 postings through agencies and other sources that have turned out to be for this position.

I just got a rejection email from the company directly. I have not heard any update from the agency recruiter.

Was I possibly disqualified entirely? Or could this be a case where the company decided not to hire directly at all, and I'm still being considered via the agency position?  
Basically I'm hoping to understand how this process works. The application duplicate was a mistake. I would hate to learn that the duplicate disqualified me, but at least I'll know for the future.

The right to represent doesn't preclude me from applying any other way, it just states that I give the agency I signed with the right to represent, and will not be submitted through other agencies.",pixelblue1,2,1.0,0,1726946089,2024-09-21 19:14:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fmajl3/right_to_represent/,9,2024

I’ve recently interviewed and accepted a position with another different government agency - so this would be a new employer not transfer even though my pension transfers - that pays over 50% more, is closer to home, better title, and gives me an option for hybrid (remote work days). The new manager appears to be a lot more sane and human-like than my current boss.

* Work at a Natural Pace

I'm currently searching for a new job as an operations manager because I'm unhappy in my current position, which is taking a toll on my mental health. I'm eager to find a role where I can advance my career, particularly in sales (SDR), but I've been applying for various positions just to leave my current job since promotions aren't possible at my small company.

Here are two opportunities I'm considering:

**Job 1:** A nanny position for three days a week, working 10-hour days at $30 per hour. While this would mean stepping back in my career, it would allow me the time and flexibility to focus on going back to school.

**Job 2:** Fully remote entry-level position as a call center representative with my dream company (200-500 employees), offering $17 per hour for full-time work (40 hours a week). The schedule could vary, requiring me to work mornings, afternoons, and weekends, and I would be handling 40-60 calls a day. Although this is a significant pay cut, it might open up more opportunities for advancement in the future.

1fm4b0m,Take a Job I'm Not Enthused About,"Hi All - I've received what is by all accounts a good offer at a place that I'm not enthused to work for. It would require 100% in office (I'm currently fully remote) and a quick cross-state move. 

My husband and I are not opposed to the move as the location will be better for us in terms of job prospects, but I'm also sort of seeing this job as a short term stop gap while I can keep looking for things that are hybrid in that area. Going back to an office full time just sounds terrible. It's also an industry I'm really not very enthusiastic about. 

I applied b/c my husband and I wanted to go back to this area and marketing jobs are really tough to get right now. I feel like if I don't take it I would be an idiot. But I also feel like I already know I'm not going to like it very much... and it would be uprooting our life for a job I don't think I would be happy at. 

Would you take a job you knew you weren't going to enjoy / would just be a short term thing while you looked for something else? Or should I just bow out now and keep searching in that area for something I feel is more sustainable?

1fm4975,when is it worth it to do a shitty junior job?,"Hi everyone, i've recently been doing a trial for a company, and i can't quite decide if i should stay here or not.

  
It's a design job for a very small book publishing company, and so far the company has a lot of red flags - some of which are the fact that 1) the only senior designer in this company is going away at the end of the month, so i would be virtually alone trying to learn how to do a milion different tasks (we're talking about book layout, social media managing, video making, creating content for different companies, etc) with nobody to ask if ther's something i have trouble with (the boss is there, but he knows nothing about social media)  
2) the pay is incredibly low, and that's fine, i expected it: but friday the boss told me that for the first three months they'd pay me even less, and with a freelancer contract which basically mean i wouldnt have sick pay or vacation time, which sucks and makes me worry a little bit that they're going to try and screw me over again in the future, since this didnt come up for almost two weeks of me working there

on the other hand though, i know that the design industry sucks, and lots of people told me to just hang in there for a couple of years and then find a better company or get into freelancing: i'm just wondering if it would be worth it, considering that i don't really know if i would like to stay in this particular field and i don't think i would be able to do that much networking at this kind of company  
At the same time, finding a job in the field is though, so maybe i shouldnt be so choosy?

1fm3prg,How do I handle a manager who has it out for me?,"Recently I received a ""Performance Improvement Plan"" from my job. My performance is equal to or better than most, I have a few co workers that would agree (we only have 10 employees). 

Within this plan I am told that I need to log my daily plans in the morning with 3 superiors. I also need to log what I accomplished during the day at the end of my shift. Amongst a bunch of super extra things, including that I will be terrminated if i dont do these things for 3 months. No other employee has gotten this. 

Here the kicker the company had three owners involved with day to day, two of them stepped away and gave the keys to someone who is not qualified to run the place and just happens to have it out for me.

1fm3azq,"Considering a major career move for higher pay, but likely lower job satisfaction.","I’ll get right to it. Currently I’m in a “part time” job that I enjoy a lot, pay is $33.25 an hour with regular annual increases to that pay. I’m about a year out from being converted to full time in this position, and I’m part of a great union. I work irregular hours and sometimes nights/overnights that change on a weekly basis. I put part time in quotes because I’m generally averaging about 32 hours a week, and work a second job on top of this which is much less work and supplements my income to reach what I would be making if I was working 40 hours a week. My plan has always been to work this job for about ten years and during that time get a master’s degree and become a college professor in my industry.

I regularly apply to other positions to keep my options open and practice my resumé/interview skills. I received a job offer for a position which pays about $72,000 a year in a managerial position with a $5,000 signing bonus and a reassessment of salary in 6 months depending on my skill and a raise to $77k. They seem as though they would expect a lot from me, but I feel competent enough for the position. I likely would be working about 50 hours a week in this position, and I worry about my ability to continue my second job, which I do feel mildly obligated to continue. I also doubt I would be able to work on getting a master’s degree, but the company seems to have a lot of opportunities for growth beyond the position they’re bringing me in at.

The other large factor is that I am getting married in mid March of next year, and I want to enjoy my first few years of marriage (I want to enjoy the whole marriage, but you get what i mean). On one hand my current work situation somewhat caps me at a 60 hour week in a really busy season, and can drop me down to as low as a 24 hour week on a bad week, or if I just need the time off I can take off what I need to. The downside of my current position is the overnights and off hours/working weekends which in some seasons conflict with my fiancée’s job greatly which she works 9-5. On the other hand, this new position I’m considering would work me more normal hours regularly, with some days which would be outliers but it seems they wouldn’t be extremely common, but not rare either.

It’s essentially moving from blue collar to white collar with a pay increase, but I believe I’d see my compensation increase beyond what I’d make in this new position within the next couple years. I feel i wouldn’t be as happy working in this new job, but I could be wrong and I do feel there’s a possibility I could be much happier in my home life with this change, but if I’m miserable at work then I doubt it would be worth it. 

TL;DR. Opportunity to move from blue collar to white collar, with a roughly 10% pay increase and more regular job hours, but likely lower job satisfaction and flexibility, as well as likely giving up on my current dream/plan. Additionally I am getting married in March of next year.",Corporate-Loser,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1726926118,2024-09-21 13:41:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fm3azq/considering_a_major_career_move_for_higher_pay/,9,2024

1fm1bjc,24F. Corporate for 6 years. Toxic colleagues/managers. Seeking a career break and switch to doing music. Advice?,"Hi. I know these kinds of posts are very subject-dependent, but I think it'd be great to receive perspectives from various people.

I'm 24(F), and have been working full-time in an IT role before I graduated from university at the age of 19. It's been 6 years in corporate and I have received a promotion as a team leader last year. The reason I was able to stay this long was due to the good work-life balance, and how supportive the environment was for my growth...
It's another matter entirely, but I wasn't truly happy generally cause all the while, I know deep down that my vision in life is to just make and play music. I sing, play the guitar and write songs in DAWs. I have shared some of my works online, slowly... I know it's very possible to keep my job and do what I love on the side, but lately the work environment is getting really unbearable for me... I know my feelings and experiences are valid as it is, but I do want to hear other perspectives.
I was bullied at the Team Leader role I had from my fellow colleagues that took shape in the form of really petty behaviors, such as creating fake rumors about me amongst colleagues, always assuming bad intent in all the decisions I took, attacking my personal life that I've never told this person (involving my sister and boyfriend) How she knew things about them is beyond me… also always forcing me and others to create after-office events/events non-stop, and even when we were there, myself and a couple others were ignored, and belittled, basically to make us feel bad, and a means to control our actions in the office.

However, it gets so bad that the bully brought more people into disliking me? to the point of throwing out my personal items that are in my office desk. I know it sounds childish and very high-school… I tried speaking to the bully 1-1 to resolve the issue, but was faced with a backlash and gaslighting instead…

This has been going on for almost 2 years, however at the start of the year, I finally just stopped caring, blocked the bully in my socials, and do what I want in the office, without considering them. I just want them to leave me alone.

I've also been in contact with my managers about this and they expressed their sympathies and concern. Recently, however, my managers have decided to relocate this bully into another regional office branch with 2-3x time our salary, and lied about the relocation opportunity. This has broken my trust and others in my team too, for the lie, lack of transparency, and also me for being naive enough to share my struggle with them regarding the bully and in response, was faced with a lack of action and care, and even ""rewarding"" the bully by relocating and compensating them much higher than we all do.

These were the main issues. But others also being like the work we do is super menial, repetitive and also kinda impossible to complete, ike being forced to automate complex business processes that are clearly not suitable, but since it was agreed upon by higher ups, we are to receive the brunt end of the labor. It’s stressful that upper ups and the business didn’t understand how difficult it was for us to do.

I felt meaningless, clocking in and out at work. The company culture however has very low turnover, with people being here for even up to 25 to 30 years, but the gossip amongst them all was pretty intense too. It was like a “family” company. 

There weren’t much people my age and when there is one, suddenly this person went around and backstabbed me too even though she was super sweet whenever we met… it was hurtful as I used to looked up to her a lot too in the past (though another matter entirely).

I got better at managing all this, as I’m able to focus on family, friends, and remind myself of my priorities with doing what I enjoy and love on the side with music (slowly practicing my instruments, singing and learning more about composition, etc).

Though at times, these things do tend to get in my head, even in the weekends (like right now), and I sometimes don’t feel as motivated to do the things I love, as I dread having to face work again…  on Monday.

I wanted to resign and go for a career break next June, though my parents are forbidding me to, or at least saying should have another job lined up before doing so (which is super understandable) especially with how bad the job market and rumors of upcoming recessions are. But as I’ve mentioned, I felt like I don’t think I’m able to be happy doing anything aside from making music, and I know I just got to keep my head focused in it, and see where it takes me… 

Just wondering what are people’s thoughts on my situation? Maybe I do need some reality check - maybe it’s not bad as it is…, as my job doesn’t force me into crazy hours, and the work life balance is still okay, amidst the crazy powerless environment I find myself in (with upper ups, HR, manager) being completely unreliable, and aren’t on my side. I’ve also gotten ‘too sensitive’ as a comment from both HR and my manager so… that’s been super helpful… 

For now, I aim to keep trying to focus on things I love like music and keep going at it, slowly, wholeheartedly while keeping this job till June. But there are pressures for me to staying from my parents and future career concerns (even when I no longer wish to be in IT).",Cherri-Double3016,1,1.0,4,1726919762,2024-09-21 11:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fm1bjc/24f_corporate_for_6_years_toxic/,9,2024

1fm0mi5,Put on PIP and said I’ll be fired without notice if I don’t perform. This is a soft-fire. No policies written on offer letter since it’s an early startup. I don’t have an employment contract. Help?,"
Location: India

4 months into a new job. 
Manager who doesn’t like me since the first week- thinks I’m constantly under performing. Sat down with me today and told me that my performance is not meeting expectations, there’s a gap in skills and that I am being put under a 6-week PIP.
And that this period would be counted as “sufficient notice” and I would be terminated without notice if I fail to meet their expectations during this period.

PIP doesn’t contain any quantifiable targets/metrics. 

My offer letter has no mentions of termination, PIP, notice, leaves- nothing. 
I was not given an employment contract either.

This would be justified by them by saying “we’re a pre seed startup”, is my assumption.

I feel lost, confused and unsure of whether I can act and ask for:

1. Employment contract and policies
2. A notice period after my PIP
3. Severance in case of termination

Unable to make a call since I know nothing of this company’s policies. 
Scared that if I get terminated, finding other jobs would be at risk, and it would be a black mark on my career forever.

1flykw0,Product managers: help me focus my skill acquisition for the next role ,"Context: I was hired as a senior marketing analyst at a large US retailer. I moved horizontally into a senior product analyst role on the marketing platform team. This move meant I couldn’t be promoted despite smashing my goals due to company policy of staying in a role for a year. 
  
The review cycle is in January and I want to prepare for a move if I don’t get what I want as I have been at the company for over 2.5 years without any real changes in salary. The good thing is I’m learning lots and have had courses paid for me, and lots of work travel for conferences and global team off-sites. This is the best job I’ve had, and I am pretty happy except for feeling taken advantage of and overlooked.
  
Since joining product I recognise I have lots to learn, but I am also getting projects off the ground and valuable features built. My role is weird because my engineering team will generally build what I ask for, but as I work on the platform I have lots of external dependencies. That’s where there is a bit of struggle getting on other peoples roadmaps, but again I’ve had success. I am very good at looking at our engineering timelines and getting dependencies to deliver so that my engineers are not delayed. I’m also good at identifying and outlining opportunities for the business. I’m a bit weak at managing stakeholders (they don’t always like the tradeoffs and decisions I’m making but I get the results so…), im not great at long term planning or communicating the vision. I also feel a bit confused by some of the engineering topics despite being more technical that some senior PMs (I have Python/sql knowledge but less backend platform stuff). 

The ask:
Product managers, can you advise me on the best move for someone with my profile to climb the product management ladder? Online resources suggest reading books, I’m doing just that and it’s enlightening. They also suggest learning to code, I can code in Python going as far as winning a hackathon last year. I’m wondering if I study more if it’s better to learn more tech things or more business/framework stuff? Most of the jobs I see that I’d like want 3-5 years product and a technical degree, which I don’t have so I’m leaning towards staying where I am and using company resources to do a techy masters.

1flyex9,Need Advice: Stuck in a Toxic Work Environment,"I’m in a tough situation at my current company and could really use some advice. Here’s what’s going on:

I’ve been dealing with a toxic work environment for a while now. There’s a lot of fear and anxiety among the team, where even small mistakes are blown out of proportion. For example, one junior employee was really scared of something as minor as accidentally assigning a task to herself. The atmosphere has become really stressful, and it’s getting hard to stay motivated.

I reached out to someone from the internal mobility team in HR, and they listened to my concerns, saying it would take a maximum of 3 months to move me to a different division. However, instead of making any progress, she later sent me an email with the division head in CC, stating that my seniority level and being a “key person” are reasons why a move would take longer.

To add some context, my personal relationship with my manager was good before all of this. But over time, the way he micromanaged the team impacted me as the technical lead. His approach stifled creativity, and most of the team began asking me for even basic things, which massively increased my workload. I ended up on constant calls throughout the day, which only added to the stress.

I had previously given this feedback directly to my manager as well, so it feels pretty strange to continue working with him now, especially with no changes. Some senior colleagues have mentioned they would support me and attest to the feedback I’ve given if needed, but I’m starting to feel stuck. The company seems to want me to keep working in this division until at least next April due to my role and seniority.

At the same time, I’m considering switching companies rather than simply accepting this delay, as there are some new possibilities emerging for me.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Should I push back harder with HR or seriously consider making a move to a new company? How have you handled being “key personnel” in a toxic environment when you’re essentially being delayed from moving elsewhere?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",TypicalRestaurant469,1,1.0,0,1726907472,2024-09-21 08:31:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flyex9/need_advice_stuck_in_a_toxic_work_environment/,9,2024

1flwmfv,Advice for a Software Development student,"HI I {M 22} have been considering career options and I'd like some maybe more experienced input IDK if you guys probably have been put in similar situations. So here is the deal, I'm on my last year in software dev local collage not much to show for work except college projects, we are still in the beginning of the first sem of the year so I still got some time and I'm Considering a few things

- Continuing to  get a masters degree either in Machine learning or Computer security ( this allows me more time to do some side work to show what I can do)  
- take a job

I was kind of considering learning some trades just because I like them like car mechanics, painting cars, blacksmith, I just think these are cool and I've always been a fan of physical labour, the thing is I could be able to learn them while doing a job on the side and probably work on some-project on the weekend or something, but I'll have a hole in the CV and the CV doesn't look that great right now to be honest.

Also I haven't decided what field to take when it comes to computer science, I like the idea of Cyber security but I haven't had much experience with it throughout the program I'm in. So it would be difficult to land a job in that field.  
I like learning things but I'm like I don't want to be broke for the rest of my life right? ",big__friendly_giant,2,1.0,4,1726899475,2024-09-21 06:17:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flwmfv/advice_for_a_software_development_student/,9,2024
1flw6t3,What should I do when teammate/s don't contribute much in brainstorming but very much enthusiastic during presentation.,"

We, a group of 3, decided to join a company held competition that started last week.

For the first two days, our manager was on leave, I was the one driving the discussion and it was so hard to get something out of them. One was decided was she wasn't going to take it seriously (explicitly said it to me and probably even proud of it). While the other one was pretty busy with life outside work and wasn't giving too much care about it.

Then just a few days ago we were all promoted. The girl revealed to us that she was the one who brought it up to our manager why aren't we all still promoted. That's why she wasn't as much engaged. It's like almost invalidating our efforts and she takes credit for it. She said she wasn't expecting it because our manager told her it was impossible.

Instead of feeling happy I felt bad. I mean I'm the one who does the learnings in advance so that when the time comes for the promotion I am ready for it? In a way maybe I should've pushed for promotion but I already pushed for a more lenient RTO policy so I was thinking if I also asked for a promotion then they would ask me to come to the office more. So I just focused on upskilling.

On the same day we were promoted we were going to present the initial idea to our counterparts. We tried randomizing who will present and my name got chosen. I said I was a bit tired (leading the discussions without much input was really draining for me) and why make it the best of two. I just wanted them to have some stake to it and not feel like I'm the only one pushing for it. So the girl was chosen. (Yes stupid of me to agree)

Come presentation time it was like she was super excited / nervous (who wouldn't be, you are trying to present an idea you were barely involved in making). It was well received and I felt bitter? Maybe I wanted acknowledgement with how I drove the discussions forward. I was able to do that by learning in advance.

Now we still have some time to finish the competition I don't know how to move forward. I'm scared my efforts would go unseen but of course we have to collaborate effectively as well. to join a company held competition that started last week.

1flur7e,Help required to deal with a senior colleague at new org,"
I am from India. 

I have recently joined a new firm; been here for almost 4 months now. One of my senior colleague joined two months before I did (may v/s july).

I am an introvert and my role requires me to work on the tasks given and send them out (execution centric with not much people / stakeholder management).

Being an introvert and given my work responsibilities, I hardly interact with many people at the workplace (just 3-4 people in  a large team).

My senior colleague wanted me to talk to some people of another team to get information about how the other team operates so that he can also implement the same in our team. I didn't say no but I didn't do anything about it either.

Instead I went on to talk to other people (not those who my senior wanted me to connect with) This seemed to have irked the senior. 

Now because I keep to myself and don't talk to many people he is telling other people in office that I am arrogant etc. and on many occasions he asks me to not talk to people now when earlier he was saying exactly opposite things

The senior colleague is also lying to me about many things (including feedback that others have given about me - on 3 separate instances when I reached out to the feedback provider, they gave me an entirely different narrative)

What bothers me more is that he is taking away my portfolio of work as well. I have 3 months before I complete my probation and am getting worried - what if the organization says that I am useless and fires me at the end of my probation. 

I have tried interacting with people at the same level as this ""senior colleague"" and higher but because I don't have anything work related to show, these other people find interacting with me boring. 

What should I do? Any suggestions would help please. ",selfishcook,1,1.0,0,1726892044,2024-09-21 04:14:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flur7e/help_required_to_deal_with_a_senior_colleague_at/,9,2024
1fluih0,what career would I fit if my skills are only being good at standardized tests?,"I'm 17 and currently applying to college. Throughout my life, I've been decent in every subject, but never really excelled/specialized in any particular subject. The only area I have found myself constantly performing above my peers is with standardized tests/ tests that have elements of logical reasoning and critical thinking.

I’m not talking about class exams that require memorization, but tests like the SAT and AP exams. I took the SAT once without studying and scored a 730 in reading, which I believe is due to my strong analytical skills. After just under 3 weeks of study, I took the SAT again and scored 770 in reading and 780 in math (totalling 1550). Math is usually my weaker subject, but I was able to do well by logically deducing what the questions were asking, even when the wording was tricky.

For example, I encountered a question that was unlike anything I had seen before on any practice test, it was clearly an expierimental question designed to be tricky, but by carefully breaking it down logically and paying close attention to wording, I figured out exactly what it was asking.

Similarly, on the AP Lang exam, despite having a teacher that never taught, I scored a 5. 
I approached each passage by analyzing the structure and tone, then using logical reasoning to narrow down answer choices, even when the wording was difficult or the passage was in older English.
I approached the essay portion by crafting a cohesive argument and ensuring that each point logically responded to the prompt.

Even in regular AP tests at school that are given in class, I'm very good at identifying and navigating tricky or confusing questions through logical reasoning, which is where many students struggle.

These skills I think have led me to have my better grades within subjects like Statistics, History, English, and Economics

I am 24F based in Australia and seeking some career advice please. 

I feel as though I have really struggled to figure out what I want to do in terms of a career. I am the kind of person that has lots of hobbies, interests, and passions but have had lots of life roadblocks that have stopped me from exploring any of them thoroughly. I like a lot of different things and am a bit of a perfectionist which I realise has left me a bit stagnant, because I have so many different ideas of what I could do, paired with no guidance from family, I have stayed still and not really figured it out or given anything a real go.

I want to seek some advice as maybe once I talk about the things I love doing, somebody in here will have a job come to mind for me. 

In my most recent job, which was an entry level administration role, my favourite parts of the job were learning new things, updating and implementing new processes to streamline workflow, investigating and researching things to come up with solutions to problems within the firm and doing challenging applications and tasks for clients. When I reflect on this, it made me realise how much I love learning, problem solving, understanding the intricacies of the software we were using, and researching. 

I also love being creative, I love writing, photography, design, dancing, acting, crafts and find joy in lots of different creative aspects.

I am also a very caring and compassionate person, I really enjoy making a difference and helping others.

I have lots of customer service experience, working in both retail and hospitality. Experience ranges from casual to shift supervisor. I also have a bit of administrative experience in an accounting firm. I have completed two years of a creative arts degree and would be open to future study - hopefully with an opportunity to transfer some of my credit points over. 

I have considered so many different directions and am kind of at a standstill about what could be good for me and what could even possibly incorporate a few of these skills/traits and would love some advice if anyone knows of any roles/fields that sound suited to me.

1flrcry,"GF starts new job on Monday, just got a call that her pay changed.","Hi everyone,

  
Maybe this isn't the right place to post, but we're kind of in a jam. Some backstory is that my GF is about to start a job at a non-profit on Monday. She received the job offer at the end of August and finally finished all the paperwork with HR 2 weeks ago since they told her the onboarding process is slow for whatever reason. The manager (at the time of the job offering) told her that her hourly rate could be anywhere from 20/hr to 25/hr, but most likely 22/hr. My GF was fine with that and accepted the job. A couple days later she received the HR paperwork that stated that she would be making 24.12/hr which was awesome for us! She had been on the job hunt for quite some time and it felt like someone was finally taking notice of her extensive resume in a field she's really passionate about (homeless case management). The problem is that today she got a call from her manager saying that the rate on the HR paperwork was incorrect and she's actually going to be making 21.50/hr. My GF pushed back and said she wanted to talk to HR. When she spoke to HR, the person on the line said that the verbal offer that the manager gave was the real rate offer, not the one on the document she signed. It seems like a load of bull since in what world is a conversation more legally binding than signed paperwork? She's already stuck it out without searching for another job for a month (hindsight is 20/20), so it's either she takes the job at the lower rate than what she was promised or start the job search over again which is going to be a really tough situation since I've had to deplete my savings almost entirely to support the both of us. What would you do in this situation? Can the company do that? (State of CO for reference)

TLDR: GF got a verbal offer from manager first and then received a different offer on a signed document from HR after at a higher rate. 1 business day before she starts, she gets a call saying that the verbal offer was the real rate, not the one on the document from HR, which she had already signed. What should she do?",MeinSelfHelp,3,0.6399999856948853,15,1726880319,2024-09-21 00:58:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flrcry/gf_starts_new_job_on_monday_just_got_a_call_that/,9,2024

1flr5mi,Is a lateral move for more money worth losing seniority?,"I’ve been unhappy with my currrent job for a while. I generally like and respect my boss but I continue to get assigned to projects that have not been fulfilling to me. I won’t go into detail because it’s all very convoluted but the past 6 months have been particularly demoralizing due to the undermining behavior of the team I’m supporting, and inter-office politics/power struggles, blah blah blah. I’ve been asking for a new project because I’m not being utilized fully and it’s (IMO) a waste of a company resource to continue this way but it’s fallen on deaf ears.

Recently I came across an internal job posting that intrigued me and would have been a promotion had I gotten the job. After I applied, the hiring VP contacted me to chat and of course I agreed. During our conversation they indicated that they “can’t offer me more money” but that they have another position if I’m still interested. Without saying it directly this meant, “you’re not what we’re looking for in the higher-level role, but we still want you on our team”. 

While I was somewhat disappointed, I still looked at this as a positive way to make a change and maybe, if I’m lucky, no longer want to die inside every time I walk into work.

Fast forward a few weeks while the corporate hiring process works at its typical snail’s pace to get through all the internal interviews, assessments, etc…
Now my current boss is finally paying attention to the issues I’m facing with the team I’m working with and has a “strategy” to deal with it. This still does not result in me getting a new project, but rather I have to stick around, continue to deal with the B.S., to lay the groundwork in preparation for some much bigger projects and opportunities next year. I do feel more supported now but I’m skeptical as to whether it’s going to work or be a further waste of my time, and opportunity cost of not doing something else worthwhile.

So I got my offer with the new team today. It’s actually does come with a $4k increase per year (not life changing but better than the $0 I was expecting), but it’s still considered a “lateral” move meaning I don’t change my title/level. And the downside is that my “time in role” for my next promotion would be reset. So I have 18 months toward my current role and that would roll back to 0, delaying any future opportunities to actually be promoted. My company does give out promotions regularly so this isn’t a false hope.

1flr3cv,Need advice going forward. What should be my next immediate steps?,"Here is a TL DR first:

""I'm a 32 year old german person stuck in life searching for advice, what my immediate next steps should be. I pursued a professional gaming carrier + livestreaming on the side most of my life & don't see my future in it anymore. I dont feel competitive in the job market with my current situation & search a path forward.""

I always had a huge passion for competitive games & invested way to much time into it, thinking it will be my carrier. I was high elo in several games & top35 in Teamfight Tactics while winning several tournaments & boosting people for money. I also streamed averaging from 40 to 80 viewers - hoping there is more growth to be had. Recently I came to the realization that there is no way that this lifestyle is sustainable, tho. Also I came to the realization that my qualifications in the job market are astonishing bad. I know i am a highly competitive guy and would die in a not demanding work.

I'm really unsure what path to take from here. I can get a voucher from the german ""unemployment agency"" for a 1 year course as a data analyst. I've read that the information in that course is really entry level & the course in general very slow. When u finish the course u get a certificate, tho. That would be my reason to do it, so I have a chance to get a more demanding job.

To put it bluntly I feel I fucked up in life & need to unfuck it somehow. I am confident in myself but would love some advice.

My qualifications:

-Worked 1 year in design + marketing for a company hosting local party events. From flyer/poster design, web design, local + facebook marketing (yes it was big back then) & the actuall organisiation of the event

-General University Entrance Qualification (Abitur)

-Dropped out of 3 different (design, study teaching, computer science) subjects of study

-Worked a year in a startup as a sales manager",Curious_Conclusion60,1,1.0,0,1726879469,2024-09-21 00:44:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flr3cv/need_advice_going_forward_what_should_be_my_next/,9,2024

1flqguf,How do you take it easy at work?,"So I’m a very chronically stressed person. I’m getting help and it’s been getting better. I recently got accepted into this new position and I think mentally it will be a good fit. One thing I’ve noticed is that I struggle with coping with work stress. I take work very personally and put too much unhelpful pressure on myself; employers in the past have been happy to add on some more. I think I have some goals. But I would really appreciate some points or mindsets you have that reduce the pressure and stress to perform.

1. Not finish everything in one day. Set a simple goal for today and try to get it done if not then get it done tommorw.

2. Expect mistakes but do not assume them. As I’m when it happens it won’t be a shock. No need to go hard on myslef and slam myself. It’s a mistake and I’m not a bad worker or stupid for doing it. I’ll try again, no pressure.

3. Care kindly not wildly. I care about what I do it’s fun, but I don’t need it to be excessive or constant. I will not work overtime, weekends, and will opt to leave early if possible. I can love something without having to engage in it overwhelmingly. It’s okay to let it go. 

4. It’s okay, I’m not going to get penalized or punshied. This one’s hard because I’m used to being punished for making mistakes or not being an ideal performer. The point here is to not be scared of work. Work is just a simple job, it can be fun sometimes, it’s not serious. It is not serious or scary. It’s just a job.",simplyetal13,2,1.0,0,1726877509,2024-09-21 00:11:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flqguf/how_do_you_take_it_easy_at_work/,9,2024

1flmz8x,Am I in danger?,"I'm in lower management at the state government, in the US. I've worked for my department for three years, with two of them being a manager of a small team. In the last six months we had our director leave for bigger things and a new director stepped in. The new director is nice enough on the surface but she has a two faced edge to her. She hired a new supervisor who would be my direct supervisor, and before I'd even met my new supervisor the director Cc'd me in an email lambasting something I was doing wrong... but I wasn't? I was definitely petty here, but I pulled out the guidelines and copied the section that I was following to an absolute T and corrected her, where she backpeddled and admitted that yes I was following standards set by the state but *she* wanted it done differently from now on. Fine, I'll follow. I'll admit that I did this, partially because I was angry to be stripped down in front of my new supervisor and partially because the state government is notoriously hard to be fired from. 

So, in the last two weeks two managers that I worked closely with who had worked for the department for over 20 years each, won multiple awards etc. Got fired in the same week. We're not being told why, but I do know that they didn't get along with the new director and could be... firey with their words, whereas I'm a very cool and collected person generally. (I promise it was a very polite, rules lawyer petty moment of mine, despite what it may sound like). 

I'd been wanting to make an entrance into a new career field, but I was waiting until I got my home loan and house figured out which my spouse and I just started the process for, and I'm the breadwinner so I didn't plan to leave my job just yet. If I leave I lose the loan potentially, but if I stay I'm afraid I might get fired since I've already rubbed this manager wrong. I'm trying to play nice and do my job and keep my head low, and I think I might be able to ride it out but the water is hot. 

Should I just try to ride it out until the home loan has gone through and find a new job the second the ink has dried on the house? Or should I up and run now to save myself the potential tarnish on my professional record?

2. Will completely cover my insurance just not any dependents
3. A newer company so not totally sure how they will do.
4. Hybrid -remote
5. 10 days pto starting out 
6. No guaranteed bonuses 
7. To the eye, can see a bit more potential career growth but will not pay for tuition but company A will  

Company B
1. Getting paid $3k less than company A but will receiving guaranteed bonuses throughout the year and salary
2. Will cover 80% of all insurance including dependents
3. Stable company - has been around for a long time.

1flluc2,How important is WFH for you?,"
I’m in two interview cycles atm. I haven’t been offered a job for either yet but I’m trying to get input on how to evaluate what could be potential offers or any in the future. The situations are as follows:

J1: Fortune 50 company. MIT services. One day in office. Office about 45-1hr away in traffic. 85k base and a variable descending ramp up of additional commission payments based on a 150k OTE. Delta of 65k and I’d get 80% in month one and it descends to 40% in month six. Approximately $4,500 for the first month in training descending to about $2,000 at the six month mark. 

J2:  SaaS product for endpoint security. Fully remote. They’re even encouraging me to work remote and told me they don’t even know why they have an office. Basically a startup but fully funded by their own sales activities. No venture funding. Privately owned. 80-90k base. First year OTE 120-140. No ramp up. 

At some point I’d like to live / work overseas and if J1 eventually goes back in office full time or needs me to do outside sales that would suck. I’m already leaning towards J2 if given the choice between the two. I have a lot of experience and a variety of IT certs and education. Then if you don’t get offered J2, would you turn down J1 and keep looking? That’s a lot of money.

1flkexe,Thinking of Stepping Down?,"I work for a very large company and have been with them for almost 15 years now, I started on the ground floor as an apprentice in a unionized trade, where I gained extensive experience by holding every position available to me in that trade. After about seven years, I began to question my happiness, reflecting on my career and realizing I felt like a glorified laborer. So, I made the leap after 7 years or so to the other side of the fence and became a supervisor. Looking back the supervisor position was probably the best job I ever had and I was pretty good at it.

A few years later, I was offered a management position in a new city, where my wife and I started a new life together. We welcomed our first child about a year later. While I love this new city’s small-town feel, my job is demanding. It requires 24/7, 365 availability for emergencies and operational issues, and I often feel like I can’t leave work at work—I’m constantly getting emails, texts, and calls during my off hours.

The company’s leadership is always changing direction, and while I’m one step below leading my department for the entire territory, I have passed up the opportunity a few times as I no longer feel the need to climb the corporate ladder, especially with a second child on the way. I’ve found all the validation I need from my family.

Financially, my salary is decent but not great for the high cost of living here. My wife is a stay-at-home mom currently, and my current salary allows her to be there for our kids. While I make enough for some extra perks here or there and do receive performance-based bonuses and other incentives, I’ve experienced years without bonuses or incentives due to the company citing hardship so I do my best not to depend on them. I know several colleagues who have left for higher-paying, seemingly more relaxed jobs, but those opportunities are mostly in the larger city I came from, which I’d prefer to avoid for my family. 

I’m considering trying to step back down to a supervisory role, even though it would mean a 15% salary reduction, losing my company vehicle, reduced bonuses, etc.... Honestly the vehicle is nice but feels more like a burden sometimes, as it’s mostly for incidents response and I don't live very far from work. I want to be more present for my family, but there are currently no open supervisory positions at my location, despite my requests for additional support over the years.

I don't know if stepping down is the right move or how to approach this situation. I feel like it would be career suicide if I did, but I think I am ok with that. The real question is if they would make the position for me and allow me to transition back, I would have no issues mentoring, training the new applicant or even covering the position while they are on vacation etc... I am well liked in my role, from both my teams and the companies point of view. I am constantly told they don't want to lose me but they never really listen to things I ask for. I always receive a lot of praise for the work we do. I am just tired of having my own time ruined by someone else's poor planning, mistakes or their inability to solve their own problems and think for them damn selves.... now I just feel stuck, maybe I am stuck. 

If I stay in this position for 4 - 5 more years I think financially I could be in a lot better position and have my mortgage completely paid down. My wife does also want to go back to work after the kids are in school or try and find some way to make some form of income. Maybe I should just hold on a few more years, I just feel like I am absent at home even when I am at home....

1flkd9k,Am I making the right choice?,"Hi. I'm lucky to receive 2 job offers after months and months of applying. But my dilemma comes from choosing the good one.

Both companies actually offered a not-so-high salary. Company A just added 138USD to my current salary. They first offered the same but I negotiated a bit. 

Company B offered exactly the same amount as my current salary but the catch here is it's free accommodation, transportation and staff meal during working hours. So I will be living with them but a little bit stricter as they don't allow visitors and pets.

Company A is a dream job for creative people like me. When I first came to the interview I told to myself I should get the job. While Company B is a hotel offering a diversified job (and a more career growth if you want to get to the top). Company B is also stricter because it follows a standard while A is more on creative side so they don't mind a little bit late or anything you wear as long as it's decent.

I don't have any experience on both companies. They are new to me but will greatly add up to my experience. Both are going to make me come out of my comfort zone.

I don't feel any negative vibes on both. The only thing that worries me is I actually like company A more than B but the salary offer is final. And right now I need a better salary because I've been working abroad for 2 years now and I still have more to pay on my credit and loans. I didn't rven get to go home at my home country as I don't have savings yet.

What am I afraid is am I blinded by the fact that I can earn more with company B rather than having to work in a place that suits my career? Or is it justified because right now I need financial growth?

1. Should I quit and get a job in esports? If yes then I am considering to do an online degree(if its worth it) in a related field like BBA(plz suggest if you have smtg else in your mind) or just focus on the job.  
2. If I decide to continue what should be my approach to the degree?  
3. If I decide to quit what should I do another offline degree, online degree, job or job and online degree?  
  
Some important points that will help you answer my questions better  
1. I am inclined towards quitting, I just dont have a plan of what to do next  
2. I have ADHD

If you need to ask more questions to answer me better I'll be more than happy to answer them

1fljsvg,Pay attention to those who don't clap when you win,"This has happened many times in my career, and it happened to me again recently. I just presented in front of our entire department of around 100 people, including my SVP, and the work was EXTREMELY well received. I take a lot of pride in my ability to be an engaging speaker and communicate complex ideas in a simple easy to understand way, so it was great to be recognized by leadership. 

That being said, I couldn't help but notice that my direct manager nor other people on my team even reached out to say good job (they were in attendance). Not that I was expecting it, but they've done so in the past on things that were a lot smaller of accomplishments. 

I know I shouldn't let it bug me, but this has happened to me at other companies as well, it's like I get to a certain point in my tenure and people just stop caring about me.

1fljaqe,What degrees are ‘worth it’ in the UK?,"I am in Year 12 (17 years old/penultimate year of study in the UK) and need to start considering the uni courses I may want to study post-college. I study English Lit, History, Psychology and an EPQ on women in film, and would love to become a journalist and then break into the film industry in writing or criticism. 
I know this is an ambitious and not necessarily lucrative career path but I prioritise enjoying my time on Earth so would just love to write, write, write.

My question is a) whether going to uni is worth it, and b) what degrees, with my A-levels, would be worthwhile considering my career aspirations. 

I’ve been dissuaded from pursuing journalism, media, film, and English literature, and was wondering whether this dissuasion is genuine advice.

1fli1dj,Should I negotiate salary if I receive an offer?,"In my application for a similar job role I put my desired to be 65k. This was for a similar position in a different department. Solely for the fact, I’m currently making 56k at 6 years of experience. Hence the reason why I’m leaving my current job. Now the HR recruiter called me and after our screening, he said there’s another position open that is in a different department and told me the information on that. The position is similar to the one I applied for & the salary is 66k. He asked if I was interested, he’d put my application on that one as well. I told him yes. Does this mean it’s too late in negotiating a salary bump? I’m actually fine with the 10k bump in my pay, and the benefits sound really good with a 4% annual bonus and merit increases throughout the year. but I have also never negotiated salary before. So should I just accept the 66k or try and negotiate? I also have another job that is interested in me, should I use that potential offer to get an increase in my pay in the 66k job?

1fli0m5,Absolutely Desperate,"Hi friends,

I took a job in early 2023 that promised a reputable career trajectory with a large brand. This forced me to move to a smaller manufacturing town. Unfortunately, many of the promises that were made to me have not come to fruition. Thus, I have been looking to find a new job and transition back into a larger area. I've realized that I have sacrificed friendships, time with family, personal recreation, and my own mental sanity for the sake of a career and decent paycheck which has in turn has sucked the life out of me and pretty much run me into the ground. I realize that much of this burnout has had to do with my own personal sacrifices for this corporate career rather than the career/job itself. Thus, I have been actively trying to change it and have sought to move back into a larger, younger, and healthier area. As a single 24-year-old guy, I am desperate to get back into a larger area like I had when I was in college.   
  
The problem is I have not been able to find a new job. The problem is I can’t seem to find another role. I’ve applied to over 700 jobs in cities across the southeast since February. Gone through 10 interview processes and never received an offer. I’ve spent of $500 on a professional resume coach and interview professionals. I've worked with recruiting agencies and job search professionals. This has taken its toll. Once a vibrant, extroverted, sociable young man is now 30 pounds overweight, lacking a good solid community, seemingly depressed who has gone to some pretty dark places and is desperate to get back into the city again where I have friends. I literally feel like I am becoming a sad loner and I cannot have that happen.

While I have successful and verifiable experience in marketing, communications, project management, and event planning, I have come to the point where I will pretty much do anything to get back into a healthier environment. I am 24 years old and feel like I’m always competing against more experienced candidates. I just feel utterly stuck and it’s draining the life out of me.

Thus, I am stuck slaving away in my current role which is full of toxicity. My boss is demeaning and verbally abusive towards women. As I man, I was threatened with termination when I would speak up. All my circles of wisdom are telling me to quit which I’m trying to do. However, while I have been fortunate to earn a stable paycheck, I use much of my income to aggressively pay off my student loans. Thus, I don't have the flexibility to just up and quit my job until I have another one.

I am pleading with the Reddit community to help. I don't need supporting statements. I need practical help: networking opportunities, job leads, information on people hiring, anything. I am desperate to change my life and get out of here. Please help.

Thanks in advance.",WesternAd3013,1,1.0,2,1726854444,2024-09-20 17:47:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fli0m5/absolutely_desperate/,9,2024
1flhvka,"Interviewing for the same position twice, 1 year later. Do I bring up that I interviewed with them previously?","Hi all, this may or may not be as complicated as I’m making it out to be, but I’ve been out of the job market for 15 months so I can’t take many chances.

Last year, I interviewed for a Program Coordinator position at a company my friend worked at. During the interview, I found out that the Program Coordinator position paid next to nothing, so after the interview, I reached out to the interviewer expressing my interest in the Program Manager position as well. They agreed to interview me for it but the interviewer seemed a little annoyed during this second interview lol. After the interview, they told me that they were restructuring the department and the Program Coordinator position was going to be eliminated for now and that they were going with someone more qualified for the Manager role.

I looked up the company on a whim a few days ago and found the Program Coordinator role was re-opened a couple of days ago and I reapplied as the starting salary went up A LOT. The same person who interviewed me last year responded and offered an interview slot to me on Monday. They didn’t seem to indicate that they remembered me.

I’m wondering if I should bring up that I interviewed with them before. I don’t know if it makes me a more desirable candidate that I interviewed with them last year for 2 different roles, or a less desirable candidate who was rejected at least once (twice if they weren’t being honest about the department restructure). What do you think - mention it or not?

1flhkw5,Top performer now under motivated after passed for promotion and low raise,"
Hi everyone. I started my first corporate job in December, along with a few other new hires, all going to the customer service team. We were told we need to wait a year, per company policy, to be promoted. I have been the top performer everyday since my first day being able to work issues. The stats are shown each morning and week and I am shouted out. Every one on one with my boss discusses my success and plans for promotion. My colleagues will do 30 issues a day, when I do 130. Fast forward to this month, I come to learn a colleague is being promoted. Keep in mind, this co-worker was hired the same day as me, and it obviously has not been a year yet. I confronted my manager and she said it came from upper management and HR and it was out of their hands. My manager also advised me how when I was absent for a week it really affected the team and I play a very significant role in the team, therefore they want to keep me where I am. In my performance review a week later, I wanted to ask for a 7-10% raise, however, my aunt high in another company advised me it is too soon. Little did I know, in performance reviews, everyone gets a raise. I received about a 2% raise which is 25 cents more an hour, which my managers acknowledged was low, but the company was in a tight spot. I did not try to bargain because my aunt advised me it was too soon. I have tried to be motivated but I just cannot. I feel so unrewarded for my work. It is unfair I am carrying the team on my back and not being fairly compensated. I have now been holding back and doing less issues. I just am seeking advice and guidance on the situation because I now hate coming to work everyday.",Capital-Ad3422,462,0.9200000166893005,348,1726853333,2024-09-20 17:28:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flhkw5/top_performer_now_under_motivated_after_passed/,9,2024

","Hoping that reddit is the best place to go for this information since every time I look into this topic I am lead to multiple different directions and honestly just feel lost. I graduated college in 2021 (currently 25) and received a bachelor’s in sport management. Changed my major a few times but ended up with sport management because of my passion for sports. Ideally, I would have loved to work in sports business, but at the moment that seems like a stretch. I hate the hours (mostly nights and weekends) and feel as if I do not have any free time in my personal life. I’ve been thinking about a career change, even if it’s not in the sport industry. As the saying goes, do something you love and you’ll never have to work a day in your life, or at least that’s what I thought once I switched to sport management. I did not realize that working in sports would cause me to have no free time nor weekends to enjoy with friends and family. I am looking to work a more traditional 9-5 Monday-Friday job while also getting a bump in salary (I currently make 50k/year). I am really intrigued with data analytics, but I do not have any experience in that field and because of Covid the courses I were taking at the time were cancelled. Reason why I wanted to work with data was because of the movie Moneyball, a big reason as to why I wanted to work in sports business and get knowledge with data analytics. Also, I am not very tech savvy and know I need to improve. As for experience I received a minor in marketing and did a few internships with minor league teams in that field during college. For work experience I worked as a manager in fast food for most of my life until recently I received a job with this sports betting company as a supervisor. I currently supervise a group of analysts who record live data and make sure they are collecting data accurately (yards, scoring plays, etc) but that doesn’t really entail much in the field of analytics. Hoping to hear back with any suggestions of what might be a good career switch for me, or what steps I should take to get a better salary. I am still young but want to start advancing my career.

I also don’t have much relevant experience to this industry which also makes me less confident in pitching myself. Though I do enjoy math and want to learn what skills I need for the job.

1fldhy9,"Yes, tech jobs are slowing down.","

That doesn’t mean that anybody made a bad career choice. It just means that you might have to make a shift in the type of work that you do in IT. That also doesn’t mean that you have to run cable or pursue AI. Sure, it might, but that doesn’t mean it’s definite.

I think a lot of us got into working with computers and tech overall because we were good with computers when we were younger, so we figured we might as well turn it into a career. Then there are the people who did something else, realized they always had an interest in IT, and decided to pursue it later on. And then there are the people who just needed a job and figured this was as good of a career as any. No matter what, yes, it’s oversaturated now.

It was great for a while because working with computers as we now know them was not something that “anybody” could do. They were complex beasts and you were special for both being good with them and being in the right place at the right time. Now, they’re less complicated (from a consumer-grade support perspective), the materials to make them is harder to get, the idea of working with them is commonplace, and the old guard isn’t retiring quickly.

The idea of a job is that you fill a need in an underserved market. That’s why you can drive through small towns and see homes where people sell eggplant. They don’t do that because it’s their passion. They do it because they walk through the farmer’s market on Sundays and overheard people saying that they want eggplant and none of the farmers grow it. So they go to a nursery and spend less than a dollar on seeds and make a few extra grand a year providing that to the community. The IT market now is like if that block and all the blocks surrounding that house all saw that it’s profitable to sell eggplant so they started growing it themselves, too. Sure you get the people who sell “better” eggplant, but instead of one person having a lock on the market they identified, you have a hundred in a small area who all make a few bucks every once in a while, and it’s basically a crapshoot who sells their stuff that week.

If you really want to work in IT, don’t focus on what you want to do and what you’re good at. Focus on what the market needs. If you really like systems but there’s a sudden influx of network jobs, try to get into networking. You can always get into systems through promotions and internal moves after you’ve shown what you’re capable of.

Just don’t keep selling eggplant. Your skill is still growing vegetables (working in tech), so grow a different vegetable that people are asking for (a different IT skill), and use the money from that to do what you really want to do.",StrategyXCareer,25,0.7799999713897705,10,1726842866,2024-09-20 14:34:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fldhy9/yes_tech_jobs_are_slowing_down/,9,2024

1fld3n4,I’m a top performer but my company won’t promote me. ,"I’ve been with my company just over 3 years. I’ve done well in my role, I get good feedback from other functions and I was brought into the High Potential employees group this year. 

My manager seems to be well intentioned, but lacks the skill of advocating for anyone on their team. I’ve not enjoyed working with this manager for over a year, but have no choice as the feedback is not acknowledged. Since earlier this year, I’ve been having conversations about my career path within the company. I’ve asked for an increased scope for my role, a promotion or both. Comes with more money of course. 

My company went into a reorganisation a few months ago, and I took the opportunity to advocate for a bigger role with my new skip level manager. 

No clear path has emerged for me, despite direct and pointed conversations about this. I have been the top performer this year and continue to do well. I feel super frustrated as there doesn’t seem to be any desire by the organisation to reward me. 

I’ve been looking outside but feel conflicted as I’ve done the hard yards to set myself up for success in theory. The external job market isn’t great either.

1flc477,Seeking Career Guidance: Transitioning from Mechanical background to AI ,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 25-year-old Senior Design Engineer currently based in Bangalore, with 4 years of experience in electrical wiring harness design and development for automotive OEMs. Over the past 9 months, I've been working in this role, and while I have a mechanical engineering background, I am currently pursuing a part time postgraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence, which I’ll complete in about a year.

Given the challenges my current industry has been facing since last year, I've been contemplating a career shift to AI, but I'm unsure about how to proceed as my experience in AI/ML is still quite limited. My initial plan was to transition into embedded systems, where I could integrate AI applications. However, I’m not entirely sure if this is the best path forward or if there are better options that I haven’t considered.

I would really appreciate any advice or insights from those who have made similar transitions or are knowledgeable about the AI/ML field. Is focusing on embedded systems the right way to go? Or should I explore other areas where I can leverage both my current experience and my growing interest in AI?

Thank you so much for your time and guidance!

1flbwma,"Do I explain that performance issue was due to mental health reasons, or is that a red flag?","Hi there! I am set to meet with my manager to discuss a performance issue, particularly delivering a project late. 

The issue is, this project was mostly late due to it being assigned at the same time as a negative rut in my life. I don't know that I would say it's depression per se, but sometimes I just get overwhelmed and feel like life is pointless and I'm terrible at it. For the most part I keep this contained so that it's not noticeable outside of my own home, but for some reason it attached itself to this task. 

The task was not really that critical to my role, but was it assigned by an important person on my team. For some strange reason instead of just doing the task, I got it in my head that I was going to fail at the task and be fired. Every single time I opened it up (it was a weeks long, tedious task requiring a lot of focus) I just felt overwhelmed and felt like I literally could not do it. I missed multiple extension dates, and basically spent the last couple weeks waiting for them to fire me over the task. For the most part I accomplish all of my other tasks as scheduled, though I did request to work from home more often than usual during this.

I did eventually complete the task, and resolve some of the other things going on outside of work, and now that it's over it just feels really stupid and doesn't actually make any logical sense. I'm not sure how to explain why this task was late, I'm 7 years into this career so my manager does not expect this type of thing for me. I'm also newer to this company, so this is already a huge red flag. 

I just don't know how to explain this without including that it was a mental health issue, however I realized that that could be more of a red flag and could make my management reconsider having me on the team. 

The whole thing feels really stupid, I don't know why I thought this one task was going to be the nail in the coffin for my entire career. It felt like an inevitable outcome at the time, and I just kept picturing losing my job and then house and car over this. It really wasn't that big of a deal and I had the option to ask for it to go to someone else.",Alternative-Town-250,4,0.8299999833106995,7,1726838576,2024-09-20 13:22:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1flbwma/do_i_explain_that_performance_issue_was_due_to/,9,2024

1flaoo2,[Cross-Post from r/LifeProTips] Discover Why You Were Ghosted After Job Interviews with a Data Subject Request,"Have you ever been ghosted after a few promising job interviews and left wondering what went wrong? Here's a little-known hack that might help you get to the bottom of it, and it's your legal right in many countries!

# What You Can Do:

If you're being ghosted after a few interviews, you might want to send a Data Subject Request (DSR) asking for details of all communications containing your name. This can help you understand what happened and why you were not selected.

# Where This Works:

This approach is effective in countries with strong data protection laws. Here are some examples:

* **European Union (EU):** Under GDPR, you have the right to access your personal data.
* **United Kingdom:** Similar rights under the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.
* **Canada:** PIPEDA grants you the right to access your personal information.
* **Australia**: Privacy Act 1988 provides similar rights.
* **New Zealand**: Privacy Act 2020.
* **Brazil:** General Data Protection Law (LGPD).
* **South Korea**: Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).
* **California, USA**: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

# How to Do It:

1. **Identify the Applicable Law**: Determine the data protection law that applies to the company.
2. **Visit the Company’s Website**: Look for their privacy policy page to find contact details for the Data Protection Officer (DPO).
3. **Draft Your Request**: Use a formal template to request access to all communications containing your name.
4. **Send the Request**: Submit it to the specified contact or the general email address, marking it for the attention of the DPO.

# Sample Request Template:

Subject: Data Subject Access Request

Dear \[Company Name\],

I am writing to formally request access to all personal data that your organization holds about me, in accordance with \[relevant data protection law, e.g., GDPR, CCPA\]. Specifically, I am requesting access to all communications, including emails, internal memos, and notes, that contain my name.

Please confirm receipt of this request and provide the requested information within the timeframe stipulated by \[relevant data protection law\].

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

\[Your Name\]

\[Your Contact Information\]

# Additional Tips:

**Keep Records:** Maintain copies of all correspondence related to your request.

**Be Specific:** Clearly specify the type of data you are requesting.

**Follow Up:** If you don't receive a response within the legally mandated time frame, follow up with the organization.

1flafv9,Apprehensive about a job offer,"I am currently 35 making 100k a year at a large asset manager which I have been with for five years. I have been through two layoffs in my career which I believe have set me back, as well as COVID where I was stuck as a contract worker before transitioning to full time. In addition, I have health issues that were also a priority both during my 20s and especially since 2021. 

I enjoy what I do and genuinely like my coworkers, as well as the benefits the company provides. Both of these were not present in former roles at other large firms and made me hate my career choice at the time. I have unlimited time off, get to WFH two days a week, which is helpful managing my health. I also have work life balance and almost always work 9-5 hours. My specific team is much better than others at the firm for all these reasons.

I am grateful for all of that. Still, I feel that I am underemployed compared to my peers, and should have a higher title and salary. My goal was to reach VP and 100k by age 30, so I feel I am at least five years late. The promotion process here can be 1-2 years, and that's IF I am put up for one next year, which I don't think is likely. So at best, I would become a VP at 37, and probably not much of an internal pay raise. I like my team but feel my career will not go anywhere further here, and feel disrespected by leadership since I have trained much of the team, but was told instead of being promoted that they would hire two new VPs, who I would also assist in training.

I am entertaining a job offer that would be mostly remote, and a 150k base salary. It is with a small consulting firm but they have a project for the next two years with another large asset manager, so putting that on my resume would be very appealing. And it would allow me to have a huge pay raise for the next two years at least, instead of staying stagnant. 

I think it's a no brainer, and will most likely accept it if it is approved. But I know I value some of the other things aside from salary - the health insurance at the new role is worse, and I do utilize it. I will be mostly remote so will miss out on the social aspects of my team, won't be able to keep my therapist, etc. I am apprehensive that the extra salary won't make up for the potential loss in my quality of life. I have an autoimmune disease that is progressive, so stress management is important to keep that in remission. However, I know I won't be getting a 50% pay raise internally for many years if at all. 

I own a rental property but currently rent an apartment for myself. The extra income would be nice to build up my savings and provide more of a cushion for the future, possible marriage/home ownership/ etc. 

How can I feel better about the big changes in terms of what I may be losing by leaving, and make sure my mental and physical health aren't negatively impacted, when I could be losing my therapist and possibly have to change doctors?

1fl91gr,"20, have no idea what I want to do for a career in life","I'm 20, redoing high school in the UK. I'm currently doing Philosophy A level, French A level and Applied Psychology BTEC. I'm supposed to be deciding whether I want to go to University or not, but I have no idea what I want to do in life. Of course, the study element of University is interesting but I'm definitely not going to go if it's not going to serve me in a career later on in life. Some interests/dislikes of mine:

  
-I would like to live in a rural area one day, preferably the french alps and I'd like to find a career that can facilitate that.

-I don't want to work a corporate office job in a city. I wouldn't mind working at a desk if it was a small office, e.g at the forestry commission of my town or from home.

-I really like books, so I'm wondering if being a librarian would be an option and what i'd need to do to get that job.

-I'd be interested in forestry, tree surgery or horticulture because I love gardening

-I wouldn't want to be a teacher

-I would be interested in some form of woodwork like guitar making

-Another option for living rurally would be to do a completely online job. What types of jobs would be completely online?

-I can ski

-I am down to learn a trade

-I can climb a little bit

-I'd like to have some time for hobbies like reading and playing guitar

-I'd also want to work on the side on a self sufficient vegetable garden/orchard if i'm living rurally.

What jobs could facilitate this way of life? Which of these options would be better to go to university for, and which would be better to do an apprenticeship for? I apologise if my post is really naive. I'm young and stupid after all..

I’m working in the hospitality industry since 2018 and I joined only because I couldn’t find a job at that time. I’ve worked in hotels between 505 to 700 rooms which was crazy with the level of stress and high operation. I was burnt out the entire time I would bring my coffee to the office and never drink it. It started when they liked my performance and promoted me to a supervisor. I admit it I learned a lot and my personality has changed in terms of communication and skills I understood myself better and everyone thinks I excel at every job I take. My role between 2021-2023 was a managerial one and it’s where things started to get real. I remember my brother taking me to the hospital twice after work because I was unwell, I was short staffed and I overworked. My mom got tired of asking me to come home after my actual duty finishes. The management was crazy for refusing to hire more people, people were fighting me for shitty things like the fact that I’m a woman and women shouldn’t be managing departments. Suspect my decisions, and on top of that I figure out that some people were only supporting me because they were emotionally attracted to me I swear I had no time for this shit, taking more than 1 day off was a crime to them 😭 cried like a baby when they accepted my resignation. I stayed at home for 4 months clearing my mind from the shit I have been going through, considering working in the industry for long these are the only offers I was getting. I joined another hotel late 2023 and things were weird as hell so I left after 7 months. Joined another, salary is better, people are better but deep down I hate the fact that I am working in this industry and I don’t see myself working in it for the coming 4-5 years hell no.

1fl7gzf,How frame PhD drop-out on resume/LinkedIn,"Background: I come from a country where structured PhD programs are rare. A master's degree is required to start a PhD and you are usually employed as a researcher with a part-time, limited-time contract at a university with the option to hand in a thesis (no classe, just work). You can't switch to another lab/research group. You are bound to your PI who is also your boss.

So, I got my MSc and joined a lab as a PhD student. Unfortunately, the postdoc who was my supervisor was a massive bully and the working atmosphere was very toxic. I quit after a year (I did try student counseling, they didn't help). I joined another lab at a different university (completely different research area). I spent about 3.5 years there. However, the research yielded no results, the experiments weren't working. I had no support from my PI. PI was almost never there, no postdoc to supervise me. My area of research was also completely unrelated to the rest of the work group. (PI tried to breach into a new field but lost interest soon) I tried switching my research focus but PI refused. When my first contract ended I decided to look for another job.

Honestly, both labs I worked in had a high staff turnover rate due to poor leadership.

I currently listed my experience as research associate, not mentioning PhD student as I don't have a degree. However, I do have the experience that PhD graduates have, having spent about 4.5 years in academia. Anyone who has spent some time in science will probably know that I was a PhD candidate during this time, at least the last job. But recruiters probably don't know and only look for buzzwords like ""PhD"" or ""doctorate"". I don't want to lie on my resume or look like a total failure but I feel like I might be depriving myself of job opportunities.

Do you have suggestions in how to frame this on my resume?",Dingbat2022,1,1.0,0,1726822381,2024-09-20 08:53:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fl7gzf/how_frame_phd_dropout_on_resumelinkedin/,9,2024

1fl6w8i,Attorney with no idea what to do,"Hi, guys! I finally got the courage to write something despite my anxiety - but I just got fired yesterday and honestly I'm so at loss. I hope maybe some of you will find the time to look at what I wrote and share their thoughts and success stories of leaving law. I would really appreciate it!

So as in the title - I'm an attorney. Very unhappy one (as it is often the case in legal profession). I've studied Law because it seemed reasonable and I didn't have any particular interests (or had too many of them maybe - hello, my ADHD). I've never worked outside legal profession...

I've been a legal trainee, got my bar exam (that managed to deepen my depression, anxiety, and compulsive eating), and worked as an attorney for a while. I've tried to quit law but it was hard to pick anything else I can do + the pressure from the outise (""You've worked so hard for this, why do you want to quit now?!"" + if I didn't become a doctor, at least I can be an attorney...). 

I finally switched a bit from legal to compliance - I actually enjoyed it a little bit more. I've been working in a pharma company for over a year. I have a great boss, and people from the business side of things are amazing. Unfortunately, thee company started to make cutbacks due to financial reasons. Many departments got affected - and from our very small compliance team across Europe, my region is the only one with two people in compliance department. So... I think it was no brainer for them, even though my agreement was recently renewed, I got raise and bonus, and got excellent performance reviews from all sides. This didn't matter at all.

I also never worked anywhere more than 2 years - I just get bored and frustrated, and I usually leave myself. This was the first job where I thought I would stay in for longer. I was just talking with my therapist that finally I have safe and stable career so I can maybe start working on something else on the side. 

What is also important - I'm F32, and live in the Eastern Europe. Cannot leave my country due to serious illnesses in my family and aging grandparents. I like writing, but I'm not sure I'm good at it. I loved drawing when I was little, but dropped it because ""you won't make career out of it"" and didn't draw for over 15-20 years. I had proofreading and editing courses in my mother language. 

I think I need your success stories now - from people who were so deep into their long-learnt careers who managed to break free ;) Sorry for this long post. If anybody got through my post, even if they don't plan to comment - thank you!",janiscat,1,1.0,0,1726819640,2024-09-20 08:07:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fl6w8i/attorney_with_no_idea_what_to_do/,9,2024

1fl4xpq,Boss obsessed with me ,"Does anyone have a boss who is obsessed with them? I have been working for a small business for 5 years. I was supposed to leave once I finished my Bachelors & Masters but some things happened with my health and I had to stay a little longer, anyway I am currently looking for a new job but with the way the economy is right now it’s tough. 

I have a boss that makes me feel so guilty for wanting to leave. When I first started the job I told her it would be temporary until I finish my degree. I stayed way longer than I should have (my fault). My boss is oddly obsessed with me. She is about 61 and I’m 27 and she does really weird things sometimes that make me crazy. She will put her head on my shoulder, come stand next to me and put her arms around me, stands very close to me, and is constantly trying to set me up with her loser son ( mentions it every day and I never respond btw the son is 15 years older than me). Anyway, my boss I feel like is constantly trying to “show off” in front of me. She’s always asking personal questions, every time I want to leave work she talks to me for about 20 extra minutes( unpaid). She is one of those people who you can give the world to and she will not be happy. She is also one of those types a people that has a story for everything (even if it’s unrelated). You can say “oh I feel pain in my side” and then immediately she has pain in some area of her body. She is always complaining (idk why she has so much money) and I’m so sick of her. I’m so sick of her!! I’m miserable at that job. Pay is so bad, no benefits, no PTO, people at McDonalds are making more than me. I’m miserable.

I can’t leave because any money is better than no money but idk how to deal with her. I tried to be rude but it’s not me and I just end up feeling so bad for being disrespectful. She is the owner of the company so there is no HR or anyone higher up. Idk what to do. If anyone has tips please let me know because I have had enough with her.

1fl4237,Mechanical Engineer (1.5 YOE): Seeking Long-Term Career Strategy Advice,"also posted elsewhere on r/careerguidance , but wanted to get more feedback



# Background

I (25M, Los Angeles, CA) currently work as a test technician in an R&D department in the automotive industry. I have test engineer experience from a previous job but left due to burnout, and found this current job, which is relatively lax in comparison. I'm trying to assess the best strategy for my career from here on out. I'm under contract and from my perspective I don't know where this department is heading (half of our team just left and I don't know if more people are leaving); I haven't heard anything from our lead engineer on whether they will promote our remaining team members (there are other techs who come first in seniority and relevant experience) or not. I'm hoping for elucidation on what industry(s) and position(s) I should pursue from here on out, given what I hope to gain from employment.

1.  **Pay:** I would like to find an industry(s) with positions that have a potentially high salary ceiling (meaning $150k+). I understand it takes time and experience to work up to this salary range. I would be grateful if someone could point me in the right direction to direct my focus though.
2. **Work Style:** Remote/Hybrid work potential. I have ME and other engineering friends that work hybrid or remote and they are <5 years older than me, so I know these positions are obtainable. I know this work style is a privilege for the ME industry, but I don't mind grinding it out over the long haul in order to attain this work style.
3. **Growth Prospects:** Preferably an industry that will enjoy high growth over the long term. I'd like to ride the rising tide of the market, if anybody knows an industry that's experiencing a surge in growth. This would make me feel more confident in finding employment opportunities.

I understand that it is difficult to find something that includes both (1) and (2), especially since it's something that we would all like (Money and Flexibility with our time). Conventional wisdom dictates that you must choose one or the other. However, I know that these positions do exist— positions that pay well and integrate elements of remote work (or even fully integrate it) in growing industries. 

The type of industry is not very important to me. I get a lot of happiness and fulfillment from my life outside of work, especially from being with my family and friends. I don't expect to seek much fulfillment from work beyond the curiosity that comes from novelty, the sense of satisfaction that comes from problem solving, and meeting cool coworkers. I also know that creating plans can only help you so much, until life punches you in the face. I only want to create a framework to work with, and then just roll with the punches. My main concern is making enough money to help myself and my loved ones.



If anybody has any advice on what industry/position to target, I would really appreciate it! I'm also open to any advice from those with more life experience than me, if you think I'm being misguided in my approach. I want to maximize my time while I'm here.BackgroundI (25M, Los Angeles, CA) currently work as a test technician in an R&D department in the automotive industry.

1fl34pb,Should I quit or stay?,"Hi everyone, looking for advice. I have MDD and GAD and while I was mostly high-functioning during school and early career, multiple factors (family, marriage, work) have made things extremely difficult for me to work the past year. My work ethic and abilities have greatly declined and I started procrastinating. I feel the only reason I haven’t been fired yet is because my manager was too busy to notice that work wasn’t being done. Manager is now starting to pick up on this and I feel like I might get fired soon but I don’t know if this is my anxiety talking. 

I opened up to them about my struggles (some may advise against this as this could be used against you later on) but I received some support so it helped for a bit. I am starting to DREAD work, it shoots me with anxiety signing on every morning. I find it hard to sleep the night before. I contemplate quitting every day. I also can sense the general feeling that my team doesn’t like me anymore as they had to pick up some work I lacked on. I completely understand as I wouldn’t appreciate extra work being placed on me either. My main concern with quitting is that I don’t have anything lined up. I haven’t been looking either because I fear I am going to fail there too as I haven’t improved my mental condition. I started therapy so I hope to start improving but I am sure it’ll take months to learn helpful coping mechanisms that would improve my daily functioning and work abilities. 

I have some savings and my husband is working (doesn’t make as much as me but we could get by). No children.

Again, I have GAD so decisions like this cause me to think of worst case scenarios so I feel like if I quit, I’ll lose everything and if I stay I will go crazy from living this miserable life with no time to focus on improving my mental health. I am leaning towards taking a few months break to figure myself out and my mental health but I have been browsing lots of posts and I have seen a lot of good points that it isn’t always smart to be unemployed and to always have something lined up. My issue is that I am mentally unstable and I desperately crave a break to just rest for once in my life and not take care of everyone else but myself. I have always been the one in my family to take care of everyone (emotionally and financially at some points) and I feel like I am reaching some breaking point. I am just looking for some sobering advice.

Thank you in advance! Any guidance is appreciated. ",namuslimah,1,1.0,0,1726803970,2024-09-20 03:46:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fl34pb/should_i_quit_or_stay/,9,2024
1fl2zrn,Quitting will screw this small business over but I hate it,"To start. I’ve been working at this place for about 3 1/2 months. It’s a very small family business consisting of basically a woman and her husband working there and their daughter(daughter is now on maternity leave for six weeks bc come to find out, she was pregnant- worked up until she literally had the baby about a month ago and is set to come back to work AND BRING THE NEWBORN INTO THE OFFICE in about 2 weeks). I interviewed there two months prior but they hired someone else. I don’t know what the circumstances were surrounding the other person leaving but in 2 months but, regardless, 2 months later they contacted me asking if I was still looking for something. I was working at two part time jobs at the time and left both of them to work there as it sounded more interesting to me and was a full time position. 
I have hated my experience working there. First of all, these people are very religious. Which I guess is fine if thats your thing but I cannot take hearing Christian rock all day which is what they play in their store. Second, the woman who owns it is incredibly rude and condescending. She makes me feel like an idiot if I make a mistake it’s the end of the world but if her husband her daughter or her do anything then it’s no big deal. A few weeks ago she printed out a written warning basically saying I’m bad at my job and if I step out of like she will fire me. She makes little digs at me like she gets upset if I walk in with two beverages in the morning?? She messed up my payroll last week and double payed me. When I told her she rolled her eyes and acted like it was my fault and then said “well I’m just not going to pay you for next week. You’ll just need to budget 🙄. You can handle that” Anyway, I’m hoping to move to a new city in the next few months anyway BUT I really feel like I can’t take it anymore. I can go back to one of my old part time jobs in the 2 months I’m preparing for my move but I have to travel to the new city in about 3 weeks to set some things up in preparation to move(these dates can’t be moved). They won’t let me have the days off I need because I took 1 sick day a few weeks ago and was gone for a week in the beginning of June for a week for 2 weddings I was in (approved before I started working there). So I’m thinking of just giving my 2 weeks and then going back to part time job before my move but I honestly feel bad. They are in such a horrible position with the daughter being gone and I honestly think they are so ridiculous for making her come back as soon as she is  (and having her take the baby to work omg). Any advice.

1fl2jg8,Am I putting unrealistic expectations on myself for being new at a job?,"

Prior to this job, I worked in financial aid for ~2 yrs. That was my 1st time ever working in the field but before that job I was an academic advisor. Early on during training when I was on a call with a trainer, I ended up breaking down crying bc I felt overwhelmed. I ended up pushing through & the trainers let my new team know that I was doing well. Eventually ended up having higher metrics compared to a lot of people on my team. Anxiety was always there but I got *better*, I was miserable at that job though due to the workload. 

Now I’m in my 3rd week working for another school remotely in FA again, this is a school I’ve been trying to get in at for almost as long as I was at my other job (mostly bc of pay). I’m training by myself with the manager & I like her so far, she keeps telling me that I’m doing a good job (I’m not asking) & she felt the need to let the whole team know that I’m doing good/picking up fast when I was introduced to them earlier this week. This job is more in depth vs the last job & she even told me that they only hire people with experience now bc of how much there is to it. When she first taught me something new, it took a few tries & I picked it up, then she teaches me something else & I get it the first try. 

I made my first 2 calls today & I felt shaky, she also said nicely that the first few calls will feel like that/ it was obvious it was one of my first calls but I did a good job. I felt like a wreck + then she gave me another assignment of something I caught onto before but I ended up getting stuck this time. I was obv frustrated & it was right before I was done for the day but I just couldn’t think straight bc I felt so upset with my progress. 

Am I being too hard on myself? Am I right to believe this might not be a good fit for me? I’ve been so upset since I clocked out & am dreading tomorrow.

I think a major reason these jobs are denying me is due to a lack of formal experience (but how do I get that no one is willing to take a chance on me???) I have no clue what else to do as I feel I have exhausted all my options. My family is pressuring me to go to the military and I reallyyyyyy do not want to go. I know it’s an opportunity to get me where I want but I have my own notions about why I do not want to go that I don’t really want to get into. I stay in the DFW area, and I am barely skating by with my rent payments for this apartment. Please someone help me, any advice on what you think I could do better, places I could apply, etc. would be helpful.

1fl1qm6,Jobs related to business analyst,"Hi - Hoping this is the right place for this. I recently got laid off from my first job and am struggling to figure out what to do next. My last role was related to strategy and competitive research but I didn’t really love it so I’m trying to figure out what type of role I want next. I’m thinking I want something related to a business analyst, project manager, or more operational role, but that feels very unspecific. I’d also prefer something that isn’t too client or presentation focused, and I like excel type stuff, but I also don’t have a finance/accounting degree.

If anyone has ideas of job titles that I should be looking for related to this, that would be so helpful!

1fl1i4g,20% pay cut for switching jobs?,"I recently received an offer that pays 20% less than my current job. Even though the pay is lower, I think it is a step in the right direction for my career growth. For context, I've been a developer for 7 years in my current company and I want to switch to a more business-oriented role, and this offer is in sales engineering, which I think is a good midpoint between business and technical work and a way to transition into something like strategy in the future. It also has the word ""Senior"" in the job title.

My dilemma is there isn't a strong push factor for my current job. I like my team, can do the work, and the benefits are good. However, I'm bored of my job and have no interest in my projects, which is why I started talking to recruiters. A part of me wants to stay in something familiar and just take the money, but the other says I'm still too young to not try to learn new skills and staying will hurt me in the long run.

Assuming both companies have the same benefits and culture, would you take a 20% pay cut to switch to a job that helps your personal career growth?

Also, if you've switched from software engineering to operations strategy, I'd love to hear your story!",crispy_lemon,2,1.0,3,1726798591,2024-09-20 02:16:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fl1i4g/20_pay_cut_for_switching_jobs/,9,2024

1fl0xda,spiteful former employer ruining my career,"I'm scared that my former employer is ruining my career.

I worked for a state agency and I put my two weeks in before the end of my 12 month probationary period. I was on month 10. I had also worked for another state agency in the same state for over 2 years and left on amicable terms then.

The day after I put my two week notice in, my manager and bureau chief fired me, citing poor performance during my probationary period. Personally, I was really upset and felt that it was spiteful for them to not let me continue my two weeks but I thought, hey now I can get unemployment, whatever, it is what it is. 

I have since gotten two conditional job offers from other state departments, only to have them rescinded when they contact my past agency. I have been upfront in telling the interviewers that I didn't excel in my previous job and that I put in a two week notice just to be let go the next day. This leads me to think my former employer is like blacklisting me from the state somehow or disparaging my name. I didn't think I left on bad terms at all. I am terrified because my degrees are in political science. All of my experience is in the public sector and I cannot be blackballed from the state over this. I recognized I was not a good fit for the job and tried to leave and they fired me anyways like what do I do?? What was I supposed to have done?? I tried to leave before I was fired for not doing a good job in that role and they did all this anyways! I feel like I have ruined my entire life!! 

Backstory: During my time there, there was an incident where the trainer yelled at me. I apologized for whatever I did to make her upset but she never spoke about it to me again. I went to her superior to make sure everything was fine after a few days and the meeting just got turned into things he pointed out that I did wrong. I felt this trainer's feelings toward got worse and that she was exceptionally harsh in reviewing my work. I brought this up to my manager twice and it was brushed off. Ultimately I was fired after turning in my two weeks notice for my ""high error rate"". 

Backstory #2: Part of the reason I left too was due to inconsistencies in their application of policy. Either their policies were not updated to match state law or their trainers were not updated. There were inconsistencies that I asked about a few times. Things that affected my job a lot. Calls that I had to make to sobbing victims, it was awful. I ended up doing as I was told and I also reached out to the Bureau Attorney to let them know something about our policies were wrong or not up to date. He just forwarded it to my manager who then got mad about me going over her head. (I had actually verbally discussed the case and policy this dealt with days earlier with her and didn't feel my concern was taken seriously). Anyways this specific policy required me to break heartbreaking news to someone, which I was told to do and I did. Then my manager said I should have just ""held off"" on giving the decision as to not ""upset her too much"". I was disgusted by that and I put in my two weeks specifically because of that.

Also I just want to note that I am neurodivergent and I felt hostility at my job because of that. My manager frequently had talks with me about my social anxiety and not being talkative enough and one time when I tried to explain I was diagnosed with autism, she told me to only talk about that with HR. One time I also tried to explain that I considered her tone harsh in her emails and she said I made HER uncomfortable by saying that to her. 

Honestly it was a terrible fit for me. I didnt fit in. I didn't do the job well because I relied too heavily on written policy I think and had issues communicating that I think. I just feel like this has ruined my career and don't know what to do and I am scared.

I’ve only been at my company for about a year, but I’m looking to leave due to having a completely unsustainable workload.

1fkzhpp,"Shifting careers: hopefully making 90K, working outside, sole household income (26M)","Hello, I have followed this thread for a while looking for advice and seeing what different people say for different situations and thought I would share my own to get some feedback.  
  
I am 26 years old and looking to switch fields from what I am currently doing. I co-founded a pretty successful residential maintenance company on the east coast of the united states 3 years ago. I have worn all the ""hats"" for this business due to it being a start up but mainly focused on the operation. We have roughly 25 employees and do 3M in revenue annually. However I have decided to leave the company to be more present with my wife and our child that will be born this fall. In this upcoming season, ideally my wife will be able to leave her job to stay at home with our newborn and be a stay at home mom. To do this I have made a budget and need to bring in roughly 90K annually to afford our mortgage, utility bills, insurance, retirement, some minimal savings, etc. Where we live this would be lower middle class for household income but we really do not want to move cause of our friends and community. All the exit strategy is worked out responsibilities backfilled at our company and ready for me to leave. I just have no idea what I want to do. I just knew I wanted to get out and not deal with property managers/realtors, having a company that operates 24/7 or being in ""management"" and in an office anymore.  

I have asked some mentors and older friends of mine what I should do. A lot of them have told me to look into going a corporate or consulting route more than likely remote. They think it would be the best way for me to make the amount I need to and have a better work life balance than I previously did. I think there is a lot of wisdom in that, however it would be really difficult for me to be behind a computer all day (I think I would go a little crazy). I also have been cautioned to not start another business yet cause I am leaving a start up to spend more time with my growing family and by nature entrepreneurial ventures are time consuming. 

My first couple of jobs before starting the company above I worked mainly with my hands in signage fabrication, surfboard manufacturing, construction, or outside doing hiking trail maintenance. I loved most of these jobs and really miss working outside and with my hands. I also interned in college doing sports radio and loved that as well (even though my degree was in marketing). There is just not a lot of money in these for me to be the sole source of income for my family from what I can find and discussed with potential employers.

  
In summary I am torn between some wise advice with responsibility and youthful desire but if you have any ideas that could line up with the following would love to hear them:

* $90,000+
* 40 Hours a week (5/8s or 4/10s)
* Not on call
* Working with my hands
* Working outside
* Individual Contributor
* Fields of interest: History, Writing, Sports, Nature (Outdoor)

  
Thanks for taking the time to read about my life and situation.

1fkyz2h,Entire Department is Pregnant ,"Hi everyone, I recently landed a new job and it was disclosed that I would provide coverage for one woman who will go on maternity leave in an administrative role while I spent the rest of my available time in the role I am hired for. Now that I’ve started (I’ve been here around 6 weeks), I’ve found out that the entire department is pregnant aside from one woman who is on the brink of retirement. 

My managers have started to try to “sell” me on the value of staying the role that I’m covering for long term instead of giving me the tasks associated with the role I am hired for. I’m concerned for obvious reasons primarily because some of the women are having high risk pregnancies and also because the bulk of my prior work experience is within their department (and I’ve been historically good at it). Can anyone advice me on how to proceed? I’ve already expressed my unhappiness to both of my managers and they’ve either lied to me or given me non answers like “think about how we feel with all these girls getting pregnant, it’s a tough spot to be”. I really just want to quit because if I stick around in delaying my field experience and therefore my salary in the long run. Especially if these girls don’t come back, I will be in this department for at minimum a year.

1fkyfkl,"How should I negotiate an ""up to 40% travel"" job requirement?","Hello All,

I am currently in the hiring process for a new job (remote in the US). I passed the first few rounds and all that is left is a final round interview with the managing director. For now it seems like a great fit and I would be very excited if I was hired for the role.

One thing that has been concerning is in the job description they want someone that has the ability to travel up to 40% to domestic and international trade shows, conferences, and head office.

Just some background on me, I'm a US born Korean-American, whose parents live in the US, and I'm married to a Korean living in Korea. Usually, I don't mind traveling frequently for work. The issue is since my wife lives in Korea I want to find work that allows me to work in any location so I can be with her. Living in Korea while working in the US timezone is also already something I'm used to from my previous work experience so that's only a minor inconvenience.

The company listed the trade shows they are participating in and there were about 8 in a span of 30 days during peak months, and about 1 per month on the low end. For peak months, I can stay a month at my parents place and travel to the shows in the US. But traveling even once a month from Korea to the US is not something I can manage financially.

I still need to clarify with the managing director exactly what 40% travel looks like and if I would be required to go to every single show vs splitting participation between the team. But given the information I have now here are some options I have considered (in no specific order):

1. Only participating in the international shows (this would help lower their costs send me to their shows in Asia from Korea vs from US while the shows to Europe would be similar priced)
2. Just flat out asking for reduced requirement on travel, something like just the big shows, conferences and important head office events. Maybe like 5-6 trips from Korea to the US total.
3. Accepting the full 40% requirement but asking the company to pay for my round trip travel from Korea to the US as needed. (I can imagine this option is highly unlikely to be accepted)
4. Accepting a lower salary in order to have any of the other 3 options accepted.

I know I'm getting ahead of myself as I am still not 100% sure I will be landing this role. However I would really like to know at what stage, to who, and how I should be communicating these concerns. Should I wait until I receive the final job offer to voice them? Should I speak with internal recruiter or the managing director who will be overseeing my team or the HR rep? How should I approach negotiating the terms of the travel requirement while simultaneously expressing that I am willing and able to put more work just to lower the travel? I am really considering just asking for lower salary just to make this work out.

1fkxrsi,What should I do? ,"I've worked in the cannabis industry for 5+ years and built myself up to an upper management position with a great salary (60k a year). 

I have a college degree in Mass Communication/media studies that isn't exactly relevant to my job, but my own field rarely pays well. 

I quit smoking cannabis a year ago and I'm so burnt out on this job. It's not fun for me anymore. 

I search and search Indeed for different positions but the pay is either too low for me to survive, or my resume/application gets ignored. I'm guessing because it's on there that I've spent half a decade working with cannabis and other companies don't want a stoner running their store. 

I'm unsure of where to go from here or what career path to take. I'm debating getting an HR certification because of the job security it provides, and I have a lot of experience managing people. I thrive way better behind the scenes in an office type setting than in customer service.

1fkxc59,Feeling down about work,"Recently got a new job (late June) and I feel like I'm spinning my wheels. It's a sales job, with uncapped commissions and when I took the job I was shown the math that 60k was a realistic expectation. However the job available wasn't the one I applied for, it was instead 1.5hrs away from my house and in a location where I would have to do over 1/3 of the projected Gross Profit myself and the store would need to hit it's goals 100% every month for 12 months straight in order to make 60K. I get it, we're salesman, but I feel like I was ""sold"" the job. I tried putting in a transfer request to a position closer, and the manager told me the postings on the internal site are not real -- they collect resumes and interview candidates and then bench them so that if there's turnover they can quickly replace staff. In the last 2 months I've seen my manager and district manager maybe a total of 3 times, for a few hours at a time. Communication isn't really happening and the only communication that does happen is all hype train corporate gobbledygook. None of my co-workers discuss anything non-work related and there is no sense of comradery or shared experience. Nobody is asking how I'm doing, or if I want to hangout, or about my interests outside of work. I just feel very alone, and since I just switched jobs, I don't have the money to get out and go someplace different. So I need the money I do make, even if it's not the 60k/year I was told I could reliably make. So the only alternative is too find some way to bridge the communication gaps, and make the trip worth it. How do you guys relate too your co workers?

1fkw6ge,Advice about putting my web development skills to use in another endeavour,"Hello. I am a web developer, but I feel like I'm starting to feel like my web development skills are better suited to creating something for myself but in a separate endeavour, as I'm not having much success in finding people. If I can't get anyone to want me to build them a website for free and hosted for only £6 per month with no contract, I think my efforts are lost and I'd be earning a pittance for the sake of wanting to pursue it. I know how to do a lot in web development. Django, Python, WebSockets, WebRTC, Ubuntu, Linux, I could perhaps create any kind of app that anyone wanted. Booking and scheduling, video  chat, e-commerce, security, anything.

Could you give me some ideas to put my skills into use? Let me give you some information about myself to allow you to give me suggestions of what I can do:

I love/like:
- My wife, children and family in general. They are my everything.
- Football (or soccer if you're from the US) and sports in general.
- Languages (in particular Spanish and French)
- Delivery driving - perhaps a less exciting one, but it's probably the only ""normal"" job that I actually thoroughly enjoy and is what I do in my day-to-day job.
- Children, I love children in general. They are the most precious things on this planet.
- Science, maybe more of a milder interest as I like watching videos on how lots of different things work in this world.
- Being kind. I love to make people happy and always try and go the extra mile for anyone, probably more than others. 

I don't like:
- Tutoring, I know there's a bit of demand for it but it really saps the life out of me.
- Childminding, exact same reason as above
- Being asked to develop web apps for people who want me to ""join"" their ventures so they get their website for nothing and do nothing, but still reap the profit from it if something came of it - seriously, don't even try it. I've had many chancers try it 😅 I like to be kind, not taken for a ride ☺️

I like, but have tried and not had much success in:

- Web Development
- Translation and video subtitling services

Thank you for any advice, it would be much appreciated. I feel like I need to add that I am actually pretty contented in my life, I feel very happy in myself and even my job. I do however feel like I have an itch to scratch by putting what I know into good use and bring some value to people from it, whether that be directly or indirectly.",Dear-Slide6882,1,1.0,0,1726782654,2024-09-19 21:50:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkw6ge/advice_about_putting_my_web_development_skills_to/,9,2024

I’m not sure who else I would give my two weeks to, and I do have a close relationship with my manager - a few people left a few months ago and she said that it’s ok if I wanted to tell her I was looking (I did not at all lol).

","
Hey everyone,

I’m (M26) mechanical engineering graduate from a Tier II NIT. After college, I spent a few years preparing for the UPSC and gave two attempts, but now I’ve decided to put that on hold. Honestly, it sucks to still be asking your parents for money at this age, and being unemployed definitely takes a toll on your mental health too. I’m really trying to become financially independent before considering the exam again.

Lately, I’ve been doing some freelancing work as an LLM trainer (working with AI models), which has been a decent side gig, but I’m looking for something more stable. Ideally, I’d love to get back into something related to tech or engineering, or even a mix of both or even something like a social media management profile.

If anyone could help me out with a referral or point me in the right direction, I’d be super grateful. Thanks a lot!",Megakairyu,1,1.0,0,1726780168,2024-09-19 21:09:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkv81d/looking_for_job_referrals/,9,2024
1fkuxvw,Uncertainty at work gives me panic attacks,"And i am sick and tired of it. For context im a 25 y/o who recently graduated with masters in computer science and is working my first job since last year. I would love to move but due to visa constraints i am stuck here till the end of the year atleast. I have been described as talented and intelligent by everyone around me and yet they keep disregarding my opinion on almost every matter and now ive just stopped fighting as i cannot with my mental health. I finished a pretty successful project last year and i am still technically maintaining it. My old boss was really good. He had clear plan laid out for me, i was also working with my then best friend. I really was liking it.

But sometime over the last year, almost simultaneously. My best friend was fired and my boss quit. My friend stopped all communication with me which hurt me deeply as he was my only friend. My new boss is 2 levels higher than a manager, he used to be the boss of my boss. He is nice and says nice things but at the same time he does nothing for me. He keeps mentioning projects but the only project i am working on is where they dont even need me. My old project which i am maintaining and project managing and developing has completely burned me out. Nowadays there is nothing to do so i took up some new ventures all by myself i am creating work for me.

My question is what do i do? I cannot live in this uncertainty because it is driving me insane. Step in my shoes for a bit, I work onsite 9-5, after 5 i cook and sleep. On weekends, i try to socialize but nowadays it’s becoming less and less viable since i don’t drive, all my social life is my work and I work alone. I am in a company where nobody is my age, the people who are my age work very far away from me and actively ignore me since im not white. I have 1 friend who i like but i can only spend 1-2 hours every other day with him. Never in my life have i felt this alone, i am always the person who lights up the room but now my self confidence is shattered, i combat that with working out so it helps me numb out the emotional pain. But is this what life is? Is this what im expected to do forever?

1fku22m,I can't stand being a software developer anymore. Is mechanical engineering too similar?,"A little context: I'm fairly new to the career. Only 4 years of professional experience building software for companies

I was blinded by the promise of money when picking colleges. I ended up going to an accelerated bachelor's program (fully accredited, so at least there's that) in order to graduate in under 4 years. It was a private, for profit institution which really should have been more a consideration on my part.

After graduation, it took 8 months to land my first job. Since then, I've lost my job 3 times due to volatility in the industries and at this point I can't find any enjoyment in the kinds of projects I've been tasked with. I wanted to enjoy this career so much, but it's so boring sitting in front of the computer all the time writing the same kinds of logic. I was promised puzzles to solve, but it feels like one puzzle I have to solve hundreds of times.

Lately I've been thinking about switching careers entirely and picking up a second bachelor's degree in engineering. I love the idea of working in the automotive industry, and I'm really passionate about making cars more efficient in order to help preserve the climate. Is engineering too similar to SWE in that I'm going to run into the same issues or are there jobs within the field that are more hands-on, ""get out of your chair and move""-esque?

I just feel kinda lost. I'm the sole income for my family, and will be for at least 2 more years while my partner finishes their degree in electrical engineering, but I desperately want to leave this career field to the point I'm struggling to focus on my current job.

As a side note, I'd love to hear about other high paying careers that are a bit more hands-on and don't require sitting in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day.

I just became aware that the government (U.S.) increased the minimum salary threshold for administrative employees to be considered “exempt” from overtime pay. My salary does not meet this minimum threshold. I was not aware of this when I signed my contract and in my employment contract it states my salary and the expectation that I will work “approximately 45 hours per week”. So far it has not been a problem because I have not been asked to work overtime. However, I will soon be taking on more responsibilities since I will be covering for coworker who will be on leave for several months.

1fks8wv,Take a new job or wait for a promotion?,"I (27f) currently work for a locally owned company and have been here 3 years next month. I took this job as an EA hoping for it to be a stepping stone into a better role. My role has changed after several rounds of layoffs, and I now manage our nonprofit programs, which I tried in April to leverage into an official promotion and my bosses were super receptive for. They even talked about sending me back to school and footing the bill. Long story short- we found out shortly after we might get acquired so all conversations stopped short. Since then, that acquisition fell through and we are now entering another acquisition that should firm up next week or so.

During this time, I did start applying to a handful of roles, one of which I have a second interview for next week. This role is for a nonprofit and would be a Development Manager position, something I’d love to do at my current company. I’d be switching into a whole other industry that I’m not familiar with, so the learning curve would be steep.

1fks3iq,Exempt Employee - Pay Reduction & PTO - What is Your Experience?,"I am about 2.5 months into a new job. I am an exempt employee, and I don't think my manager is following labor laws - and is certainly not following what is typical - regarding PTO for exempt employees. 

For example, during my second week of work, my dad's sister passed away, and I had to miss a day of work to attend her funeral two states away. My pay was docked for a day for that week. It is my understanding that when an exempt employee works any part of a week, their pay cannot be reduced for that week. (PTO can be reduced, but not pay.) 

Additionally, one day, I was quite busy throughout the day, and did not take lunch around a ""typical"" lunch time. Because of that, I left about 20 minutes early (I was hungry!), and I got called out, and told that from now on, my work hours are from 7:00am to 4:00pm, with no room for flexibility. Again, maybe I am misunderstanding, but I thought that exempt employees were paid for the work they do, rather than the exact number of hours they work. I understand that there will often be expectations, but this rigidity does not seem in line with my understanding. 

And finally, I asked how to handle a couple of upcoming medical appointments that I have. I scheduled one of the appointments during lunch, in effort to minimize time away. I inquired as to whether anything needed to be done, if I ended up being away longer than the allotted lunch time, and I was told that I must take PTO, even if it is just a few minutes. I will need to leave an hour early one day for the other appointment and I was told that I could not swap that time out with my lunch hour that day, and that I must take PTO - I can't come in an hour early, or otherwise make it up. 

This all seems much more rigid than anything I have ever experienced (after 30 years in the workforce). I work for a huge organization, but each department makes their own policies when there is no policy that addresses a particular issue. This information regarding PTO use is not printed anywhere and has not been shared anywhere - just told to me when I asked.

1fkrrvn,Post-Biomedical Science Opportunities?,"



Hi everyone, this post is on behalf of a friend who's seeking some guidance.

I'm an international student studying at Taylor's University and will be starting my 3rd semester soon. I'm majoring in Biomedical Science for my bachelor's degree and trying to figure out what opportunities are available after I graduate.

Initially, I was really interested in going into the research field, but over time, I’ve realized that it might not be as financially rewarding as I had hoped. I recently spoke with my advisor, who suggested that I could minor in pharmacy. If I do, they mentioned they’d send me to the UK for a 3-month course where I’d study chemistry (I think?) and then come back to Malaysia. After I complete my bachelor's degree, I’d have the option to return to the UK to pursue a master’s in pharmacy and potentially become a pharmacist.

This route seems like it would open more doors for me, especially since Biomedical Science is such a broad field. However, a friend recommended I consider bioinformatics, which seems to be another field with promising opportunities.

Another option I’m considering is focusing more on Microbiology. I’ve been thinking a lot about the job market for Biomedical Science graduates in Malaysia, and it seems like opportunities here might be somewhat limited compared to other countries. I’m also seriously thinking about moving to Europe for my master’s after completing my bachelor’s degree, regardless of the path I choose.

Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get in touch with my advisor recently to discuss these options in more detail, so I’m hoping to get some advice here on Reddit!

For anyone who has experience in these fields, could you please let me know what job opportunities are available in Biomedical Science, Pharmacy, Bioinformatics, or Microbiology? Especially in Malaysia or Europe? Any advice on which path might have the best job prospects would be really helpful!

My project on the program is meant to be almost completely unclassified so I was assured I could work from home as much as I wanted as long as my classified work was done. Fast forward to now and a security spill from a different team on my project has led to the determination that all of it needs to be managed on the classified system. 


To be honest, I was fully remote before I took this with the understanding it would be heavily hybrid so I would have issue with it regardless.

She has chemo for 4-6 hours twice a week and the cancer has caused fractures in her spine meaning she can’t bend over or lift more than 5 pounds.

My productivity has remained top notch and I have been recognized for it several times. Obviously I can’t do classified work from the hospital though so not only will that have to change, it will significantly reduce the time I can be home to give a quick hand when she needs something. 


I guess I’m just crushed and looking for new perspective. I LOVE my manager and my team and I don’t want to leave (plus new jobs always mean new difficulties so it’s not without risk). I also have loads of PTO saved in case of emergency, which would start from scratch at a new company. I’m trying not to resent the fact that someone else’s screwup has messed things up for me but it’s hard not to. I’m also struggling to come to terms with having to be in the office full time on top of everything else that’s going on. I will never have my mom going to appointments by herself but it is exhausting being the only one to help and the idea of having to schlep into the office every day on top of that is just kind of soul crushing. I’ll have to hire a dog walker because with my mom’s spine it’s not safe for her to do it. I’ll be spending hours in the car some days because chemo is about an hour each way and the office is another 30 each way. 


Thank you if you’ve made it this far into my pity party 😅 any words of wisdom would be very much appreciated ",Numerous-Tie-9677,2,1.0,1,1726769159,2024-09-19 18:05:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkrfhq/tips_on_how_to_accept_going_back_to_the_office/,9,2024
1fkr6eb,What should i do?,"I have 2.5 years of experience in past, but due to some issues ,i had some career gap after that, despite trying for so long i couldnt get anything, so to compensate that gap now i have joined as a intern in a startup 2 months back..
Initially i was enjoying the work, i was completing every task and objectives on time and still, but as i giving the results, the person whom i was reporting to now giving all the work back to back without any 1 min break. He made me to complete analysis in advance for him, and taking all the credit and giving his own work to me and still i am completing that but now he is overly pushing me, now i am mentally and physically exhausted and it is impacting me negatively, this has impacted on my health too while working non stop without any lunch break for few days...

So the thing is, now i am having anxiety all the time, i am not getting any good sleep, my heart beats fast all the time, and i am not able to do other things, i dont know what to do...
And the second thing is if i resign again, my family will think i resign everytime and i am not good for anything (something like that), so couldnt share this to anyone...

1fkq72k,Wasting my potential,"Would appreciate getting some objective thoughts, feedback and advice. 

I was laid off from my media marketing job this time last year and have been freelancing ever since out of necessity. I had been doing this for about five years, but it was without a doubt a career I fell into. I have zero in marketing, but did a philosophy degree and scraped by with terrible grades. Almost flunked out multiple times due to undiagnosed ADHD. 

With my shocking transcript, I couldn’t get a look in at most grad roles. 

I’ve always been at my best thinking about problems and trying to find the solution, which makes me think I would potentially suit an ops role or possibly policy/implementation. 

I attended many elite institutions and most of my peers and friends have gone on to thrive in their careers as attorneys, academics, consultants, bankers, policy leads, startup founders. 

I come from a working class immigrant background so don’t have a huge safety net (I do have some savings) and can’t afford to keep being underemployed indefinitely while I figure out what to do next, but the thought of going back to media or marketing fills me with dread. 

I’m now considering going back to school, doing a second-degree and using that to spring board into a more aligned career. But I also can’t afford to waste time and money if the payoff is a gamble at best. 

I’m now medicated and have built routines into my life that allow me to function really well, so I’m confident uni wouldn’t be a repeat of the first time. 

My question is if you think this is my best option.w",squ1ge,1,1.0,0,1726766124,2024-09-19 17:15:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkq72k/wasting_my_potential/,9,2024
1fkq4rw,What major should I choose? ,"So, hi, I am a first year university student. In a month I'm planning to drop out (for those who are interested why only a month later and not now, it is because of two reasons: 1) in my country you can only drop out during certain days of the month, and 2) because I'm still hoping I'll maybe start to love the major I've chosen). 

Before anybody comes at me for just quitting uni alltogether, I'm not, it's just that in my country you can only reapply to a different university if you aren't a student of another uni, and it's also not possible for me to switch majors, since you can only switch between majors similar to the one you are studying right now, none of which I hold any interest in. (If anybody is interested, I am taking architectural engineering, which is basically both the engineering and the architecture major at the same time, in one major) 

Several things have led me to making this decision, one of the most prominent one being the fact that my courses take up 30 hours/week of my time, and that's only the time I have to spend sitting in class, not counting the time between two classes or the homework and extra work. Oh, and I can't drop any of the courses, since I have to complete all of them in order to be able to start the second semester. Since I hold no real passion for this major and recently cant really imagine myself working in this field, and in my country it doesn't even pay really well, with also a bunch of added reasons why, I've decided to look for another major. 

My only problem is that I have no idea what to choose. In highschool I enjoyed everything, except chemistry and PE, and was also a straight A student in everything. My favorite subjects were math, literature, history and languages, so I'm thinking of a major related to these somehow? I LOVE math because of the challenges it brings and the satisfaction of solving them. Literature and history are kind of close to my heart because it gives us insight into a bunch of whys and hows, which I just adore. I love knowing what happened, why, and how it has affected us. Languages, well, they are kind of just a given. I also really liked when we had debates or some kind of a task where we had to solve different kind of problems. (My friends say I'm kind of a natural in that department) I am also not afraid of creativity, however the execution is not really my forte, I'm better at just throwing in ideas, brainstorming, drawing quick sketches and maybe formatting documents and powerpoints.

Any suggestions? I'd really appreciate them, I'm kind of stuck. ",Throwbyebye00,0,0.5,0,1726765965,2024-09-19 17:12:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkq4rw/what_major_should_i_choose/,9,2024
1fkq24c,Just got fired ,"I’ve been working at a warehouse for close to 8 months now, in my time there the site lead got promoted to floor manager and started acting different, being more strict, blatant nepotism and just downright rude.

I’d like to mention that her and her boss are buddy buddy l, her boss has no back bone and can’t think for himself he got promoted because of another employees ideas. That said boss came in today and fired another employee and myself (to my knowledge) I am home because I called off sick,  he called and said  “because of consumer demand, we are terminating your position and tomorrow will be your last day” the phone to me and let me add that her daughter and a family friend were hired after I was hired and they both do what I do, if the position is being terminated doesn’t it make sense to fire the one that have least employment than I?

1fkph3r,Got Laid off from work becasue my title was no longer needed.,"I’m feeling quite frustrated after being made redundant. Many talented individuals were let go, so it wasn’t about merit or a lack of work ethic.

In the lead-up to the redundancy, my boss stopped communicating with me, and I had a strong sense that this was coming. Despite that, I’ve consistently given my best over the years. For reasons I can’t quite understand, my boss didn’t seem to like me. I made efforts to foster a better relationship, but there was no reciprocal attempt, not even casual conversation.

When vacancies arose, external candidates were recruited directly, despite my interest and willingness to improve. I often asked for feedback on how I could do better, but there was never any real guidance. Over time, I noticed the team wasn’t very motivated, and it gradually dawned on me that a culture of favouritism was at play, and I simply wasn’t part of that inner circle.

Perhaps I’m partly to blame for working hard and striving for recognition, which might have been seen as a threat. But what stings the most is that I genuinely gave my all. Had I been given even one opportunity for promotion or a chance to improve my relationship with my boss, I believe I’d still have my job.

To give the benefit of the doubt, I’m willing to accept that I might have been the issue. But in truth, every suggestion I was given, I took on board and made improvements. I reached out for guidance, but there was a complete lack of leadership or support. It started to feel as though they were subtly pushing me out.

I’m angry because I feel betrayed. I’m trying to move past what happened and let go of the frustration towards people I’ll likely never see again, but I’m struggling.

I have MDD and GAD and while I was mostly high-functioning during school and early career, multiple factors (family, marriage, work) have made things extremely difficult for me to work the past year. My work ethic and abilities have greatly declined and I started procrastinating. I feel the only reason I haven’t been fired yet is because my manager was too busy to notice that work wasn’t being done. Manager is now starting to pick up on this and I feel like I might get fired soon but I don’t know if this is my anxiety talking. 

I opened up to them about my struggles (some may advise against this as this could be used against you later on) but I received some support so it helped for a bit. I am starting to DREAD work, it shoots me with anxiety signing on every morning. I find it hard to sleep the night before. I contemplate quitting every day. I also can sense the general feeling that my team doesn’t like me anymore as they had to pick up some work I lacked on. I completely understand as I wouldn’t appreciate extra work being placed on me either. My main concern with quitting is that I don’t have anything lined up. I haven’t been looking either because I fear I am going to fail there too as I haven’t improved my mental condition. I started therapy so I hope to start improving but I am sure it’ll take months to learn helpful coping mechanisms that would improve my daily functioning and work abilities. 

I have some savings and my husband is working (doesn’t make as much as me but we could get by). No children.

Again, I have GAD so decisions like this cause me to think of worst case scenarios so I feel like if I quit, I’ll lose everything and if I stay I will go crazy from living this miserable life with no time to focus on improving my mental health.

One week I was sent out of town to do work for a client who was known to be very difficult to please.

I wasn’t very upset as I had just finished school and month before and was looking to move on anyways but never less I was confused. If I had just done a great job for a client that other employees couldn’t satisfy, why wasn’t I working out ? Since then I’ve only quit jobs.

1fkno4a,School Psychology or LPC?,"I'm currently a senior in undergrad majoring in Psychology. I have come to terms with the fact that I will have to probably go to grad school in order to make a decent living. My struggle is, I don't know what to go to grad school for! I'm going back and forth between two options as of right now. 

The first thing I'm considering is School Psychology. 

- Pros= work schedule (off by 3-4 pm), summers off, working with kids, school environment. 

- Cons = starting pay (around 40-55k for my area), work-life balance is very tough, and strict deadlines.

 I know each year the pay goes up (typically by 1-1.5k), but I would really like to be earning at least 70-80k within 7-10 years, and I don't see that happening if I stay in this area. I did an internship with a school psychologist last year so I know it's something I'm interested in, but I saw firsthand how the job can be stressful and balancing work and personal life can be hard. 

On the other hand, I've been thinking about getting my LPC and potentially opening my own practice later on. 

- Pros = also could work with children, one year less schooling than school psych, more flexibility, and higher earning potential.

1fknkd9,Do you guys think you need to truly enjoy what you are doing in the area of engineering to be successful?,"Hey, I'm an 18 year old freshman in my first semester of college right now, and I just suddenly had the urge to question just *what the hell I want to do with my future.* So far my classes have been pretty okay... I have always been better than average in math and had a general curiosity for all things science, but being in a college environment, surrounded by just *so much* information and subject matter and majors and everything is overwhelming me. My dad is a petroleum engineer and my brother just recently became an electrical engineer and is now working for a really good company, earning good money, but is the route that they are taking for me? How do i know that it is when I haven't really even touched the bulk of engineering yet? Have you guys felt this feeling? Of course, the salary that comes along with graduating with an engineering degree is very appealing, but how did you guys figure *it out?* I am learning philosophy on the side, and part of me wants to flourish in a more liberal arts major, but I need to also be realistic and play to my goals and aspirations. I want to have a large impact on people. I want to earn more money than my parents did. It is so much harder to reach a certain status if you decide to take these more creative, art majors. Is it a good idea to minor in one of these? Art? English? Philosophy? I feel as if I am going on a side tangent, but this is how I feel **right now.** Did you guys eventually *fall in love* with engineering and the classes you take for your major and all that comes with being an engineer?",World_Easy,2,1.0,3,1726759552,2024-09-19 15:25:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fknkd9/do_you_guys_think_you_need_to_truly_enjoy_what/,9,2024
1fknjty,I’m a contingent worker working as a data analyst. I want to express to my manager about being long term. ,"I’ve been at my current job for three months on a one-year contract. The pay is low, but I love the company and my manager. I’ve been getting a lot of praise for my work and how quickly I pick things up. I’m trying to take on more responsibilities, and my manager is helping me with that because I’m so efficient with my tasks that I end up with a lot of spare time, which makes me feel unsatisfied and anxious, especially since I’m fully remote. I’ve expressed my interest in working onsite, as I live near one of the offices and don’t like feeling isolated.

Before this role, I worked as an analyst in the robotics field for three years. I took this position, despite the lower pay, because I had been out of work for over a year. My previous role focused on ML in robotics, and now I’m an analyst in the GenAI and LLM space.

I’m approaching my 90-day mark next week and want to discuss potential long-term opportunities with my manager during our 1:1, whether that’s a contract conversion or exploring similar internal roles. I’m not sure how to bring this up. Any advice on how to approach it?",rutherne,1,1.0,0,1726759514,2024-09-19 15:25:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fknjty/im_a_contingent_worker_working_as_a_data_analyst/,9,2024
1fkn58c,Need some direction,"I’ve been working at a job for almost two years now and I feel stuck. I graduated university in 2021 and have been working for over three years. The job I landed is a research coordinator job and by the looks of it there seems to be no ladder to climb at this job. I was hired as a temp contract with very minimal hopes of getting a permanent contract. The job is very redundant and I’m not learning anything new at the job. Moreover, I feel like the job has become very tedious and consumes my life. I’m lost because I don’t really have a direction. On one hand I was told to get a higher education and on the other I was told the job market is horrible and right now it’s a blessing to be in the position I am today. 

I’m not looking to spend the rest of my days working at this job with no way of advancing my career due to the fact that I’ve seen plenty of my colleagues do this job with no promotions and they don’t even have permanent contracts. It just seems like more and more work is dumped on us with no compensation. 

I was thinking of resigning once my contract ends and pursuing a further education with the hopes that the degree might land me a better opportunity with the experience that I have working for 3 years. Almost all my work experience is in research, yet my bachelors degree is in kinesiology. I don’t really have ambitions of furthering my career in kinesiology and have been thinking of doing a masters in public health as I am very interested in public health policy and hoping that I may be able to influence the health policies someday in the future. 


I’m unsure what to do and I feel extremely lost, no sense of direction or purpose. 90% of the time I come home from work burnt out and don’t feel like doing anything.

Should I go for my masters or should I spend my time looking for alternative jobs where I may be better compensated or feel like I can learn more and further my career.

1fkm6u4,"Need to Leave Fundraising, What Else Can I do? Contracts/Grants?","I have worked in fundraising/development since I graduated college, so nearly 20 years. I have done primarily back end work: writing reports, gift acknowledgments, accounting, prospect research, proposal writing, etc. This was in higher ed and healthcare.  I am Jack of all Trades, Master of None, unfortunately. I stepped away for a bit in my late 30s to take care of a family member and did temporary/contract work. Some of it was in development but a lot of it was administrative work.  It didn't pay very well but gave me space to take care of my family member. I am in an HCOL state.

I recently was hired for a full time career position and the ED is awful.  There is a lot of light sexual harassment (comments that generally demean women). There isn't an HR. He seems annoyed by most of what I do, is unapproachable, cynical/negative, and isn't communicating with me.  I am supposed to be launching a major gifts program and we had help from a major consultancy firm coming up with a plan. He says he likes the plan but the moment I try to execute the plan, he dismisses it, talks over me, and makes me look stupid in front of the board. The job has been basically admin work so far and that's not what I signed up, either.  He is one of many toxic bosses I've had (mostly men) and I don't like the work enough to put up with it anymore. 

I haven't resigned because it is easier to get a job when you have a job. I also know how terrible the job market is and don't have enough savings (and am on an expensive lease that has eight months left) to account for even six months of being unemployed. 

I need to do something else. I am a detail person, an introvert, probably on the spectrum to some degree, and I like policies, procedures, etc. The older I've become, the more uncomfortable I've grown to be with ambiguity, especially when it comes to interpersonal relationships with people like donors. I've been a people pleaser in the past and I've reached the age where I can't do it anymore.  I've always gotten along well with my colleagues though! 

I'd love to be able to WFH (wouldn't we all!) I think contracts and grants might be a great place for me. However, I don't know if I have the appropriate background. 

My experience with grants is only with private foundations; I haven't worked with state/federal and I know they are completely different. I don't have any formal training as an accountant, but I have done general accounting, monitored funds, audited funds, and have experience with compliance issues.  I also haven't written any research grants; it's all been program.  I'm not opposed to being a full time grant writer but I don't want a foundation relations position because I don't want to manage relationships. 

Is contracts/grants a good idea? What else could I do? Note that more education isn't an option, neither are certifications. I struggle with algebra; it's highly unlikely I could learn any programming languages.",Empty-Trifle-7027,1,1.0,0,1726756017,2024-09-19 14:26:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkm6u4/need_to_leave_fundraising_what_else_can_i_do/,9,2024

1fklv3z,I feel I am complacent now and it’s hurting my career,"I joined a consulting firm via an acquisition a few years ago. This new firm has struggling financially for quite some time and was even bought out by a private equity firm. There are a lot of changes, a lot of people coming and going, and it’s giving me whiplash. While my team is great, our bonuses are affected by the firm’s performance and so there’s not as much incentive to keep pushing ourselves since the rest of the firm is struggling. To top it off, the promotion criteria keeps changing, and I haven’t gotten a promotion since joining (most of the rest on my team has). I am making the pay I want, but the job itself is incredibly boring to me now. (I do admit this is probably why I have not been promoted). I used to be more excited. I am missing my spark. 
The pros are: I am fully remote, the benefits are decent, and I have job flexibility. 
The cons are that I am unmotivated, haven’t gotten a promotion in a while. It’s making me question everything from what kind of job I want in the future to whether or not I am even wanting to stay in this field. 

So the question is: 1) Do I look for other jobs now while I have the time? When do you know “it’s time” to leave a job? 2) Or do I try to go for a promotion in January? (I frankly don’t have high hopes of getting promoted..)

Thanks for reading this far. Side note - I purposely left a few details out as to not be identified (age, location).

1fklugx,"I refused a job that pays 50k more to continue wfh, should I argue for more pay with my company? ","I love my job (engineering), have been there almost 3 years,, and get paid pretty decently (110k). It's remote, and I do ~2 hours of work a day, which gives me plenty of time to live my life and get hobbies/chores done. I also like the culture of the company a lot. This is one of the few jobs in my specific sector of engineering that is fully remote, so it could be tough to get another one like it.

The major issue with the job is at the 1 year mark, I got an annual raise of 5%, and the second year I got a promotion (had to remind my boss several times to put in the paperwork), but it was only a 4% raise for the promotion, and I didn't get a yearly raise cause of it. I basically told my boss ""hey what the hell"", and he said he'd talk to HR about it and I bugged him a few times about it but I never heard anything back. Didn't want to majorly rock the boat, me and my boss are friendly and all but not friends because I don't see him ever due to being remote. My 3rd year with the company is coming up next month, and that is when I discuss asking my boss for a raise. 

 I get contacted by recruiters on linkedin all the time, and one of them put me through to a company I worked at before that wanted me back at 160k. They said they liked my resume and my work and would pay to make it shown. The major downside there is that it'd be in office 5 days a week, and after mulling it over it just isn't worth losing so much of my life over the money. I also just got contacted by another company offering me 150k (also in office so I turned them down). 

The question here is, would it negatively affect me to bring up that I've been getting these offers for a way higher salary? Or would it help me on the negotiating table next month? 

Thanks in advance.

1fklg4e,APost termination options ,"50 year old married man. I was fired two weeks ago from a pretty big company. They said I retaliated against a white male employee who I didn't promote. I prompted a woman who just did better in the interview. We can probably just barely pay all of our bills on wife's income. I'm a paranoid person so we have about a year's worth of bills in savings anyway. Not sure what to do next

* I found a senior employee relations team that agreed to review my termination. I have the support of my former boss and employees. They said they can reinstate but feels like a long shot.

* A friend set me up with a recruiter. a company wants me to work for them as a consultant. I'd get around a year's salary at my old job for about 4 months of work. But it's a 4 month commitment to, essentially, a temp job

* I have an interview for a state job doing remote work. Something I did early in my career. Not much of a career growth move but I think I'd love the chill and relatively stress free work.

* I was referred to a law firm to pursue civil action against former employer. There is little evidence of the violation I supposedly committed but there are records of me trying to protect the company by raising a labor law that was being violated. The firm is hot to go but if I sue and the company rehires me, the law firm will want me to pay for legal fees. so even if I have to change firms, I'm going to wait to see what former employer's employee relations team says.

I really don't want to go back to my old company after this but I feel obligated to accept an offer IF that happens. The consultant work is exciting but not sure I'm cut out for work that's not as stable as I need for my mental health. LOL I said, I'm a bit paranoid.

1fkl7fe,Am I grossly underpaid or should I appreciate the stability of having a job?,"I’ve been working as an Analyst at a large insurance company for the past two years, focusing on pension plan contracts. My salary is around $67,000, with annual raises typically in the 2-3% range. I was initially attracted to the position because of the hiring manager and the job’s stability. 

Many people in my department have been here for 20-40 years, often starting their careers straight out of school. At first, I thought this was a testament to employee satisfaction, but I’ve since realized that many seem to have settled into a routine of mundane tasks, updating the same spreadsheets year after year, and are content with minimal raises and bonuses, lacking any aspirations for advancement.

My hiring manager retired early, which changed my original training plan. Instead of a thorough transition, I’ve had to navigate my responsibilities on my own. I’ve encountered two new managers since then, and with each change, I feel less understood and supported in my role. I’m not sure if the latest manager truly grasps what I do.

Currently, I can't justify a higher salary based on my responsibilities. My daily tasks include updating spreadsheets, responding to a few emails, handling ad hoc requests, and preparing month-end and quarter-end reports. Altogether, this probably amounts to about a week’s worth of work each month. Is this typical in the corporate world, and should I just enjoy this easy situation while it lasts? I sometimes feel like I’m a stay-at-home dad who occasionally has to go to the office and pretend to work.  I’m primarily working remotely, but new requirements will transition me to a more hybrid model over the next few months.

For some background, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Statistics from a public university. Over the past decade, I worked as a loan officer for several small residential lenders and regional banks, where I earned a salary between $25,000 and $50,000, plus commission. I was easily making over $100,000 annually. I never intended to stay in the mortgage industry, but after entering it in the early 2010s when jobs were scarce, I found the financial rewards hard to resist. However, I was ready for a change and left that field in 2022.

I believe I can and should be doing more. My current salary barely covers my expenses, leaving me to live paycheck to paycheck, and aside from my 401k contributions, I haven’t been able to save much. While I’ve managed to save quite a bit at my previous jobs, I’m in my late 30s and often feel like I’m falling behind, as if it’s too late to catch up. Now, I’m considering whether it’s time to make a move or if I should just enjoy this easy situation until a more appealing opportunity comes along.",SnafuLobster,3,0.6399999856948853,16,1726753469,2024-09-19 13:44:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkl7fe/am_i_grossly_underpaid_or_should_i_appreciate_the/,9,2024

1fkkfrv,"There are always more losers than winners in everything, so therefore listening to popular opinion is always more likely to result in loss.","This thought crossed my mind this morning because I was thinking about something unrelated to career advice and getting jobs, but then I realized it applies to most things.

When you go out for a job, there’s always competition. Even if the company says there isn’t, there is. The company may even be trying to be honest about the competition or lack thereof, because that’s how it is when you interview and then one of the internal employees applies to the job afterward. I think about truth sometimes like it’s an absolute, but it’s really just based on timing. I’ve truthfully said before that a hot sauce is my favorite one and then tried one that I like more, and that doesn’t mean that my earlier statement was a lie. It was just true at that time based on the information I had at that time.

So if there’s always competition, then there’s always at least one winner and at least one loser, and oftentimes there’s  far more than just one loser. Sometimes there are dozens. I wouldn’t consider everyone that applies and doesn’t get an interview a loser, but in this context I’d consider anyone who interviews and doesn’t get the job a loser. And I’m only using these terms in the literal sense, and in no way do I mean that someone is a loser like a piece of shit. I mean like they literally lost the opportunity.

So if the vast majority of people won’t get the job, then that means popular opinion about the job market and interview process will be based on the perspectives of people who aren’t getting the jobs they’re interviewing for. That’s how you end up with people being unemployed for extremely long periods of time, saying “but so many people told me that this is what I should be doing.” It’s literally the fact that so many people are telling you to do it that decreases the likelihood of it being true or good advice.

I always remember those platitudes about what’s popular not always being right and vice versa, but today was the first time that I realized that it’s actually more than that, and that in most things in life what’s popular doesn’t only basically mean nothing but actually most likely means that thing is wrong.",StrategyXCareer,0,0.4000000059604645,3,1726751332,2024-09-19 13:08:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkkfrv/there_are_always_more_losers_than_winners_in/,9,2024
1fkk4c3,Civil Engineering Student,"Hey everyone,

I’m a penultimate-year civil engineering student with a focus on geotechnical engineering. I’ve done a mining internship with Anglo American in Central Queensland, and I’m currently considering options for my final summer before graduation.

I have an offer for a geotechnical role at Glencore Zinc in Mount Isa, which would deepen my mining experience. However, I’m also drawn to infrastructure projects, as most of my university studies have been in this area, and I’m concerned about narrowing my future opportunities if I stick with mining.

Long-term, I see myself in mining for the first 10-12 years, then transitioning to infrastructure. But I’m torn between gaining more mining experience now or diversifying into infrastructure.

What would you recommend for my last summer? Stick with mining, or explore infrastructure to broaden my skill set? Appreciate any insights!",ai_classix,1,1.0,0,1726750447,2024-09-19 12:54:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkk4c3/civil_engineering_student/,9,2024

1fkjemv,I feel trapped?,"So currently live in a high cost of living city. I make a good wage, consistent work, stable, full benefits, and pension, union (hard to get fired) and 4 weeks vacation a year.. The draw back is the job is niche and I'm stuck doing shiftwork and permanent week new and don't know what to do. I don't hate the job but it's definitely not healthy. I work as an industrial plant operator (but it's more like unskilled labour) but I'm overpaid for my position. 

I'm stuck because the economy here where I live in Vancouver BC is terrible right now for work and I have a good life with my job, it's just the shift work is getting exhausting and I haven't been able to feel good in a long time. I am always tired and exhausted, getting out of bed is hard these days. I either sleep too much or not enough. I was off for two weeks and I was just at home depressed and did nothing. I still can't seem to feel better.

Anyways, I don't even know if it's entirely a job situation but it has I imagine some impacts. So I'm considering quitting and moving on but not without finding other work. I'm a single 33m with some limitations and all I can find is labour work as that's what I have done for Nearly 20 years.

I have hobbies I love outside of work but it's hard to make anything out of them.

I'm curious what are some steps I can take to feel better and move towards a healthier career path. School seems like a challenge for me and I feel my cognitive function has slowed down drastically in the past couple years. I've been doing 3 on 4 off shifts, two weeks graveyards and then switching to two weeks dayshifts 6-6 for 4 years and it's caught up to me.

I soon realised that they have added a lot of my friends from my previous job. I wasn't really sure how to feel about that because these are people I am still quite close to, it felt like some kind of boundary had been crossed, that they'd done this intentionally, felt unsure of their motivations, and and removed them from my profile. They've since tried to add me again. 

What do you think? Is this unprofessional thing to do from either perspective, am I being unreasonable in my response or feelings? 

Would you freely start adding all your employee or managers contacts on LinkedIn, the key here is that they are people you do not know and work for a completely different company.

Now he even attended a few product related meetings and informed the team that for the Product owner role they should involve him and I am there for long term but without saying I will be replacing the previous colleague.

Hi I am a 24 year old Lawyer.

I graduated from a Bachelors degree in law, a masters degree to become an advocate and most recently from an LLM in business law.

Basically I have startted a full time job as a lawyer a couple months ago and oh my god I cant do the 9-5 at a desk and a laptop for the rest of my life. I have worked in law for the past 5 years but always 20-30 hours a week so not full time.

I also was heading my national student union which caters for over 13000 students, managed six figure projects, negotiated contracts with vendors, project managed and dealt with agnecies and govt departments as well as private companies. I got to do financial planning, budgeting and I realised how much I enjoy this job where I get to deal with hands on problems and it truly made me realise how much I enjoy management. I recently got an offer to work as a facility manager at an international business with numerous locations in my state (They met me during my time as the president of the student union and they liked me and my method of work) which involves at least 3 large buildings of different functions. I would love to end up becoming a COO(no hurry but I would love to get there one day). Is this realistic?

1fkexly,"I am a Nepo Baby, I need advice.","I won’t lie—my mom is one of the top executives at this company, and she originally provided me with employment when I was struggling to find work. I’m a 22-year-old male, and I was hired as her office aide, along with a couple of managers, to handle tasks that no one else had the time to dedicate to. I had my own space and no hourly expectations as long as I got my work done in an agreeable timeframe. I did this for about three months before another executive, her friend, offered me a position working on the “ground.”

I can’t know the specifics for why I was chosen for this role other than being in the right place at the right time when they needed someone quickly. It’s a similar assistant-esque role that requires more industry-specific knowledge to help my direct superior complete their work with little to no hiccups. I started this role a couple of weeks ago, and due to the timing (previous person put in their 1 week notice) now I’m sharing responsibilities with a more experienced colleague as we struggle to find time to properly discuss how we delegate their tasks between us along with working for second superior with similar demands

My personality is typically very positive—nothing can seriously ruin my day. My humor is pretty dry and subtle, which in retrospect does not produce the best or most obvious jokes and I’ve tried to fit in with my colleagues as quickly as I've transistioned into this role. Everyone knows my mom is the boss, and they often joke around me. For example, when someone brought ice cream to the office, a colleague said, “Oh, did you ask your mom for permission?” I sometimes play into these jokes as much as I try to separate that relationship at work. When a colleague mentioned working extra hours off the clock, Opposed and knowing she shouldn't said, “If there’s work to be done, then do it, just make sure you’re clocked in for it,” quoting my mom and saying something like shes the boss so what she says goes, further playing into those jokes I realise. In retrospect, that might have come off as snarky.

Recently, I voiced concerns about how inefficient our processes were and that we shouldn’t be spending our nights trying to catch up. Initially, my colleague was resistant, saying she does it all the time. But then our team—me, said colleague, and our 1st superior—spent more time discussing the shared dissatisfaction we all felt. Our superior pointed out that I’m in a unique position because my mom can directly enact change and I know several people who also can from my previous work in that area. So, I set up a meeting with all of us, including a manager and two executives, to voice our complaints and work productively to improve things.

After the meeting, while working with my colleague, she asked how I knew about a certain change. I corrected her concerns and said something different was happening. When she asked how I knew ( car had been in the shop and my mom drove me) I then made another comment, “My mom drove me this morning.” which is another bad comment I now realize. A manager and I shared a laugh, but my colleague muttered under their breath, “It’s fine, I’m used to rude comments.”

Later, I was called into the office of the executive who offered me this position. They said people have commented that I was acting entitled or offputting, as if nothing I do will get me in trouble. I found this ridiculous because I’m working more than expected and trying to voice necessary changes in a job that many dislike. I didn't ask who made the comment, rather what they had said so I can change my behaviors accordingly but they continued with saying stuff like "" I know you... didn't offer this role because... blah blah blah... you know this Is serious"" which I am well aware and I never intended to come off that way. I’m just lost on how this blew back on me considering the efforts I have put in championing their concerns as the only voice of change in our area. 

I’ve never been in a position like this and I’m unsure if I should dial back my efforts to make this a better job or how I converse with my colleagues. I previously said, “I’m not going to quit, so I’m going to make this a better place to work,” trying to show how far I would go to support this team but now I’m unsure. It feels like some days they want to take advantage of my connections, but on other days, they despise me for them. I consider myself a good employee, and I’m juggling four classes outside of work. Every day, I go to work, hit the gym if I have time, do homework, and crash to wake up early again to work before going into work. Despite many comments about how this would be a difficult job to transition into and If I ever needed help from above I would have it, I did this on my own and learned quickly. My direct superior even told me that there had been several other people who have tried to fill this role who just couldn't catch onto it. Again I am blindsided by what is happening, my worst fear is that this continues and somehow blows back on my mom which I do not want.

Is there something I’m missing? I need someone outside the situation to tell me what I’m doing wrong here.",bashasjam,1,1.0,0,1726729646,2024-09-19 07:07:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkexly/i_am_a_nepo_baby_i_need_advice/,9,2024

1fkdvpp,Red flags starting to show up at new job(ex: consistent late pay and poor training),"So, I just recently started a new job at a healthcare clinic it’s a job that I’ve always wanted which is being a receptionist and it’s great I love the work I do. 

But, I’ve been there a couple of months and I’m starting to notice why the turnaround rate is so high. So, training wise it was essentially nonexistent which is fine with me I prefer learning as I go anyway but I’m realizing that in this particular position at least at where I work it’s definitely not ideal at all. There are a lot of things that are a case by case basis which I can understand but I wasn’t even really given the basics for how to do a lot of my work and I’m starting to get in trouble for it.

Insurance is confusing as fuck and while we have lots of papers about what insurance we can take and what we can’t, there is no consistency on a solid “yes or no” so then I have to ask the financial department  and they are getting frustrated because me and the several other new people constantly are asking so we have a meeting basically every week talking about the insurance but still I have no idea about any of it. This last meeting I was called out specifically about constantly asking management questions but the only other person(we’ll call them person A) to ask hasn’t been there very long at all so they generally don’t know the answer.

But, now we have to ask Person A who basically just started like us and then if they don’t know they personally will relay the information to management but yet we are being told that we shouldn’t be afraid to ask management questions but now we don’t even get the chance to ask questions because Person A is constantly interrupting us when we are talking to patients when they think we aren’t sure what we’re doing which is starting to get on my nerves because what’s the difference between them asking when they don’t know and me asking after already having asked Person A? 

Also, the pay is consistently late; I don’t know how smaller clinics normally work but we write our own timesheet that is all based on trust and we turn it in on Friday but payroll doesn’t get done till Monday and then I don’t normally get paid till the following Friday. Which would be fine if they haven’t consistently made me late in paying my rent but there is just no consistency and I really can’t work somewhere that isn’t paying me on time and I don’t know if it’s a money issue because they just happened to buy a bus for another one of their clinics in another state.

The CEO of the clinic who is also a provider is constantly taking random weeks off so we then have to completely move people in the schedule and our schedules are normally fully booked months out so us people in reception are getting yelled at by patients because they are being moved for an appointment that they had set months ago and we have been losing patients for it(which isn’t my problem but then we in reception get in trouble for it). 

It’s just all very frustrating because this is a job I’ve been wanting to do for a long time but seeing how the clinic is being run and how the staff is treated like we are all expendable at any moment it’s making me want to look for a new job ASAP but I’d also like to think that if I brought up the issues to management that there would be change but I’ve recently started hearing horror stories of people being fired for no reason(which is legal cause we’re an at will state) and I don’t want to be fired but I also just started and was planning to stay for a while but with no organization to be found anywhere in the clinic I’m thinking it’s best just to cut my losses and look for another job.

1fkdm4v,Question about PTO and owing company,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. I began working for this company in March. They gave me 11 days of PTO for the year, but it wasn’t all earned. I used all 11 days for appointments concerning health issues. Basically, you have to work until the end of the year to “earn” that PTO, but you can use it whenever. (New hires starting in January wouldve started with 13 days). Well here we are today, I’m still employed, but I’ve had some conflict with some leadership positions that’s made me uncomfortable to work there anymore. I’m hoping to be gone sometime this upcoming week, just waiting on a new job. I won’t go into that here but basically my question is this:

If I leave before the end of the year, how much will I owe this company? 

I’m sure there’s more info needed to come to that answer but I’m trying to figure out how to that. Any help would be appreciated.

We have the same job duties, but I do more and have more responsibility, since I am senior, while they are junior.

There are updated terms in the California Equal Pay Act that doesn't base the entirety of it on only sex/gender. It also includes fair wages between races and ethnicity. I could file a claim with the Labor Commissioner’s Office, but I don't necessarily want to bring that up right away.

1fkb4ph,Seeking Career Change Guidance: Program/Project Manager Interested in Meaningful People Experiences,"38F, generic non-technical program/project manager at a big tech company in the Bay Area, still like my company and the people I work with, get paid relatively well, but have been feeling very lost and aimless in what I do, and have no clear vision of where I can/should go next if I get laid off next. Hoping for some guidance and concrete tips/directions on finding/regaining some personal purpose in potential next career paths.  
  
I started out in customer support/customer experience and loved the sense of personal fulfillment, and was very motivated to couple my program management skills to drive up customer/people/vendor satisfaction, things I naturally care a lot about (see below). However, my role has evolved so much over time that I now work on very dry internal tools/process efficiency projects. Coupled with changes in the tech landscape and lack of job security these days, I've been in constant fear of losing my job, and struggling to maintain performance while severely depressed for the past two years.  
  
With the little energy and mental capacity I have left, I try to force myself to get exposure to different professional/industry topics (e.g. forcing myself to digest some shallow AI related topics to stay somewhat current, looking into gaining a bit of quantitative skills like learning very basic SQL), but still have no idea where to go next for a meaningful career in this scary job market. The topics/fields I naturally lean toward (softer/customer or people-oriented areas) seem to be especially challenging in terms of making a sustainable living compared to more traditional money-making areas like SaaS/AI/etc. And I don't see myself going back to school at this age for something like nursing (I don't care for biology and get queasy with blood anyway), or try to transition into a high-stress-low-pay therapist job, when I also have life responsibilities like aging parents to take care of.  
  
Things I enjoy and find meaningful:  
- Impacting people in warming, enlightening, personal ways (something as basic as working as a server taking care of customers and bringing people joyful experiences makes me really happy)  
- Advocating for the ""underdogs"" (being an advocate for and treating vendors well while on the client side)  
- Whatever that makes me feel like my work brings meaningful impact on a human level (e.g. I feel very removed when work on internal processes/policies that make embedded layers of a company run smoother/supposedly more efficiently or compliantly, rather than seeing any clear meaning to people/end users)  
  
Things I don't have a knack for:  
- Presentations (high anxiety around public speaking with speech impediment)  
- Sales (I don't have the natural charisma nor the ambition for these type of quota-driven roles)  
  
Preferences:  
- Something career path that helps combine what I find personally meaningful with my professional general program manager/organization skills  
- Staying in the Bay Area, being remote, or going to another big vibrant city like NYC (if I can afford it). I live alone and have already been feeling very socially isolated and dealing with severe depression, moving to any smaller towns would probably spiritually kill me.  
- Something that still pays reasonably well if staying in a tier 1 city (I still need to support myself and elderly family members)  
  
Thanks for reading this far. I struggled a lot to finally put some mind-rambling down in words here (it's been a challenge to even get out of bed everyday due to the crippling depression, have been trying to work with multiple mental health/general health professionals).",ShowMeLight814,1,1.0,0,1726715083,2024-09-19 03:04:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fkb4ph/seeking_career_change_guidance_programproject/,9,2024

1fkassq,Turning 30 and desperate to get out of the service industry ,"Basically the title but I’m earnestly in need of career advice.

I moved out of a small town where I was pretty well established this year, and I’m the poorest I’ve ever been. I make only enough money to pay my bills. And I am so sick of dead end jobs with no room for growth. I have an associates degree in general studies, and no other education. I’m currently waitressing andtaking night classes for a graphic design certificate.

I was never taught how to be financially stable or wise with my money. I have avoided going back to school bc I fear having more debt and still no job growth and honestly I’m undecided and terrified of going into a field I hate. I love my creative interest but I feel like I lack the know how to be an entrepreneur with those skills. In a perfect world my job is something I’m passionate about and affords me the ability to travel and allows me to. But at this rate I’d be happy if it was a job I didn’t hate that had a work life balance and I didn’t have to fear that I’d miss a bill. 

I struggle with how to even step out into a different career field bc my entire experience is service jobs. I know I’m talented in marketing, event planning, drawing, painting, and also connect with psychology and really really am passionate about community.

What do I do? Where do I start? Moving home isn’t an option. I feel so stuck and embarrassed. All of my friends are well established in their jobs or married with children and I feel like I’m getting left behind.

1fkam5h,"Am I being picky, or unreasonable with my job expectations?","I graduated 2 years ago now with a microbiology degree. Did my first year at a biotech startup where I made garbage pay and waa not treated amazingly. Though I did enjoy the work and people I quit.

I am lucky enough to have gotten a goverment job 2 months later. It's easy, low stress, comfortable. I get 2 days a week from home, some outdoor time, some driving time, some lab time, mostly office though. Lots of space for career growth. Great supervisor, people are friendly but much older, it's not the same socially as school or my last job was. Pay is very good compared to average here but still too low to buy a home or anything crazy.

I can't help but feel I'm rotting my brain and wasting like life though. I don't enjoy it, it just feels bland, reminds me of how I felt in class in highschool when bored. The people higher up don't seem to enjoy it but again it's easy, somewhat stimulating, and comfortable. Benefits are as good as they get. 

If I manage to find seomthing comparable in pay is it worth leaving? Will I just find everything is the same and this is a good as it gets? Has everyone just accepted that mildly interesting, easy, and comfortable is the best option? 

Really don't want to accept that I will be wasting 8h a day for the rest of the foreseeable future... no amount of afterwork activities can make up for that.

1fk9p7h,What advice do you have for dealing with an impossible client?,"I (28f) just began a new position as a relationship manager at an organization about 3 months ago and was assigned their most difficult client. 

Issues with this client stem far before my start at the company but it is my job to turn things around with them. However, they have a manager within their company that is borderline abusive to our staff. Additionally, they lack communication and effective problem resolution skills. I seriously question whether one of their managers is drunk at work because of the sheer number of misspells, quick switches from all caps to all lowercase, and jumbled writing. Whenever we try to address concerns with them, so we can increase their satisfaction with our service they always turn the finger at us and spend 95% of the time complaining instead of outlining what they would like to see in the future. 

I don’t have issues with them raising concerns because if we need to take accountability and resolve an issue, I want to make things right. However, they continually move the goal post, deflect, and don’t take accountability when they make mistakes, instead telling us it’s our fault. They even involved their lawyers at one point to sent us a cease and desist, stating we weren’t authorized to provide service, even though we had email communication and proper documentation that we were informed by said client to provide service. When we provided this evidence to them, they acted like nothing had happened and never apologized for their mistake.  

They are one of our largest clients and our organization has gone through a lot of changes because past leadership failed the organization and left us in a state of dire debt and a lack of profitability (I didn’t learn of this until after I started). We are close to being in the green again, so we definitely cannot lose this client.

What is your advice on how I can best address things with them? I have a very supportive manager who understands how difficult this client is. However, it is getting more difficult for me to support my team and justify them having to deal with condescending communication at best and borderline verbally abusive communication most of the time. I mean, there’s a distinct difference in the professionalism of my communication to them vs. the way they speak to us. 

I tend to be a problem solver and don’t tend to let my feelings impact my professionalism. However, I’m finding myself drained after dealing with this client and feeling like I’m on a constant hamster wheel trying to attend to their needs. There have we been many instances where they email me 3-4 times about something that I already provided them information on or resolved for them. I’m literally re-doing work for them constantly, even after they’ve sent emails confirming that they’ve received the necessary information or something has been resolved. There’s also junior staff who are being impacted by this and I’m starting to feel a personal sense of justice with needing to address the way they treat our team. I would just like to address things with them directly but respectfully. However, in my company hierarchy, my supervisor and the Director of Account Management outrank me. I’m starting to get to the point though of thinking it’s better to ask for forgiveness than permission and try my own approach. 

I have no issues acknowledging when we’ve made mistakes and with working to resolve them. I just don’t understand why they treat our staff so poorly and why when trying to resolve issues, they can’t just clearly communicate what their expectations are, so I can effectively track our progress on meeting those expectations. It’s starting to trigger me and remind me of the abusive marriage I escaped over a year ago; the constant twisting of words, pointing the finger at everyone but themselves when they’ve made mistakes, gaslighting, speaking condescendingly, yelling at us (through all caps emails), etc. 

Am I missing something? Do you have any advice on how I can best approach this so we can have a mutually beneficial relationship with them? I can understand if they lost some trust in us due to past leadership and I want to ensure we’re meeting their needs and rebuilding our relationship with them. I just don’t know how to approach this and don’t have this same experience with any other of my clients. We’ve also had several coordinators quit the company after having to continually deal with this client, which is why my position was created and one of the reasons I was hired in the first place. 

I wish I knew all this before starting this job, but alas, this is the position I find myself in so I’m trying to figure out how I can best navigate all of this. 

Thanks so much for your feedback and advice!!

1fk9f0t,Being harassed by ExCompany,"I don’t know what to do guys. I’m generally so depressed and think I’m being harassed by my ex company. I’m here to rent and maybe listen to any advice you may have. 

Back story: I was working two, work from home jobs in the same industry at the same time for about 6 months. I am going through a divorce, needed the money and the distraction. I was actually putting in time for both, working nights and even weekends to get things done. Even though the companies were in the same industry, they were not competitive of each other and their end market users were different t. I was not in any management positions, not buying or selling, nor did I have access to confidential information like formulas or pricing. I was simply technical support. 
I was working both jobs at the same time for about 6 months and things were going actually well. I never once had a bad performance review and was actually receiving high praises from Job B.

Well there was an industry conference and I attended with Job B and ran into someone from Job A there. They were not in my department or my supervisor but obviously were like, I just emailed you two weeks ago, how are you working here now? I generally felt bad, felt depressed and the next day I put in my resignation from Job A because Job B paid higher and I enjoyed the culture there more.

 From there, all hell broke loose. 
Job A withheld my last 3 weeks of pay, called Job Bs HR department to notify them I was working two jobs at once. Job B fired me. It sucks and now I have zero jobs, but I do generally feel bad and that’s life and the consequences of my actions. I thought that was it. 

but now a week later HR is texting me telling me “not to bother filing for unemployment since I was double dipping.” I wasn’t planning to file for unemployment since I quit, so I didn’t respond but I thought the text was weird and unprofessional. Then again, Job A sends me more text messages. This time from my boss, Calling me dishonest, saying he saw hotel receipts in my email for Job B, wondering if I was sick when I took sick days, claiming I lied about my kids when I had literal doctors notes and had to have emergency gallbladder removal surgery. The text messages are hurtful to my character, they also just seem so unprofessional and unnecessary. I told my ex boss, I’m sorry he viewed me in that light but I was never doing it with ill intent. I asked him if we could just move on from this. I blocked him and all other colleagues on linkedIN but I’m scared to block his phone number because I just feel like this isn’t the end of this. I generally feel like they are trying to blacklist me in the industry and maybe sue me for something. I don’t know. I don’t know how to professionally move on from this when I’m being texted daily about how shitty of a person I was. 

I am so depressed. This year has been a shit show from my husband cheating on me, to divorce, to now losing both jobs and my source of income, and health insurance. I just wish the text messages would stop so I can heal and move forward. I never ever wanted to deceive either company although I know that’s what happened and I was just trying to be a good employee to both. 

thanks for reading.

1fk8uqx,Feeling uncomfortable? guilty? As I search for a new job while still being employed - how to leave when it's finally time?,"Hello. Confusing title, I know. Not sure how else to word it, though.

To provide context, I (24F) started working at my current job (with Company A) in Feb 2024, soon after I finished up my last term in school. It was always meant to be a temporary thing while I figure out if I wanted to go on to do my Master's.

I admit, I didn't do that much research into Company A, because at the time, I was just desperate for work. I maintain I was very lucky to get a job 3 months out of school, when I know so many people are struggling and have been doing so for quite a while. Truly, I feel for you. Those three months had me losing hair and losing sleep. Job-searching sucks. 

Things were okay at the beginning at my new job, my coworkers are great, and I genuinely love them. The issue, however, is senior management, and one senior manager in particular (isn't it always?) From the beginning, I was put off by her, because I made it clear what my expected starting salary was, and she offered me someyhing far before that but told me, come annual reviews, we would ""revisit it"" - I know it's going to stay the same based on what my coworkers' experiences have been in the same situation. As I said, I accepted because I needed anything that would pay the bills. 

Throughout my time, she went on to show her true colours. She is truly unhinged. She drives everyone crazy with her ridiculous demands. Constantly, she will come up to us demanding we prioritize a task/project that we are LITERALLY working on in front of her eyes. It's gotten to the point where her senior supervisor has flat out told us to ignore her or told her off for micromanaging us because we can't get shit done with her around. There's a lot of other stuff too, like her lack of attention to detail/organization, her attitude, etc.

All that's to say that I lost my patience long ago, and due to some other significant changes in my life recently, have decided to put further education on hold, and am now looking to find a job where I'll have a higher pay and more stability, something more worthwhile and permanent. 

Recently, I went through 2 rounds of interviews for a job with Company B and have been invited for a final working interview. This opportunity is exactly what I'd been searching for these last few months. It's higher pay, hybrid, etc. It's exactly what I need and I'm excited. If I get an offer, I won't be able to refuse.

The problem is. Well. 

I feel guilty. I truly feel like a snake, just sitting around, chatting with the people I've become close with, knowing inside that I'll (hopefully?) be leaving soon. 

They're good people, people that will offer me rides home even if it's out of the way for them on days I don't have my car, people who will ask me multiple times if I'm okay when I'm sick and offer to take on my tasks that are too much for me even when they've got their own things to do, people that genuinely feel like friends/family. 

There's another, arguably bigger issue. 

We're incredibly short-staffed - again, manager's fault. She had 4 fucking months where we were fully staffed with 8 team members (which is the ideal number), to find someone so that when it came time for the contracted employees to leave, we'd already have onboarded other people. She left it to the last minute, and refused to hire so many perfectly decent candidates because they weren't EXACTLY what she wanted. 

And guess what? This shit isn't even new. It happens EVERY YEAR!

Finally, she hired someone who will start next month, but they will need a lot of training, and I am one of only two fully-trained individuals on my team of five, soon to be six with the new hire - the other fully-trained perosn is our team lead. If I leave, everything will fall on my team lead's shoulders, but the situation will be worse than it is now, because the new person won't know anything. 

I can't tell anyone that I plan to leave, because I'll be putting them in a tough position as they (eg. my team lead) would be obligated to tell management - which I completely understand, given it's their job. Financially, I can't risk them finding out because I can't risk being let go. 

Logically, I know I should keep my mouth shut and my head down until I have something solid. But I can't help but feel terrible because I feel like I'm betraying my team's trust. I'll be leaving them to deal with everything on their own while management tries to hire another replacement. 

I just feel confused, lost, and I don't know what to do. Or well, I do, but I don't know if not telling them is the RIGHT thing, even if it is the smart thing. 

And okay, maybe this is a better question. I won't say anything now, but if I get an offer from Company B, how do I go about announcing that I'll be leaving? How should I go about explaining the situation - should I explain anything? How do I express that I don't want to be putting them in a tough spot, or that it really isn't anything personal?

I feel like I've given too much detail lol, but I feel like it's all necessary. If any of you have been in a similar position, I'd love to know how you went about navigating it.

Any advice would be much appreciated. 

Thank you!

1fk8pe7,Is it worth taking a pay cut??,"Hi so I spoke to a recruiter for a position I applied for, (front desk). It seemed attractive to me since she said there is a lot of downtime during the shift and I would have the chance to learn any other role I’m interested in, like HR, management, event coordination and so on. The last 2 people in this position got promoted (they like to promote within the company) I don’t have a degree and have been wanting to move into a new career so that’s the part I like about learning a new position during this role and seeing what I like. 

I have been in dental for a few years and I’m not happy in it. I have a cert in project management but it’s been a bit hard getting a entry level role. I currently make 26 an hour, this position can only offer 41K yearly which would be a pretty decent pay cut for me. Any advice? I’m torn between it.

1fk73bn,IT Consultant Completely Burnt Out,"Hi CA,

I've been working at a company implementing a specific software vendor's IT systems since I graduated college in 2016, so roughly 8 YOE. I'm now in a low-level leadership role making about $190k/year. My company, like most similar consulting firms, is big on utilization targets and ensuring that one's billable hours meet the target. 

Due to the soft market and poor leadership, I've consistently been unable to meet that target, even though I work a full 40-45 hours / week on a mix of billable and non-billable work. I've not been PIPed or told that I'm underperforming, but it's always in the back of my mind.

At this point, the late nights, early mornings, and constant stress have taken their toll and I don't know how much longer I can continue at this company.

However, I don't know what to do now. I could:

1. Find a position at another consulting firm - I'm afraid that this would just be trading one bad situation for another.
2. Find a role as a system admin at a non-consulting company - This is more appealing for WLB even though any position will likely be a massive pay cut.
3. Going back to school or switching to a non-IT career - Possible, but what could I even do that would be worthwhile in 2024?

1fk6vvd,Left to deal with the ghosts of work colleagues past,"The title says it all, really.
There are 4 situations going on concurrently:
1) Employee 1 (calling him K) left the company 6 months ago
2) My manager (calling him M) has been suspended for the last 3 months
3) I am replacing M temporarily (for no extra pay, it's all about the exposure and experience)
4) There are 2 new employees in my team (B and D)

Hi, my name is L (because of just how many I am taking in this life).
I am 33, divorced, childless, and currently sitting in bed eating a pint of ice-cream and crying over my job.
Why, you may ask?
Because I'm an idiot.

It all started a few years ago when K was employed. K was a nightmare from the start in my opinion. Lazy, inattentive, fake, and taking leave every few weeks like clockwork claiming a variety of illnesses that he would suddenly recover from on a Tuesday and then be reinfected with on Thursday night.
All this meant is that while K was being onboarded (which took 1.5 years - no I am not kidding), I was doing all the work.
Why?
Because my manager is actually a garbage bin with human flesh, and like I said, I'm an idiot.

But I digress.
Eventually K's 'onboarding' ended, and M started getting angry that K was not actually doing the work (despite knowing HOW to do the work), and so K decided to leave the company, and surprise surprise - their work has not been done for over 6 months. M had a great solution; to pass off most of the work to me and to claim that he was doing the rest of it (surprise, he was not)

Now we get to M. M has been suspended for being difficult to work with. M does not believe he is difficult to work with. 
M has been getting by for the last few years by making me do the grunt work and taking credit for it.
It's my fault, I'm an idiot and thought that we were friends, and friends help each other out.
But turns out, I was a friend indeed and he was Satan taking advantage.

So M has been gone for the last 3 months, and because I'm the last one standing, they asked me to step up and I, being the idiot that I am, said yes.

So I have been doing K's, M's, and my own work, for the last 3 months.
What does that mean? It means working weekends, nights, and even on holiday.

""But at least you have help now, right?""
Wrong.
B and D require extensive training, which I try and do after selling my soul to buy an extra hour each week.
What kind of training, you ask? Well, since they both have significant experience, it's them coming and asking me to show them how to print to pdf (an hour long activity that they wasted 2 days on before asking).

Now on to my actual complaint. Yes, the above was not actually what pushed me to my breaking point.

4 months ago I was approached by another company and asked if I'd like to interview for a position there. I immediately praised the Lord and decided to interview. I made it to the FIFTH round of interviews, they asked me about my salary expectations, and I was ready to go.
I found out today that M has also interviewed, and will likely be offered the position at that company instead.

So why am I angry, you may ask?
Because I do my damnedest.
And I am left with the MESS that M made by being a really, really, REALLY, terrible manager - like a dumpster fire kind of manager.
And he will take a new position elsewhere and start over.
And I am left with this.
And I have nothing else.
Everyone else, they have lives.
I have the vague certainty that I'm going to die of a heart attack in the next 3 years.
I'm hurt. I'm angry. I'm an idiot. And the only solution seems to be to succumb to the inevitable notion that I will die without anything in my life because I gave it all to work.

I have to go now, it's 3am where I am, and I have deadlines due today that were actually K's responsibility, then M's, and now they haunt me.

I'm burnt out. I'm angry. I'm sad. M manipulated me so much over the years and I'm left to pick up the pieces.
Am I wrong to feel like he's getting off scot free and I'm getting the raw end of the deal?",Puzzler15,2,1.0,0,1726702379,2024-09-18 23:32:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fk6vvd/left_to_deal_with_the_ghosts_of_work_colleagues/,9,2024
1fk6s2q,Senior in undergad: which career choice is optimal/which would you choose?,"What would you do?

T2 (OW,LEK,ATK) or choose a small boutique of 15 people? The boutique pays more base salary wise but the T2 beats it by about 5% with bonus if that is fully paid.  The boutique is in a suburb of my home city while the T2 is in a large city I have no ties to, which is an interesting proposition and has pros and cons. The T2 is known to work 60-68 hrs weeks on average sometimes more. The boutique I haven’t gotten averages but know it’s def not less than 50 and I’d be  shocked if it were less than 55 (maybe 53-58 type).  
 

The T2 is 3 days in office (but will probably go in more in the beginning) and the boutique is 5 days a 30-40m commute from my parents house where I’d prob live for a year.   
 

the boutique is not going to grow and most analysts stay for 3 years, but it’s very competitive and I was told they make 1 offer for about every 200-250 resumes they get. Of the people that have left to get MBAs, apparently everyone has landed at a T10. Also apparently leadership (who is old) is well connected and happy to help with exits after you reach your 2+ yr.   
 

the boutique class size is only 2/3, the T2 would be about 20. Also maybe (?) the boutique would give me more responsibility and I’d learn more? Idk

For context: 
- I am advanced in my career (8+ years, 4 of those at a senior level role)
- the company I have been with for the last 3 years is a large-scale market-leader (very well known company)
- Every time I have gotten even a single interview, I have landed the job

- tailoring individual resumes and cover letters
- mass applications with the same resume
- group tailoring 4-5 resumes based on area
- messaging recruiters directly
- messaging employees of the target company directly
- sending requests to be put in contact with the HM
- reaching out through my network for connections 
- single page resume
- two page resume
- using ATS resume/rec matching software
- literally copying and pasting rec skills into my resume
- applying for positions one step above me
- applying for lateral move positions
- applying for positions one step below me
- applying to large companies
- applying to small companies
- applying through LinkedIn 
- applying directly through company career pages
- applying to newly posted jobs 
- applying to jobs that have been open a while
- applying on Monday/Wednesday/Friday

- Automatically answers recruiter questions.
- Applies to hundreds of jobs while you focus on other things.

The job market is dominated by automation, and this bot helps you get past those automated filters. After using it, I finally started getting responses and eventually landed a job. The project has **12,000 stars on GitHub** and over **3,000 people on Telegram** talking about it.

1fk40ex,32f - Would HR rescind a resignation if they were going to end up firing you anyway?,"Hi everyone
I resigned from my position after being blindsided by accusations that are now being investigated. I understand the investigation process needs to happen as per HR policy. 
I spoke with HR and asked once the process is complete if I could come back and I was rash in resigning. 
TODAY they sent me an email saying effectively immediately I was an employee again however won’t get shifts until investigation is done. 

If the investigation was REALLY serious - they wouldn’t have rescinded right? Doesn’t that take more work? Looking for a light at the end of the tunnel tbh 🙈

1fk3zkq,Losing My Job After Maternity Leave ,"I’m 4 weeks into my 8 week, unpaid maternity leave. Illinois based. It is a small company, less than 15 people. 

I called my employer earlier this week to see what my schedule would be for returning. Basically I was told they are having financial issues. They didn’t outright say it, but it sounds like they can’t afford to keep me on the payroll.

I asked if reduced hours could be a thing, but they were very careful in how they spoke. They mentioned the hours would have to meet when customers were in the store (I.e. they wouldn’t be able to work around my childcare schedule). They want me to call back by the end of the week. I believe they want me to quit. But if I quit, I couldn’t get unemployment. 

Thoughts? Ideas? I’m totally lost. I tried calling unemployment but haven’t been able to get through or get a call back. ",shesaidzed,3,0.7200000286102295,5,1726694405,2024-09-18 21:20:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fk3zkq/losing_my_job_after_maternity_leave/,9,2024

Before I was a manager that managed about 30 people, I wasn’t perfect but I think I was decent enough at my job and helped the business in the day to day until financially it went under. In my new role I am strictly sales. Most of my day is spent visiting potential accounts, a lot of time in my car, a lot of time alone and man it is HARD and lonely. I’ve been in this role for about 4 months and I feel like the first couple months I was super motivated, hit the ground running, but I’m not going to lie the rejection has gotten to me and I honestly don’t know where to go from here. So many people tell me I just need to get through this and keep pushing but to tell you the truth I think I may not just be meant for sales. I am outgoing and love being around people but lately I’ve been feeling very anxious and not really sure what to do. I would hate to quit now and go back to my previous line of work where earning potential is relatively capped if maybe this is just a normal thing new salespeople go through. I guess it doesn’t help that my personal life is extremely stressful right now as well, I feel like I have no break.

I have a finance degree and will complete my MBA with an emphasis in sports management in Spring 2025. Currently, I'm playing basketball at the university where I’m earning my MBA, and my work experience has been in athletic facilities and game management.

I’ve been considering a career in insurance, specifically underwriting, as well as financial analyst roles, but I’m unsure which path to pursue. I’m looking for a job with strong upward mobility, a healthy work-life balance, and a salary that supports my long-term financial goals. While a career in sports would be great, it's not a necessity.

I’m based in San Diego, if that’s helpful! Any insights on starting my career, what to expect day-to-day in these fields, or advice on which option offers the best long-term growth would be greatly appreciated.

1fk35ml,Tips for dealing with a difficult boss until I get fired,"I was put on a PIP and am waiting out being fired. For now I have been rapidly applying to new jobs and had three interviews so far. I should have known it was a bad environment when I started and several people told me to watch out for my boss. Or said good luck with them. In all honesty I thought they were being sarcastic. But, I think now maybe they weren't. 

I hate my environment, I hate my boss. I get a bunch of anxiety thinking about going to work everyday. It's like butterflies, and it makes me feel sick all the time.

 My boss said I lied about how good I am at Excel, and everyone else sees it, but if I don't know how to do something I look it up. If I am not immediately good at something she rolls her eyes. I didn't lie about any of the things I knew with Excel. I can do formulas and V-Lookups. I don't know everything about excel though. 

I am so tired of her saying everything I am doing is bad, she never has said good job on anything I have done. It has been awful for my self confidence. I have only been at this job for 4 months, so I think it's natural that I would make mistakes every now and then. 

  
She is also a huge gossip and shit talker so I can't help but feel like she is just shit talking me to everyone. My first day she shit talked a bunch of other employees and her boss.  I can't trust any of my coworkers. I feel so alone and am not in a good place. I need the job though. I am right out of college, but in my previous jobs I have always been told how good I am at them, I have gotten promotions, and have even gotten service awards for my work. I am not used to being so hated at work and every time my boss talks to me she brings up a new thing that she doesn't like about me, or that I am doing.

1fk19e2,Update: Sitting down with CEO after I got refused a promotion.,"First of all, thanks to everyone who replied, I read every comment but didn't have time to respond to all of them.

To first answer on some comments:
- I got more understanding from an organisational perspective that if the other person was made redundant, it is a logical step to promote her and train her in house, so everyone could keep their jobs.
- The job was never mine and of course I was a bit biased and frustrated about me feeling that way.
- We are a small organisation of 25-30 people
- The new manager his job got merged, so staff will take over some parts of the old role.

Back to the update:

I sat down with my CEO and listened without saying anything about how disappointed I was. She actuality gave some options for me. I got the option to choose between some new opportunities in the organisation, which are the same pay and no potential for growth. 

Or I can rework my own job description to choose and build my own projects for them to develop into its own branche and build it to a leadership position. She would help me with a plan to keep me on track and I will get a management training for the future. The promise of a promotion isn't in sight for the next 6-8 months and even after it isn't something sure. My contract is safe and I have a meeting next week to discuss it.

I have it good where I am 98% work from home some travel for meetings. This new role would be work from home, more sales based but prob 40% travel with reimbursed  miles, bonus would be 8-16% twice a year (if goals met). It’s risky due to more sales I could fail.
Where I am now I feel no forward movement but only been here 2 years so would be losing like $10k (employer contribution) from retirement not being fully vested.
The only reason I applied for new job is my current employer there were some recent lay offs due to reorg but luckily I was saved. Again, as it stand as long as I’m safe I have it so good wfh, I know the job, everyone likes me but just don’t see much growth and when is the next layoff rounds happening. 
I am on round 3 of interviews for new role but so hesitant as I’m in a good comfort zone now, should I continue to hear what they have to say and wait on offer. What would be a good salary range to make me leave? before bonus? Would it make sense to leave for only $10k increase since potential for bonus is 2x a year?

I have been a massage therapist, lead therapist, therapist trainer, and clinic manager at a Massage Envy.
I have been a client relationship manager at a Hair Club.
I have owned my own paint and sip art studio. 
I have been a dog groomer. 
I have been a barista.
And I am currently an Accounts Receivable Specialist at a very large construction office. 

My best skills are customer/client and/or inter office relations and anything to do with process improvement recognition and implementation. I have a great knack for staying cool under pressure, figuring out how things work on my own, and catching details that other people miss. 

I enjoy teaching others how to do things and digging through problems for solutions. I also enjoy figuring out how to create solutions for better workflow in team environments.

How do I let it go when another department isn't helping the student. For example, I had a student be dropped from her instructor due to non attendance. I informed her that her instructor would have to be the one to put her back in the class if he is okay with that. 

She told me, ""My instructor says it's you."" I told her she can visit the Academic Department of that course for further assistance if she feels like her instructor is not helping her. I checked her account for the past two days and she hasn't been added back. For some reason I think that I will get in trouble.

Another example, I had a student inquire about manually withdrawing, he did not have his ID and I told him he can submit a ticket online or come back in person with his ID. He opted to submit it online. 

The online center rejected his request and asked him to resubmit it a certain format. I was unaware they were so strict about the format.

1fjyj7k,Why do people say that psychology is a useless degree?,"
I don't believe any degree is useless many wise and kind people have told me that a degree is what you make of it and I have recently become very stressed and overwhelmed with the negative comments and althought I understand that it can be a warning for people calling a degree useless is not fair out of all the degrees in the world is psychology the most useless?

I like and currently am doing very well in psychology and want to take it in uni most likely and although I don't plan on becoming a therapist or anything that specialised I might in many years time go for a master's maybe so I did my own little but of research for other contemplating psychology students and people who are considering it.



Here are jobs that I found that claim are possible to get with a psychology bachlors degree or other useful degrees please do tell me if the ones I write need more than a bachlors and to find the lowest and highest salaries I used talent.com and there is a median on there.

These are only some of the jobs I found that seem to accept a bachlors in psychology and that alone shows to be that the degree isn't all that useless I believe that the knowledge you gain from any degree can help you get a job I haven't looked at job that require JUST a degree yet but will also look into those many people seem to work on a degree and not work in that specific sector so I don't seem to mind.

-also I am only an Alevel student and so to some the annual wages may seem very low and although I can understand that I also think that for a single person after graduating or finishing a degree these would be good start up jobs or in general good jobs in the UK my mother for example gets a pretty low wage and despite that she raised me and my younger sibling just fine with that low wage so yes there are jobs that can use psychology and some jobs may not pay the highest but it definitely shows that's the degree isn't useless.

((I'm sure there are some other jobs however I spent too much time researching already and please do correct me if something is wrong and I am aware some of these jobs do need further training too))

Both options are working at the same location/company, but I can work as their direct employee or as a consultant for them for higher pay but less benefits.

State government employee: $65-70k. Benefits: 14 paid holidays, union, 4 weeks PTO, 3 weeks sick leave, 1 week personal leave, free tolls for commute, very good health insurance, tuition reimbursement.

Consultant: $82k. Benefits: 12 days PTO, 10 paid holidays, average health insurance.

We have been doing the long distance dating thing for about a year and a half and I decided to start over and join her in FL. So I was basically unemployed for about 3 weeks as I was getting things here in FL sorted out such as my driver's license, getting my car registered, and other things. Even partook in a weekend getaway to North Carolina with my girlfriend and her family that first weekend after I arrived. My girlfriend said I was basically on a mini-vacation or sabbatical while I got things sorted out. Well, this week I finally started work and I feel kind of bummed. Is it normal to feel bummed having to return to work after being on a sabbatical or mini-vacation for a few weeks? I think another thing is I am still adjusting to residing in a brand new environment so it's a combination of that and feeling anxious about being the new guy at work.

1fjxnai,2nd job in 2-3 years. Would switching jobs again be career suicide?,"Hi everyone. I graduated college in December, 2021 with a mechanical engineering degree and in May got my first job out of college. It was a contract position but after about 6 months, got converted to full-time. 3 months later, I got laid off after company got acquired. Went 9 months being unemployed then got my second job in January, 2024 which is the job I have now.

I absolutely hate this job. It’s toxic, my co-workers suck and most importantly I realized that mechanical engineering and manufacturing is absolutely not what I want to be doing with my life. Ideally I’d get a job in another field but if I can get another mechanical engineering job, I’d probably still take it.

Because I held my first job for only 9 months and then went 9 months with no job, then been at this job for 9 months, would that look super bad for future employers? My first exit wasn’t my fault and I know I can explain that but my main thing is getting interviews. I feel like my resume will be overlooked if they saw that.

1fjxk58,Career Switch,"Am considering switching from tech to accounting. 

For context, I graduated from a state school in 2023 with a Bachelors in MIS, average GPA (3.1). and have had 3 jobs since. It’s been absolute hell, I was told that “tech was the future” like everyone else and took the bait even though I don’t like to code/suck at it. 

I don’t have enough experience to get a less technical job I’d be interested in since every entry level position is really just 3-5 years experience at entry level pay. 

Also I read that in 2023 there were 600,000 CS/IS majors, a 40% increase over the last 5 years, with only 350,000 tech jobs expected year by year from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Compare that to Accounting where there’s only 47,000 Acc majors, but 130,000 expected jobs. Accounting was the rare class I ended up getting As in college, and there are a ton of online masters programs I can become CPA eligible for in 1-2 years. 

I also understand there’s AI and outsourcing concerns in both fields, and that accounting is a boring long hours job, but I don’t really mind at this point in my life I need stable income and a roof over my head.

1fjxjpq,Get hired ,"Call all folks feeling stuck while looking

Hi guys I’m founder of an online platform called CareerHQ I’m going to give away a few free one month subscriptions and invite you to join the platform. So what’s the problem here? Well your resume should always be tailored to the job to help maximize keywords, context and anti spamming of keywords. As a former hiring manager who has managed a team of over 350, I’ve seen far too many times resumes are not tailored to the job so it’s difficult for me to relate the candidate to what I’m looking for...

So we developed careerhq.io to help with rapid generation of resume, highly customized and we’ve benchmarked our sample data set to ChatGPT and other closed sourced models. We use a combination of several technologies including traditional machine learning algorithms and generate AI with a robust scoring framework.

DM me if you are interested with your email and I can send you a custom promo code to try out the pro models (include standard and advanced models). It will be the first month for free, renews for regular price, cancel anytime. Giving away 25 licenses to start.

In exchange I’d ask for your honest feedback on the platform and what you think needs to improve.

I’d also use the sport science part of the degree to coach or train people athletically. I need to do more research on these degrees to see if they’re the right choices but I really like exercise and eating healthy, and think it could be something to capitalize on. Ikigai and what-not.

Unfortunately, today is my last day working at \[redacted\]. While it was a pleasure to assist you in your CAD and Permitting needs, I have found the work environment here not satisfying my needs. The late-night texts, after hour calls, missing paydays, the unfound claims that I am “not getting the ball rolling” on our open projects are some of the contributing factors to my decision.

Also, the comment “I need more from your position to justify the pay” is a comment that has caused more anxiety than missing a deadline, quitting a job, being berated. I believe there are better ways to set expectations for your employees than to devalue them as an asset of the company.

Additionally, there are multiple occasions where I have not received full payment during paychecks, and multiple occasions of my mileage not being reimbursed. Both of which are incredibly unprofessional. Now, I do not mean to aim these comments towards anyone other than Jason. Everyone else I have interacted with has been nothing but a delight.

1fjvcbi,Getting salary to match workload ,"Long story short (probably won’t be) I was asked a few years ago to move from a skilled trade position (HVAC tech)to a planner/scheduler role with some admin duties but in the same department. A big change occurred within the company and multiple coworkers ended up leaving our department and my manager ended up becoming a director. They interviewed one individual (I was asked to sit in on the hiring process) but they were not willing to pay him what he wanted as a manger. Since that time, no one has been hired internally to fill all these positions but the amount of work has nearly tripled due to this change and we are just expected to keep on making it work. 

 I continue to get loaded up with new responsibilities without a decent increase in my salary and I feel as though I am most certainly doing manager type work but not offered the same salary as the last manager they attempted to hire (around 35k more than what I make). Listed below is what I do: 

- Plan and schedule maintenance and inspections for 8 different vendors
- Log and keep a record of all inspection reports for annual audit (which I am expected to attend) 
-Audit invoices from vendors as well as all purchases made by my department and ensure coded to correct budget line. 
-Follow up with accounting when invoices from vendors not paid for status of payment (they still write checks and mail payments out 😑)
-Keep records of all invoices and track on an excel sheet all invoices to track against the department budget. 
-Track CapEx invoices and ensure they line up with agreed upon contract. 
-Fill out visitor forms everyday for all visitors coming on site for our department (whether for work, meetings or job estimates)
-I am in charge of our CMMS platform: adding users, helping users with WO issues, submissions etc. Assigning new work order requests to appropriate users. Updating assets and information.Tracking coworker labor hours on work orders and ensuring they put the correct amount of time in each week. Then reporting this weekly labor hour to directors.
-Manage the BAS system and schedule spaces being used each day that are not normally scheduled are occupied and at the desired temp. Make on the fly temp adjustments when someone contacts me (includes after hours requests). Review alarms daily and make sure looked at. 
-If short-handed or vendors busy where they unable to immediately respond to an issue, asked to look into myself. 
-We host events so I am in also in charge of submitting onsite vendor credentials and getting them to the vendors. 
-Was just added a few months ago to another “community email account” that I am responsible for managing issues reported by the security team or employees on site. 
-Was just asked to be a member of the new Health and Safety Committee (email sent out asking to volunteer if you wanted to be a part of this committee). I’m so busy I didn’t feel I could juggle this also, but was put on it anyway. This committee is comprised of directors and managers of other departments, no one in a lower role like myself. 
-Having to jump in and host meetings with vendors when my two direct report directors aren’t available. 
-Point of contact for everything when my director is out on PTO. 
-Also was a part of the budget planning for our department my first year doing this role and sat in with my director, the president, accounting etc to explain money requests for each budget code and explain why we were over or under the allotted amount. 
-Every week I have to spend one on one time with my director going back through his emails to make sure no invoices missed.

Call me crazy but does this not sound like a managers role? The only thing keeping me here honestly is the large amount of PTO we get (but it’s across the board for everyone here). Someone that’s been here for only a year, now has the same amount of PTO as myself who has almost been here 10yrs.

1fju409,In dire need of career path suggestions!,"literally what the title says. I want you to make suggestions about what I should study based on a little info I'll give you about myself in a second. the reasons for that are that I just cannot for the love of god decide on what job I should do and I need some outside perspective, don't want to keep thinking in circles. I'll take everything with a grain of salt so don't worry about ruining my life by making ""unfitting"" suggestions. 

some info about myself:
- I love languages (have taken courses in English, Spanish, French and Latin, my mother-tongue is German)
- I love nature, camping and adventure but almost never do it bc it's too exhausting
- I'm shit at physics, chemistry, maths, IT etc. 
- I love art (drawing/ painting) but am not very skilled at it
- I'm super interested in psychology/ education but only on a theoretical level, I am autistic so social jobs are simply too tiring for me
- I'm good at making plans, but not good at following through with them. Would love to be a professional manager/ project manager of some sort. I've had a remote job as a project manager bc my boss saw my potential once I started working for him (the job initially was to simply transcribe texts) and *somewhat* made me second head of the (very small) company
- I'm not good at self directing my time, but I also hate when people tell me what to do; I still prefer the latter though (unless it becomes micromanaging)
- I like to work from home but I need there to be consequences if I don't show up
- I cannot very well stand still/ stand in on place for long periods of time. Moving and sitting are both okay 
- I've been studying educational science and English to become a teacher at the local university, am dropping out of that though bc the teacher job would be too demanding of me (I didn't understand why until I got the autism diagnosis)
- I want a job that cannot easily be replaced by AI
- I have a passion for explaining things
- A high paying job would obviously be ideal (lol), I don't think I'm capable of working 40 hours per week so I want something I can live off of while working fewer hours

1fjtk9k,Is it waste of time and money?,"Hey everyone,

I’m a student at the University of Derby, about to start my Bachelor of Arts in Accounting and Finance. I previously completed a diploma in Business and Finance Management, which allows me to top up to my degree in about 1.5 years. I’ve already paid my tuition, and classes are set to begin in just five days.

I was really happy and optimistic about my studies, but after talking to some friends, I’m feeling terrified. They argued that a Bachelor of Arts in Accounting and Finance is less valuable than a Bachelor of Science, claiming it might even be “worthless” for my career. Some have suggested that I’m wasting my money and time and encouraged me to switch to the BSc in Business and Management, which is the only other option available at my university.

I’ve been trying to change my course for the past week, but I haven’t heard back from the university, and I’m worried I might be too late to make this change.

So, I’m reaching out for your advice:

1. **Is a BA in Accounting and Finance really considered less valuable in the job market?**
2. **Will it impact my job prospects in accounting or finance?**
3. **Has anyone completed a BA in Accounting and successfully found a job in the field?**
4. **Should I stick with the BA, or should I try harder to switch to the BSc?**

I’d really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share. Thank you so much for your help!",Standard_Feature2135,1,1.0,0,1726668106,2024-09-18 14:01:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fjtk9k/is_it_waste_of_time_and_money/,9,2024

1fjrsti,"Need Urgent Career Advice! Im way too much confused, HELP!","I'm a 21-year-old male, currently unemployed. I left my job as a video editor because of the toxic work culture. (I have 6 months of experience, started working from Nov 2023 and left at may 2024) I am a BMM graduate from a tier-4 college (graduated in 2023). I scored 6/5/8 from Maharashtra board non eng. I was never much interested in studies; I’ve always been more of an art guy, good at sketches, and curious about how games are made. This led me to learn 3D modeling and other software, eventually sparking my interest in video editing. However, I realized video editors don’t get paid enough. I used to earn around ₹35,000 a month, but the salary wasn’t satisfying, and the work culture and pressure were unbearable. I used to work 16-17 hours a day.

Because AI is advancing rapidly, I’m scared to go back to 3D work. Over the past few months, I started preparing for the CAT exam because I feel like I’ve lost hope in everything I’ve spent time learning. However, as the exam dates approach, I’m even more scared to take the exam because I haven’t prepared well, especially since I hate math.

I'm lost and scared right now, I don’t know what to do, and I’m too stressed out to think clearly. I need career advice and clarification. I don’t want to pursue government exams because I find them unchallenging and not worth it. I really want to improve myself, but I don’t have anyone to guide me.

If I get the right guidance, I would love to return to 3D work and proceed on the right path. I’m also an excellent video editor, and if you'd like to see my projects and works in video editing and 3D art, I’m happy to share them anytime! If someone in a situation like mine has overcome their challenges and built a better career, I would love to hear about it and receive help.

1fjpkz7,Advice on how to take leave,"Hello everyone, I’m having a really difficult time.

For reference, I am in the US and specifically in Texas. Two weeks ago my best friend and someone I served with in the military, committed suicide. Him and I have been friends for years and I’m also very close with his wife. I’m having to handle all the legal aspects of it as his wife is honestly inconsolable. I am also suffering from this but unfortunately but I digress.

I spoke with my manager about this and how I would need to take time off. I was told my PTO is mine to take but here’s where the problem starts: I only get 14 days of leave. When I started I was told it was 18 but due to starting on Jan 31st, I only get 14 days. This was news to me as I had been taking my leave during the year. I only have two days of leave left at this point. I asked about unpaid leave and my manager got EXTREMELY dodgy. They just pointed me towards the HR site and it was very vague so I called HR. Come to find out, I cannot take unpaid leave, I can only take a leave of absence that has to last at least 7 calendar days. Here’s where it’s really awful: I lose all worker protections when I take that LOA. If they want to lay me off or fire me they can and I lose all rights to anything and anyway to fight back, according to their documentation. Yes, this is documented but I do not feel comfortable at this time sharing a company HR site screen shot. 

So I’m going to obviously need time off for my friends funeral at the least. Do I just take the LOA and risk it with no idea what could happen or try to work and keep messing up cause I’m so distracted?

I am an introvert (23,M) who's more right brained and inclined towards artistic and emotional persuits. I am a passionate content writer, my goal is to enter the industry of Content Strategy,scriptwriting and copywriting. I completed graduation (Geo Hons) in the last year and then enrolled in a 6 months certification program in Digital Marketing from a well reputed institution. I had Arts in my 11th and 12th. After completion of certification program, I went onto an SEO internship, which went terribly wrong (2 months, toxic environment and work culture, very limited learning experience). After that, I came back home and looking for an remote internship opportunity ever since. 

But I belong in a middle class family and currently the family situation is such, I can't dedicate 1-2 years solely for following my passion or what I desire. My weakness is, I'm not that great or passionate in coding. I have no interest in perusing masters or degree courses in institutions that offers 2-3 nonsensical placement opportunities. I have been checking out Machine Learning or AI online courses (IIT, IIIT) and in dilemma 'cause of required coding experience and whether I should persue it in offline. I seek recommendations on what would the best career options for me (best offline courses/ certifications) now that would not necessarily align with my passions for now but land me a safer, better future. I will keep persuing my interests as side hustle but I can't just steadily focus on thinking what I should persue right now. I don't mind an industry or career switch.

1fjnnzn,At will employment hack,"Work for large tech company as a mid level manager. We have performance reviews every 4 months where I have to decide which one of my direct reports needs PIP/layoff.

Smartly, the people under me band together behind the scenes and make an HR complaint using the person most likely to get PIP/laid off right before this review happens. Happened last 3 performance cycles and super annoying. I have to sit through hours and hours of meetings with HR every week during the performance cycles and explain my reviews line by line. I put someone for layoff and while they don't tell me who the complainant is, HR keeps claiming I'm retaliating by putting this person on layoff or PIP. This drags out for months and they don't revoke access to the person I fired so they still stay in the system and have full access to everything. When I got laid off from my previous company I spent 7 years with, they simply revoked my log in access with no warning and no explanation or goodbyes. 

Mentally just exhausting and there's nothing I can do. I filed a case last cycle but HR completely ignored it and when I asked about it, he said it's considered retaliation. This seems like an excellent hack, as these people are receiving a detailed explanation of why they are getting laid off/PIP, as well as a couple extra months of pay during the case and then severance/or a payout.

It’s a great opportunity and could lead to plenty of progression in future. I’m a senior graphic designer and I’m the only designer in the company (it’s a big big big company!). The idea is that I’ll develop and create an in-house design team.

I started confidently and felt really positive that I could make a difference. However, because the business is lacking in many areas in terms of processes and having the correct methods of working in place, my boss isn’t great with being clear and precise about what he wants to see. 

This has meant that projects that would usually be straightforward for me have taken much longer to complete and I don’t believe I’ve been able to show the quality of my work.

I know this can happen while you’re getting to know each other and how you both work, etc. But it’s making me nervous that when my six month probationary period comes up, it may not go as planned.

The other issue I’m having is that because he’s worked in the industry for years, he doesn’t seem to realise that for me to be able to truly make a difference in this department, I need time to get to know the industry.

I've been with this company for nearly 3 years now. I'm one of the top performers in sales for this retail company. But I don't want stay in retail sales, I've always seen myself as a creative person who wants to create content and make people go ""aha"" or give them joy through making incredible content so lately I thought I should move into the marketing department of this company. How should I approach this? 
I have subtly asked my manager and he did seem supportive to make this transition happen for me but at the end gave me the basic answer of, ""let me talk to my manager and get back to you"" and please guide me my fellow Redditors, how does one approach to this transition in the company you are working when you might not be fully qualified or do not bring in marketing experience? And how should I follow up or any other tips? 

Also I thought maybe I should create some content for the company and send it to my manager, indirectly asking for a transition with a proof that I am passionate about this new role. Is this a good idea? 

I'm keen to your thoughts.

1fjm9ug,How do I quit a job when my boss is the reason? ,"I have been working at this vet clinic as a veterinary professional (I don’t want to give too much away just in case) for the past 8 months. For the entirety of that time, my hours have been reduced due to burn out and I’ve been rigid about the days I work. 

Management and I had a text conversation about this recently, which was quite in depth and while I didn’t think there was much more discuss, management would like to meet with me next week on a specific day. I believe on this day I will either be fired or forced to quit due to an ultimatum I won’t be able to fulfill. 

While I do believe management is losing patience with my hours and my inflexibility about my days of work (as well as the fact that I don’t tend to accommodate last minute schedule changes if I’m unavailable, for obvious reasons), the main reason is my boss.

In the past few months especially, my boss has become incredibly controlling and she is known to be fake, duplicitous, sneaky, and talk behind everyone’s backs. She generally cannot be trusted. This has gotten to the point where most of the staff is planning their resignations. 

If I quit, I feel I will be asked to provide a reason but I obviously can’t say the above due to the fact that this is a very small field and I feel it’s unprofessional. Does anyone have ideas as to what to say? 

TLDR: I feel I am about to be fired/forced to quit a job, where I’ve been for 8 months. If I quit, my reason would be my boss’ behaviour but I can’t say that so I’m wondering what to say instead.

1fjluy3,Help deciding between 2 jobs,"I’ll keep it short, 2 hospitality industry jobs that I am moving forward interviewing for that I think I’ll get an offer for both (I know it’s not a guarantee but I’m not in a rush anyways, still just trying to compare) 

Job 1: hotel Supervisor position 
- salaried 50k (no overtime possibility )
- job where you move around and in rooms (I like being active) 
- often working 10 hour days
- no lunch offered 
- discounts not as appealing 
- sometimes night shift 4pm-1am
-PTO/401k/ insurance 

Job 2: hotel office position
- 22/hr position (overtime possibility)
- more of a desk/ office job 
- usually 8 hour days (no night shifts)
- hotel discounts that I really want
- offers free lunch cooked daily
-PTO / 401k / insurance 

My thoughts are that the salaried position is too low for days that will often be 10 hours with no overtime. But I really like moving around during the day. However, I like the discounts for the office job (a company that I’ve worked for before). And it’s nice they offer free lunch which would save me money. I also like the possibility of overtime… but I’ve never had a job in more of an office setting and scared I might get bored. So even though job 2 has more pros like the discounts and free lunch and such, liking what I do is important. (Not saying I wouldn’t like office setting, I’ve just never done it and looking for other opinions from people who have done it)

1fjky5b,Am I being disliked by my boss? ,"Hi guys, i think I am experiencing the end stage of my downfall at work. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post but I swear this work experience sucks for me right now.

Ive (F24) been working at this VERY SMALL company for a year a few months already and after hitting the 1 year mark, the boss decides to bump me up higher. I took the promotion but immediately felt like i was regretting it. I knew I would have it in me to become better but as the months go by, I started experiencing the total opposite of growth. Very slowly, things were not going well for me, I was making far too many mistakes and can tell that my boss (also the supervisor) is getting irritated by the mistakes I make. Everyday, i was doing something wrong, I have been feeling so anxious about coming to work because i know there would be somehting new I did wrong. The problem is, there is no one else to point the blame to because I am the only person and senior working under her and the rest of the team are freelancers.

\*I forgot to mention this, but we work for an events company so naturally, we need to be fast, detailed and all that.

Knowing my skills, I am absolutely not fast enough, not even detailed enough and she obviously picks on these flaws and i would just accept it and say ill do better (honestly this is just my skill issue, can't really say i was really fast or detailed at work.) Things just became worse as we start preparing for different events and eventually she lashes out on me infront of my other colleague. the only other person i felt like i could be supported by. It made me realise i haven't been a good employee but that lashing sort of helped, I was definitely more alert. I have been accepting her comments about me for 1 year so ofcourse when somehting happens once again, I am the fault.

When shes ranting to me about me, she tells me I should be like (x person) because (x person) is good at responding. for example. Just recently, I did a stupid mistake and apparently costed us close to $1k. This was really my fault but also as a team, none of us pointed out the problem. But ofc i had to take responsibility and take the blame still because it is. My Fault.

All in all, I've just been experiencing one hell of a downfall. I have no idea what is really happening to me. I am not growing as expected - is it the environment? Is it just me? I used to be so much better than this. I started out so well. After my promotion was when i experienced some pretty shit experiences. This week, my boss has just been on my ass, everything is pointing towards me. Not my other colleague though, shes just an intern, ofcourse she gets more protection. I felt so betrayed cos i felt like after every blaming i got, not even this person would help to support me. in that, I realise that I am alone and no one is going to help. I just started accepting that this is my fate. I am now ruined. I feel like I am not good enough for anything.",ghettogoldcar,1,1.0,0,1726635442,2024-09-18 04:57:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fjky5b/am_i_being_disliked_by_my_boss/,9,2024

1fjkact,Any suggestions for careers?,"Hi everyone!

I’m 22 years old, living in Australia, no responsibilities, and currently working for the public service. I don’t have a ""dream career"" or any strong passions that have pointed me toward a specific field. However, I’m open-minded, a quick learner, and I tend to absorb information easily. My main goal is to find a career that suits my lifestyle rather than a specific passion. I absolutely love to travel, so a job that allows me to do that a lot (either with ample leave or opportunities to travel for work) would be ideal.

A little about my background: Before joining the public service, I studied patisserie and worked in that field, but baking the same things every day became too repetitive for me. I also missed interacting with people while working. Currently, I enjoy my job, especially data entry, but I get bored easily if I’m not constantly learning something new. I need a role that keeps me both cognitively and physically engaged—jobs like data entry, where I can type and think at the same time, seem to work really well for me.

I’m more of an objective thinker and like having clear answers, so something like purely customer service wouldn’t be a great fit. I also tend to get distracted easily if the role doesn’t keep me engaged on multiple levels.

I’ve been exploring careers in IT, but after speaking with people in the industry, it seems over-saturated, which has made me second-guess that option. I’m open to going to university (since I haven’t been before) and willing to study if it leads to a well-paying career with flexibility—such as a 4-day workweek or remote work. I have hobbies like baking, photography, and embroidery, and I’d love a job that allows for work in different locations or even overseas. One of my long-term dreams is to move overseas. Unfortunately, my current government job is too niche to offer much international mobility.

Any suggestions for careers or industries that might fit my desires? I’m ideally looking for something that involves travel, flexibility, learning, and good pay.

1fjixzs,My job is horrible and I don’t know how to leave. ,"So let me start off by saying that I can keep a job. Prior to this year I had a job for 4 years. The issue was that previous job salary was horrible. I made about $1500 every two weeks. My rent alone was $1600. After that job I ended doing a 180 and getting a job as a teacher for a state prison. I am a woman who isn’t too ugly in the face and I worked for the men’s unit. I was sexually and verbally harassed everyday. So as you could imagine, I quit after like three months. 
The next job I worked was retail. But the hours and pay were inconsistent and I was making like $1800 a month. I decided to become and ESL teacher. The money wasn’t that good but the hours worked for me and I could pick up a lot of shifts. 
During my time as an ESL teacher I saw a posting for my dream job. Long story short, I got it… it was a dream come true so I thought. My manager/boss/ceo of this company is horrible. She yells at me and berates me. Constantly tells me that I’m doing things wrong. She blows up my phone all the time and gets mad when something isn’t my fault. In expected to live and breathe this job. I want to leave so bad but the guilt of having to leave a job AGAIN is eating me alive. 
On the bright side, I never quit the ESL job and just work that one at nights. I love working there and can pick up more shifts there if I ever left this one. 
But the guilt keeps me here. And she also is wealthy and knows a lot of people. I’m scared if I leave, she will bad mouth me to other really important people.

He also said he looked himself up on one of our information systems which is strictly prohibited and that is made clear in training and our policy manuals/rulebook.

The fact he felt so comfortable admitting to the fact he looked himself up (against the rules), I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he might have looked my information up as well and found out where I live. I ended up reporting this to my supervisor although I made clear to my supervisor that the part about looking me up is a suspicion and not something he admitted to or something I can prove or have evidence of.

I applied for everything out there, focusing on management roles. I was offered a position as a manager and promised a path to a district manager. The role itself I can do, the experience is something I need ( I need the experience managing larger teams and this would provide it), and its a well established company so no stress about layoffs. 

So here is where I have some concern/questions... He told me that I would be paid $750 a week flat for 50 hours a week. (this is the midwest, shit wages are the norm.) From my understanding in a role like this salary is not unusual nor are longer hours. But I was made aware there are new laws requiring salaried employees at least $844 a week to be exempt from FLSA as of July 1st 2024 and increases to $1,128 January 1st 2025. I am at a crossroads as to how to proceed. I am sure my paid would increase pretty quickly as I advance but its a red flag.

My options are mention it to my employer and risk getting the offer rescinded and I am not sure I would be able to get another offer that gives this experience in my region. Or I can take the job and work the role for awhile before mentioning it to my employer, and file a case with the state labor board if they ignore me. Or I could turn down the job.

I can usually get away with putting friends/family members who can vouch for my character, work ethic etc. but this one specifies that they have to be professional and it’s a childcare center so they’ll probably check. 

Scrolling through my contacts I still have a few old bosses numbers but I think putting them down would be extremely weird since I haven’t spoken to these people in years. Plus, there’s no guarantee they even work there anymore or remember who I am. 

I’m this 🤏 close to just putting the main front desk number for the places I worked at and hope for the best. Any ideas?

1fjfm6w,Stumped- proceed with and pay for background investigation or wait to hear back from other interviews?,"I had passed the interviews for a local dispatcher position (~$85-90k ish) and the next step is background investigation, which requires me to request and order my transcripts and driver’s record.

One of the jobs in my field (~$80k-$95k, remote) I interviewed at almost a month ago said they were finishing up interviews last week and would have a response by this week and I heard nothing so far.

I recently finished an interview for a position and got offered a job after being laid off from my previous job not because of performance but overhirring. I managed to get to a final round for this position and they offered me a job and gave me a salary on the spot. I did tell them that it was lower than my previous job but mainly because it's a whole different work experience from my previous one so I considered myself somewhat new to the field. They mentioned that their budget is limited and can only offer me the amount.

I’m seventeen and soon will be needing to write my personal statement for university. I don’t have much of an idea of what to do !! 

I take English Literature. Psychology and Philosophy&Ethics as my three A levels. 

I love english literature and psychology is very interesting to me. I do care about not being dead broke when I grow up otherwise I’m very sure I’d go into social work as that topic interests me. 

The idea of being an English teacher sounds very interesting to me as well. I’d like to do a job where I help people and I was particularly interested in working with victims of sex crimes until, as usual, I found out those careers made no money at all. 

I would be a mental health nurse but I’m just TERRIFIED of needles. If I was super smart i’d go into forensic psychology. I am interested in the “taboo” aspects of life and working with criminals, understanding them or people who struggle with mental illness or who have been victims to these types of people. 

I’m tough, don’t break easily. But I will say I’m quite short and not super strong so I definitely wouldn’t be like a walking the streets police officer.

1fjcg6p,Should I switch jobs? Hoping for advice and different viewpoints!,"I see this question a lot, but everyone's situation is different, so I'm hoping for some discussion on my specific case :)

I'm a Project Manager in construction. I spent most of my career working for commercial and industrial GCs and major subs (stress level 8-9 on a 1-10 scale) on jobs as large as $400mil, but after about 10 years of that, I effectively burnt out. About six weeks ago, I switched to working for a very low-key (we’re talking stress level 2-3) specialty fabricator where I spend about 70% of my time just estimating these little $100-300k jobs, and about 30% of my time performing PM duties for awarded contracts. The company values having butts in seats at the office 40 hours a week, but there's no OT or requirements to work during vacation or all hours of the day/night. There’s no travel, and the office is a 20-minute commute for me, and traffic isn’t really a thing. That said, the pay seems to match the stress level as I’m only making $75k and the benefits are terrible (no retirement, only 50% of health covered and nothing for my family, 2 wks PTO gaining 1 day per year, and that’s pretty much it). I have some concerns this job might get boring in a few years, but after my burnout, I’m kind of wondering if there are worse things than boring?

The timing is terrible given that I just started the job I have now, but I kept applying to jobs while I interviewed for this current job, and some companies were slower than others to get back to me. Anyway, I’m about to receive a job offer from an owner’s rep for $110k (\~45% more money) AND much better benefits (5% 401k match, full health coverage for me and 75% coverage for all family members, 3 wks PTO gaining 1 wk after 5 years, and more). There is some travel involved, even a couple of overnights each month – which is a bit of a big deal as my SO and I have a toddler now. I’d be expected in the office \~3-4 days per week with some WFH flexibility that honestly might just mean I have to work even when I’m sick or something, can’t get a good read on this. I gather that my working hours are subject to relative change as required by whatever projects I'm responsible for and the stakeholders involved. My understanding is that working for an owner’s rep would be less stressful than a GC, but more stressful than my current gig, like maybe it would be a 5-6 on my theoretical 1-10 stress scale?

The industry is small, the town I live in makes it even smaller, and I do worry about burning bridges here to some extent. I would certainly be burning the bridge to this current company in leaving after just a couple of months.

What are your thoughts, Reddit Community? Am I properly evaluating the comparisons? What are some other things I ought to consider? Is this amount of money worth the tradeoffs?",emmasculator,1,1.0,0,1726610910,2024-09-17 22:08:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fjcg6p/should_i_switch_jobs_hoping_for_advice_and/,9,2024

1fjazop,Manager wants me in office when my contract mentions remote ,"
I joined this job recently (2 months ago) and I already hate the job and the manager. 

During hiring, I negotiated with HR about being fully remote and she agreed as well. 

My employment contract mentions remote.

But my manager comes to the office once a week and wants me to come too.

I went for some weeks, thinking it’d get better eventually.

I finally asked the manager that it isn’t in my contract and I specifically negotiated remote (I have to travel 100kms to get to the office). 

But the manager said I have to come to the office and she was under the impression that I was hired knowing that. 

I’ve started applying to other jobs today onwards.

This job sucks anyway, so much of micromanaging and overworking culture at the company (or just my manager, I wouldn’t know). My manager takes pride in working extra hours and appreciates when others work too.

So I’m not sure, do I just quit now? Or do I wait it out till I get a new job? ",foundationmatchques,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1726607440,2024-09-17 21:10:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fjazop/manager_wants_me_in_office_when_my_contract/,9,2024

I’m going to graduate in Dec with a bachelor’s in a non science field so I know I’ll need to take pre reqs. I’m generally interested in anything in the medical field (I’ve always have been but got discouraged) but that doesn’t mean you guys can’t suggest something else.

I know there’s some field like nursing, being a rad tech or ultrasound tech, or going a step higher and becoming a NP or PA but I’m not sure what would fit me.

I like to help people in some way, I love surgery related stuff (used to watch surgery videos for fun), I’m fine with talking to people but once it becomes a big group or anything presentation wise I get really anxious. I like working 3/4 days out the week (I value my free time), I don’t want to be on my feet the whole day but at the same time I don’t like staring at a screen for hours (I get bored)

1fj9x16,Leaving my job related to my PhD for an industry job,"Hello!

First of all I hope the story I'm writing fits to this subreddit. If not, feel free to delete my post.  
I currently hold a job that's strongly related to my PhD. One of the 3 project's I'm in, is basically my PhD. I also work another job part time that's unrelated to it and is in industry. Now, this industry job is offering me a very nice position, with a very nice work culture, compared to the PhD job, where I feel a bit mismanaged - also there is sometimes tension/ stress and loss of time and efforts due to disorganization. Since I got offered a full time position in the industry place, I'm planning to tell my supervisor, that I'm taking it but I would stay for 2 more months to make sure that all the projects I'm no longer going to be involved in are in a state where someone else can take over, and also that I would like to still progress with my PhD even if at a slower pace. Currently I see myself finishing this way in 1-2 years. In all rationalistic sense finishing my PhD would be in the best interest of me my supervisor and my doctoral school, however I'm a bit worried, that out of spite my supervisor might decide to no longer support it. What do you guys think would be the cleanest and most professional way to do this? I feel like staying two more months is reasonable, and of course the PhD job would also no longer need to pay me (aside from my scholarship which comes from the state, so it doesn't matter to them anyway) , so from that money they could hire someone else. The problem is that I think it will be very hard to find someone for my position, and as I've said things are already quite mismanaged and chaotic, so I feel like  my leave will be a huge blow to my group. There's also a couple people who I like despite the overworked/stressed atmosphere, who I would definitely like to part with in the most professional way.",Lonely_Ice6579,1,1.0,2,1726604925,2024-09-17 20:28:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fj9x16/leaving_my_job_related_to_my_phd_for_an_industry/,9,2024
1fj9ojv,Imposter Syndrome when learning on the job,"I (M30) recently joined an economic planning and consulting company a few months ago and my first few months have involved a lot of learning through failure and embarrassment.

When I interviewed, I told my boss that I have no direct experience in this field - only academic. I started off in construction and then went back and got my masters in finance and a professor who took a liking to me recommended me for this position. 

I’ve made some mistakes that clients have pointed out, some of which the result of my own lack of thoroughness and others that were the result of not having the right data from the client or no direction from my boss. I’ve faced criticism straight on and vowed to put in place checks and balances so as to avoid mistakes on future projects. 

My boss has gotten frustrated with me a couple of times and understandably so. I’ve suggested putting a meeting on the calendar every week for us to go over things I need direction on and what needs to get done that week. 

Lately I’ve noticed I’ve been getting more menial tasks that are less consequential. I’ve also noticed that some projects that were assigned to me have been shifted to other employees that have been here longer. 

I hate f***ing up and I’m afraid of getting fired before I have a chance to really demonstrate I can do the job. I don’t know if my boss is gearing up to let me go or just redirecting me to where I thinks I’ll be the most useful. 

He’s a bit of a passive aggressive guy, but I do respect him. One minute he’ll chew me out and then the next he’s giving me free football tickets. I just feel really weird about where I’m at, I could use some outside views on the situation and how to proceed. Thanks.

I have a part-time job at a grocery store right now, but that won't cut it. I want to go to college because I LOVE learning new things, but I must figure out what degree to get. I'm so scared I'll go to college, waste my money, and be in debt.

I have so many passions; I want to move to a big city, but how do I afford it? I love fitness and nutrition, journalism, film and photography, digital marketing and sales, or maybe business; I don't know. I want to do everything simultaneously and have so many aspirations. I also really have a passion for all things health and self-help-related. I'm a very creative and highly disciplined person. Who is very passionate about the things I love but don't know what to do with them or how to get opportunities to achieve those goals.

1fj9bz9,"My college professor gave a speech about successful students and dedication, which made me feel really bad because I believe I'm not like those students.","
Before I start, I want you to know that I'm from Portugal and not the United States like many of you.

Today my finance teacher gave a speech about some successful students, from a former student who became a financial director at the age of 27 to a former student who now lives in Dubai and is a millionaire, all examples of success.

But he also talked about the commitment behind it, the hours of study and dedication, the failures they made and the ability they had to get back on their feet.

When I came back from college and told my father this, he said, ""And you know what? No one offered them that, they had to work much harder than you to get it.""

And hearing this made me feel bad because I'm not like those people, I've always been known as someone who doesn't make an effort.

I got into this college for the minimum, I almost ended up having to work as a carpenter.

But now I'm no longer at school, here there are no teachers who care about you, the demand and effort required is no longer 100% and now it's 1000000%.

And in the last year my life has gotten a lot worse: I've become addicted to Reddit, I've discovered how difficult it is for me to read books, I've become really lazy and unable to get out of bed early.

I don't know what I'm going to do in the future, but I don't feel like staying in college for 10 years (like some people) or having to leave and go to a minimum-wage job while others get bachelor's and master's degrees and make it to the top.

I just want to give up on life because I'm not capable of making the effort to be like the former students my teachers talk about, but I also don't want to spend my whole life looking at others and thinking that I am and will be condemned to be a loser until I die.",Melgako562,9,0.6000000238418579,18,1726603571,2024-09-17 20:06:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fj9bz9/my_college_professor_gave_a_speech_about/,9,2024

I ended up not working for a year and went back into the job search and got a job that I planned to stay at temporarily for experience, but they ended up letting go of me because they said I needed more experience.

Unfortunately, due to previously mentioned changes I have spent +-half a year doing stuff which bored and exhausted me + the new managers did not make it easier (made it even worse - to be precise).

Today, my frustration have reached its peak and I quit. My question is what should I do now? After such a long period of doing soul-killing job, I feel burnt out and have an impression that I will not find a job which will bring joy and satisfaction anymore.

Due to local regulations, I will be officialy free to leave the company at the begging of November, but have basically nothing to do throught this time.

1fj7785,CS or Dentistry,"Hello Reddit, Currently 18M on the west coast

I’m at a crossroads and could use some advice. I've been passionate about computer science (CS) since I was a kid. My journey began with scripting on Roblox, creating games, and even coding small projects at the age of 12. This passion persisted through various self-taught courses and formal education like Coursera, Michigan State, and CS50. I've always been drawn to problem-solving, critical thinking, and bringing ideas to life through programming.

Despite my deep-rooted interest in CS, I initially veered away due to concerns about job stability and marketability and been pursuing Dentistry. Now, I’m considering going back to my original passion. I believe I could genuinely enjoy and excel in a CS career, but I’m still apprehensive about job security.

On the flip side, I’ve been pursuing a career in dentistry largely for the financial benefits. While I’ve had moments of personal insecurity about my teeth and feel I could help others with their smiles, I lack a true passion for the field. I’m concerned that choosing dentistry primarily for its salary might lead to unhappiness in my professional life.

So, here’s my dilemma: Should I follow my passion for CS, despite the risks and uncertainties, or stick with dentistry for the financial stability, even if it means working in a field I’m not passionate about?

I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this. Thanks!

**Computer Science (CS) Pros:**

* Deep passion and genuine interest in the field.
* Established connections with software engineers, providing valuable networking opportunities.
* Flexibility to work from home.
* Competitive salary with room for growth.
* Numerous job opportunities and potential for career advancement.
* Valuable hard skills with the ability to create apps or pursue entrepreneurial ventures.
* Low student debt.
* Flexibility to live anywhere.

**Computer Science (CS) Cons:**

* Job instability and market fluctuations.
* Challenges in securing a job due to high competition.
* Saturated field with intense competition.
* Constant need to stay updated with the latest technologies and documentation.

**Dentistry Pros:**

* High salary potential.
* Opportunity to start your own practice or business.
* Prestigious career with a doctoral degree.
* Directly impacts and helps people’s health and well-being.
* Possibility to learn new skills through additional courses post-dental school.

**Dentistry Cons:**

* Extremely high stress levels.
* Increasing dominance of Dental Service Organizations (DSOs) and corporate practices, leading to high patient turnover and inadequate support staff.
* Negative public perception and criticism. (Patients coming in and saying ""I hate you"" ""I hate the dentist ETC.)
* Significant debt, ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 straight out of Dental School.
* Risk of frequent lawsuits.
* Lengthy and costly education, with intense competition for dental school admission.
* Limited career progression unless you specialize or open your own practice.
* Physically demanding, with a high risk of chronic pain or injury, including back and neck issues.
* Strict contract terms, including potential legal action if you leave before fulfilling a 90-day notice period, often resulting in loss of patients and income.
* Also it disgusts me, the inside of people's mouths",DentistryCats,0,0.5,2,1726598653,2024-09-17 18:44:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fj7785/cs_or_dentistry/,9,2024

-been bartending for 8 years (absolutely love it but want a more stable career- not opposed to doing both jobs and switching to part-time at the bar)
-started working in the legal field 2 years ago, became a licensed paralegal 1 year ago: NOTHING LAW BASED. NOTHING IN AN OFFICE. I hate it lol.
-I am an artist and do commissions on the side. Design people’s tattoos, do portraits, love logo design and general illustration- big fan of working with my hands but not opposed to learning digital
-I love the outdoors
-I love animals and plants and caring for them all

Here are the two I have been considering: 

-paramedic
-park ranger

The only issue with park ranger is that the pay is pretty low on that, if it weren’t for that I would already be diving in head first. 

Ideally something that does not require university (very open to trade school) 

I just want something that will be a little different every day but consistently doing the same things, something active, something with contact with nature/plants/people, or something arts based.

1fj644j,Applied for rehire job at 11.50 an hour but hiring manager is only paying me 10.45?,"So, I worked for this company two years ago, and I was there for 9 years. I saw on indeed and on their company website that they are hiring backroom associates at 11.50 an hour. So, I applied. That was two weeks ago, and I finally started yesterday, only to discover last night after installing the app, that they are only paying me 10.45 an hour. I'm not sure if this was a typo or what, but I brought it up and the hiring manager said that they can't pay me 11.50 an hour. I checked on indeed to make sure I wasn't wrong, but they updated Backroom Associates to 12 an hour now. 

This seems like false advertising honestly, and I'm not sure what to do. My friend is telling me to suck it up and take the 10 dollars because it's just ""one dollar"", while another friend is telling me to go to HR and threaten legal actions against the company, and I'm not sure if I should just quit cuz Idk if it's even worth the effort.

The reason I reapplied to this job was because for half a year now, I haven't been able to find a job, and I have put in applications everywhere, I've walked in, called in to ask, brought my resume, but nothing. Not even walmart or dollar general will hire me. I guess my 9 years of experience in retail, and my one year experience as a housekeeper isn't enough.

1fj576p,Streamline Your Job Search: How New Tools Can Save You Time and Effort,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some insights about a new approach to job searching that could significantly save you time and reduce the hassle of finding the right job. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the sheer volume of job listings and the time it takes to sift through them, you’re not alone.

Traditional job search methods often involve scrolling through numerous job postings, each with lengthy descriptions that can be time-consuming to read. This is where innovative job search solutions come into play. One such solution is a chat-based search engine designed to simplify this process. Here’s how it works:

1. **Efficient Job Matching:** The platform helps you quickly find jobs that match your criteria, reducing the time spent on job boards and eliminating irrelevant postings.
2. **Summarized Job Details:** Instead of wading through long job descriptions, you can get concise summaries of key job details. This means you spend less time reading and more time applying for jobs that are genuinely suitable for you.
3. **Real-Time Insights:** By asking specific questions, you can quickly get the information you need about job requirements, company expectations, and more.

For anyone tired of traditional job search methods, this new approach might be worth exploring. It’s designed to streamline the process and make job hunting more efficient and less stressful.

Feel free to share your thoughts or ask questions if you’re curious about how such solutions might fit into your job search strategy!

1fj53d3,Hating my job ,"I am one of those INFPs who was unfortunately good at maths, hence got into finance. Once I started working, I realised this finance world isn't really for me for numerous reasons, ""finance guys"" being one.

After gaining some experience, I pivoted to performance marketing for an international banking corporation and now that I've spent some time here, I've realised that maybe I am just not made for this corporate world. 

Not only are managers and your colleagues so utterly toxic, the fact that everyday I am being asked to be more ""assertive"" to get the work done by others is just pathetic.

I am being told almost on a daily basis to pull up my socks and become more proactive. It's not an unfair demand on my manager's part, I know but I am only in this job for the money. I thought I don't dislike it but lately I've been dreading waking up in the morning.

My hobbies include reading novels ( I literally read The House of Mirth by Edith Wharton on my work breaks), practicing my French, going for a run and exercising (mainly for my mental health).

I am doing in most areas of my life and I am very grateful for the money that I get from my job but these days none of this seems worth it.

So I've started splurging a little, going out with friends and dates a lot more, spending money on cosmetics, shoes, etc. (I am very frugal in general tbh but I am in my ""fuck it"" mode most days).

I don't want to live a life where I keep waiting for Friday evenings and dreading Monday mornings.

I work from home completely and I am very grateful for that but I am not sure if I can keep going on like this. 

Have you ever felt like this? What did you do to change your life? Any other helpful advice would be highly appreciated!

Tl;Dr - hating my job, like the wfh and money, hate everything else.

1fj4zdp,Getting into a new field,"I (31f) have not had a traditional career trajectory since graduating college. I got my B.S. in Economics in 2016. My original goal was to work for a company focused on sustainability or in a nonprofit setting. Due to changing personal circumstances, I ended up taking the first position offered to me for a start up private insurance agency. This ended up being a bad move for me. I was considered a part owner in the company and my name was tied to a lot of the operations, some of which I wasn’t aware of. After about a year and a half of this I finally decided to walk away. I kept having bad feelings about potentially shady business decisions. 

My only other experience was in the restaurant industry, so I ended up managing for a few years. I ultimately got burnt out by the lack of work life balance and pivoted to an entirely different field. I worked in private schools and early childhood education until my school closed during the pandemic. At that time, I took a job as an office assistant for an optometrist. I have worked in optometry since then (about 3.5 years), but am painfully aware that none of these things have been my intended career path. 

I want to start applying to entry level positions in the nonprofit world, something in the sustainability sector, or even finance, but I have no idea where to begin. I want to use the education I worked hard for, but am worried about the eclectic work experience. Does anyone have any tips on how to proceed? From resume building, cover letter writing, what sites are best to use when applying, or even companies to look into; I would appreciate any advice that can be shared.

1fj4r0a,My wife is not supportive of me taking a lower paying job ,"I work in computer science and I make great income. But my wife is also a similar field and we make more than enough where we live but I wasn’t happy in my field. I mostly chose this pathway because my parents pressured me to get in a good program/field in college so I can become successful and take care of my family which I’m thankful for since I never had to struggle financially by choosing a good major in college and they also paid for my education so I felt like I needed to do this. However, currently I want to pursue want I actually want to do now that money isn’t an issue for us 

While working my job full time I went back to school to get my masters and I obtained a certification to become a teacher in my state 

My wife was fine with it since I’m furthering my education and she thinks that’s great for me but she wanted me to stay at my current job because I make a lot of money. She said she would be OK with me becoming a substitute teacher and work temporarily or be a fill-in as a teacher which I did do for a while. But I changed my mind. I really want to work with children and specifically special needs children. I love children and I honestly felt so much joy teaching and helping the youth. One student in particular made me want to stay in teaching and it made me feel inspired to stay in education. The kids really love me and I saw an impact working with them. I never got that kind of satisfaction from my computer science career

I told my wife I want to quit my job and become a full time teacher but she is livid. She says she doesn’t want to be “the breadwinner” in the marriage and how embarrassing this will be for my status and being downgraded in pay and she told me what would my parents think (I come from a strict south Asian background where education and your success determines your value especially as a man I need to be making significant amount of money)

She’s also upset because we’re pregnant and she wants the best for our children. Even though we would be financially fine with my wife’s income and my new career as a teacher but we obviously won’t have as much money as we did with my old job, but we will still be fine. She just doesn’t want to be the sole provider and she made it clear she would think less of me if I downgraded job titles. The social status matters a lot in my community since everyone in our community is high income and have respectable careers especially the men

And then she tried to make me feel gross by wanting to be a teacher. She called me a creep. She told me it’s weird that I’m a man and want to be around children and how this isn’t normal and now she regrets creating a baby with me. My wife is 24 weeks pregnant

She later apologized and said that was out of line but she was just really upset about my career choices lately and she told me to just please drop the silly teacher gig and go back to working full time at my computer science job. I forgave her since I know she’s been hormonal and emotional lately since her pregnancy symptoms are crazy. Her words still hurt me and they discouraged me. I don’t really know what to do. I don’t want to stay unhappy in my career. I guess I can still work temporarily as a teacher but that will just make me want to work full time. I also want to please my wife and I don’t want to disappoint her or think less of me.

I've always wanted to become a commercial pilot, and now that I’m about to finish school in a few months, I’m looking for guidance on how to get started. I plan to do my flight training outside of India (specifically Miami), but I have a lot of questions about the process and would love some advice. For context, I was a JEE student but realized halfway through that it wasn’t for me. I stopped attending coaching and focused on self-studying for 12th grade cbse and I'll finish that in a few months. My parents are fully supportive of my decision.

Here are my main questions:

1. How exactly do I become a commercial pilot after finishing 12th grade?
2. What subjects and qualifications are required for flying schools abroad?
3. **Important:** I have spectacles (myopic -ve 3 in both eyes) , so is LASIK surgery allowed for aspiring commercial pilots, or will it disqualify me?
4. Do I need to get classes to clear the exam? If so, where, and when (immediately after 12th?)?
5. What’s the cost range for completing flight school abroad and overall cost in general.
6. Are there any specific medical or physical requirements for flying?
7. Is becoming a commercial pilot a good decision, or am I missing something important I should consider?

1fj4af8,Seeking Advice for Career Shift: From Social Work to Tech or FBI,"Hey everyone,

I’m a 24-year-old guy with an MSW and an APSW license in Wisconsin. After six years in social work, including recent private practice, I’m at a crossroads. My first job post-graduation was rough (ethical concerns, lack of support, and poor work-life balance), leaving me jaded.

To find clarity, I’ve been exploring both the FBI and IT paths. I'm researching the FBI application process, qualifications, and reaching out to current/former agents to hear firsthand experiences. I also have an interview coming up at UW Health and I'm applying to similar positions, which I’m treating as a short-term stepping stone to build my resume while I explore other passions. 

At the same time, I’m diving into tech through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Program and considering a bachelor’s degree in IT, with a focus on specialized areas like cybersecurity, cloud computing, or UX design. I'm actively seeking hands-on experience via internships, volunteer projects, and networking with IT professionals.

**Here’s What I’m Looking For:**

**Relevant Roles for FBI/BAU**: I’m intrigued by roles that might prepare me for the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU), specifically the role of special agent - psychology/counseling background. Would a forensic social work certification help? What roles should I consider?

**Career Change Advice**: I’m open to pivoting to tech (cybersecurity, IT, cloud computing, UX design) but feel overwhelmed by the choices. Insights from anyone who’s transitioned would be appreciated.

**Remote Work Opportunities**: Any suggestions for remote roles in social work or tech that offer flexibility and travel?

**Networking Tips**: My network is limited. How can I build a stronger one in social work or tech?

I’m passionate about human behavior and problem-solving, but I feel lost and unsure if social work is truly for me or if it was influenced by others' expectations. I’d love to hear any advice, resources, or stories from others who have navigated similar paths.

I have made a total of $198k a year for quite awhile now thanks to a trust fund, but as my dad fucked over the IRS, that trust is under fire and I need to be prepared to take the ship home myself.

I have lots of past retail management experience. Left because I hate the employees, but I am an excellent salesman. Like can sell trash bags to homeless or ice to Eskimo level at sales. I love chasing the next big payday too.

I have 4 total years professional landscape experience with 3 being for a high end internationally renowned golf course and 1 with Parks and Rec (my current job which pays excellent benefits). I hate being outside but I love the extra family time.

I have 7 years experience managing a medical business office environment remotely, but have been really shit on by other medical centers trying to get my foot in the door. Had one of the better companies offer me only $23/hr level bad.

I have my Associates in English.

I have a fully paid off $1.2M home I’ll be selling and splitting with my ex (we are ending things amicably due to her infidelity).

I have $250k soon arriving from my grandmas inheritance.

I have $100k in savings to be split with the ex.

What’s my next best move? What do I work toward? What basket do I put all my eggs in?

The way I see it, I can either get certifications for landscape and go for broke on Parks and Rec (not gonna be rich enough to keep doing Disney every year but kids will be fine).

I can transition into sales, in which case I’m not sure where to start. Real estate? Car sales? Something more obscure..? Do I get my degree first? In what..? Business has been a degree that has alluded me once before, so finances..?

I can also go back to retail and just be miserable. $36-42/hr is sort of the midline. My benefits with this many children over at Parks and Rec almost makes the value equal, however.

Any advice? Outside the box welcome too.

1fj2oj9,Guidance Needed: Deciding whether to escalate a sensitive issue before leaving.,"**Situation**: My Skip level manager alluded to my son's medical condition while on a team call. 

**Question**: Should raise this to HR before my final day or just let it go?

**Background**: In a recent team meeting, we were discussing ideas for a team-building event (lunch & learn). I was sharing my support for the suggestion and before I could finish my skip jumps in and says, ""Oh yeah, you could talk to us about heart transplants."" This caught me off guard, especially since only a few people at work knew of my son's condition. Even after the call a college reached out calling out the comment. 

For additional context, I had to take a few weeks of leave last year (right around the time this guy joined our company) but have kept this information private, sharing only with my direct managers and a few select others. To boot, my skip knew of my son's condition before I even told him, assuming from HR or my previous manager who may have had to justify my leave last year. He asked about my son during our second connect and when called out, brushed it off as if I had told him previously.

I did raise his comment afterwards  to my direct manager but never really intended to escalate further, even though I had worked hard over the past 3 years to keep my family's medical details private. 

Also....After being with the company for 13 years, I was recently notified I was being laid off and my role would transition to an offshore hub. I'm not a confrontational person and was never planning to escalate but this guy just rubs me the wrong way and I'm pretty annoyed how he can just blurt something like that out. The more I think about it the more I want to raise to HR. However, I don't want to burn any bridges as we are in a bit of a niche tech industry. 

Would you suggest just letting this go, or should I raise it with HR? I'm not even sure want outcome I'm hoping for, but I feel conflicted. Maybe just hope having someone call out his inappropriate comments would help avoid similar situations in the future.

Thanks in advance!

1fj2nzl,What degree should I go for?,"I have 10 years of experience in all facets of multi-state payroll (new hire reporting, federal and state compliance, garnishments, employee benefits, etc.). I also handle other tasks such as sales tax, bookkeeping, and tax preparation. I’m in my early 30s and do not have any certifications or college degrees. I want to pursue a degree.

I would like to earn a bachelor’s degree, and my ultimate goal is to secure a remote job focused solely on payroll (not public accounting) with a salary of at least $60,000. I am also interested in the HR aspect of payroll. I have been advised that an accounting degree would give me more flexibility compared to a major in HR.

The college I would really like to attend does not offer a BS in Accounting online. However, they do offer a BSBA in Global Business with a concentration in Accounting and Finance. Would this degree align with my goals, or should I look for another school that offers an online BS in Accounting?

I recently (last month) stated working for a state agency (my second job since law school) in the field that drew me to law school. The job will absolutely open a lot of doors for me and give me a good trajectory. However, it is far slower compared to my previous gig as a prosecutor. Although I was routinely working 70 hours a week, it was (usually) exciting and I was close with my colleagues. Part of why I left was the crazy hours as well as wanting to be in my preferred industry, but I did not realize how much I'd miss high-paced litigation. Additionally, the office is a lot smaller,  Im the youngest attorney  by about a decade which makes the social aspect harder. 

I know complaining about a good work-life balance is crazy in our field especially with a good job, but I want some feedback on how to adapt to a slower job and get the most out of it.

1fj29cw,New grad requesting advice on handling remote work environment,"hi, so recently I started a new job at a fully remote company. It is my first grad job so I have no idea how to navigate workspace and Im completely lost. After every call with my manager I want to cry because he is incredibly vague. All I hear from him is handle this. And the ""this"" part is not specified, for him it's obvious. for me it's not. It nightmare. I am doing work that I think he wants me to do but Im not sure of that and if Im doing it correctly. Every call with him is so vague. It's putting lots of stress on me. Anyway, that was a rant and not an aim of this post but if anyone has any advice that would be great.

  
I was thinking of reaching out to someone else on the team. My team is super small and even though our manager requested three times for my colleagues to contact me, none of them did so I already dont feel too comfortable going to them. But, one other person in the same role as I have but in a different team reached out to me and said we should set up a call to chat. just like a casual chat, we dont have anything to work on together. Im wondering how to follow up on that, I would love to chat with her and get to know her and how the work around the company is handled but then one I dont even know what to say when I call her. Do I go for what are your hobbies seeing as it is a causal call? but also Im afraid if I go for ""my manager is really unclear can you tell me what how do you do  it in your team (seeing as we have different topics but same tasks)"" it will be seen as complaining about my manager which might get back to him. I dont know. Im completely lost to be honest

1fj1n0w,When do i announce that im quitting?,"I’ve worked at my current full time job for a little over a year now. This is my first job that is relevant to my degree. It doesn’t pay well and my boss has been driving me insane. I work with a small team, only 4, and 2 of them are my “boss.” I work in research for a university, so one is my PI and the other is the lab manager. I am 23, and the closest person to my age at my job is 46. They all treat me unfairly/passive aggressively. I used to be salaried, but the FLSA change made it so I now make just under the minimum to be salaried, which was a big reason I accepted the job offer. During my one-year eval, there was no talk of a pay increase. I plan to go back to school to get my masters degree and need to start saving up. With my current wage, I don’t make enough to be saving, I’m just breaking even. During my time at this job, I kept a job I had during undergrad so I could pick up shifts to make some extra money. I’ve had this job long enough to know I get along with everyone I work with and there are always yearly raises. This job pays me slightly more than my current full time job. I’ve been talking to my boss at this job about coming back at the end of the year to be full time there to save up for grad school. My boss at that job let me know there is a full time position available and she’d want me to come back in the middle of october if possible. My current full time job has caused me so much stress and annoyance, I’ve decided to take the opportunity to help better my mental health and financial situation. Since I work in research, there are some projects that are being worked on, so I’m not sure if I should put in a normal two weeks or what. I don’t have anything major going on that would get me a publication so I honestly am indifferent about it, I just don’t want to screw the people I work with because this will all inevitably fall on my 46yo coworker. I’ve heard horror stories about people informing their boss before two weeks and getting fired, so I’m worried that could happen. Additionally, if I put in my two weeks notice, I’m worried that it will come off as a total surprise because my boss knows I intend to go back to school, I just think they thought I would be staying until next Summer/Fall. I don’t want to burn bridges or make a bad situation with them because this is my first “real” job and I would like to use it as a reference in the future. Sorry for over explaining things!

1fj1ejc,Career options where I can help people dying & grieving? ,"A few years ago I got my degree in computer science & have been working in game development ever since. It’s been fun and fairly awesome - but not very fulfilling. Earlier in my life I worked as an EMT and a combat medic. I have lots of firsthand experience with childhood death, trauma, elder care, dementia, suicide, grief, etc.. I’m a listener, and I love to help people through listening and compassion. 

This sounds cheesy-  but lately I’ve felt a very deep need to live my life helping more people, particularly those who are lonely, dying, or grieving. I think I’d also really enjoy helping people plan for death, green burials, home funerals, etc. 

I’ve been volunteering with some senior services and hospice companies to just be a companion when people need it as well, which has been awesome. 

But I’ve been very limited due to my day job, and I want to pursue a career where I can do this kind of work everyday. So far I’ve been looking at a few options, but I’d love some advice on which careers would be the most promising considering what I want to do day-to-day, and the general qualifiers like feasibility/job demand/pay, etc. 

I’m not opposed to going back to school for a masters degree - and I can get by making around $60k in my city (Savannah, GA). 

Some jobs I’ve been considering: Social Worker, Professional Counselor, Funeral Director, Death Doula, RN, or maybe even some kind of secular/interfaith chaplain.

1fj191y,I need help! New career help? ,"
I have a background in education, before staying home with my children for two years, I worked as a teacher or school counselor for a decade. My masters degree is in education as well. I left to stay home with my kids and pivoted careers during Covid to an entirely new field based on a hobby/passion of mine. I didn’t think much of it, had no clue if I could get into it then happened to land myself in two different roles in which I was not qualified at all. I ended up leaving the first job, because it was a toxic work environment and I was given absolutely no training, and expected to do things a senior would do. It was so overwhelming and stressful, I wanted to ease into this field and that was not the case. I got hired as an admin/support role for a bigger company, to support the designers which is what I want to do. I thought it would be the perfect transition role into this industry. They agreed to let me work my previous schedule so I could still do afternoon shift with my kids. So I’m working 30 hours a week. What I thought I was going to be doing, and what I am doing is drastically harder and insanely fast paced. I haven’t really been given much training, and my manager is rarely in the office while I go in 5 days a week. There are so many tasks, so many emails, so many vendors, so much to keep organized in our sample library, as well as tracking all of the stuff coming for really large jobs. It’s been such a difficult transition, I got back on adhd medication as well as anti anxiety medication. I feel like an intern at the age of 32. I am 6 months into this job, and I feel like I can’t keep up. I was on a job site m-th last week, working nearly 10 hour days as well as attempting to keep up with email, and do a task that was “urgent”, and then this week I get feedback that I didn’t do something I was supposed to do, and we need to chat about my challenges with executing this process. Doing that task requires me to wait on information, and I didn’t get around to it until friday, so of course Monday morning it was not complete. I don’t know how to learn all I need to know about the industry, and keep up with so many tasks, keep it all organized in my brain, and be a good mother to my young children, all in 30 hours a week. When the heck does this get easier? I feel like I’m an idiot, or slow. When am I expected not to make mistakes? I’m so tired of the anxiety. I feel like no matter what career or job I will be riddled with self doubt.

They said that I would be under evaluation for the month of August and if I fulfill all of the tasks they give me, they will renew my contract in the succeeding months. We're a small team and when I started, I asked my boss how many we were in the team: it was just me and him.

Just last week, when we were having our feedback meeting, they said that I successfully fulfilled all of my assigned tasks last August, and so they were renewing my contract.

By the end of November, they will be choosing who will stay in the position while the other one will have to leave.

1fj0rua,How do I regain my work ethic?,"Hey everyone,

I started self-improvement when I was 14, mainly driven by a desire to make money through various online businesses and skills. I grew up in a single-mother household, so a big part of my motivation came from wanting to help my mom with bills and take care of my own expenses to ease her burden.

By the time I was 16, I had made over $30K from these ventures, working long hours—sometimes up to 12 hours a day. I would end the day exhausted but fulfilled, knowing I was pushing forward and achieving something. I was a workaholic, driven by both internal and external goals.

Now, I’m 18 (turning 19 soon), and while I’ve made over $20K working for others in the past 2 years, I feel like I’m stagnating. The same drive I had earlier just isn’t there anymore. I’m stuck in a cycle of making the same monthly salary without any real growth.

Recently, I stepped into real estate, hoping to become an agent and get back on track to break the cycle. I figured with my previous experience in sales and online business, I’d be able to thrive. I worked from April to July, took a break in August, and came back this month. However, I haven’t closed a single deal yet and I’m currently running on savings. I’m simply not putting in the work like I used to, and I know it. I’ll make excuses to avoid work, choosing instead to focus on university assignments (which aren’t that challenging for me, as I’m a straight-A computer science student) and honestly it's considered a waste of time for me considering I only need C's to please my mom. Where before I would squeeze every free moment to work on my goals, now I’ll just sit on my phone if I have a spare 30mins - hour and eventually it adds up.

What’s frustrating is that my goals haven’t changed. I still want to be a multimillionaire, retire my mom by 21, and live a financially free life. I still feel like university isn’t aligned with my ambitions. But I just can’t find the motivation to do the work necessary to get to where I want too. I'm not sure if I'm in the right career path, But time will tell and I only wanna fix what I can control which is my work ethic.

So, my question is—how can I regain the work ethic and drive I once had? Why am I struggling so much with something I used to thrive on?

I’d really appreciate any advice from people who’ve gone through something similar. Thanks for reading.  

  
TLDR: I had a signifcant work ethic and over the last 4 years it's dwindled considerably to where I'm just doing the bare minimmum + a little extra.

In search of career switch advice 

I am in desperate need of advice on how to proceed with a career switch to interior design. I am currently a junior in college pursuing a degree in civil engineering with a concentration in structural design. I’ve partook in engineering CO-OPS which have given me the skills in sourcing materials and creating structural designs using autocad and revit. I’ve been trying to make a career shift to interior design as civil engineering hasn’t given me the artistic/creative freedom that I hoped for. But I am really struggling to get my foot in the door. Most opportunities that I have come across require a portfolio of some sort which I do not have. The positions I have applied to have 500+ applicants so my chances are a long shot. I’ve started to contact local interior designers, sending my resume and stressing that this is a favor to me as I am strictly looking to gain experience and get some mentorship on starting a portfolio. I’ve even insinuated that I am willing to work for free, this is strictly about experience. But I haven’t gotten any emails back. I’m at a loss for what else to do. In regards to the technical side I am more than qualified - autocad/revit experience, materials sourcing experience, leadership experience (prior active duty military), budgeting and contract negotiation experience, etc. I just need someone to give me a chance and I really didn’t expect it to be this difficult as I live in a major US city (Boston). Should I consider transferring and changing my degree? I would prefer not to do that as I don’t want to lose any credits. I’m at a loss and could use some advice.

1fj04n1,Is my manager a micro manager or am I over reacting?,"So I’ve started working for this company that I am currently at a year ago. It is in recruitment, I now have 5 years of recruitment experience.

When I first started, I reported into a woman, let’s call her Mandy, and she was great- 30 years of experience, very laid back but also amazing at building relationships and just overall a great manager. She managed a team of 4, including me. 

I enjoyed working with her, because she treated me with a lot of trust and appreciated that I’ve had 4 years of experience. However, after about 5 months she had to go on maternity leave and since then I have been reporting into a guy, let’s call him Mike, who was in our immediate team and who also reported into Mandy. He is only about 5 years older than me and only has 3 more years of experience in recruitment. 

He is a really nice guy, and at first we really got on, I thought he was very considerate and since it was still fresh I overlooked that we are completely different people. 

As an example, he wants to catch up about 4 times a day (I should add that we work remotely). He needs to check in at 9:30, 12, 3pm and then 5:30pm before we finish. Even when there isn’t much to catch up about. Mandy didn’t do this unless we worked on something important. 
The fact that he has to catch up at the same times each day makes me think it is part of control or OCD.

He also wants me to send him most emails or job ads to proof read before I send or share. I’d like to add, I’ve been doing this for 5 years and I’ve never made a mistake for him to feel that he has to control every little thing I send. 

Again, at first I thought he has to just get used to working with me and build that trust, but it’s been a year and he’s the same! I’m not saying 5 years is a huge amount of time, but I feel very undervalued at the moment and feel like I could be easily more trusted or even work in the position that he is in. 

What’s worse is that the other two people that were in our team resigned a few months back, so it’s just me and him now.

What was the cherry on the cake for me, was that we speak on teams every single day about 4 times a day (as mentioned) and when we had an office working day last week, I’ve noticed that he is just such an awkward person. He is very uptight about everything, didn’t speak to many people in the office and we were busy that day. I was making calls all day, whereas he didn’t make ONE call and when I tried to look at what he’s doing, he was clearly making himself look busy. 
He didn’t go for the work drinks after and people from our extended team asked me about how I feel working with him, implying what I said above. 

Sorry about the rant. I just don’t know if I’m being dramatic! 

I don’t know whether to look for new jobs, or whether confronting him will do anything, as I don’t necessarily want to work with him for much longer. I don’t see value in reporting into him. Seeing his name pop up on the screen makes me annoyed and I don’t particularly get on with him as a person. 

I don’t agree with being anxious about every little thing! Let’s do our jobs to the best of our ability but let’s not be anxious 24/7! Especially if it’s a client facing role.

However, I think this is a great company: the other team members are lovely and it offers flexibility and some good perks.

1fizg1z,"How to ask to reduce hours at my employer (to pick up more hours at a better employer), without  leaving/getting fired, or raising an alarm?","I work as a PT in sports rehab.

I have been working in a local sports clinic for nearly 3 years on a part-time basis. It started ok but I started to see red flags in the first year, I'm at the point where I really just resent my job and hate going to work. My day to day with clients is good, I'm a good PT I would think, but the clinic management sucks and the pay is way less than what we should be earning in our field (and below the averages).   
Why don't I just quit?   
We live a bit remote and this is the best commute - I need to consider commute / family time with young kids right now. I technically COULD commute 1+ hours each way to a better clinic, but we have chosen to just sacrifice that so I can be closer to home right now while the kids are young. PT jobs often involve evenings and I just do not want to do that commute and be getting home 9pm. 

Very recently, I got an online teaching position that I started part-time from home on my non-clinic days - it's with a University and a mix of writing research papers, doing some virtual classes online. I have to go in 2x/month for the full day for planning and meetings. It's going to be a 2 hour drive one way, but I don't mind since it's only every couple of weeks. This new gig pays way better than my PT clinic job as we get hourly, extra benefits, and some other perks, and I can write off some new equipment that I will be using at home, they have even agreed to write off my gas for the commute days as it was advertised as from home but at last minute they decided to have everyone in biweekly. 

My goal: I want to reduce my days in clinic down to 2 days, and increase my online job to 3 days. Some may ask, why not just switch out completely - well in the long term of 5+ years I would like to do hands-on client work to some degree and I do have a goal of running my own small business as a PT with other hired staff, so I do not want to completely leave the field and lose those skills. Also, the teaching/research gig is not busy enough to give me 40 hours of work a week. 

How do I approach this? I know for a fact that where we are located it is going to be hard for them to fill a role and find a good PT. So I know I can leverage saying ""My situation has changed, I really do not want to leave this clinic, but I need to reduce my hours"", I think they would be too scared to have to find a new hire to just fire me. I could also take the approach ""We have a family situation that requires me to be home more so I need to cut my hours down"", and finally ""As you know I've had some health issues in the last year and I need to reduce my hours for the next few months"" (They know I was off for a health reason 12 months ago for a couple of weeks, so I can play on that). 

I just don't know if anyone has been in a situation where they are reducing hours but still staying on ? I don't want to quite, I don't want to be fired, and I don't need them to know that the reason is that I have a better job that I'm going to devote more hours to. 

Any tips? ",HiLiter1234,1,1.0,1,1726580162,2024-09-17 13:36:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fizg1z/how_to_ask_to_reduce_hours_at_my_employer_to_pick/,9,2024
1fizasi,Director wants me to apply for a new position,"I began working for a new company at an entry level position, then I received a promotion about a year in, to a position I had been interested in from the get go. After being in the new position for 2 months, a director from another department approached me to apply for an upcoming position in their department. It's a position that interested me, but I didn't have the experience in that field so I would have never pursued it until now. I politely declined, mostly due to me not wanting to be seen as ""that employee"" that bounces between departments. A few weeks later they approached me again, this time I asked why they think I would be a good fit given I haven't worked in that department and don't have the experience required. They said they watch and listen, and they know I would be a great fit for the position. 

I've never been ""scouted"" for a position before. It's always been me seeking a position and working to get it. My fiance told me to at least request lunch with the director to discuss further, and I am thinking about it now. I feel like I have imposter syndrome. Like I said, I've never been scouted, and I lack confidence to do most things I know I am capable of, due to fear of what others will say/think about me. 

I have a few reservations that I'm hoping someone could offer some advice based on experience or possibly being in a similar situation. 

1) I'm new. I've had two positions in 18 months so how does it look to the company and senior/executive staff if I go for my third position in less than two years? 

2) A coworker expressed to me that they are interested in the position before the director approached me the first time. I asked the director if anyone else internally had feigned interest, and they shrugged it off saying no one worth while. This coworker and I are on good terms, and given I just got the promotion I wanted a few months ago, I feel awful for applying for a position I didn't think about until the director approached, but I also want to keep moving.

I don't know much about the position in terms of whether it is a lateral move or another step on the ladder, but my ultimate goal is to keep climbing, and I somewhat feel like this is my chance to take the next step.

1fiz58z,Getting fired after giving notice ,"I worked 100% remote and began seeking new work locally. I found a brilliant job that's a major step up in my career with decent benefits. I signed the contract and the following week gave my boss my 2 weeks notice, two hours later he fired me. 

I'm currently not working for 3 weeks until I begin my new job, which actually suits me well besides missing two weeks of paychecks and ending on super sour terms with my boss who I worked for 3+ years.
In hindsight my work ethic definitely dropped once I started interviewing for other roles, and I was getting increasingly depressed with my clients giving me shit because of the dysfunction in the company and having to defend the company, but deep down inside I agreed with my clients and had so much sympathy for them. This was my bosses reasoning to fire me, which I accepted. 

I suppose my word of advice is that those two weeks notice are not for you, but for your employer and you should always have your own back and expect that it's always possible your notice period won't be honoured.

1fiyyca,My Sanity is Hanging by a Thread (and Maybe My Job Too),"I hit rock bottom, if you are reading this, 🆂🅾🆂. 

My once enjoyable job has become a daily struggle, and a constant source of stress and frustration.

Dispute the obvious reason to quit, there is a constant sense of fear. The thought that I might end up in a worse  position seems makes me feel like any step forward is an insurmountable challenge. I'm feeling trapped in a cycle of stress-and-burnout searching to find a way to make my current situation more manageable.

A similar patterns happens when I stop thinking about a new job and start applying myself to work. A couple weeks will go by fine until I am triggered by either my boss's incompetence and the constant stream of meaningless tasks and wanting more out of life, my workload because too much to handle that spilled over into my personal life, causing me to neglect my own well-being and relationships.

I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I'm determined to find a way to make my job more tolerable. I'm hoping that someone out there can give me some advice on how to improve my situation or identify a better career path.

1fixv7q,Really don’t like new job/ regret quitting old job,"Hello guys,

Basically what the title says here..

About 6 months ago I accepted a job offer for what seemed to be a good career move plus a 30% salary increase.
I didn’t dislike my old position and was pretty good at it, but I felt it was slowly becoming stale and didn’t see much career growth -as many other colleagues did- I am only pointing that out as my previous company does have a pretty high turnover rate. 
On one hand I believe I indeed could not have much growth in my previous job (position or salary wise) so there is a side of me that feels it was a good move to change, but on the other hand I absolutely hate this new position and company. There is literally nothing to do, expectation bar is so low it is making me feel stupid, what they sold to be a position of ownership with much room for growth blah blah blah could have easily been an intern’s job and I am far away from there.

I have asked to be given more projects, I have asked to be involved more and I recently starting expressing clearly to my manager that this is not what was promised to be. On their end they are somehow happy with me (??) and just tell me that “it will take time to shape this role”

But really having to come to the office every day (no remote option) is mentally draining me. I have had days where all I had to do was print a document.

I am not in my home country so as an expat here (EU country) I feel my chances of finding a new role are a bit lower. I keep applying but I feel as if the market is really tough right now, just getting these straight up automated rejection responses.

No idea what to do and how to cope until I find something better.
I would go back to my old job even with the salary cut- that was not the reason I left in the first place, but they have no openings right now and of course I do feel a bit ashamed to ask them for a job after I left.

Any similar feelings/ experiences?
How would you approach the situation?",purpleglitterpurple,2,1.0,1,1726576035,2024-09-17 12:27:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fixv7q/really_dont_like_new_job_regret_quitting_old_job/,9,2024

I have injury rehab experience, as well as coaching experience. I got my CS degree earlier this year but the market is bananas and I don't have the energy or hope to keep getting rejected right now. I have no hope for the market for tech to be honest.

Now that I got that out of the way, anyone have any insights on nursing vs. physical therapy.

Nursing would be quicker for me in general, and way less expensive. Physical Therapy would be another 3-4 years minimum and leave me in debt for sure.

1fiwbpt,Can you think of a better fit than Backend Dev given my profile ?,"I am a young backend (enterprise) software developer looking for a better fitting niche or career to my strengths & weaknesses. I am approaching this in my characteristic systematic manner.


I would be grateful and appreciate if you experienced people could take a moment of your time to tell me if you know of roles that fit me better given what I'm about to write.

So you understand what I'm talking about clearly, I need to define what I mean by certain things first.

I defined, using my own words : 2 fundamentally distinct decision making methods in problem solving :

- using explicit, clearly defined, systematic rules (knowledge) for a fully _conscious_ judgment.
    
- using intuitive, subconscious and subjective judgment. Which _unconsciously_ works by weighing the decision against the sum of one's past experience and knowledge to arrive at a guess.
    

The first method (I'll call it systematic from now on) often takes more time to arrive at an answer. This is important.

When solving 1 problem and having to make 1 decision, _both_ those methods _often_ get used together. However, importantly, there are decisions where 1 method is better suited than the other, here is how I see it:

- When is the explicit method better : high level of objective rigor demanded AND (required knowledge is already known OR req. knowledge in clear/explicit format is available).
    
- When is the intuitive method better : high level of objective rigor not demanded OR (required knowledge is unknown AND req. knowledge in clear/explicit format is not available.)
    

Additionally, while the systematic method only works with knowledge that is either directly applicable or from which you can derive directly applicable knowledge, the intuitive method can even work without that, just using experiences and tangential knowledge.

---

_Compared to my backend developer colleagues_, including ones with _less_ and ones with _more_ experience than me, I have a higher level of the following :

- using systematic method feels positive and rewarding
    
- innately more skilled in systematic method
    
- innately unskilled in intuitive method (i.e. I'm less likely to arrive at an answer than others using it despite having had the same exact experiences.)
    
- using second method feels negative (tiring, too uncertain, not satisfying, stressful, ...)
    

And that is how my brain works since forever. I can of course apply both methods and I'm someone hardworking, but ultimately, I had to face reality and accept these fundamental strengths and weaknesses.

---

Now, in my current job of enterprise backend SWE, the day-to-day work fits me worse than my colleagues on the dimensions I outlined because:

- Much of the learning and knowledge is of an intuitive nature. It's formed on experience and trying out things as well as vague advice or information _which cannot or should not lead to concrete systematic knowledge (because it's far too specific or vague and so a waste of time)_. This is similar to craftsmanship. This kind of knowledge my brain somehow does not hold on to well and then does not effectively piece together using the intuitive approach either (even compared to less experienced colleagues !).
    
    I also know that experience does not truly change that. This type of intuitive second method learnign is a core recurring feature of the job.
    

---

So my preference is essentially : as high a ratio of systematic method vs intuitive method (learning) as possible.

Examples of very bad fits :

- Artistic endeavours
    
- Craftsmanship
    
- Frontend SWE, from what I have seen
    

Examples of potentially better fit (I'm guessing, I could be wrong !):

- Research (though I'm sure it depends on the type and area) I'd like to see if there are non PhD options however
    
- Technical Writing, maybe QA Testing This fits the preference but I'd like more intellectually challenging roles.
    

---

So, my question to you is, do you know of jobs/ niches/ general ways to make a living that fit my profile as I outlined better than general backend SWE ?

Sorry if this is long and in a mess but I really hope I will get some tips out of this. 

So long story short, for ten years I've been stuck in a relationship that made me freeze my life completely, so now I don't know what to do anymore. 

I was a medical doctor and I got my diploma while I was living outside of the US and worked for a while as a medical doctor. 
I was meaning to move to the US so I was preparing for the test ..but my husband said he wants to move somewhere else so .. I stopped everything and I basically started waiting for him to take a decision for 6 years ( sounds simple but is complicated and he was dragging me over for years with false promises and lies ) 
We ended moving to the US anyway almost 4 years ago... but with a kid... 
In the meantime my University and the Health ministry in my country decided that they won't  communicate with ECFMG anymore because they don't think it's fair for the great brains of my country to be delivered for free to the US ... 
I decided to start preparing for the USMLE anyway and fight the university for that communication when booking for the tests... and my husband agreed.. 
As soon as I started preparing he was not supportive at all and made it about him and then he stopped providing for our family and wanted me to work full time to help him, and also cook clean and raise the child full time without his help ..
He was also cheating so I decided to get seperated from him 
And I started looking for a job and it's hell !!! 
The pay is so low and all I can find is customer service jobs, I don't know where to apply and what to do 
I tried doing a bootcamp to be a data analyst, but after the bootcamp no one would hire me.. I did another as an IT technician and no one would hire me either.. I'm not even getting interviews 
All I get is rejection emails all the time. 
The positions I scored till now are 15 dollars an hour and it doesn't even cover the basic bills ... 
I'm completely lost and I don't understand what's going on .. 
What can I do as a foreign medical graduate in the US ? With two bootcamp certificates in data analysis and IT support and 3 spoken languages? 
Do I go to University and restudy ?
Why am I not getting interviews? I got my resume and cover letter reviewed by professionals 

What should I do to have a livable salary to support myself and my child?

Since acceptance he has been told to stay at the previous location which has now been 6 weeks. He hasn't been able to have his trial period yet and is still at the previous business location as the director is too lazy to start the recruitment process for his replacement.

He has a written agreement to move starting from the 1st of this month as part of the redundancy process.

Since then he has had a disciplinary case against him which he is now fighting, this case started two days after a reminder he should have moved location. The evidence is not factual and is completely inadmissible. 

What options does he have in this situation?

1fitzlz, Is Asking for a $25K Raise and Creative Director Role Justified After Probation?,"Hi Reddit,

I’m looking for some advice on negotiating my position after my probation period. Here’s a bit of background:

I’m a videographer and editor with over 5 years of experience, primarily in high-end agencies, and I also have a side career in broadcast where I’ve directed smaller broadcasts. Recently, I joined a new company as a content creator, and I’m approaching the end of my 3-month probation period.

During my time here, I’ve been part of a marketing team of three and have contributed significantly to the company and its subsidiaries. Here’s a summary of my achievements so far:
- Produced, filmed, and edited major videos for the company and four startup subsidiaries.
- Created and implemented a successful content plan.
- Managed to get the team to follow this content plan effectively.
- Received an appreciation award for content from a charity.
- Designed, scheduled, and managed social media for these companies.
- Advised other departments creatively.
- Recently taken on designing EDMs for the companies.

Given these accomplishments, I’m considering asking for a significant raise of $25K and requesting a promotion to the role of Creative Director. 

Do you think this is a fair ask given my contributions and the added responsibilities I’ve taken on? Any advice on how to approach this conversation or factors I should consider would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",Lonely-Associate4677,1,0.6700000166893005,6,1726562682,2024-09-17 08:44:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fitzlz/is_asking_for_a_25k_raise_and_creative_director/,9,2024

1fisfbn,Torn between wife’s health and new opportunity,"Hi all, I’m asking for some advice regarding a new job opportunity that is going to collide with my wife’s health. For some context, we’re currently struggling financially and have been for about two years now. Rents been paid late, foods been hard to buy and so on… my wife has had some pretty bad health problems going on and will be needing surgery within the next 3-4 months. I just got a job offer making a considerable amount more than I currently do, but would have to do some traveling. I’d be expected to have excellent attendance (which I haven’t had in the past couple years) and would be doing a lot of grinding in the beginning due to the professional nature of this job. If I apply I will be hired on immediately which would be a huge change for our lives financially. Now as stated above, my wife needs surgery in a few months and I would need to take a month or more off in order to take care of her and the kids. Im unsure what to do and what direction to go, I’ve already taken a month off this year at the current job I’m at to take care of her after surgery, I don’t know how I can do it again so soon after getting a new job. We don’t have anyone who is able to help take care of her or the kids after she gets surgery. Should I take the job? Should I stay at the job I’m at and take the month off?

1firzhz,I’m pregnant and potentially being promoted - do I wait to inform my employer?,"About ~1.5 months ago I was informed that I would be recommended for a promotion. I’m about 4 months pregnant and decided to hold off on sharing until the promotion was confirmed.

As of now, it looks like the final decision will be made in a few weeks. 

I would really like to share with my employer asap as I plan to start my leave in about three months and will be out for at least a year.

That said, I want to look out for myself here and not risk the promotion decision. I am worried about how to inform them if I do get promoted, without looking like I was being political / manipulative. 

FWIW this pregnancy has had some complications and I was waiting to be quite sure to communicate so I would’ve waited until about now anyway. Not sure if that’s helpful information to share. 

I should note that the promotion wouldn’t come with additional responsibilities - it’s more to adjust my title and salary to fit my current level of responsibility. 

Would love to get some advice on if it’s better to continue waiting or if I should just inform them now? If I do wait, what is the best way to communicate this that preserves my relationships and goodwill?",unicornsandall,0,0.5,4,1726554690,2024-09-17 06:31:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1firzhz/im_pregnant_and_potentially_being_promoted_do_i/,9,2024
1firxb0,Confused for 2 years and keep self sabotaging - should I try out this PhD?,"Hi so I’m from the UK and graduated with a degree in Chem. since graduating I’ve juggled with two options: doing a PhD or switching to medicine. I’ve never know what I wanted to do, I did chem in undergrad bc I was good at it in school. But during undergrad I never thought I’d work in a lab after but I did enjoy research in my final year to an extent. But after graduating I wanted to switch to med bc the only time I remotely “felt” anything towards a career was when thinking of becoming a doctor. Long story short for two years I worked in a hospital as a care assistant and debated whether to do med or not…some of the reasons that conflicted me was no pay for another 4 years while studying, I’m anxiety prone so worried if I could handle that environment, entrance exams for grad entry and work life balance as a doc. At some point I got tired of going back and forth and told myself that if I’m overthinking this much maybe I am not committed enough. So decided to go full steam with chem career options. I worked as a lab tech which was boring mindless work but I didn’t mind the 9-5 nature and also the people were nice. I got accepted to a PhD which is in a project I’m not that “passionate” about but gives good skills. I’m meant to start next week but the last month I’ve been so anxious about it. I’ve been crying non stop thinking of whether I want to do this. And all do a sudden the last week I can’t stop thinking about med which I hadn’t put my mind on for half a year or more. My friends say that I’m self sabotaging and that I should go and try this PhD out and that I might like it. I’m naturally an anxious over thinker but the way I’ve been so anxious and guttural crying makes me worried I’m making the wrong decision. And now thoughts of med are coming back. But applications are closed for this year so I’ll have to wait till next year if I want to try. I quit my job last week for this PhD and now I feel like I’m making such a mess of my life. Should I try this PhD out? I know it’s not right to go into something that requires a large commitment like PhD half heartedly but I don’t know what to do. I’ve kind of messed things up for myself.

1fiq0sz,How normal is it to be given a promotion without a salary increase? ,"A few colleagues have started to break their silence about being given formal title changes to more senior titles, and an increase in responsibilities. However, allegedly they are being told they will not get a salary increase until they can prove themselves in the role. Some have said they have not seen raises for over 6 months after their ‘promotion’ and doing these increased responsibilities, which baffled me. 

I worry about eventually having the same situation and unsure of how to handle it. For me, this role was already a huge step down in title, pay, PTO, benefits - everything. I took it after being laid off and the job market being horrible. I like what I do but they know of my past experience and still wouldn’t budge on salary when I started so I have had to really be careful to ‘act my wage’ so to speak. I have already been asked to take on a few higher responsibilities outside of my title and pay as it is with ease, so I couldn’t imagine agreeing to a formal title change and official higher responsibilities without a raise immediately. 

I know many will say to take the promotion and look for a new job immediately, but it’s not always as simple as that anymore when the job market is brutal and some people are looking for jobs for years at this point. So then you might end up
stuck in a higher position, for the same pay, for a long time. 

How are people approaching this now days with the above point in mind? Would you turn it down due to no raise? Would you accept but get it in writing to have a raise by X date?

1fippg3,Should I accept new offer?,"I have a dilemma about my work. Whether to take the offer?

I am currently an investment associate at a company. I have been at this job for 2.5 years. The job is about debt deal execution, supporting the entire process from internal approval to contracting. I will touch client relationship management, financial assessment, ESG, green / climate finance, KYC (know your customer), capacity development, legal, mid office. I always describe myself as a spider on the net pulling all strings. I know everything but not in depth because we have specialists who deal with all specific topics. Travel is 1-4 times per year to Southeast Asia. I enjoy it but I don’t see myself doing it forever. It is just because when I becoming the team leader I will need to originate the deals and it is not something I particularly enjoy. 

I got disappointed at work because how I was treated mostly by my manager. I felt he did not acknowledge what I achieved (very huge) and lives in the past and keeps bringing what I should improve to justify why he gave me an okay review. I wanted to get promoted and he thinks I was too rushy. I got disappointed so I looked for new opportunities. I got a job internally at another team. I told him about the interviews because it was an internal requirement. He kept saying one should usually stay in one role for 3-4 years otherwise this person can be perceived restless. 

Anyway, the new job is a more focused role, structured finance associate. I will be working on a risk sharing facility which is a program lasting until 2032 (vs debt is our long term business). I will support deal execution as well but with a narrower focus which is on credit risk of clients, underwriting process of clients. I will also be more technical and structure the deals. I will no longer be the core deal team but just one of the strings being pulled whenever the core team needs me. The relationship management will not lie with me anymore but I will need to negotiate on my own part with the clients. My new manager from hear and say has very positive reviews. New role involved promotion to senior. Travel is at least 6 times per year to four continents. 

I just got married and want to have kids in the coming three years. I don’t know if I should take this offer? I feel insecure about my new offer. 1. Many times of travel per year considering my family plans, short term program (8 years life). 2. more specialist role instead of generalist role, will it pave my future better? 3. If I wait longer will I get promoted? Am I too impulsive just to apply and accept whatever is offer? 

Any advice is helpful. Thank you very much in advance.

1fip54z,Current role expanded ,"
Hi! Earlier this year I had landed an exciting opportunity in an industry and role I had been working hard toward since graduating. The basis of my role was to focus on a singular segment of the market. After successfully meeting the key metrics of the role, I’ve been asked to take on looking at other segments along with the same market. I quickly reached out to my manager to inquire on why this was decided without my knowledge. I later got confirmation from my manager's boss that this was how the role was sold within the organization. This is new information to me. I am very excited for the opportunity; however, upon thinking more deeply about the workload and responsibilities, I will be underpaying myself for the work to be done. What’s the best approach to start the conversation about my compensation structure? I had initially agreed to the new opportunity, but the manager did inform me that if I have any roadblocks, I should reach out.

1fioruj,Switching to finance from a pure maths background,"I hope this question is not too specific for this sub, but it seems career advice posts on r/mathematics are rare.

Hi all. I came from a pure maths background, having a maths UG degree and soon starting my maths + CS masters degree, both in the top 10 universities in the field. Originally, I picked those because I was passionate about the subjects. I am really into theoretical maths - SGA 4.5 is very painful, for those who understand ;). I was top of my cohort and I considered going into academia. However, I have slowly realised that, well, it doesn't pay well. My family and I are barely able to afford the school fee, so it'll be great if I can pay them back before they die you know. So I am considering switching tracks to finance, because it pays very well and is still within my interest, especially the quantitative side.

For more background, the masters degree I am heading into is also very pure mathy, with some CS here and there. There isn't even statistics or probability courses offered directly, though I am allowed to take a few if I apply to the department.

I have a few questions/worries and I hope you all can give some advice, or just general tips.

- I know it sounds very stupid to ask this, but is it too late to switch? As I said, the degree I'm heading into is rather mathy with not much courses closely related to finance. As a result, I don't know where I should obtain and *prove I obtained* those knowledge. Of course I can pick up some book on stochastic calculus and self-study it, and I am quite confident I can digest the material quicker than say my peers, but the question then becomes how do I show it on my CV without my transcript showing anything. I am lacking the ""door-opener"".

- I don't know anything about finance, or economics in general. I do watch the news, but it feels like that kind of economics is different from the ""textbook"" theories lol. I have been watching youtube videos and podcasts the past month trying to absorb as much as I can, am I doing the right thing?

- Somewhat repeating the question above, but my CV currently has nothing to do with finance, apart from two maths cs degree. None of my projects or work experience has been in the field, and my networking in the field is somewhat limited. I am afraid that my CV will be rejected automatically or worse manually. Personally I believe my strength compared to other ""finance bros"" is my cs is also quite strong, both theoretical and in writing code (C++ Rust Python some Java some Haskell, no OCaml). Any advice on how I should highlight that?

- What other general advice do you have for a person in my situation?

I was given two weeks to get everything in order and secure a new job. After reaching out to various contacts, I've boiled my options down to the following three:

Option 1: Go back to my former employer (restaurant management), left on good terms but the job was terrible. Not great pay, but it's something I was good at and would need minimal training.

Option 2: A warehouse gig with a local school district. Not the most promising lead, but I have some contacts that may be able to push my application through. Pay and working conditions unknown.

When I came back almost two years ago, I negotiated my pay at $45/hour plus perks like having certain bills paid by the company. I started as an assistant to my stepfather, and after some years, my current title is COO, so I basically run a huge chunk of daily operations. My job is fairly demanding. 

I thought I worked out something sustainable. However, I am living beyond paycheck to paycheck at this point. My mortgage payment (I got a place in April) is exactly half of my monthly pay (this is the cheapest property I could find, and I moved in order to be able to buy it because I couldn't afford the Bay Area). Almost the entire other half goes to my HOA and essential bills. Again, I understand I could stand to review my budget, but that's not what this post is about.

I feel frustrated to be so stressed about money. I'm effectively underpaid and overworked. The company is usually extremely lucrative, and this year is the first year since 2020 where we have significantly lowered profit margins, due to our industry. So I don't think a raise or bonus is coming. 

Historically, I have been underpaid at this company, and for some years, my stepfather reported me as a contractor when I should have been W-2. There was also financial abuse against me on the personal side, within my family.

The caveat is that the bills that are being paid by the company are a chunk that is not insignificant, so I'm wondering if I need to calculate that and figure out my true hourly pay before determining whether I'm truly underpaid.

This is the least I've ever been paid for a professional job, except for when I was starting out in my early 20s. I believe I should at least be making low six-figures, according to my own past jobs and my former colleagues and peers who have parallel careers.

At the end of the day, I'm having trouble paying my bills. I have good work experience and a college degree. Should I be looking for another job? Or am I just a stressed first-time homeowner?

These are my prime earning years, and I can't even save for retirement, much less pay off my debts. I have $50 in my checking account, and payday is two weeks away, and I haven't done anything but pay for basics in months. This isn't right. 

**What are other 30-something professionals with college degrees getting paid in LA and SF?** Please help me figure out what's normal, so I can figure out what I need to do.

Please be kind. Thank you.",ActualEconomy8371,1,1.0,2,1726539045,2024-09-17 02:10:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fin377/am_i_being_underpaid/,9,2024
1fimt2o,Resigning for Bus Trainee...,"So as the title suggests, I recently got accepted into a traineeship in recruitment day today and eventually they'll hand me a contract I'll have to sign and then resign from my current job.

I'll be paid around £14 an hour during training and will be around 38 hours a week and training takes around 8 weeks and by then should be passed or failed, but the practical can be even sooner, even 3-4 weeks into training...

Once I pass if I do, that is, I'll be sent to a depot and be a full time employee. If I fail, I'll be let go and be unemployed and no job due to resigning from my previous. I could potentially be jobless within 4 weeks if I fail the practical driving test or even theory.

I should note that I'm 90% sure this new manager of mine in my current job is aching to fail my probation of 3 months but is keeping me until the end due to workload being high this time of year.

Is it worth leaving my £27K job for this opportunity? knowing it could all fail and I'll be jobless?

My bills are around £1,470 (including rent etc) and have around £5,000 saved.

1fiksal,Will I be fire after 6 months?,"I started working at a law firm two months ago, and last Friday was the end of my probation period. Afterward, I signed a labor contract, but it’s only for six months, meaning my employment could end in March 2025. The reason given was that the firm wanted more time to observe and evaluate my performance. They mentioned that while I was doing okay, several mistakes I made led them to offer just a six-month contract. Specifically, I made some errors, wasn’t careful enough, missed deadlines without informing my seniors in time to request extensions, and didn’t proactively ask for more tasks when I was available.

Although I agree with most of their feedback, I don’t think the last point was entirely fair. I felt I had enough work, and I prefer to focus on completing my tasks well—quality over quantity. Nevertheless, HR suggested I should ask for more work during the next six months.

My concern is that the firm has two office locations, and I sit at location 1. If I’m to ask for more tasks, I’ll need to contact seniors at location 2, but I’ve never met them, and I only have their phone numbers and emails. I’m also worried that if I don’t perform well enough, it could lead to a poor review, worsening my situation

Everything seems to be data and tech right now and I'm sure it's only going to rise over the years, which is why I need some career advice. Is it worth it to get my masters degree in computer science, since it's a broad area and l'd be able to apply it to many fields, or should I do something more specialized like bioinformatics or data analytics? I've also heard that bioinformatics is on the come-up and I wouldn't be throwing away my biology background, but at the same time I'm assuming jobs are more limited...right?
Also, the pay seems to be much better in anything data/tech related as opposed to biology, which can take years to get higher pay.

If I want job stability and good pay, I'm better off getting my masters in computer science or bioinformatics (which is basically just data science with a concentration in science data, right?) or data analytics, what do you guys think?
Or am I better off getting my masters in genetics or microbiology, and just staying on the science side of things. I don't really want to work in a wet lab and I want to be able to work remotely if allowed, which is why I'm leaning towards comp-sci.

1fija2m,Need help deciding between two job offers!! ,"I have a background in IO psychology and received two job offers coming out of grad school. Neither of the jobs are what I dreamed of but both are related to my field of study and are a good start for gaining experience 

Job 1: City job, I only had one interview with the team and they seemed overall friendly and excited when they offered me a job. I am not overly enthusiastic about the work but think I will be good at it! 

Schedule 9:80, mostly remote but an hour commute 1 day a week, pay: 87k, free health care. But I am not allowed to take any vacation time for a whole year (this is alarming for me- is this normal?)

Job 2: Non profit organizational consulting. I cried after my first interview because my potential boss kept grilling me with follow-up questions. I continued to interview for this company and overall had a positive experience in the second round. I think there is more opportunity to learn here but throughout the process I’ve gotten red class from my potential boss. I also think this job could align more with what I want to eventually do in the future.

Schedule: In person 5-days a week, would require a move (however I have lived in this location before and loved it), pay: 72k, 21 days of PTO, can use 5 days right away

1fij2yq,CS Career Advice (Stuck in the dreaded Powerapps / MS environment).,"

I have been working on a project at my company for the past few months. I am not the main developer and actually was thrown into the project because the main developer was struggling to work on the app herself.

Recently I have been forced to work on the project alone because our manager decided that her time would be best spent on other projects (she also has not been able to access the project herself because the app the project entails is too large for her computer to load at her point.) In the call where I was being told I would have to work on the project by myself, I expressed that I felt uncomfortable taking the lead, but I was just told to try my best.

The app went into UAT a few weeks ago and I received a large list of enhancements and bugs to fix. As I try to go through her code, it just obstacle after obstacle where I have to go on a goose hunt to understand where all the variables are and how the code works. (This is in Power apps btw, where all the code is in each screen control and not on a simple files). The enhancements are due next week, but I only finished a quarter of the enhancements so far. I keep getting told that the code is ""**simple, I just need to look at it**"", but it's not. Each piece of code has so many dependencies on other pieces of code that I am never told/informed of. (I have to give estimates as to how long it will take, and when I come across these, my time estimate from before is no longer accurate).

When I read the enhancements, I am being told what the original requirements and the new modified requirements are, but the already existing code doesn't even match the original requirements in the first place. I just keep coming across obstacle after obstacle and it's just frustrating for me to the point where I sit at my desk and work on everything else to avoid working on this. I'm really angry that she wrote code that is so fragmented and spread out, and yet has the gall to say, ""it's simple, just look at it"". (I don't express my anger at work btw, this is the first project where someone really bothers me).

I'm pretty burnt out and at a point where I have considered resigning numerous times over this project solely. I wake up every morning and feel dread on having to deal with this. The documentation for this project is garbage and I keep getting new task after task, but due to my burn out, I am not really in a state where I have the mental capacity to work on anything. I used to have hobbies where I would work on personal projects or go to the gym, but I am so burnt out that I don't do anything. I have a back injury, and I have been putting off taking time off from work because of this project's looming deadlines.

The company I work at is pretty nice and the management is actually really nice and supportive, but I just feel for this specific project, I am being really let down. All my previous projects, I had a 5/5 experience.

Now here is why I am personally stuck. I have a gig lined up elsewhere that is my dream job in the research field; so, I am not stuck here forever thankfully. However, I am waiting for clearance for that job (it's been almost 5 months, but I have been told it's an estimated 6-12 months) and I confident that my current boss will be interviewed about me. In the mean while I just have to pay my bills and survive.

Any advice on how to handle my situation?  
What do I do?  
Can I ask to no longer work with her on future projects? (Am I shooting myself in the foot with this?)

1fiiblg,Following My Head or My Heart?,"Hi all,

  
I'm currently in a head vs heart situation with changing careers where I'd really like some unbiased opinions on, or new perspectives that I haven't yet considered. I'm 23 years old and have been working in the film/video game studios industry doing production management/events as a coordinator-level employee of said studios. Recently, I've been looking to leave my current company due to a long commute, increasing RTO days, and general dissatisfaction with my job duties (I have a film degree and most of my current work stems from corporate event production). 

I had two interviews with a large studio and the received an offer to join their TV show as a coordinator. The whole process moved incredibly fast, and in all honesty, I don't think I preformed very well in the interviews, in my opinion bombing a technical exam. It's an extra day in office than my current job, but closer to home (although some days it may honestly be the same amount of travel time with the traffic), but most of all, it's a pay cut. While both my current role and this new role are hourly, I would be losing out on approx. $7,000 annually by taking the new role. I don't doubt the hiring team's decision to offer my the role, but it's always a scary thought to take the leap into something you may not excel in, as while I don't like my current role in event production, I know I'm good at it. 

  
My question is this. Do I chase my dreams of working in TV production and accept the role/pay cut/increased RTO? Or do I stay at my current role, where a promotion and pay increase may be on the horizon in the coming months?  The manager on my team pulled me aside last week to put the idea of a promotion in my head and getting me on a plan to work towards it. While I haven't had time to discuss with my direct manager, I believe her when she says a promotion is possible in the coming months. 

I don't want to have any regrets, but don't want to shoot myself in the foot in the current state of the economy. ",sokkerogsokker,1,1.0,0,1726526398,2024-09-16 22:39:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fiiblg/following_my_head_or_my_heart/,9,2024

In June my manager said ""I am not giving you full raise because forthcoming months, your schedule is very inflexible and tight (it was because of studies)


though I agree, but its common sense that **any promotion is based on your progress of previous months not on upcoming “forthcoming” months**. That's what promotion is. you do good job, you get promotion, you don't do good, you get partial raise.



anyways, now that July and August are over and I am full time, she is giving me day and night shifts altogether day after day, without any raise. Its ironic she said I was inflexible and hence partial raise but now she is putting me day and nights consecutively without any raise. I’m Pretty flexible with scheduling.



I’m new to careers (I’m 22 male) so i need to know how can I bring this up. Please advise. I’ve been told I am one of the best employees by various leaders. And I do more work than some people who have higher position than me, (I have OCPD, I’m workaholic), So I know my worth and know I need full raise before December comes as December is when our next raise would be.


Since I’m new to this, please advise me how to bring this up. I will do whatever you guys advise me.

1fihmtf,Confused for 2 years…should I start this PhD?,"Hi so I’m from the UK and graduated with a degree in Chem. since graduating I’ve juggled with two options: doing a PhD or switching to medicine. I’ve never know what I wanted to do, I did chem in undergrad bc I was good at it in school. But during undergrad I never thought I’d work in a lab after but I did enjoy research in my final year to an extent. But after graduating I wanted to switch to med bc the only time I remotely “felt” anything towards a career was when thinking of becoming a doctor. Long story short for two years I worked in a hospital as a care assistant and debated whether to do med or not…some of the reasons that conflicted me was no pay for another 4 years while studying, I’m anxiety prone so worried if I could handle that environment, entrance exams for grad entry and work life balance as a doc. At some point I got tired of going back and forth and told myself that if I’m overthinking this much maybe I am not committed enough. So decided to go full steam with chem career options. I worked as a lab tech which was boring mindless work but I didn’t mind the 9-5 nature and also the people were nice. I got accepted to a PhD which is in a project I’m not that “passionate” about but gives good skills. I’m meant to start next week but the last month I’ve been so anxious about it. I’ve been crying non stop thinking of whether I want to do this. And all do a sudden the last week I can’t stop thinking about med which I hadn’t put my mind on for half a year or more. My friends say that I’m self sabotaging and that I should go and try this PhD out and that I might like it. I’m naturally an anxious over thinker but the way I’ve been so anxious and guttural crying makes me worried I’m making the wrong decision. And now thoughts of med are coming back. But applications are closed for this year so I’ll have to wait till next year if I want to try. I quit my job last week for this PhD and now I feel like I’m making such a mess of my life. Should I try this PhD out? And if im still thinking about med then leave? I know it’s not right to go into something that requires a large commitment like PhD half heartedly but I don’t know what to do. I’ve kind of messed things up for myself.

1fihbh4,Sitting down with CEO after I got refused a promotion.,"I got denied a promotion that normally would have been a sealed deal. After the internal interviews I found out a team member with less experience and management skills got the promotion. 

I told them I was very disappointed but left on holiday the same day. 

Ceo sent me a message to tell me that she wanted to have a chat, about potential upcoming roles. Or if there are any trainings that could help me prepare for a next promotion.

Later I found out from different managers that the person who got my role would have been made redundant if I would have gotten the role. As part of her role is now included in the promotion. To me this ofcourse feels like it was all planned. There will be another opening of 2 tiers higher than where I am now but im not feeling this going to go my way.

Tomorrow I have a chat with my CEO, I'm not sure what my do's or don'ts will be for that.

I am prepared to leave the company if nothing comes out of it, but my contract is also up for renewal next month so can't be too harsh.

Any advice?",Gillas,995,0.9599999785423279,216,1726523942,2024-09-16 21:59:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fihbh4/sitting_down_with_ceo_after_i_got_refused_a/,9,2024
1figfr3,Engineering/Tech Career is my Biggest Life Mistake…Awful Lifestyle…Planning an Escape,"I am 28 years old with a Masters in Data Science and make 140K at an engineering company. I have a few years of experience and have come in contact with a myriad of engineers and techies of different backgrounds who are very disillusioned with the career, including myself.

Many of them are heading for the exit signs and hoping a JD, MBA, or some other Hail Mary career pivot will be their ticket out. I’d say there are two major causes of this malaise: the decline of the engineering job market and, more interestingly, the declining lifestyle of being an engineer. 

The job market for engineering and tech is drying up. Wages are stagnating or down, layoffs or threat of layoffs loom across the industry, outsourcing is abundant, and hundreds of job applications go unanswered. Our company interns are staying in school an extra year upon graduation due to the poor job market, and are opting for MBAs or Engineering Management grad degrees.

The main complaint I hear, and the one I share myself, is the declining lifestyle of being an engineer. Return to office has ruined career mobility and flexibility. Sitting in cubicles and performing hard tasks with autistic and depressed coworkers isn’t a great work environment. The workplace environment in general is poor. 

Colleagues and friends who have made their escape, usually via MBAs, are very happy with their choice. They are working cushy business side jobs in great cities and hanging out with young, well adjusted, happy coworkers. After a promotion or two, they are eclipsing once impressive engineering salaries. 

My favorite example is an ex-engineer coworker who once had an ugly girlfriend and worked at a defense company in Bumfuck, AZ. He now lives in Nashville with a Korean model girlfriend and works a cushy job as a “product manager”. A group of colleagues from my previous research and development job got MBAs and are now work at a venture capital firm on the beach in Miami and are loving life. 

I would have never said this 5 years ago, but I plan on making this exit and getting a part time, employer paid for MBA as soon as possible so I don’t waste any more of my youth in this field and lifestyle. Overall, I’d say going down this career path has been a major mistake.

Thoughts?

1figetj,Stuck in high paying job,"I’ll try keep this as briefly as I can but I am looking for some career advice.  I don’t have any real qualifications – just your basic high school grades. Not even ‘Highers’. I’ve mostly worked lower grade jobs my whole life. My last job previous to my current one involved shift and weekend working including nightshifts – which benefitted me from a salary POV as I always earned an extra 15-20% of my yearly salary on top of my basic salary which was great, so in essence what I was earning each year was that of a couple of grades higher – but it was a dead end job and after almost 6 years I was at my wits end with it for various reasons, so I wanted to look for something new.

After throwing in applications all over the place for higher paying, higher graded jobs I appear to had struck gold. I somehow sailed through an interview for a post that was approx. 35% pay increase on my basic yearly salary, with normal working hours and zero weekend work and a generous annual leave entitlement on top to boot. This job has given me an opportunity at a higher job grade that I always had wanted. I’ve been here for 2 years. I still have imposter syndrome and to some extent have zero idea what I am doing day-to-day.

I have never quite ‘got’ or fully understood what I am supposed to be doing but I plod along and very much ‘fake it’ at times. I have regular catch ups with my manager and annual reviews twice and both of those have gone well, with good feedback and reports. I think I am fairly well liked by my manager and those above my manager, but I suppose you never do really know. They could probably get rid of me at any stage fairly easily, if they wanted.

You are probably thinking this sounds great, and to be fair it probably is compared to some jobs out there. However, because of the nature of the industry, and the difficulty of any actual work that I may or may not know what I am doing with – I am already feeling like it is time to move on and I’m pretty unhappy, part of that is due to the nature of the industry, part of that is due to my own self-doubt and I think it’s fair to say slight incompetence at the role. I do believe they could get someone better than me, fairly easily to be honest. I don’t like the full-on responsibility I have. I’d much rather go in to work – follow my list of tasks, go home. Unfortunately, this role doesn’t work like that and every day is an ad hoc nightmare. I feel pretty out of my depth and uncomfortable almost daily.

The issue I now have is, assuming I try to move on– I probably won’t get paid anywhere near as much elsewhere. I basically won the lottery to an extent with my current role. I suspect the role is paid so well, because they know I wouldn’t get as much elsewhere so I am basically trapped in their eyes if that makes sense. Similar roles to mine out there don’t get anywhere near as much as what I get. I don’t have the qualifications to walk into other similar paying roles in different industries or subject areas. I have two years’ worth of experience in my current role now which I guess stands me in good stead a bit but with the vast majority of other similar paying roles out there requiring qualifications I feel pretty stuck. Doing these qualifications is not something I want to do; it will cost me financially and with time – something I don’t have for varying reasons.

In reality, I could probably take a small wage cut of 5-10% and live comfortably, and pay off bills and any debt.  Maybe that’s an option, in that I could drop down a grade and find a happy middle ground so to speak – but even looking around at other jobs, there really isn’t much out there at the minute.

I am pretty deflated at the minute, and whilst I realise things could be a lot worse and I am fairly proud of how far I’ve come, I think I’ve probably taken a step too far out of my comfort zone. I don’t want the stress, mental exhaustion or uncertainty that surrounds me in my current role. I’d much rather be happier and feel more confident. Although, the pay is too good. Any advice would be appreciated.",ShankyMcShankerson,3,0.6700000166893005,1,1726521784,2024-09-16 21:23:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1figetj/stuck_in_high_paying_job/,9,2024

1fig4xj,Career Advice (Physics),"Some background info: I got my B.S. in Astrophysics in the summer of 2023. My main goal is to go to grad school for physics, but since my GPA was around 2.8, I thought it would be better to get some experience before applying to grad school. As such, I got a job as a 4th and 5th grade science teacher for the 23-24 school year (this job required no certification). Unfortunately, I was laid off and am now faced with the following questions I need advice for:

1) Should I stick with teaching, since I already have experience, and get certified? The problem with this is that I would have to take a 400 hour course for the certification while also working, meaning that I would have to put off grad school for another 2 years. Alternatively, what other areas can I find jobs in with my degree?

OR

2) Should I dedicate this entire year to apply to grad school? With my low GPA, I know it would be quite hard to be accepted, so I could take the GRE to boost my chances. I also know of some post baccalaureate programs in my field that I could look into. But my question is: would it be bad for potential interviews if I didn't do anything  (besides applications) between my last job and the potential interview?

I have a couple videos of me giving these trainings as coworkers would record them and save them for future reference. I planned to post a couple clips of my program to LinkedIn to help me on my search for a new sales position while currently biding my time here.

1fieyzd,How to ask for more money tomorrow in my performance review when they give a pay rise ,"Tomorrow is my annual performance review for my job as a mid-level web developer for a web based agency company of around 100-120. Last year we had to come up with targets for the next 12 months, so tomorrow will be a review on my performance of those targets (targets include personal development and team work, collaboration, leadership, ownership,etc.

From what I gather, we are getting a pay rise, as 2 people in my team have already had their review. I asked the first one discreetly if they got a pay rise and they said yes, but didn't say how much. Nor do I know her current salary.

I also asked a guy who had his review and he said yes also, but in addition told me he got 1k salary (£).

My manager is working his way through the team and mine is tomorrow. I'm currently the leader of a smaller team within our team, and have more responsibilities. I foresee all client work, scope out the task, assign it to weekly workload, do code reviews, implement best practices in coding, look at ways to improve client revenue through optimization of their site, etc. 
I've been doing this new leadership role since the beginning of the year when we set up these targets and my boss said me taking on this new role will be a big step to my promotion.

I have been working on a promotion this review to a senior web developer. But I have a feeling that won't happen. I did a few slip-ups and I think my manager is going to say tomorrow that I didn't get the promotion (it's not like if someone else gets the job I won't. It's simply down to my own performance). I think I will lack the technical side of things to get it.

While I don't think I will get the promotion (that will come with a pay rise) I still think we're all getting pay rises regardless (just that a promotion would have been a bigger one). I suspect this pay rise will just be one for inflation. 

My question is, tomorrow if in the meeting he says ""you didn't get the promotion as we feel you're not ready, we still want to give you a pay rise of £1,000"".. how can I say politely say ""I feel I deserve more"" since I've been the leadership the team lacks for the last 2 years prior to me taking on the role. 

I have a list of achievements I have done, which include search engine optimization (40% to 80%), improvement on our CMS that our clients use, even internal training within the team, presentations etc. 

I want to ask for around 3k rise but I fear they will laugh and say no that's only if you got the senior position. But I don't think 1k is that much. 

I've read online to consider how much you're worth, find out what other jobs are offering, etc. but no tells you exactly how you should phrase these things. How to execute myself, how to push but not be arrogant.

Now that this lease is expiring in November, I am grappling with moving back in with my parents and commuting (driving) 1-1.5 hours each way to avoid spending so much in rent. This would only be for approx 6 months until my contract ends.

I have spoken with my manager about working online 2-3 days a week, and he dragged his feet. If he does end up agreeing I will be ending the lease and doing the commute 100% but for purposes of this conversation let’s say I would need to do 5 days in person a week

There is an expensive toll highway (407 etr) connecting these cities which would shave off 30 minutes each way at the cost of ~27 dollars each way, which I may or may not choose to take

With gas and the toll road considered I stand to save well over 1400$ a month

1ficlrb,New hire supervisor is trying to get me fired for no reason,"I'm a professional, competent, confident and capable person. The new supervisor constantly acts like she is overwhelmed. Whenever I talk to her, she acts irritated, and after awhile will start making minor remarks, saying that I've done this or that wrong. Although, in reality, I may have had nothing to do with what she's talking about, or it was clearly another department that was responsible for the mistake, or I'm simply following directions of other supervisors. 

Occasionally I'll have an issue, where I'm required to contact her to resolve it. And even more occasionally, it'll be a major problem that shouldn't have happened. But a confident, healthy person would normally be able to resolve these problems, even if they're a little bigger than the normal stuff.

The second time this happened, I honestly irritated with her because of this prior accusation and I could tell it was going to again.

Yesterday it happened for the third time. This time, the customer ended up yelling at her because she refused to listen to what I said and instead tried to pick a fight with the customer. Afterwards, she actually THANKED me for ""pushing her about it."" 

I was written up the second time this happened, and management refused to acknowledge or listen to anything I said. 

I guess I'm just venting, and also seeing if anybody has any advice. I do have a plan currently. I'm going to be leaving the company, because I don't think she's going to stop until she gets me fired. She's blatantly lying about me. I'm considering suing her for defamation but from what I've read, that's not easy to prove in court. Either way, I think I need to leave the company. I'm planning on moving, so I might end up getting rehired after I move, in a different city. But for the time being, I think I should just get a diff job.  I'd rather have them on my resume as a friendly previous employer, rather than an employer who fired me for shouting (which I never did. In fact I was very neutral, serene, and... just, normal.)",Idkawesome,2,0.75,2,1726512694,2024-09-16 18:51:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ficlrb/new_hire_supervisor_is_trying_to_get_me_fired_for/,9,2024
1ficg3k,Need Advice on Pursuing a Master’s in CSE,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in my 7th semester of engineering in Electronics and Telecommunication (EnTC) with a CGPA of 8.47 (for 6 semesters). I’m planning to pursue a Master’s in Computer Science (CSE) from top institutions. I would appreciate any advice from those who have experience in applying or have already gone through the process.


Here’s a bit more about my background:

1. Academic Background: EnTC engineering student from a tier-3 Institute, CGPA: 8.47 so far.


2. Current Focus: Securing Placements.


3. Experience: Completed internships in data analytics and machine learning, but I don’t have any published research papers yet.


4. Recommendation Letters: I have a professor who is willing to write me an LoR.

5. No extracurriculars because my college never encouraged it. 


What I need advice on:

Should I consider working for 2-3 years and then apply for masters? 

Should I focus on placements or MS applications? 

How important is having research papers published for top-tier university applications?

Any tips on improving my profile in the final year to increase my chances of getting into top schools?

Best way to structure a strong SoP (Statement of Purpose)?

Should I focus on gaining more practical experience (internships, projects) or publishing research papers at this stage?

Thank you in advance for any help! I’d love to hear your experiences and suggestions.

I was just given an offer from a great company that I plan on accepting. However, I’m currently working in fast food and there has been a lot of drama in the workplace, and I recently got into an argument with a problematic coworker who has issues with other coworkers as well.

I am nervous to tell my coworkers what company I am going to be working with out of fear that my manager (with a history of being petty) or the problematic coworker will reach out to my new company’s HR team and sabotage my offer.

I’m also nervous they will try to find me on LinkedIn to do the same thing.

Is this a valid fear? Would they get anywhere? Or am I just being way too paranoid? I really want this job and to get out of food service.",La_Bomba_,1,1.0,3,1726511394,2024-09-16 18:29:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fic2fm/offer_extended_fearing_sabotage/,9,2024

1fiba7v,Trying to figure out what's next (engineering / software based career),"For background, I'm mid 20s with a bachelor in computer science. 

As far as where I've worked: 
Between internships, contract positions, and full-time salaried roles, I've worked in IT helpdesk, software engineering, system engineering, now at a data analyst role. I'm hybrid working in the defense industry with good WLB.

I've been thinking about a master's in electrical and computer engineering (paid for by work) but I know that's quite a pivot so I'm not 100% on that yet. My alternatives that interest me would be going into data engineering or cloud engineering (not sure how saturated either is though). I'm also not sure if AI will actually replace these types of roles or just reduce potential opportunities (if existing employees could  count as 2 in 1 employees with AI support). 

Industries I'm interested in would be doing defense work or working at aerospace companies (Blue origin, NASA, SpaceX, etc). The only thing is, not sure what I'd actually want to do if I had the opportunity to work at one of those aerospace companies. 

Not sure what I'd want to do. Curious if anyone else found themselves in the same sort of situation. I know I can grow further in my career at my company, just a matter of what role I want to grow into (tech/engineering).

As a therapist I have been very traditionally successful, I'm fully licensed and run a solo practice. 

I have many soft skills that I think could eventually translate to other roles, and I am willing to take a significant pay cut just to get out. My issues are:

  
1) creating a resume or cover letter that people will actually look at and take seriously

2) how to provide an explanation of why I would have this successful career that many people dream of and walk away from it entirely. The truthful answer is ""I would rather lay in traffic and scream than conduct another therapy session"" but obviously that isn't the kind of response that gets your foot in the door somewhere else.

1fiaczl,Career change: help me pick a path that’s right for me.,"26M planning a career change. I’ll preface this by saying that this is not about finding “a job” but about finding “the job”, something I can progress in for life. Hence, I’m willing to put as much work in as it takes in order to transition. I’m currently at a point where I’m ready to quit my job and dedicate a couple years to getting a whole new education, if needed.

Im somewhat lost in what is “right” for me, and my brain hurts from all the thinking. Hoping I can get some ideas from here. So, let me share what I’m looking for in a career, what I’m doing right now,  what I’m good / bad at, and what I’m considering, in that order.

What am I looking for in a career? 
So, my biggest passion is traveling, like long adventure type travel. The passion didn’t pass with years, so I know that whatever job I chose, it should either have potential to be fully remote with flexible hours, or to allow for longer uninterrupted leaves (seasonal and such).
I also live in a HCOL city, and I would really hope to build my family here. I’ve lived all over the world, and there’s no place better than this for me. But it also means that I need to be able to make really good money. Six figures is pretty much an entry level requirement in this place.
I also want the job to be interesting and/or fulfilling. I’m not much of a creative, and not too good with fixing what’s not broken. But with a clear objective, I get the things done quite great, and I find ways to make things better / more efficient. I’m also a very quick learner, I have pretty terrific communication skills, and I’m quite bright (or that’s what I’ve been told haha). I’m also able bodied and strong, and I don’t mind a dangerous / difficult job if it comes to that.

What I do now? 
I’m a business marketing major and I work as a Senior SEO guy (search engine optimization) at an agency. You can see how it was a good idea to begin with (fully remote, potential to start a business eventually). However, turns out marketing isn’t as profitable for most folks. And I’m certainly “most folks” here, as I have virtually zero interest in the industry. Turned out I’m not a very “businessy” guy, I just don’t think in these terms. Not much of a self-starter either (see “fixing what’s not broken”), hence why I’m having a hard time coming up with a business of my own. And on a personal level, I somewhat despise marketing as a concept, even though I understand its necessity and respect the grind. So, the folks who actually love what they do have a noticeable leg up over me. They live and breathe commerce, and I’m starting to fall behind.
I too want to do something that would be interesting to me.
I also used to build websites on visual platforms (WP, Webflow), know the basic HTML & CSS, and a tad bit of JS. I also worked construction.

What am I good & bad at?
Good:
Coaching, communication, leadership, optimizing efficiencies. Delegating and creating processes. I can get hyper-focused (adhd), and get shit done incredibly quick and fast if I’m interested. Same for learning new things, especially if I can visualize them. I can write alright, but it takes me too long to build a career around it, but it helps indirectly in other things. I’m quite able with my hands too, and I don’t mind rough environments, to an extent. I’m fairly comfy with both the digital and the physical realms, and I have a bazillion of random skills, albeit I’m most certainly a master of none.
Bad:
Can’t start at a blank page for the life of mine, not much of a creative. I never have ideas on what I “want” to create from scratch, I don’t even know what it could feel like. I somewhat suck at numbers, and I get lost in large datasets. If I can’t visually imagine something I absolutely can’t remember it. I NEED to intricately understand how each system works if I want to remember it. And I never remember numbers, just the concepts. Also, multitasking breaks my flow (adhd). And I also pretty much require a clear task at hand to function well. Idk why but sales didn’t work out too well for me, even though I had high hopes for it due to my comm skills.

So, what am I considering?
I’m two steps away from enrolling in a maritime school, so that in 3 years I can become a deck officer on a cargo ship. Month on month off schedule, so ample time for travel. And pays quite well. A good use of my organizational & people skills, as well as of my physical ability. And I love the sea, I sail recreationally. 
However, it’s a scary choice given the strain in might put on my family in the future (half a year spent at sea), and the possible health consequences. I’m quite serious about being a good husband and a father. Besides, it does seem like a transient job, where folks eventually want out for the reasons stated above. And I’d hate to start again at square one a decade later.

Another option I’m considering is quite obvious, and it’s Software Development. Fully remote and pays a ton. I have some limited experience with coding & programming, and I guess a couple years of studying it full time could do the trick for me. But I’m a bit scared that I might get lost in all the data as I get into the nitty gritty. I suck at remembering things that I can’t visualize. And if it ever gets boring for me, it will be torture. Although it seems like it can be a fun job at times, at least from the words of my friends who are building something cool or solve problems.

Really hoping that there are more careers out there that I just never knew could be done remotely, paid well, or existed at all. Any input is welcome. Sorry for the long post, and thanks everyone!",Significant_Neck2008,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1726507199,2024-09-16 17:19:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fiaczl/career_change_help_me_pick_a_path_thats_right_for/,9,2024
1fia3d0,Med student but doesn’t want to be a doctor - any advice? ,"Hello, thanks in advance! 

I am currently 22 years old based in the UK. I am nearly finished with medical school but realised it wasn’t for me and decided to take the year out to do my masters. I achieved a BSc last year in medical sciences with management, doing an MSc in biotech and pharmaceutical management this year and then will go back to university to complete the last 2 years of medical school and come out with my medical degree. I really do not want to be a doctor, and also I would like to leave the UK and go to the US, places like New York etc.

Not too sure what to focus on or how to make the best use of the next four years.

1fi9msb,Need Advice on Job Decision: Stick with Current Role or Take New Opportunity?,"Hey everyone, I could use some advice on a job decision I'm facing. Here’s the situation:

I’m currently working part-time **(24 hours per week)** at my job where I earn **$25 an hour.** There’s a chance for me to move into a **full-time position** within the next 4-5 months (not guaranteed but there's a good possibility), which would pay **$35** per hour for 35 hours a week. I’ve been in this role for a while and am comfortable with the team and responsibilities, so there's some security here.

However, I’ve also applied for a full-time position in a different department that pays **$33** per hour for 35 hours a week. I’ve made it to the interview stage (to start immediately if I get it), and now I’m weighing the pros and cons of sticking with my current role, where there’s potential for a pay bump, or making the move to a new department and environment.

Both positions (when it's full time) offer the same benefits, and I’m having a hard time deciding. Should I stay and wait for the full-time role in my current position or take the leap into the new opportunity? What would you do in this situation?

1fi9eg0,"Weird CV, bit lost, looking for some help","Hi everyone, first time posting here. I have such a weird CV, and I don’t know what to do next with my career. 

Education:
I just finished a PhD in History. I wanted to be a professor but not so sure any more. I’m living in France and the situation in academia isn’t great and I don’t want to change countries. 

While I was studying, I had two main jobs (I worked full time) and some freelance work. First job, at a Bank, was HR related. Lots of excel work. Second job was at a Law Firm, as a bit like a paralegal. They closed down last year and as part of the process of closing down they offered to pay for a Master in Finance for me. That will start, part-time, in a month. I chose a flexible degree so I can work and study at the same time. 

My freelance work has been quite good. I’ve done quite a bit of translation, I’ve edited some books and I built this crazy VBA tool for a lawyer which was quite a profitable project. I bought a flat in Paris and I’m happy where I am. 

As you can see, I have many skills and currently no direction. 

I’d like to work for myself, as an independent or by starting a company. Immediately money isn’t a problem, my expenses are covered for a good two years or so and my independent work will continue. 

Basically, I’m having a big think about my next steps. I’m 27. No girlfriend, no kids yet. So I figure, if there was a time to take a risk, it’s now. With my weird CV, I’m not sure what to do.  

Also, I’m fluent in French.

1fi96ti,I made a mistake ,"I graduated from college in May ‘23 and moved back home, which luckily and unluckily is NYC. I initially had the inkling to go to law school so after I spent the greater part of my last free summer at home collecting dust, I started studying for the LSAT and interning in music on the weekdays and nannying and applying to jobs on the weekends. 

Before I got my LSAT results back, which were subpar, I ended up getting a job in the mailroom at a talent agency and started in January of this year.

While interviewing for the agency I was interviewing for another company (job 2) that I felt I wanted more and would allow me to start fresh in a new avenue of the industry. (I had interned at an agency prior and wanted to get involved in production). They however went with another candidate and offered to freelance me, to which I opted for the full time job at the agency. 

I loved the agency, I am unfortunately as you would say addicted to the grind. I don’t mind staying late, I like to do more and I feed off pressure. My time in the mailroom was brief as I was quickly promoted, however things went south as soon as I was.  

The department was in desperate need of organizational overhaul, however one of the team members needed to be fired which shifted everyone else’s workload. My boss was never in office, didn’t communicate with me, and essentially required I read her mind. 

As I began to felt like there was no end in sight, job 2 reached back out. I think needing to know what it would’ve been like was my downfall. I essentially up and left despite never really communicating my needs to anyone. 

Job #2 is actually purgatory, and I feel like I’m in Montessori school or something. I am back in a development role, which despite my age is emotionally taxing, and I have spent the last year proving myself to different people. Since starting at this company in July, I still have no clue what people actually are doing. No one is friendly, no one cares, I actually don’t think anyone works. 4:30 rolls around and they’re sitting and waiting for the clock to strike 5 so they can leave. There’s a certain career track in the office that I have been castaway from, but actually does things. The things, however, require skills I would’ve needed to develop years ago to be on an even playing field with the people around my age. The other path I know I would need to leave within a year.  Also one of the partners can’t stand me, so I feel extremely job insecure and like I am doing everything wrong. 
They’re also not good about giving me additional responsibility that has anything to do with development, either.  They did give me 40 pages of notes to study though? No one has asked me about anything in it? Prior internships I have had have been like, here’s this excel sheet! fix it. or here’s this random computer task that’s tedious, will give you some background info, but require no skill, or something of the sorts. My tasks, for reference I’m a 23 year old girl with zero upper body strength. I am athletic in that I run, but I have to usually pick up everyone’s lunch, or 50lb bags. It’s bizarre. My office had me refinishing furniture the other day… and I got in trouble because I shouldn’t have sanded the surface down… it was rusty metal…… 

I am still very close with everyone at the agency, however, due to my departure, there’s likely no space for me unless I get super lucky. I also don’t want to encounter my former boss. They’re mentioning a position to me for someone they work closely to and i would be a good fit for. 
However, I don’t want to just leave, especially because it hasn’t been 3 months but I don’t want to miss out on this opportunity now that I feel weird abt a choppy resume. 

I know I made the wrong decision and shouldn’t be here, but for the sake of my future, is this something I just ride out until I make it to a year? This is something I definitely regret, but I am looking at it as a lesson about decision making and weighing options. Adulting is so fucking hard. My mom says stay, despite her not liking the environment I am in and complaining about my emotional state. Should I try for the LSAT again? Should I take a phone call with this other company? 

I also don’t think I will make it to then end of the year at job 2 no matter what… I’m not fucking up or doing anything wrong, but idk every day I’m in that office I’m carrying something extra with me.

1fi8ska,Boss agreed to raise 4 months ago,"Hello everyone,

About 4 months ago I asked my boss for a raise (on my birthday) during a meeting where I got slightly reprimanded for using my company card somewhat carelessly, but it really wasn’t a big deal. My boss sat there and agreed with every single reason I had for wanting a $4/hr raise and even shook my hand (he did not look me in the eyes when he shook my hand) when I left his office. 

Fast forward 4 months and it still hasn’t happened. We’ve talked about the raise at least 3 times since I initially asked for it and have provided him with plenty of similar jobs in the area that pay more than what I am currently making.

I have worked for this company the past almost 4 years and started basically at the bottom and have had 2 promotions since I started with them. I took my current position for a $1.50 raise and I went from working with 1 facility to 2 facilities so my work load has almost doubled.

The position I am in now is in the maintenance department and I manage our software which my boss has no idea how to use. He always uses phrases like: “you’re my right hand man, you’re a rock star, I have no idea what I would do without you” and so on and so forth. 
 
Last Friday, our production manager at one of our facilities was fired. The facility is just in constant chaos and is losing money, compared to its sister facility and it seems like things are changing a lot and it really has me wondering if I will ever get my raise or if I should just move on to somewhere else. I’m relied on heavily at my company and our new director of maintenance and reliability has taken me under his wing and I consider him to be my mentor.

Essentially I am looking for advice on if I should move on from the company or if I should ride it out? There is plenty of room to move up still but I’m not sure if I want to wait around for another promotion or for one of the facilities to go under and I lose my job.

I have a 4 year degree, which is in industrial technology, and close to 4 years of experience now with this company and I am 29 years old, if any of that is relevant.

Thanks in advance.",Party_Suspect1242,3,0.6700000166893005,22,1726503565,2024-09-16 16:19:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fi8ska/boss_agreed_to_raise_4_months_ago/,9,2024

From my personal experience, I seems like big corps are not hiring. All the interviews I have been getting recently are all from small-med size corp. I can't even land an interview with big corps. I am from Canada so your mileage might vary.

1fi5h7d,Does my job offer regarding vacation time adequate?,"Currently, the company I am applying for has time off is set up as x-number vacations days a year and x-number of days for sick days.

Starting 2025, this company will be switching from PTO (paid time off) wherein vacation time and sick days will be combined. I actually prefer this since I am normally only out sick average maybe 2 days a year. In the benefit package, it reads:

""Enjoy a minimum of 6 weeks total paid time off! (PTO, 11 company-paid holidays, 2 floating holidays, and 2 volunteer days)""

As part of job offer, I asked for 4 weeks vacation and on the initial job offer, it was listed that way but then I remembered reading in the HR benefit package about them switching to PTO days in 2025 and I asked HR about how that would affect my ""4 weeks"" of vacation? They initially explained, unless you have been with the company 10 plus years, everyone in 2025 would be only getting 3 weeks of PTO (not counting the 11 company paid holidays, 2 floating holidays and 2 volunteer days). So, I went back to the hiring manager explaining how I needed 4 weeks of PTO starting in 2025 as well. He explained, he had to get approval from his manager. Well, the same day, he came back and explained he gotten approval and HR would be updating the job offer in the next day or two via text message.

I believe originally (I didn't save a copy), that section of the job offer originally read:

Vacation: 4 weeks of per full calendar year.

Now it reads:

""Vacation: Accrued at a rate of 4 weeks per full calendar year (based on your standard hours and prorated for the remainder of the calendar year)""

Is that enough language to make sure I get 4 weeks of PTO (excluding 11 company-paid holidays, 2 floating holidays and 2 volunteer days) in 2025 and thereafter?

Perhaps, its should read: ""Vacation/PTO: Accrued at a rate of 4 weeks...""?

Also, is this major RED FLAG about joining this company? Shouldn't the hiring manager brought this up on his own?

They have me signing a anti-solicit agreement too. That is a first as well but the hiring manager insists every company is doing this now days in my industry. At the end of the day, it really doesn't affect me but I don't like being caught off guard either...

My VP sent me a Slack with a director from another department as well as my manager. I recently got a new manager and in the past, my VP rarely included my former manager in any of my emails/slacks with him. I thought that was strange but I'm just going to assume that my new manager wants to be in any conversations I have with other higher-ups to know what projects I'm working on. My VP asked me to help out the director from another department with a project in that group conversation and I happily said yes I can help out and told her my calendar is up to date and to feel free to send a calendar invite that works best with her schedule. My calendar is wide open and because I know how busy she is, I thought it'd be easier for her to schedule something since I don't know her or her schedule. Immediately after I sent that message, my manager privately messaged me and told me to look at her calendar and schedule something. I didn't understand why at first because I never had someone do that to me and I thought because she's super busy, it'd be easier for her to find a time that works best for her. 

I told my husband the situation and my husband said I was in the wrong and that if someone is a title above me, it's my job to schedule something on their calendar. I genuinely did not know that was a thing and never had this kind of experience before and started to feel really bad. Anyways, I looked up her calendar and just sent her an invite with the tiny window of a break she had in her busy schedule. 

Is this a normal custom for someone to look at a higher-up's calendar and send an invite rather than letting them choose the day/time that works best for them as someone who has an open schedule?

I am currently an investment associate at a company. I have been at this job for 2.5 years. The job is about debt deal execution, supporting the entire process from internal approval to contracting. I will touch client relationship management, financial assessment, ESG, green / climate finance, KYC (know your customer), capacity development, legal, mid office. I always describe myself as a spider on the net pulling all strings. I know everything but not in depth because we have specialists who deal with all specific topics. Travel is 1-4 times per year. 

I got disappointed at work because how I was treated mostly by my manager. I felt he did not acknowledge what I achieved (very huge) and lives in the past and keeps bringing what I should improve to justify why he gave me an okay review. I wanted to get promoted and he thinks I was too rushy. I got disappointed so I looked for new opportunities. I got a job internally at another team. I told him about the interviews because it was an internal requirement. He kept saying usually staying in one role for 3-4 years otherwise one can be perceived restless. Anyway, the new job is a more focused role, structured finance associate. I will be working on a risk sharing facility which is a program lasting until 2032 (vs debt is our long term business). I will focus on credit risk of clients, underwriting process of clients. I will also be more technical and structure the deals. I will no longer be the core deal team but just one of the strings being pulled. My new manager from hear and say has very positive reviews. New role involved promotion to senior. Travel is at least 6 times per year.

1fi1tez,Software developer contractor for government or full time government employee?,"Hi guys,

A little background: I am 22M from NJ-NY area. I just graduated college. I worked as an intern for a state govt agency for a while and was offered a full time software developer position. I had two options: work as a consultant for them (hired under an IT consulting agency) for higher salary but less benefits, or work as a state employee for more benefits but less pay.

I do not need health insurance at the moment. I am covered under my parents' health insurance until 26.

I pay no bills and live at home. All the money I make is mine for now.

I am currently working for them as a consultant because of the higher pay. However, I am having second thoughts about my decision, mainly due to the work life balance and long-term benefits.

No matter which option I pick, I will be working at the same location. The only difference is salary and benefits.

Here are the options in more detail:

\* **Consultant (W2) for state government agency - NOT self-employed**

* \* Salary: $82,000 CURRENTLY.
* \* 35 hours/week
* \* 2 days work from home
* \* 13 days PTO earned per year (carries over to max 400 hours, earn 3.79 hours every 2 weeks - slow PTO accrual)
* \* No sick leave, must use PTO.
* \* 10 paid holidays (any extra holidays required by the state govt agency (15-16) must come out of my PTO).
* \* 401k after 1 year employment
* \* Health insurance options
* I work with a team of contractors at the same location/company. So work is a little more engaging and interesting compared to if I were a govt employee and would need to work with a team of actual government employees.

--

\* **Full-time employee for state government agency**

* \* Salary range for entry: $65,000-70,000
* \* Union (problem: raises are not guaranteed and no merit increases in salary, everyone is paid the same)
* \* Job security (union/government)
* \* 35 hours/week
* \* 2 days work from home
* \* 4 weeks (20 days) PTO available after a year of employment, and immediately available at the start of every year. Carryover maximum 1 years' extra worth of PTO.
* \* 3 weeks (15 days) paid sick leave, must accrue
* \* 1 week (5 days) personal leave (use or lose)
* \* All holidays paid (15-16 holidays)
* \* Free tolls for commuting (save around $1,000/year)
* \* Health insurance options, very good options
* \* State employee pension

Here is my dilemma -

I talked to my boss about switching to government employee instead due to the better benefits. He asked me to put the government employee benefits into numbers and add that to my current salary and come back to him, so he could see if I could get a raise as a contractor. He almost laughed at me when I said I wanted to switch to government employee. He is advising me to stay as a contractor... the pay is very nice but the benefits are quite bad.

By my calculations I should ask for around $92k which is the cost of all government benefits (PTO, sick leave, free tolls, etc.). Manager also told me I could get a raise to around $100k after a couple years, much faster raises than as a government employee because of the extra flexibility they have with contractors. However, I still would not get time off as much as the government position. He is essentially buying the time and adding it to my salary. He said I could request unpaid leave through the contracting firm, but again, unpaid.

1fi0avw,What to do when you get job offers in reverse order of interest ?,"So here's the situation. I've been unemployed for a while, had a decent number of interviews so far but none of them led to anything until now. Since July, I have applied to 4 positions that are all very interesting to me, but not *equally* interesting of course.

I very rapidly got an answer for my 4th choice, and they want me for the position. They wanted a quick answer but I have been making them wait as I'll have an interview with my 3rd choice tomorrow. This morning, I also got a call to tell me I'd have an interview for my 2nd choice in 2 weeks from now. On wednesday, I'll know if I have an interview for my 1st choice. I can make my 4th choice wait until I get an answer for my 3rd choice, but probably not any longer.

I work in a relatively small field where reputation is quite important, but maybe I'm overestimating its actual impact. Because of that, I would like to keep a good contact with all these people, and I don't really like the idea of accepting a job just to quit soon after, but I also have to choose the best fit for me. All of these choices require me to relocate, except for my 1st choice, so once I'm going for one, I also want to commit and not turn back, but then I think I'd have a hard time thinking of the ""what ifs?"".

1fhxf0v,Medical school vs veterinary vs optometry? ,"I was accepted to all three schools in Poland and I've been agonizing over this decision for the past two months. Due to decision fatigue from thinking about it so constantly, I don't feel excited by any of them. Medical school is 6 years (plus 6 years of specialization), vet in 5.5 years (plus a few years of specialization), and optometry is 5 years. I'm also almost 26 years old. 

I have multiple chronic illnesses which makes it more difficult, because I don't know what my health will be like in the future, or if I could make it through medical or veterinary school. Both med and vet are very intense and stressful with pretty strict attendance, and I already struggle with fatigue and chronic anemia. I've been in the ER a few times, once due to dehydration from Crohn's, and once for temporary vision loss caused by a retinal hemmorhage caused by anemia, and sometimes I'll have a flare up that leaves me feeling like I'm on the verge of another ER trip for days on end. I'm feeling better at the moment, although I still have severe Crohn's inflammation that hasn't responded to biologics so far. 

Since I was little I've always been fascinated by animals and nature, so I wanted to become a veterinarian when I was younger. However, it wasn't a feasible option for me in the US due to the high student debt + low/moderate salary, so I pivoted towards medicine in high school. I took a full curriculum of advanced classes in high school and made it my life goal to get into medicine, and I got perfect grades, but I got burnt out and started questioning if it's actually if I want to do after two years of pre-med in college. In the US there's a culture of needing to sacrifice your entire life and have no other interests or hobbies to become a doctor (and due to the intensity of med school, it's somewhat like that in Poland as well, though residency hours are not as extreme, with a weekly limit of 48 hours.)

I ended up applying to medical school and veterinary school and optometry this summer, several years after college. At this point I don't know what I'm passionate about. Since I've had multiple chronic illnesses from a young age,  I'm always reading medical articles and know a notable amount of medical terminology, and I feel like being a doctor would be interesting and fulfilling. However, I'm not sure if I'm up for the sacrifices required. In Poland, medical school is 6 years, followed by a 1 year internship and then 5-6 years of residency. The ""good lifestyle"" residencies I'm interested in are becoming extremely competitive, so there's no guarantee I would get the specialty I want, and exams continue throughout residency - I would finish residency around age 37 or 38, and I don't know if I have the energy for it. I feel compelled to go to medical school, but thinking about it also gives me a sense of dread. 

With vet, I would still get to learn and practice medicine, and I've heard that it's maybe a *slightly* easier and a slightly shorter path than becoming a physician in Poland. I've always loved animals, so maybe it would be more exciting, although I've been struggling with this decision for so long that I can't currently conjure up any excitement at the thought. It's a more physically demanding job than medicine, with a risk of injury (from bites/scratches). 

Optometry seems like the most practical choice due to a better work-life balance, and it's also a cleaner and less stressful environment. Additionally, I have hobbies like art and music and photography, and this would give me the most time for them. Apparently it's much easier and less stressful than med or vet. A family friend who's a doctor thinks it's the best choice for me considering my health issues.

However, the optometry program that I'm accepted to is part-time, only on weekends, ever other week, so I wouldn't have the sense of community that I would probably have in vet or med school - it would be more socially isolating. And it feels like a bit of a letdown having spent so much time and effort getting into medical and vet school only to choose neither.

Does anyone have any personal insights or advice? I really need to make a decision today. ",Ghostfaerie,1,1.0,1,1726465717,2024-09-16 05:48:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhxf0v/medical_school_vs_veterinary_vs_optometry/,9,2024

1fhuela,How to professionally say a job prospect isn’t what you’re looking for?  (because money and position),"TLDR; I’m being shopped around for some positions internally, but I don’t think they aren aligned with my expectations.

There’s a lot to unwind here, but I’ll try to keep it short.

A few months ago a position I would have wanted opened up (they let the guy go).  It was part of senior leadership.  My boss, the guy let go, and several others said I would be a shoe in.  I didn’t even get a chance… they hired someone before they even let the first guy go.

I’ve been pretty pissed off about the lack of advancement opportunities, but I’ve kept it professional for the most part.  My boss could tell I was pissed.  We’ve been discussing succession planning for a while, but this was an opportunity to move into where I want to be immediately.  My boss has been floating other opportunities to me, and has support from our exec team.  The problem is that most of those feel lateral.  They aren’t part of the leadership team, they are movements within my current team (trading with another Sr Director, etc…).

I’ve tiptoed around the comp discussion, but not directly.  They know that part of it is being paid what I’m worth, not just what my title would support.  The other part is the seat at the table.  I’m not getting any further in my career without the seat with the leadership team.

So, that leads me to where I am… we are adding a new division to the company, and my boss mentioned that my name is being floated as the department head for that division.  My view is that it’s still not the group department head (ie, my bosses job) and I don’t think it would be part of the leadership team.  Another lateral opportunity… it might have some shiny new things to work on, but it would still roll up under my boss most likely.

So here I am, trying to figure out how to professionally not scorch all the bridges I have, but make it clear that if I don’t find something internally then I’ll find it externally, and that I have a number in mind that’s closer to a $75-100K raise which I think the market would support.",HighHoeHighHoes,1,1.0,2,1726454979,2024-09-16 02:49:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhuela/how_to_professionally_say_a_job_prospect_isnt/,9,2024

I have 4,000 followers on LinkedIn because I used to be very successful working in cannabis… here’s the thing though… paid social media is tricky for cannabis/hemp. Not impossible, but tricky.

I have a part time job right now where they really admire my advertising skills and look to me as a leader in my hours for their clients.

There is potential in all of this. I feel it. But I still make shit money and cried all weekend because I had -$9 in my bank all weekend.

1fhtt7u,Overwhelmed and not sure what to do,"This may be a long post so I’ll put a tldr at the end. For context, I’m a 21 y/o student who got a part-time admin. assistant/trainee position at a logistics company. 

I sort of accidentally got into the industry after wrapping up an on-campus at my school when I got my associates. At first, the job was supposed to be part-time and the scope of work was pretty manageable (just learning how to handle shipments + normal administrative stuff)

Throughout the summer my job duties started to expand a lot and I began working close to full-time. It wasn’t a huge issue then as I wasn’t taking classes. I actually really liked the challenge especially because I’ll be getting some great benefits soon & will be able to travel. 

But in the last few months, especially with classes starting, the workload is way too much. There’s not really a division of tasks at my company, everyone kind of just works on everything (which means we are often late or scrambling). 

I’m doing a lot of things I am NOT AT ALL qualified to do. I like a challenge, but right now I have a backlog of about 40 tasks ranging from handling shipments to coordinating with suppliers to sorting out finances (I have 0 accounting knowledge). 

I feel like the stress is eating me alive and I have no time for anything outside of work and school. I really want to stay at this company, but I have no idea how to ask my boss to narrow my scope of work- especially because based on what I’ve seen on here working yourself longer than other jobs is pretty standard. 

Does it get better??? I really want to stick with this job but I’m having second thoughts because I don’t want to waste the rest of my time in college for a job I’ll hate when I’m done. 

How can I narrow my responsibilities? I feel like I’m doing a bit of everything and I’m not handling the pressure well. But I also don’t know if I’m just being a crybaby about it lol

Tldr: the scope of my job responsibilities covers pretty much everything and I’m not handling the pressure well. Does it get better?

1fhto4n,Should i do this ?,"So im debating to either Join the airforce or either do IT or Capentry/electrician

Reasons i want to join the airforce
Free college, housing benefits, travel, because i almost have no life other than my family but i am single and by myself, make me more discipline, avoid home for a bit, to forget about life in the city i am in

Reasons i want to do IT/Cybersercurity
Money,Remote work, its interesting,least manual labor,almost predictable schedule, always work, more diverse,company might pay for a degree

Reasons i want to do capentry
I like the idea of remodeling and buidling houses,money is decent, the schedule is most of the time consistent, lifelong skill, theres always work,college credits

Reasons i want to be a electrician
Money,lifelong skill, not as tough on your body as the other trades,the schedule is most of the time consistent, theres always work, college credits

But im not really sure want to get into 

Its no a brainer that Cybersercurity makes the most money out of them but it does require months to a year to gain knowledge and then you need start of with internships and they don't always pay good at first but im just hesistant because of that which is why i see the trades as another option you get paid 23 an hour where im at the first 6 months and the airforce because i just want to be the best version of myself which i know i could do outside the airforce but im just lost they all sound good.

1fhtjgp,Scared to quit job (have another offer),"Hello all,

In the summer I accepted a job I had a lot of hesitation about. In my industry it’s like working for a consulting firm. Hours are long (9-6 with 30 min lunch), mandatory in office 3x per week, and juggling a lot of clients because we need to hit a certain number of billable hours. I took the job because I had been unemployed for about 10 months and really needed something, but I felt the salary they offered was a low ball for the position and responsibilities and they wouldn’t budge on vacation time or pay.

Fast forward about 5 months and I’ve been selected for a government job - just waiting for my offer which will come next week. It’s 35 hours per week, includes pension, and means that I will have enforced lieu time for overtime. Additionally, it will mean I am focused on one line of business rather than being spread across several, and has a much more relaxed WFH policy. 

It’s a no brainer to take this job especially as I am in my mid 30s and trying to get married (current job has taken all my energy so planning has hit a standstill) and ideally would be starting a family sooner than later, clock is ticking. 

But the owner of the firm I work at is extremely influential and well connected in my city and I feel extremely anxious about quitting. Since starting this job, I have felt very burnt out, have noticed I am less present for myself and for my relationships, and also have felt like I need to use substances to relax and decompress after work which is not healthy.

Is there any way I can do this without burning bridges? I don’t know why I feel so anxious about this. ",starsinthesky12,4,0.699999988079071,21,1726452343,2024-09-16 02:05:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhtjgp/scared_to_quit_job_have_another_offer/,9,2024
1fhtha5,Should a General Manager get his company truck taken from him?,"My husband works for a local pest control company, family owned. They have the owner and his two kids are involved and have a share of the company. They also do Christmas lights 4 months out of the year. When my husband applied for a job at this company it was for a pest control supervisor position but after interviews and an interview with their consultant they decided with his background that he would make a great General Manager. When the owner called him he asked my husband what would it take to get him and since the high end of the pay was $75k my husband told him $75k and then the owner decided to tell him that they were gonna make him General Manager if he was interested and my husband desperate for a job accepted it. Which later we believe the owner knew he tricked him cause he told my husband that he wanted him to make six figures. They offered him to buy him a new truck but with him having 23 years of pest control experience started off concerned for the company and it's profits and they decided to take another tech's truck since it was the 2nd nicest truck there. The tech is also childhood friends with one of the owner's kids. My husband was out running stops. When he got back to his office just a sudden appearance of the truck keys was laying on his desk. Nobody was there at the office and nobody talked to him about getting this truck beforehand. So forward to now, the tech who is childhood friends with one of the owners kids told my husband that they were taking his truck from him to use it for the Christmas decor. The owners had a secret meeting about them taking away his truck. My husband kept quiet and suddenly at one of the managers meetings the owner at the end of the meeting softly spoke up that they will be using my husbands truck for the Christmas decor and my husband spoke up and said ""what did you say?"" The owner said we're taking the truck from you and placing you in a company van (which BTW is one of the basic vehicles the company has) and the techs have much nicer trucks. My husband spoke up and said ""why was I not aware of this?"" The owner said ""yes I told you when the truck was given to you"" which is a lie! Why would my husband accept the truck if it was going to be taken from him 4 months out of the year, EVERY YEAR!

He was so mad he couldn't even speak and just got up and left the meeting. He told the owners son that his dad did not mention anything at all about taking his truck from him 4 months out of the year and why would he even agree to that. Now my husband wants to find another job. Advice please? Should he bring up this matter at the upcoming managers meeting with the consultant the company pays for advice, etc. They have meetings with the consultant every Tuesday.",Original_Phase_3075,0,0.33000001311302185,11,1726452168,2024-09-16 02:02:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhtha5/should_a_general_manager_get_his_company_truck/,9,2024

1fht347,Did I ruin my future ?,"I recently graduated college with a degree I wasn’t passionate about. My dad pushed me into it, and I’ve struggled with depression for a long time, but I managed to push through. I even completed three public accounting internships and landed a full-time job at one of the Big Four firms. It was a prestigious position, with a salary of around $78K (though after taxes, it was closer to $55K).

However, the job was draining, especially since I had to start work at 6 AM. Waking up early, being glued to the computer, and juggling endless tasks took a serious toll on my mental health. I ended up quitting, and I now regret it deeply. I didn’t have a clear plan when I left since i trusted a friend who I thought was going ot help me but something happen between us, and since then, everything has spiraled out of control.

My dad lost all respect for me, and he’s so upset that I might not even inherit his rental property, which was supposed to be my financial backup. I lost my relationship because they wanted to move forward and take things another level, and now I feel completely isolated. I found a part-time job as a coordinator, which pays very little. While I enjoy the work, the title and wage make me feel like I’ve fallen behind everyone else. It’s tough seeing older people in the same role when I feel like I should be doing more, and I’m starting to regret leaving my higher-paying job. My younger sister has been really harsh, even suggesting to my dad that I should be kicked out, which terrifies me.

I just can not let go of the feeling of regret from leaving my corporate job, even though it was killing me. It’s like wanting to go back to a toxic ex because of the security it provided. I know I’m not meant to stay at the bottom of the hierarchy, and that’s why I regret it so much. Now, every time I go to my new job, I feel like a failure, and I blame my mental health for everything.

The job market is rough right now, and I haven’t been able to secure another accounting role. I’ve even asked my family for help, but they don’t trust me to stick it out in accounting since I left the last job. It feels like I sacrificed everything just to prioritize my mental health, and now I’m left feeling like a complete failure in my family’s eyes. I’m at a point where, if my dad kicks me out, I might just join the Air Force, which I was initially planned on going but since I am weak I don't know if I would survive.

I don’t know what to do anymore if life is even worth continuing if I lost everything all thanks to my mental health. Any advice is appreciated.",PirateOpen2739,18,0.8500000238418579,57,1726450977,2024-09-16 01:42:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fht347/did_i_ruin_my_future/,9,2024
1fhszaw,Stuck Between Majors - Law or Engineering,"(New to Reddit so bear with me, I was advised to make a post by a friend)

I'm an 18 year old female who just graduated, right now I'm in community college in my first semester as a mechanical engineering major. I've always enjoyed being involved and doing well academically. I graduated third in my class, was ASB president one year, varsity athlete and team captain in multiple sports - all that jazz. Here's the thing though, I struggle a lot in Math and Physics. Not terrible at it but significantly worse in comparison to English and History. I'm really struggling in my Calc and Physics classes right now. I enjoy it when I understand it, but I'm working two jobs right now to save up for when I transfer and it's taking a toll on me to find time to study and understand the material. It seems like it's ten times harder for me to understand the material than most people in my classes. I'm really good at English and History however, I've always gotten high marks in those classes, 5's on all my English AP tests without studying - I was even awarded the department award in English for my graduating class. Strengths and weaknesses, I enjoy both, but I also generally enjoy things I succeed in as well. I was in Mock Trial my freshman year and everybody told me I was good at it, compared to the engineering things I've participated in where I've been for the most part average. 

When I was younger I always wanted to be a lawyer, however when I got to High School I geared myself towards engineering and never looked back. However now I'm starting to reassess, what if I'm wasting my talents by doing things I'll never be good at? What's the point of all this if I'm just going to fail? Additionally, I've been itching to get out of my house and go away for college like all my friends, financial barriers just held me back. If I pursue the path of law I can transfer in a year to a four year for political science, whereas it might take me three years to transfer for engineering. What's holding me back though is that I do enjoy engineering  more than law at times, and from what I've read law school can put you back on average 200k in debt (on top of any existing undergrad debt). Additionally, law seems so saturated from what I've heard (I know engineering is too but law even more so). I'm just at a standstill right now. Maybe I'm just meant to persevere and it's the allure of going away for college as soon as possible, or maybe it's because I'm meant to change career paths. Any advice on this would be great.

1fhsenv,Recent Business Grad Feeling Lost: Need Advice on Career Direction or Starting a Business,"""Hi everyone,

I graduated last year with a degree in Business Management, and since then I’ve gained some experience in different areas. During the last 2 years I’ve worked in Data Entry (8-9 months, part-time), assisted in financial operations (2-3 months), and spent a year as a Recruitment Resourcer with a start-up recruitment business. While the idea of recruitment initially seemed appealing, I’ve realized it’s not something I enjoy long-term.

Now, I find myself feeling lost. My degree is broad, and I’m unsure what direction to take next. With Recruitment my initial plan was to work for a company for a few years, specialize in a specific sector, and eventually open my own agency. But now that I’ve ruled out recruitment, I’m not sure what path to pursue.

Should I focus on learning a specific skill and eventually start my own business? Or should I aim to get a job with a company, gain as much experience as I can, and then venture out on my own?
Recently, I've been applying for graduate or assistant roles in digital marketing, but I've found it difficult to get entry-level jobs in the profession because there aren't that many entry level opportunities in my area. (Surrey, South East England)

I'm also thinking about teaching myself a specific area of digital marketing and trying to land a job or even take on clients down the line.
My ultimate goal is to run my own business, but I'm open to working for others in the meantime to gain valuable experience and skills if I get that opportunity.

I'd really appreciate advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation or has insights on finding the right career path or business idea. How did you figure out what was best for you?

Any guidance would be incredibly helpful!!!

1fhsei1,Took a job that I don't wanna start but need the money,"I took a job, it's ""carpentry"". I say ""carpentry"" because by definition, carpentry involves working with wood and that is not what I'll be doing. It's more like assembly with metal. Pay is good though and the commute isn't very far. They have ""odd jobs"" which MIGHT align with my interests but they're odd jobs. Won't happen very often. Maybe I can convince them to let me work on them most of the time instead.

I've applied to jobs that are more aligned with my interests but most have not wanted me and even more haven't gotten back to me (I'm not expecting them to at this point). Admittedly just thinking of working the ""carpentry"" job makes me feel sad but I don't have a backup job so I'm stuck with ""carpentry"".

Even worse I think is I have NO idea where I'm going tomorrow. Not in the sense of where I'll be working and where the company is. I mean like I need to sign a formal agreement, set up direct deposit, etc.

I don't know what I'll do. Hope they fire me after the first week, and by then I have a different job I can take right away? Hope they switch me to their location that's 10 minutes closer to me for the welding position I saw they had (I have the experience but I get not enough in their eyes)?

1fhrx4s,"Software developer: work for state government as consultant, or work as state employee?","Hi guys,

A little background: I am 22M from NJ-NY area. I just graduated college. I worked as an intern for a state govt agency for a while and was offered a full time software developer position. I had two options: work as a consultant for them (hired under an IT consulting agency) for higher salary but less benefits, or work as a state employee for more benefits but less pay.



I do not need health insurance at the moment. I am covered under my parents' health insurance until 26.



I pay no bills and live at home. All the money I make is mine for now.



I am currently working for them as a consultant because of the higher pay. However, I am having second thoughts about my decision, mainly due to the work life balance and long-term benefits.



No matter which option I pick, I will be working at the same location. The only difference is salary and benefits.



Here are the options in more detail:

\* \*\*Consultant (W2) for state government agency - NOT self-employed\*\*

\* Salary: $82,000 CURRENTLY. 

\* 35 hours/week

\* 2 days work from home

\* 13 days PTO earned per year (carries over to max 400 hours, earn 3.79 hours every 2 weeks - slow PTO accrual)

\* No sick leave, must use PTO.

\* 10 paid holidays (any extra holidays required by the state govt agency (15-16) must come out of my PTO).

\* 401k after 1 year employment

\* Health insurance options



--



\* \*\*Full-time employee for state government agency\*\*

\* Salary range for entry: $65,000-70,000

\* Union (problem: raises are not guaranteed and no merit increases in salary, everyone is paid the same)

\* Job security (union/government)

\* 35 hours/week

\* 2 days work from home

\* 4 weeks (20 days) PTO available after a year of employment, and immediately available at the start of every year. Carryover maximum 1 years' extra worth of PTO.

\* 3 weeks (15 days) paid sick leave, must accrue

\* 1 week (5 days) personal leave (use or lose)

\* All holidays paid (15-16 holidays)

\* Free tolls for commuting (save around $1,000/year)

\* Health insurance options, very good options

\* State employee pension



Here is my dilemma -

I talked to my boss about switching to government employee instead due to the better benefits. He asked me to put the government employee benefits into numbers and add that to my current salary and come back to him, so he could see if I could get a raise as a contractor. He almost laughed at me when I said I wanted to switch to government employee. He is advising me to stay as a contractor... the pay is very nice but the benefits are quite bad.



By my calculations I should ask for around $92k which is the cost of all government benefits (PTO, sick leave, free tolls, etc.). Manager also told me I could get a raise to around $100k after a couple years, much faster raises than as a government employee because of the extra flexibility they have with contractors. However, I still would not get time off as much as the government position. He is essentially buying the time and adding it to my salary. He said I could request unpaid leave through the contracting firm, but again, unpaid.



What is the best option for long term? My state is not cheap to live in. I really don't know the best option for long term. I can either ask for a raise in my consulting position to add the monetary value of the government benefits, or I can switch to government employee, sacrificing a lot of pay but for much better benefits.

Would anyone be able to help me out with the computations of salary and whether I am making the right choice in deciding to switch to government employee instead?",Deadsea3132,2,1.0,1,1726447414,2024-09-16 00:43:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhrx4s/software_developer_work_for_state_government_as/,9,2024

We have “unlimited PTO” but I put myself in a position where I am looked at to sometimes solve other peoples problems at the cost of my own projects. Upside is that I get a lot of visibility for doing this but this means that I stop working on whatever projects I have going on to help with these tasks.

Since I started working here, I’ve have had not really had time off, not counting getting sick or needing to be off for doctors appointments etc.  I’ve powered through not having personal time off but now as the end of my 3rd year is coming… it looks like I’ll be having another year without vacation. I’ve got a couple active projects that need to be closed out by December, I can make this goal but I just look at my A3 and think to myself… “man, I’m not gonna have time off until the holidays… which sucks because I get those off anyway.”

As I see this time looming I just do not want to get anything done. I’ve now come to hate Mondays and slightly view other engineers disdain when they ask me for anything. 
All of my projects are on track but man… I am taking my sweet time to do any of it because I don’t want to do it. I know it’s all mental and I have to do it but I feel like I hit a while. It feels like all I’m doing is working and paying bills.

1fhqemj,"Plan to move with no job lined up, good idea? ","For context UK based, my current job is doing redundancies so I'll likely be unemployed soon anyway. However I'll hopefully have some redundancy money behind me. I have a degree and otherwise good career (minus the redundancy). 

I'd prefer to get a job lined and I am applying like crazy but I feel like the word ""relocate"" is hindering my applications.

1fhqbg1,"Two job offers and I cannot decide which one to accept... Help, advice needed!","I am really lost and I really could use some advice from complete and utter strangers. As stated in the title, I have two job offers, both have come in at the same time and I basically need to make a decision EOD tomorrow...   
\*I have decided to hide locations and company names from this post.  
  
I have been unemployed for a number of moths now and it has been really hard but I have been getting job offers now after endless interviews, so there is a light at the end of the tunnel. These two jobs that I have been offered are completely different from one another, in both sector and wage.

A bit of background on me. I moved to London when I was 18 and studied film production. Film is one of my biggest passions ever. I love film, going to the cinema, talking about film, the lot. After graduating, I struggled getting work in the industry, I was looking for freelance positions and I was not but for it. My anxiety was overwhelming (back then I didn't even know what anxiety was, I just thought there was something wrong with me). I ended up working customer service, front of house roles etc for a long while. At the end of lock down, I got myself a pretty sweet job at a London based short term property management company, basically an airbnb management service. It was a sweet job, travelling around the country checking out all the properties etc. I had a lot of freedom in my position and I worked independently, it was great, I feel like I really excelled in my role and made an impact in the company. I was there for almost 2 years, some sh\*t happened outside of work and I ended up with a brain injury. I struggled with he world of working after that, I needed to get away to recover and went traveling with the only money I slowly saved up. Fast forward a year to today, and here I am, 30 years of age, broke living at home with the parents outside of London where I have no friends. I have been applying for jobs since I returned home in various industries, jobs that I feel passionate towards like film studios and podcast studios, as well as jobs at short term property management companies.

Job 1: Account Manager

This role is once again with a short term property management company but is a step up in both duties and pay, paying £30,000. A hybrid position in London meaning that I can travel into work some days and work from my parents the other, this way I can save up some money.   
My anxiety around this role is high because it is a step up. I had to take part in 5 interview over 3 months for this position, it was rather intense. I have a feeling it may be a high stress environment or more pressure than my last role. This is giving me anxiety.  
In the job spec, the salary stated was higher around the £32,000 mark. If I decide to accept this job I will ask more more money because why not.

Job 2: Film Studio Site Assistant

This role is at a very prestigious film studio, probably in the top 5 film studios of all time, most people have heard of it. The role is an entry level role, paying at £25,000 which is a decrease from my last job and is so vastly different. This role is pretty much manual labour, making sure the sites are in good condition for the big shoots that will take place, driving around in caddies studio to studio on my feet all day. It seems very simple, get told to do this, make my way there and do what was asked.  
I have anxiety around this role, I have not really been in this industry properly, I am essentially a newcomer at the age of 30, most people get into it at 18. It does not have much to do with the film making process but it is around film shoots. My main concern about this is not actually the work, it is my life outside of the job as I would have to relocate for this job. The studios are based no where near where I want to be (London), I have no friends there and there isn't much going on there. I would be starting a new job with a lower wage, in a new industry, in a new location and completely on my own. 

I do not want to struggle financially anymore, the UK and London are becoming harder to survive in, especially as a single person not from money. I feel like I need to be sensible and go for Job 1, there is probably room for growth and in my last role I did well, I was respected and people liked the work I did. I suffer so much with depression and anxiety, I am scared that Job 1 will make me spiral.   
Job 2 sounds easier going, perhaps more fun and perhaps somewhere that I feel more passionate about. I would be around film making all day everyday. If it was not for the location and having to relocate there, I would probably take Job 2. I know that I will be sad in that location.

I have not been able to sleep, it is a really big decision for me. I am sorry if this is poorly written or makes little sense but my lord do I need advice. 

I just want to say thank you to those you for reading this, if you have any advice for me that would be much appreciated :)",Patty-oDoor,1,1.0,1,1726442690,2024-09-15 23:24:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhqbg1/two_job_offers_and_i_cannot_decide_which_one_to/,9,2024
1fhp7c6,Concealing your employment gaps or termination,"When concealing an employment gap - never use the standard “Years only” date trick. You are not the first person to think of this, and recruiters automatically assume that you are concealing something. Additionally, this NDA trick circulating is pretty ridiculous - this just makes you look guilty, and they are still going to expect you to answer follow-up questions afterwards.

Instead, simply think about ways you can extend your employment date, or lie altogether (and make sure you are covered) - and then address it in the interview w/ no excuse whatsoever. You just have to take steps to pass the verification.

Look out for your own self-interest in interviews people - not what is “moral”. You just have to make sure that you can cover it during the background verification check, which you can if you take the right steps.

1fhos2g,"If you’re really struggling to find work, consider leaving Reddit.","Yes, I understand the hypocrisy of posting this on Reddit.

When I look back at the times that I’ve had to find a new job, there is one action that I took that led to a job shortly afterward:

Ignoring the advice and struggles of those on Reddit, and instead focusing on the advice and stories from those who are offering jobs and who have recently gotten a job.

No, I can’t say with total certainty that it’s literally because I did this that things started working out. It just has always been very shortly afterward that it does, and that’s worth paying attention to.

I think there’s something about the anonymity on Reddit, and likely other factors that have developed over time and attracted people of a similar mindset, that has led to some of the more common career advice being very defeatist. Plus, as annoying and difficult as recruiters and hiring managers can be, it’s especially defeatist for us to listen to redditors instead of those who are actively telling us what we need to do to get jobs.

I’m not saying to stop being depressed, or to put on a happy face, or that the job market isn’t a nightmare. I’m saying that Reddit might be making everything more difficult for you, despite feeling like you’re finding like minded people.",StrategyXCareer,395,0.9100000262260437,103,1726438479,2024-09-15 22:14:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhos2g/if_youre_really_struggling_to_find_work_consider/,9,2024

1fhnfzo,not sure what major i should go into,"hey guys! so i have had a lot of trouble deciding what i want to do for a career for quite a few years now. in high school, i was set on becoming a neonatal nurse, then all the sudden in my senior year i changed my mind. i went into college having no idea what i wanted to do, so picked a random major (early childhood education), it seemed interesting to me but as i took classes, i realized that it was not for me, i didn't really want to do anything in that field. so i ended up dropping out of college, felt like i was wasting my time staying there bc i had no idea what i wanted to do. i worked a part time retail job for awhile because that was the only place that would hire me. then we ended up moving and i got a CSR position at a loan company, which i did loans (obviously). and i loved it, then the company got bought out by some dumb company that didnt know what they were doing which made me hate my job. in october of last year, i had a baby and left after my maternity leave, and just recently went back and realized how much i love the office job setting itself, data entry, etc, just not necessarily the company. also, i have always loved the idea of having an office job, my little introverted self in my own cubicle lol. I have been wanting to go back to college for awhile, i just haven't known what i wanted to do. I just had a realization today that i could take something along this route? i just don't really know what that's considered? business administration? i was looking into jobs you can get with that degree but i don't necessarily want to be like a manager, or make like administrative decisions for companies. I'm just not sure lol what degrees go with what i'm talking about... if any of that makes sense 🫣",Chemical_Dog7998,1,1.0,1,1726434941,2024-09-15 21:15:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhnfzo/not_sure_what_major_i_should_go_into/,9,2024

1fhn9o7,Remote - Manager says don’t know where my job is going ,"Would love some advice. I feel like I’m intuitive enough to know what I need to do but I also overthink and over analyze everything. 

Back story I’ve been with my current company almost 3 years. I was hired around pandemic time as a remote analyst for a west coast company (I’m east coast). When I started I found out my coworker was going on maternity leave in a month and my manager was also retiring (her father was battling terminal disease) so I basically was thrown to the wolves. They got me for cheap because I was desperate but once they both left and I was doing the job that should’ve been 3 people I asked for a raise. They also switched me after a few months from hourly to salary(no additional pay increase). Fast forward a year in during review I got a bonus of $20k plus another raise. But I was still feeling under paid and overworked. My manager ends up coming back 1.5 years later as an independent contractor. I’m like hmm ok… why retire? They threw her a whole party. She was with the company for 20 something years. Then the beginning of this year the girl who trained me and was on maternity leave comes back part-time remote. 

During my review in Feb/March of this year, I asked my manager what is my path within the company for me to move up and take on more responsibilities. She’s like I’m not sure and the CEO doesn’t like remote managers but let me find out and get back to you. She never does and I don’t follow up. I had a great review and got the typical raise + bonus. Not as much as the year before though. At this time I was also getting hit up on LinkedIn for job opportunities. I ended up interviewing for a position and got the job with a 30k pay increase and manager position. I tell my current job and they say let me see if CEO will match. He doesn’t. At this point it was only verbal. I never signed anything. But in the end I decided to stay with the current 100% remote job because I have school aged kids I need the flexibility as a single mother sharing 50/50 custody. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago my managers calls me and says the part time girl is going in office and will be a manager. I was shocked. But decided not to say anything until I could cool down. She quickly says you won’t report to her you will continue to report to me. We had hired a new person so he would report to her. It was sitting heavy on my mind so next day I get on a call with her re-visiting my where does my position go from here. She’s like I honestly don’t know. She’s like I can’t tell you something I don’t know. She mentions again the CEO does not like remote managers. I was ready this time so I name off remote managers in other departments and also mention VP of our department is remote(she travels monthly to the office for a week). So I’m like so the rules only apply to OUR department and certain people? She’s like um well she’s higher up so she could be remote. She’s like that’s our policy. She’s like we’re trying to build our department in house. I’m getting pretty upset at this point because it’s not fair that it’s ok for other departments but not ours. And that she has no idea where my position is going. THEN she mentions I have no leadership qualities! This hurt me and I start crying on video because I’ve busted my butt implementing processes and holding down the fort when it was only me managing everything. And this NEVER came up in any of my reviews. She says we don’t want to lose you blah blah but yet is not looking out for me either. I just get vibes that she’s not genuine and has favoritism on top of them being upset about me almost leaving. On Friday she says they hired 2 new coordinators when before she said they were only hiring one now all of a sudden it’s 2? And my manager quickly moved back up from independent contractor to coming back full time as manager then senior manager and now she’s already Director all within a year. Obviously she has people looking out for her when she doesn’t know anything half the time. 

My other coworker I’m close with thinks they trying to push me out. He’s like the part time chick is not deserving of that promotion- it rightfully should be mine and that they are using the CEO’s name to say they don’t like remote managers. 

I just have a feeling they are going to let me go but are trying to see if I would leave on my own. The problem is I need the remote environment flexibility and I do love my job. 

Would love your perspective. Am I overthinking or does it look like she is just trying to sabotage my career?

1fhn2tw,What should I do?,"I currently have around £5,000 saved up.

I was made redundant a month or so ago from the best job I could ever ask for and nothing will probably ever come close, especially as there was only four of us employed there.

I got a job roughly two weeks later at a neighbouring company thinking it would be great, but wow, no, it's terrible and it's probably beyond slavery in that place.

Now, this manager, new manager, doesn't really work great and I don't think he likes me much as he didn't know me from next door and I think he will fail my probation in 6-7 weeks which will be my three months up.

What should I do? I was homeless at 16, no qualifications like GCSEs, did a bricklaying course for two years about 14 years ago at college and that's about it.

I have 10 years experience in retail and now I'm one of the few managers in this new store but I hate it, I want our of retail fast.

My bills amount to roughly £1,470 a month total.

I'm also on benefits to help with rent as rent is major where I am and I live in Housing Association.

If I fail probation, I'll be jobless and back to square one.

Any ideas? it's bringing back bad memories of being homeless, almost PTSD like.

1fhlnk1,"Hotel front office manager, opportunity to switch to F&B restaurant mgmt and start as AGM. Bad move or good move to keep climbing the ladder?","I am currently a front office manager at a 4 star downtown hotel in a destination city on the west coast. Total compensation is ~$100k (includes bonus). My goal has been to eventually be a GM of a downtown hotel where compensation will be between $150k-$250k. I am on that path and things have been going well. The hotel I’m at currently is actually a great work environment and I get along really well with everyone. No toxicity and a supportive GM. The work does include many long days and working holidays and weekends but that would be the same anywhere in this industry. 

Recently a recruiter reached out to me to be an AGM at an upscale chain restaurant (locations in US and Canada, rapidly expanding) with talks of being on a path to be a GM after 90 days, where my compensation would significantly increase with the upward end being $150k. Starting as an AGM my comp would be about the same as now. 

Realistically I have another 10 years before I have a shot at being a downtown hotel GM. Need to be a director of ops/rooms first for a few years. 

Should I consider making this switch? I do have F&B mgmt experience and am sure I could perform well but it is a drastic shift in career focus. The lure is I could be at a higher earning potential much quicker than my current pathway. The cons are probably even longer hours and working evenings. Right now I only work days. Also, I feel there might be less options to continue advancing past the restaurant gm position. 

My question is, is this a bad career move? Should I stay on my hotel gm path where the majority of my experience is and I am comfortable? Or do I take the risk and switch career focus to obtain that higher salary much quicker? But potentially dead end and be stuck working even longer hours and evenings? 

Is it worth considering? ",sixarmedspidey,1,1.0,2,1726430377,2024-09-15 19:59:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhlnk1/hotel_front_office_manager_opportunity_to_switch/,9,2024

i really want to get out but im not sure how i should do it. my end goal is to work in art acquisitions. my firm has a small PWM art division but they’re not hiring and switching from my current role would be challenging. 

so—- my lease ends in may of next year. here are the options of what i could do: 

- get a masters in art history / art business, find a job after school 

- leave GS for another analyst role at a bank with more of an art presence 

- work as an intern at a large auction house and hope to restart from the bottom again 

or..
- stay at GS and gain more experience to build up my resume even though it’s killing me inside

I was approached to work on a project for a new contract, to which I have unique skill sets for.   But it meant that I would need to leave the parent company and join the sister.     I did this and they explained that I would work on transition activities for the first year, and then move into an Account Management based role after.

I successfully completed my transition project and at the end of this, a new management team took over.   They did not honor my agreement with the prior management team and for months have refused to give me a role, ostracized me from the client and the internal team, not included me in any, not one meeting related to what I was supposed to be doing....     I ""fought"" back and opened a case w/ HR, but the results, were unsurprisingly ""Inconclusive"" - They gave me two menial tasks to do but I'm basically waiting for the axe to fall.

I believe I have a case for ""Constructive Dismissal"" wherein they are purposely trying to get me to quit by not giving me any work.   HR is absolutely useless, as they work for the corporation, and its a big global corporation so I think my chances of resolution to keep my job are slim to none.

Psychologically, I have been a mess.    I will be 65 next month and expected to work for another couple of years and now I'm being forced to go and look for another job as I can't financially retire yet.    I'm very very angry and have been depressed as I sit all day with nothing, absolutely nothing to do.     I can't believe that I thought so highly of this company at one time - all my performance reviews and even this year have been exemplary - but it all pales with knowing that I'm getting kicked out of an organization that I put my heart and soul into for so many years....   As someone else said on this site, I'm gutted.

1fhje26,Need advice.,"I need perspective/advice. I'm a bit lost in my career, and to be honest, life in general. (24M)

I don't know which direction in life to take, but weirdly at the same time feel like I don't have many options. I graduated from a small university (in the US) a couple years ago with a 4 year bachelors degree in interdisciplinary (fancy word for ""general"") studies. Looking back on it, a general studies degree doesn't seem to do much for me, since it specializes in absolutely nothing. At the time though, Covid was going on and everything was getting shut down - I also wasn't too focused on certain things (career, future, connections, internships, etc.). On top of that, I was told by an academic advisor that this degree would be a good option for someone who doesn't know what they are into just yet (which I can understand). Though I also got the sense from them that a general studies degree would actually be *better* than a specialized degree because I would be more well rounded. Furthermore, I naively believed that simply because I had a bachelors degree at all, I would then be guaranteed to find some type of good employment. It was all new to me, and I just didn't know what I didn't know. But, at the end of the day, I take full responsibility for my own mis-steps, lack of knowledge, and mistakes.

I'd like to think I've grown and gained some experience/wisdom since then, and now realize that: a college degree does *not* guarantee a good job, or even a job at all. Therefore I've also learned how important it is to plan ahead for my future.

One thing that I did do in my junior year, though, was start making art. I began training to hopefully make some money as an artist (Concept Artist/Illustrator/Graphic Designer). By the time I graduated, I was actually picking up small freelance jobs here and there, making some money off of it. After a few years of working really hard on developing my skills as an artist, I made many noticeable skill improvements (developed art skills). Unfortunately, to this day, this has yet to really turn into anything substantial or consistent financially - not even enough to pay the basic bills. I have yet to see much of a change in terms of my career/life. The art industry is a mess, AI (however you feel about it) is becoming more prominent in the art sector, and companies/people in general just don't seem to value art. To make things worse, I never fully took advantage of meeting new people, making connections, and building a network to help me out. 

Earlier this year, after seeing no real progress with the art career opportunities, I started applying to many different jobs that had at least above minimum wage salaries. Unfortunately, I've had no luck with that either. Some interviews, but nothing to come out of them. At this point I've had to apply to at least 500 jobs.

So now, I feel stuck. Stuck in a geographical location which isn't ideal, and where there isn't a ton of opportunity. Stuck with no real income to do anything about it. Stuck with a feeling of going in circles, rather than seeing some actual progress and advancement in life.

I'm not sure if maybe I should go to grad school in another state, locking down focus on an in-demand, somewhat enjoyable career path - (which would also help me move out of my current location, while working towards a masters degree). Or if I should just double down with the arts, picking up a low paying local job in the meantime, just to get by, while continuing to build my art portfolio - hoping that one day I'll get a job as an artist, and finally have financial freedom to create the life I want, move where I want to move, etc.

By no means am I trying to have a pity party, or anything like that. I'm just ready to start developing my career, and start seeing growth. Any thoughts/perspective is appreciated, and I wish everyone the best along their own journey.",Low_Bit8655,1,1.0,1,1726424721,2024-09-15 18:25:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhje26/need_advice/,9,2024

1fhizi5,Job Hopping when the music stops,"To begin with, I am a millennial snowflake. I fully absorbed the idea that jumping jobs is how you get raises. I'm in a pretty niche med-tech sales field and 2014 - 2022 I had 2 jobs at massive corporations. I was great (and lucky) at both, getting promotions and made Presidents Club multiple times. 

My overinflated ego lead me to leave at the end of 2022 to go make my fortunes with a start-up with big equity package. Oops. First start up was a disaster, and I left after 6 months for another start-up, which closed after 6 months and I moved to another start-up and stayed 12 months and left seeing the shit about to hit the fan, which it did. Started at a new start-up and just received a severance package after 7 months. 

  
Now that the labor market is tighter, jumping is totally holding me back. Even my network views me as a liability. Each move made sense in a vacuum, but put them together and I'm a loose cannon. 

1. A lesson to you whisper-snappers out there, don't be afraid to jump for a better opportunity, but you should absolutely be vetting these jumps and not get blinded by the comp package. 

2. I'd love to hear how this group has handled too jumping. And for what it's worth, I promise I won't do it again. ",Rorschachs_Cat,19,0.8500000238418579,8,1726423701,2024-09-15 18:08:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhizi5/job_hopping_when_the_music_stops/,9,2024

1fhi9gb,Is this sign of a toxic political culture? Can I please get some help?,"
I am working with a financial services firm and myself having 12 years of experience in tax and finance. I honestly joined the firm because the CIO said that I will shape your career and you’re in safe hands so long as we work together. This was a new role but basis that comfort I was ready to take the plunge. However, I was assigned under his reportee who is my boss. In my very first week he said if you can work as per my process and objectives then fine otherwise you are welcome to leave. Next month he compared me to an associate and told me that I’d be better off hiring an associate. The month after that he threatened that he would remove me and spoil my year end appraisal and even my super boss (because of whom I joined) could not do anything about it. Now he threatened me again about bad appraisals. All of this is because I work for both my immediate and my super boss.

I told my super boss about all of this but he said don’t worry, I am here to protect you and you are doing a good job so if I am happy it’s fine. But he said you should take it up with HR and he didn’t talk with my boss directly. I got to know from a third party that my boss had been giving negative feedback about me to him but everytime I asked my super boss he just said your boss thinks you are good but require polishing. 

It doesn’t make any sense to me? Is this a political drama and when the actual time comes I feel my super boss won’t take my side? What should I do?

Hi everyone,

I’m 30 (F) years old, based in Europe, and I’ve been working in sales for the past 5 years. I have a bachelor’s degree in psychology, but I haven’t practiced psychology since I graduated. Recently, I’ve been reflecting on my career path and considering pursuing a master’s degree in psychology to shift back into the field.

I’m particularly interested in helping people with mental health challenges or working with clients on behavioral changes. However, I’m not sure what specific career opportunities are available after earning a master’s in psychology, especially after being away from the field for so long. 

For those who have pursued a master’s in psychology or have experience in the field, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What kind of career opportunities can I expect, and is it a worthwhile investment at this point in my life and career?

Are there any tools or strategies to keep this organized and make sure you're not missing opportunities? Thanks in advance for the advice!",namlbxpro,6,1.0,4,1726410047,2024-09-15 14:20:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhdmav/how_do_you_manage_i_owe_you_one_in_a_professional/,9,2024
1fhd18d,Promoted to senior manager and not sure I want it,"I was already looking for other jobs for some time as I was completely burned out, so this came as a surprise to me. Apparently I inherited the position as the previous SM was fired. 

I feel like I am just not ready to take this step yet as I was already mentally checked out for some time. I also have to sign a new contract next week that extends my notice period to 6 months incase I leave. 

Not sure how to play this as I am completely caught off guard. Is quitting my only option now or should I bite the bullet and accept the promotion?",asji4,0,0.5,7,1726408422,2024-09-15 13:53:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fhd18d/promoted_to_senior_manager_and_not_sure_i_want_it/,9,2024
1fhcey4,Quarter Life Crisis - Big 4 consulting to where? Open to anything adventurous across the globe,"Just another late 20s girl going through a quarter life crisis (mostly career based). Seeking advice from anyone and everyone both personally and professionally.  
  
Some backstory: the typical high school high achiever story - lots of friends, easily got good grades, basically went through no hardship. Was pretty good at maths/science, so generally not 100% sure if I enjoyed it because I actually liked it, or because I was good at it. I went to uni and studied Commerce (major in Accounting) and Law as I got the grades, and that's essentially the only reason as I didn't particularly enjoy reading/writing at the time. I contemplated making a switch to engineering half way through but decided against it as it was going to add a fair few years to my degree. When I finished my degree, I bought more time before having to start my career (massive feelings of dread) by travelling for a year in Canada. The only reason I returned home is because I had hunted agressively for a job that could potentially be okay - essentially the best option that was somewhat near what I studied/corporate world.  
  
Now: I've worked 2 years in consulting in a big firm, predominantly in renewables (mostly buying/selling projects and financial/commercial advice for their development). I find the content reasonably interesting on days where something more unique is happening (i.e. meeting with government re the dire state of the grid and what has to change, company trying to figure out how to use their assets to support the indigenous communities in the area). But 95% of the time, there is constant record playing in my head: ""what am I doing here?"", ""what the f\*\*\* am I doing with my life?"", ""I hate my job."" whilst I feel a physical sickness for maybe 50% of the days. This has probably been going on for 6 months. I think this may come from feeling like my job is a bit worthless - consultants or notoriously full of sh\*\* and i absolutely agree with that that, it feels like we are slimy real estate agents but for renewables projects. I doubt my job adds really that much value to its customers, let alone to society more broadly. It's a bit of a snobby industry (just as its got a greater barrier to entry as its so technical), which I really don't enjoy in some of the people I work with. I feel very burnt out, when strangely I don't really work that many hours (generally 9-5). Also not paid amazingly for the work I do which provides some additional frustration - as I started my career so late I am pretty careful with money to get my savings up which is a bit exhausting in itself.   
  
I don't think I've ever had a feeling this strong about anything. I'm not really sure if it's an internal problem (mindset) or external (the job itself), but these feelings are seeping into other areas of my life. I'm a huge sport lover and at one of my recent soccer matches I had to stop playing at half time as I had a breakdown (which I recognise is pretty damn weird - you wouldn't normally see me dead doing that). I feel like I have no spark in my life anymore (am seeing a therapist). Luckily I have a few big chunks of leave coming up to break up over the next few months as I figure out what I want to do.   
  
Most obviously, I intend on quitting. But keen for any advice to work through the short term, or broader wisdom for my life!  
  
For my next step, I'm so open to anything and am resorting to reddit as a trusty reliable source for a broader range of ideas and opinions beyond the people around me on a similar trajectory. Note that I've reached my uni loan maximum (from Australia), so more study isn't really an option. I'm probably more focussed on ideas that have some strong personal and/or professional growth element to them (I've done a Canadian ski season and 2 x uni exchanges which were fun but A LOT of partying). When I've chatted to my friends about what might be going wrong, they tend to say that I went down a more traditional path because I was succeeding at it (in the form of academics in high school) and my parents wanted that, but they think I probably understate how creative I am (I was shocked by this as one of them freelances at Vogue as a creative!) and that I'm a deep thinker. I frustratingly wasn't brought up valuing creative outlets (like music or drama) so don't really have many skills like that.   
  
Some ideas floating through my mind that may give you an idea of what I'm looking for (bonus if there's reasonable money behind it, but not a necessity):

* Making the most of my working holiday visa options (while I'm U30) - super interested in Spain, Argentina, Chile, Germany, Korea! Not sure what jobs I'd be interested in - but pretty open to anything that is just unique (so it kind of engages/challenges me with how different it is). Doesn't need to be something behind a screen/books - I'm also trying to figure out if a job more on the ground would suit me! 2 x part time jobs would be so fun, and/or freelance. When I worked in Canada people worked in really remote areas (with all their accom and food paid for) for 6 months at a time which always seemed like an interesting way to live and to save up for an idea that might have a costly barrier to entry.
* I have a UK passport and have always been interested in film (although tbh wouldn't classify myself as a film buff in the technical way, just more so am wowed by unique movie concepts and the form of expression). I've been told I'm a good writer (although in the work report kind of way), but used to write little novels when I was a small kid. Not sure if there's someway that I could explore this, noting I'd be incredibly scared and EXTREMELY out of my comfort zone as I'm so scared of my efforts being seen by others (i.e. performing, i struggle a lot in my sports with this) - which even if it fails might teach me some valuable lessons. I also have a friend who is a 2nd editor in pretty big films in London, so could potentially find a way into entry level roles from there.
* Working at a US uni (apparently the most likely US institutions to offer visas) as a research assistant in economics (could try to leverage my renewables background, a couple of economics projects I've worked on, my law degree and the global brand of my consulting firm to get a job!).
* I've heard of scholarships funded by high net worth individuals to go to unis around the world (that are awarded independent of the uni themselves). Someone at my job did this for a Masters in some sort of global policy in China. I'd love to study pure maths, or astrophysics or economics but I think this could be quite challenging to get unless anyone knows of anything! 
* There are some people I know who work their normal job feb - nov, and then work as a commentator/director during the Australian Open. If theres any way that I could leverage my skills to work at some kind of major sporting event I think that'd be awesome as well.
* maybe something to do with journalism in NYC? I assume this is impossible to do? I'm going to apply for the green card lottery for the next couple of years.  
* Some kind of job in Africa with the UN, a thinktank, a charity on the ground or something if these kinds of roles are accessible.

1fhb7ye,"Stressed about what people think of me at work, and it’s made my QOL significantly worse off..","

I love my job, even more than I thought I would before doing my MBA. I’m doing meaningful work that helps people, even in a small way. What I do affects so many people. It fires on all the things I’m really good at, especially planning and strategy.  Very little of my actual work gives me any meaningful stress, whether it’s conducting large meetings, presenting to leadership, extremely ambitious deadlines….none of the actual work I do consumes me after work.

What I don’t love though and does consume me afterwards? Worrying about if I have a job in a couple months because someone doesn’t like my attitude or the way I speak (as that’s happened to me in my previous job, and starting to see signs of it happening again).

Everything in my career I’ve noticed post MBA is about face: the people who move up internally are ones that are well liked by the organization. Everyone in the org has to hob nob their way to promotions. You’re encouraged to setup coffee chats with people above you that you never work with.

Which is fine, I thought that would be easy…but I feel that I’m being judged in these 30 minute little interactions constantly. How I eat (I’m a messy eater). How I sit (I know nothing about ‘good habits’ of posture). And I’ve been able to tell these interactions have not always gone well, and all I’ve been doing is having nonchalant conversations about their career and asking vanilla questions. Yet my unconscious body language f***s me up.

And it’s not just these coffee chats you’re ’encouraged’ to have: my boss has to love me as a person (and I can tell she likes my work…does not like me). My boss boss has to like me (he does). And my boss boss boss (head of the entire region) has to like me.

All these people have to ‘like you’, and it’s all a giant popularity contest vs your actual work. And this is my second company post MBA at a F100.

I didn’t have any of these problems pre MBA - I worked for smaller companies and small teams. You did your job and you went home. That’s it. You didn’t make best friends at work and weren’t expected to. I was just bored of my previous career and wanted to do something more meaningful. 

I don’t have a mentor or anyone in my family to lean on who has had a successful career (1st gen who got a secondary degree, and for all intents and purposes 1st gen college degree since my dad got his after 2 decades). I come from a working class background, and ever since the MBA I dont fit. Didn’t fit my MBA cohort, and don’t fit post mba people. I don’t act posh enough to even a slight degree.

And I don’t know if it comes from chronic childhood bullying or being fortunate in being raised by parents who accepted me no matter what I did so I never felt compelled to change who I was for other people….but I just don’t want to people please for the sake of moving up on my career.

I’m thinking of making a switch to much smaller companies, because the stress of worrying what people think of me is giving me mad amounts of anxiety, and I’m tired of going to a job that I enjoy only to be undone by the stress of a 1:1 with my boss. I’m also getting a bit bored with my tasks being 3 years out. I want a challenge in my work now that I’ve done about everything my role can offer without a move up. Even if my career gets harmed long term or if I get paid less. I don’t care. I’m over it, and I don’t care about the ‘status’ of working at such a world renowned organization.

My question is: am I crazy? Is there anyone else who felt the same things at the level I’m at, and did switching to smaller companies help?

1fha1i7,"Within 2 months at my new job, I realized that I wanted to go back to my old company","I spent 5 years at my old company and worked on a nice project, the team I was part of was wonderful and in 5 years, I more than doubled my salary, got promoted and had nice perks (monetary). I qlso built a nice reputation and everyone liked me. Then, as I started feeling comfortable and had a team, I felt like I was becoming useless. The company was nice but not perfect l. I was frustrated by many things. We also didnt have the option to WFH knowing that my husband does and has more flexible hours. I used to come home late and it would be difficult to manage house chores after a long day at work.
So I started considering for a job with a WFH option without being too active. One day, a partner with whom I work offered me their job since they were getting promoted. They do hybrid and the package they offered me was nice. I accepted. Quitting was hard but my old manager was understanding, since I told them that I wanted to explore new horizons in a different environment but that I was open to coming back in the future. 
Now it’s been more than 2 months that I’ve been in this new company and I’m so depressed and regretful for quitting my old job. This new job has a lot of pressure despite having flexible hours and WFH twice a week. Yes I get to spend more time with my husband but the job itself has been challenging for me and I feel 0 passion for it compared to my old job. I’m also working solo and I’m responsible for my own objectives, so this makes me feel lonely and stressed. I didn’t think twice and called my manager telling them how much I regret changing jobs. We have a good relationship so they were willing to help but my old job was no longer available. They promised to help and already talked to his director about my situation. They weren’t against the idea of taking me back and they might contact me for some new opportunity. I’m not sure if I’ll get the job since it’s something different from what I used to do and I’m afraid it might end up being challenging for me, but I’m thinking at least I’ll get to work with people I know and I know the company well. Now in the meantime, I can’t help but feel super anxious and regretful for losing my old job and ruining my vacations ( I was supposed to take them this September). I’m also afraid of my new employer’s reaction and I only have 3 weeks left before my trial period ends. If my old employer offers me a job and I accept after the trial period ends, I’ll have to wait one month before quitting instead one week. Also I just can’t bear to do this job anymore. I’ve been slacking off this past week because of the depression. I just feel 0 motivation. What if I dont get to go back to my old company? If I do, what if I don’t like the new job? How long will they come back to me? How can I motivate myself to continue to do my work at my actual job, knowing that there’s a lot to do? 
I know I should be grateful that my old company hasn’t rejected me completely and I’m hopeful that they’d offer me a chance to go back, but I can’t help feeling all these emotions. I’m a very emotional person and I tend to overthink a lot specially over things I cant control. 

And this experience taught me that I’m not good with change and I just want stability in life, specially now that I’m married and want one day to have kids. I also don’t want a job with a lot of stress or at least that I don’t share the burden alone (aka I’d rather work with a team)

Just wanted to rant here and share my thoughts and feelings. ",gorome,8,0.7799999713897705,12,1726398464,2024-09-15 11:07:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fha1i7/within_2_months_at_my_new_job_i_realized_that_i/,9,2024

1fh8wwh,I don't know what to do with my life and I need advice on what Degree or path I should take what should I do?,"(I take Sociology, Psychology and Business studies for Alevel currently)

Not going to lie I thought I had it figured out but then did further research Business is my struggling subject and I didn't really ever consider getting a degree in it and so my first choice was psychology it seemed interesting and I do well and enjoy it but now picking universities is a hassle and the more I looked at work, careers and degrees to do something relating in psychology I get stressed out that I might choose something wrong and waste that time and debt on something that won't benefit me in life.

I understand that it's okay to not understand what I want to do and all but after reading people's opinions I realised that psychology may not be useful which was originally what I wanted to study in uni since I'm pretty good at it now but if it isn't too flexible with career as a bachlors degree then I'm not sure what I should choose but I still do want to go to uni the new problem is what to take..

So out of curiosity I want to ask whether this Alevel mix is good and for what degrees? And whether psychology could help me get into other jobs not specifically therapeutic ones if I just do a bachelor degree since I know you need to do far higher to be a counsellor or therapist.


-i also don't feel like I'd be happy with an apprenticeship some of my friends advised this but if I'm honest I'm not an overly sociable person and if feel like uni will help be become more independent and social so I want to go to uni.

This year I'm getting my business administration degree and I would like to know if combining it with biology is possible. Biology has always been my passion and it's something I want to work on it. 
There are a few options I can do:
1. Master in biomedical sciences
2. Master in biodiversity and ecology
3. Minor in biology/ biomedical engineering
Or just a second major in biology

The problem is I'm not sure exactly what jobs I can get besides health care administration. Also.. it's been a while I had any biology course, would it be possible for me to complete the program? 
What career paths do you recommend? (with biology or not)

1fh8hpk,Breaking Free from Tech: Is a Culinary Career Change Worth the Risk?,"Hey Reddit,

So, I'm in a bit of a pickle. I'm a final year [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) Computer Science student, and let's just say the whole ""stare at a screen all day"" thing isn't exactly setting my soul on fire. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the stability and career options a CS degree offers, but three internships in, and all I feel is a soul-crushing level of desk-job depression.

Here's the kicker: coding wasn't even my passion from the start. Family and relatives pushed me towards it, and frankly, young me wasn't exactly bursting with self-awareness. The truth is, I've always been way more into the world of food. Cooking is my therapy, my creative outlet – it just sparks joy in a way coding never has.

So, here I am, with a degree almost finished, and a burning desire to pursue a career in culinary arts. I've even found a fantastic school for a Masters program! The problem? That nagging 40% of me whispering ""what if?"" What if I take the plunge, invest in this new path, and it all falls apart? But then the other 60% kicks in, reminding me of the daily dread that comes with a career I'm not passionate about.

So, Reddit fam, I'm reaching out. Anyone out there make a similar leap of faith? Did it pay off? Any advice for someone with a CS background wanting to trade code for knives?

1fh7vsw,"my job makes me want to die, i feel stuck in it","*i curse a lot in this so please don't read if that bothers u*

hi. i don't live in the US so please keep in mind that the culture may be different but i do work at a US-nonprofit with offices in my country.

i'm 24 years old.

i graduated college first on my class for English Language and Literature and didn't really know what to do as I didn't want to be a teacher, after painstakingly job hunting and getting rejections every single day my friend's sister referred me to a job at an iNGO and i got it after some rounds of interviews. it is an amazingly well paying job, for context i make double what my mother made and she was a teacher at a private school for 10 years. i live alone, i make good money, better than almost anyone, i have benefits, for example i go to therapy almost for free to talk to a therapist about how suicidal my job makes me.

my supervisor was on leave for almost the whole first month after i started. i wasn't really trained for anything, technically a fresh graduate with no Non profit experience, the way she teaches me things is basically making me sit next to her and watch her do work. she gives me things to do with little to no explanation and then months later she'll realize i did something wrong. for example i work on a report every month and 5 months in she realized i didn't do something on the excel sheet she never told me about, there are so many stories like that.

as a fresh grad i just didn't know how to handle the situations and blamed myself. now i've been here for a little over a year. 13 month salary. amazing healthcare. good on my resume. i am currently on leave because we have to finish up my annual leaves and she messaged me about how i ""misunderstood"" my leaves, and i didn't understand what she meant but i think she assumes i took too many leaves which is incorrect.... but i'll have to explain it to her. whenever i go on leave or get sick she always finds something wrong with something and i go back to a long meeting. but for weeks and weeks i sit in the office on my ass and do absolutely nothing

the problem with this job is i virtually do nothing. i'm an officer but she treats me more like a secretary, a filler for when she doesn't want to complete certain tasks. i am so completely lost every day that i just go to work and try to make shit up or pretend i'm busy so no body notices how useless i am. i go home exhausted and virttually all i do is rest so i can survive the next day of work. i just wait for the weekend.... thats all i do. i wait for the weekend so i can get a break

i have been applying to jobs, mass applying, for months, have barely scored interviews and when i do i get ghosted after. i feel stuck because i live alone and have pretty much no savings. i don't want to quit or tell my family and have them have to spend money on me. i really don't know what to do and i don't know how to survive any of this. i wish i could just like my job, not love it just like it, just simply UNDERSTAND it and understand whats needed from me but i simply don't. i feel like a loser, a mess, and when i go to work, i just feel infantilized, i am the youngest in the office and they all joke about me being young all the time. i feel stupid and i feel like everyone there also thinks i'm stupid

i just don't know what to do anymore, i tried everything, i tried applying for jobs i tried interviewing i figured i could survive on a smaller salary but nothing is coming up, it feels like nothing is going to get better",Inner_Edge_2291,2,1.0,0,1726389119,2024-09-15 08:31:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fh7vsw/my_job_makes_me_want_to_die_i_feel_stuck_in_it/,9,2024

It is not bad, the pay is good, we have hybrid work but I think I am wasting my time solving tickets. I don’t want to solve custom tickets for the rest my days. 

I want to attend a specialisation course to be a payroll specialist.

1fh6t64,"I hate my job, but I feel stuck","I work at the nicest restaurant in my city, making REALLY good money, and only have to work 3 days a week to make ends meet. The problem is, I am absolutely miserable. I have been working there for 3 years and it was always the plan to leave once I graduated college. 

I finally graduated but finding another job has been a struggle. It is taking me much longer than I anticipated, and I truly just want to be out of my current position. It is a toxic environment with horrible management and it truly does not serve me anymore.

1fh5w2n,Should I do an MPA/MPP?,"Hi everyone,

I completed my BA Economics (Hons) from Delhi University, India, and have 2 years of experience in management consulting. My work so far has involved projects in banking, and media industries and a bit of work in the development space. However, I’ve realized that management consulting isn’t where my true interests lie (except for the development project I did). I’m much more passionate about working in the development and public sector space.

With this in mind, I’m considering pursuing an MPA or MPP from the US/UK to shift my career towards working with NGOs or development organizations (though I’m still exploring which specific area). I would appreciate some advice on a few things:

1. Between an MPA and MPP, which degree would be more suited for my goals?
2. What kinds of job positions could I expect post-MPA/MPP? (I’m not particularly interested in government jobs in the US or UK).
3. As an international student, would I face any challenges in the job market in the US/UK?",CatGlittering7392,1,1.0,0,1726380552,2024-09-15 06:09:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fh5w2n/should_i_do_an_mpampp/,9,2024

1fh46t9,"Tired of Ghosted Applications, I Built My Own Job Board","Hey Everyone, 

I've always admired those creating amazing things with AI. Last week, I watched an 8-year-old build a webpage using AI tools like Cursor, and it hit me hard. Here I was, working in tech, yet never truly building anything outside my job. I realized that if I didn’t start now, I might never take advantage of the incredible tools at our disposal. 

When I began job hunting, I was relentlessly applying to hundreds of listings each day, only to receive a few responses—mostly regrets. It felt like a broken system. That’s when I shifted my approach. Instead of applying to jobs blindly, I started reaching out directly to HR managers on LinkedIn. The results were night and day—real responses, faster processing. 

I wanted to make this process easier for others. So, I built a job board using AI, curating job posts directly from LinkedIn and Twitter (X) from hiring managers, HRs through their posts. These jobs feel more genuine and get quicker attention. 

Check out the board and let me know your thoughts! If you find it helpful, please upvote and share.

1fh3ypm,How to network with and find potential future mentors?,"Hi!

I’m wondering how do people network with others, find mentors mentors or groups, etc. to help them advance in their careers. Say I'm an not a total beginner in something like ecom or b2b sales (anything really), but not yet enough to produce amazing results - how should I go about networking with those people? I live in a super small city where I don’t have physical access to industry professionals, so I’m wondering how to approach this.

For those of you who’ve found mentors who helped you level up, where did you start? Some things I’m curious about:

* **Where to Look**
* **How to Approach**: How do you reach out to potential mentors without feeling like you’re imposing?
* **Maintaining the Relationship**: Once you connect with someone, how do you keep that mentorship going and make it mutually beneficial? Anyt tips on what I could offer in return?
* **I'd prefer for it to be something I can pay with my time instead of it being a monetary exchange**

I'm Ryan, 17.5 years old, from the Fiji Islands. I'm looking for guidance on how to join one of the toughest military branches, such as the Navy SEALs or the Marines, for a period of 4 to 8 years. I would really appreciate any help with visa applications and processes, including links (as my knowledge in this area is quite limited).

A little background about me: I run a small computer business and have a YouTube channel. English is my first language, and while I'm very fluent, my spelling might not always be perfect. I consistently score the highest in computer science.

After my military service, I plan to attend university to study criminology, with the goal of joining the FBI. Any advice on how to transition from military service to university and eventually into the FBI would be incredibly helpful.

I’ve been actively looking for a new and most importantly - stable job. Plus, this job is based off hourly wage which isn’t great for my current situation and my future goals.

I was advised by several people not to discuss about what I’m doing until I get a job line up then put 2 weeks in. Anyway, she asked me if I’m looking for a new job which of course I was being honest with her and told her I am. She clearly wasn’t happy to hear and basically told me she’ll be looking for someone to replace my spot. She even told me if she finds someone else before I get a job line up then she will let me go…

1fh2ixd,Choosing between nursing and automotive ,"Currently I am about to finish my first term of an accelerated ADN nursing program at ecpi. I had a quick scare with my grades, and still kind of am. I am attending using the last of a gi bill which can cover the rest, but nothing extra. 

I have spent 7 months working in quicklube while I was going to school full time for automotive. I ended up getting burnt out as they weren’t giving me the opportunity to learn more at work, and did not give me pay raises as I was told from going to school while everyone else attending school got them. The burn out got too much as I was giving everything for my career yet got nothing in return. I tried switching shops but that didn’t go well and then called it quits. 

If my grade is too low, I can’t take the hit to my income and will have to drop out and pursue another career which would be automotive. But this idea is an itch I can’t get rid of and would almost be happy to fail, even though I will make sure I will try my hardest and pass this class. 

I feel upset that I was given the gi bill from my father because it made college not a choice but a necessity for me, even though I’ve been against the idea of college for as long as I can remember and have only gotten more bitter the longer I do it.

New to this sub and migrating over from consulting to a new position as a Senior Business Analyst at one of the Big 3 in commercial real estate in Mountain View, CA. I still haven’t signed my offer letter yet and was wondering if I should take the job if I’m moving from Chicago and have a tech consulting background. Everything I’ve been told is that I would be working on an ongoing project for a Fortune 500 tech and social media client doing facilities management, automation and workflow optimization, tech stack refreshing, and reporting/dashboarding. 

The pay is decent with a title bump and pay bump at a global firm with great brand recognition and client work but I’m worried about being laid off given the current environment for commercial real estate and recent rising vacancy rates especially in the Bay Area. It would be a good chunk of change to move out there from Chicago and I don’t want to move if the CRE market is dwindling and these big companies are catching a falling knife. This company has been through some layoffs the past few quarters in the area and I don’t know if I want to risk it if I don’t have to.

Well after going through training, the owner of the shop made some very….odd comments about me. They suggested some of the other instructors to give me a pep talk bc my face gives “mean girl” or they are suggesting that because I can’t attend class during work hours (mind you it has always been clear that I have a 9-5) that I auditioned as a personal goal and they don’t think that I really want it or I need to be more chatty. It’s clear that they are just making stuff up to pick w me about. 

Honestly hearing this ruined everything for me, I wanted to teach cycle since the day I started and now I don’t even want to go into the studio anymore. I don’t need the job so I don’t care about quitting but how can I quit and still stick around as a member? They’ve already said so many things about how I wasn’t passionate enough and that I’m a mean person (which I know i’m not, i think that now that i’m on their “team” i just don’t look or act like them if you get what i’m saying) I don’t want to say “Hey i’m not doing this anymore” bc i don’t want to go into class everyday with all of the instructors side eyeing me with an “i told you so”.

In all honesty, I love cycle but the whole talking behind my back as SOON as I start training gives me a horrible vibe. I don’t need the job so I won’t stay for it.

generally, me and the CEO really hit it off, discussing my previous experience, industry-related issues, and just joking around, to the point where the HR lady was like “hey, [CEO name], we’ve got another call scheduled and we’re late for it, let’s wrap it up”, and the CEO told her to go start without him and we chatted for some more time, just enjoying the discussion. he said he liked my vibe a lot, and that he thought I’d fit well with the rest of the team. 

one day later, they contacted me again, asking for one more call. on the call, they said they’ve rounded it up to 3 great candidates - me and two other people - and they can’t choose now, hence one more round of calls. 
we discussed salary expectations and hours in more detail, then the CEO asked me some more questions, the vibe was just as great as before, he even asked me for some professional insights on some of his ideas for the future of the project. then, he opened my test task again and was like “well, I’m reading it again rn, and I can’t find anything wrong with it, for the life of me”, we laughed about that. after that, they told me they’d get back to me in the beginning of the next week. 

I feel like my chances are pretty good, but I thought I’d be a no brainer choice, based on the general vibe of the interview and the fact that I’ve got a shit ton of experience that’s perfect for the role. the salary expectations I told them are on the higher side, but nothing too crazy. what’s up with the “the three of you are so great” thing? could it be some sort of a low balling tactic?

I've worked at my company for 3.5 years as a Data Migration Analyst, and was promoted to a Senior Data Migration Analyst about 8 months ago. My day-to-day generally involves:

* Migrating customer data to our software (working with SQL and JSON files)
* Attending daily Dev-Ops meetings and doing tasks in that area (ie. shell scripting, database management) on both AWS and Azure, although we are moving exclusively to AWS shortly 
* Lead a team of 3 other Data Migration Analysts
* Doing custom requests on customer DB's (SQL scripting for their large updates)
* Handle miscellaneous requests for other departments

I did my undergraduate degree in Data Analytics & Finance, with minors in CS and IT. I also have a Masters in Data Science. 

My dilemma is that I feel that I am a master of none. I have a lot of general skills, such as SQL, Cloud Technologies and Database Management, but I'm not an expert. I also have a strong background in stats, ML and python/r programming from my undergrad/graduate degrees - all of which are not being used. 

I enjoy what I do, but I want to follow a path where I'll make more money and have hard skills that contribute to a strong resume. 

I'm currently trying to weigh my options:

1. Deep dive into cloud technologies and become an expert in cloud engineering or something along those lines
2. Improve my python programming skills and focus in data engineering
3. Try to get back to my roots and find work in DA/DS/BI since it's the bulk of what I studied",HercHuntsdirty,1,1.0,0,1726350850,2024-09-14 21:54:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fgwzv5/tech_worker_feeling_lost_which_path_should_i/,9,2024
1fgwxgb,29 Year old just turned down internal promotion not sure what to do now?,"I graduated in 2018 with a Mechanical Engineering degree from a T50 program. I failed to do any internships in that period. I ended up landing an R&D engineer at a small medical device contract manufacturer making 55k year. They were owned by a small-medium sized privately held plastics manufacturing company. After a year there I was offered the opportunity to take over the corporate quality and operational excellence departments after the original one died unexpectedly. I took that and ran quality operations across 6 plants dealing with both the FDA and ATF ( had a medical device and firearms division) and managed a team of 3 industrial engineers on continuous improvement projects. I did all of this for 75k year while managing engineers that made 15-20k more than me.

After 2 years, I was denied a raise and left for a Mid-Cap Medical Device and pharmaceutical manufacturer as a Quality Systems manager of supply chain for 90k + 10% bonus. After 18 months I was promoted to Regional Quality Systems manager - supply chain. That brought me up to $97k + 12% bonus.

In that time, I got my CSSBB, PMP, and CQM/OE. I identified a large number of severe gaps correcting them all and led 3 continuous improvement projects that combined decreased shipping errors by 88%. I also finished my MEM in August as well became a certified professional engineering manager.

I just recently identified a huge process gap in a new business segment and lead the recovery project that brought the process up to acceptable capacity with 34% less labor than was utilized at launch. This gap resulted in the termination of two directors. I was identified earlier in the year as rising star and high flight risk. I was approached last month for a promotion that would, "" properly utilize my skillset and bring me up to compensation I deserved."" I was also old that two senior directors were fighting over getting me on their team. I was told to apply for Senior technical program manager and that I would need to be fielded against external candidates to not be limited to the 7% promotion raise limit. I explained during early interviews that I would be looking for a base salary in the 130k-150k range. I was told this was doable. I completed all interviews and was offered the position. The offer was $111k + 1 time 6k retention bonus + 15% annual bonuses. I respectfully declined and told them I would not be interested in anything outside of the range specified earlier in the process. They retracted my candidacy ended up not filling the position after 3 other candidates declined offers and have reposted it as a technical project manager (3 pay grades below the original posting and 2 below my current position. I have applied to a variety of senior program, product, and quality manager positions. I have been filtered out by a surprising number of them after only a few days with no contact.

1fgw03b,When do I tell my boss I’m moving?,"In about 8 months I’ll be moving 2000 miles away with my fiancé. I’m slated to finish my degree in accounting in April and will also need to start looking for my first job in accounting in the area I’m moving to.

My boss doesn’t even know I’m in school to change careers. 

I have to tell them at some point because they will see my LinkedIn when I publish my new degree, and when I start applying for jobs there is the chance they start to get calls about my employment. 

What is holding me back is obviously I don’t want to get demoted or replaced before I’m ready since I need the money.

1fgvn4h,Should i choose computer science or finance as a career?,"I am currently 18 years old and will go to university in 2 years (Finland). I am interested in studying computer science or finance, both would probably be studied with the other as a minor subject on the side.

Which path should i pick when taking into consideration that i would finish university in 7 years from now? I am also open to the idea of working in another country. Switzerland would obviously be the dream especially when comparing salaries to Finland.

I am currently studying in a special highschool which will allow me to go straight into computer science. I like what i have been studying but probably not enough to want to do hours of my own unpaid projects in my freetime just to get that first job. Do you think the competetiveness will become less of a problem during the next 5-10 years? Does finance have the same problem?

Currently i am leaning towards getting a degree as Master of Economic Sciences since it will probably be more valuable than a degree in computer science. I can still take university courses on computer science on the side as well.

1fgvcim,Im not sure if its worth giving up the cozy sunshine and grinding in the cold. PLZ Halp,"Hi there!

I'm considering moving to Redmond from San Diego and I'm not sure if I'm making a mistake. I work in a small company making low six figures and life is not that stressful, and its a relatively stable position. Sometimes the pay can't justify the workload but I have flex schedule and can consistently put in about 45 hours and take Friday off on occasion. I can go to the beach on the weekends and the weather is nice, and there's lots to do so work life balance is definitely there. What I can't get over is the fact that I can't buy a house around here and things start feeling pointless.

I'm looking at Kuiper, Blue Origin or Space X in that area and it seems like the offers I would receive would basically double my salary (base + sign on + stock options) for the next four years, and then go back to mid six figures unless I get promoted and such. I'd be uprooting my life and risking it for the biscuit.

What I'm trying to figure out is whether or not this decision would ruin my life. I'm concerned about a few things and maybe someone else experienced similar career moves:

1. Work Life Balance: I'm guessing that it would be 12 hour days, maybe even weekends. Is this worth it for double the savings? Is it sustainable?
2. Stability: If I move there, Im note sure if its stable for the foreseeable future
3. PIP: I read that Amazon can be brutal, and could let you go within 6 months or one year if the performance isn't met. Seeing that its like a startup, the bar is so high (12 hour days, wearing many hats), I'm worried that I'd either have to work myself sick or get let go if I can't slave away. What are your thoughts on this?
4. Management: I feel that management is always sleazy and don't know the details that go into engineering something. I don't want to get stuck in a terrible mental state - wondering if I can be a good engineer without worrying about mind games that adds onto the stress
5. I feel that it's not worth moving there unless I could last at least five years. I'm thinking about getting married and having kids before the five years are up. Do you think this is possible given that FAANG like companies work employees to the bone

It's always been a dream of mine to work on something as high impact as Kuiper and it seems like I have a shot given that this is the only project that seems to be consistently hiring.

Sorry for the wall of text

1fguu9o,Manager changing rota daily...,"Hello, I currently live in the UK.

I have recently started a job as one of a few managers in a large retail store.

The current store manager I have noticed, has a habit of changing the rota literally randomly, even less than 24 hours before and changing what it was before.

I was rotad off Sat, Sun and Monday. This was current as of yesterday, Friday. I have made plans and I'm not even local to work right now, I'm far away.

Now, the next day today which is Saturday, I've received a message from one of his minions asking me to come in tomorrow, but I was rotad off tomorrow and Monday. I've gone and checked the rota and he's only gone and changed it AGAIN! It was literally Sat, Sun and Mon off less than 24 hours ago.

Is this normal to be changing employee rotas on a whim?

It's like he assumes no one makes plans, has a life or may not even be around.

The crazy thing is him not even asking me, he just straight up changed it and then gets one of his minions to message me to tell me he's asked me to come in tomorrow...

What is one to do? am I within my rights to tell them I was rotad of these days and I'm currently amongst my plans right now?

1fguq1h,Asking to restructure bonus schedule? ,"Asking to restructure bonus schedule?

I work for a start up mental health drop in clinic. I recently got promoted to head of resources and client development. This promotion came with a bonus with a base 10% of my annual income with additional bonus based on meeting specific metrics, to be paid out every six months. A couple of questions about restructuring the bonus. 

Is it reasonable to ask to restructure the bonus to be paid out quarterly. My reasoning behind this is that a large metric the bonus is based on revolves around number of clients that graduate our program. This occurs every 3 months. So, to me, it stands to reason that the bonus should reflect the graduation of these clients. I would ask for 5% plus additional metric bonuses every three months instead of 10% every six months. 

Other question revolves around the graduation itself. This is usually a big event that I personally (and individually) plan every three months. It tends to result in hundreds of hours of work. For the last two graduations, I have received an additional bonus of a set amount, payable after the event. This additional bonus has always been informal. Is it appropriate to ask to formalize the bonus, stating in writing that I will orchestrate the graduation each month, with an expected bonus to be paid out at the completion of each of these?

1fgupit,Do you like your job?,"Today I discussed a topic without reaching a clear conclusion, and I would like to know your opinion. The theme is: 'Do you like your job?'

The viewpoint of the favorable side argues that continuing to do a job doesn’t mean you like it; it just means you don’t hate it, and you don’t have the opportunity to do the job you really love. You don’t have any particular feelings for this job, you neither hate it nor love it, it’s just a way to make money.

The opposing side, however, believes that if you’ve been doing a job for a long time, it’s because you like it. Even if you might prefer another type of job, the one you’ve been doing for a long time is still something you enjoy; otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to continue.

Second-translator/interpreter, as a very bored person i intend on learning languages. I achived B1 english already at 12 and currently learning french and russian( croatian) and know some basics of korean and chinese. I tend to have good memorizing skills so I am trying to learn morse code too. Its kind of been a dream of mine to be a translator of books and shows for my country with a small amount of speakers. As a kid who knew english early i got to experience many more memories with reading books and cartoons, but I also want to be an in real life interpreter of some kinds of companys and go around the world with them. I also dont have trouble learning more languages too. In terms of school languages history and geography were my only good sides ,but is still get A's in all other subjects so a school is no problem and i will 99.9% get a scholarship.

*Thank you for the referral and for sharing your candid thoughts.*

*I’ve reflected on our working relationship and wanted to address this directly. Over the past decade, I’ve worked to develop my skills in highly technical and selective academic and professional environments. So even while being part of highly capable and inspiring teams at the org, I am confident in my abilities and contributions - they need not be reinforced to me in this manner.*

*While I appreciate your sentiment, please rest assured that I’m well-equipped to navigate my career with the guidance of mentors both within and outside the org.*

*Like you, I am committed to supporting the success of others—both men and women—and fostering a respectful and collaborative team environment. I look forward to us continuing to work together cordially.*

*Best regards

The context is that while she’s been at our organization longer and holds a slightly higher title, she’s very much a peer (we're both relatively early-career professionals with the same years of post-school experience). However, she often behaves as if she’s my manager—delegating tasks and taking up space in ways that are not overt but subtle enough to be hard to confront directly. It’s relentless, and these small actions gradually chip away at you.

Recently, she submitted an unsolicited job referral for me (it's hard to tell what her motives were) for a role that is at the lower range of what I qualify for. When I graciously thanked her, she followed up with unsolicited advice and presumptuous compliments. This kind of behavior has built up over the past year, and now that we’re working even more closely on a smaller team, with more opportunities for friction, I feel exhausted and needed to address it head-on.

May I ask two questions of you guys:
1) If this email doesn’t create the change in behavior I’m hoping for, how do I navigate the situation from here?
2) Could this backfire? Should I preemptively discuss the situation with our joint boss? He’s relatively new to the organization and tends to lean on those who’ve been around longer. While I’m confident he values my skills, I know he also wants to maintain a good rapport with her. We have regular performance reviews where peers can contribute feedback, including on teamwork, so I’m wondering if I should take steps to protect myself.

I’ve never had an actual job before - I clean and cook around the house to earn a few bucks from my parents, but I doubt I could put that on any resume. 

In January, I’ll be able to get my license so traveling to and from work won’t bother any of my family members soon, which is why I was thinking of applying to Barnes & Nobles around that time.

I am working with a financial services firm and myself having 12 years of experience in tax and finance. I honestly joined the firm because the CIO said that I will shape your career and you’re in safe hands so long as we work together. This was a new role but basis that comfort I was ready to take the plunge. However, I was assigned under his reportee who is my boss. In my very first week he said if you can work as per my process and objectives then fine otherwise you are welcome to leave. Next month he compared me to an associate and told me that I’d be better off hiring an associate. The month after that he threatened that he would remove me and spoil my year end appraisal and even my super boss (because of whom I joined) could not do anything about it. Now he threatened me again about bad appraisals. All of this is because I work for both my immediate and my super boss.

I told my super boss about all of this but he said don’t worry, I am here to protect you and you are doing a good job so if I am happy it’s fine. But he said you should take it up with HR and he didn’t talk with my boss directly. I got to know from a third party that my boss had been giving negative feedback about me to him but everytime I asked my super boss he just said your boss thinks you are good but require polishing.

1fgtj1e,To all company owners.,"I have a suggestion to all company owners out there who wish to (i guess) keep your employees in compliance. 

You have rules or company policies that are a requirement, although they should be optional.

These rules include, wearing a certain color Socks, Wearing high vis in a warehouse setting, wearing a seatbelt when driving a forklift, and wearing ear plugs when the workplace settings is loud.

The reason why they should be optional is because, Customers/Visitors/Truck Drivers and some other members of upper management are not stopped and suggested to wear these.

Someone in the chain of command had confronted me last week saying that it is required to do one or all of the above. Yes I SHOULD be wearing it, but not only did you confront me like a police officer, you implied that I would be disciplined/terminated for further ""infractions"", but you were aware that I have a supervisor, and informed my supervisor when you probably should have informed my supervisor in the first place. So Now I have to leave.

Instead of doing those, If you see someone not wearing this equipment when it doesn't put other's safety at risk, nor does it impede job performance, go directly to the supervisor so that this can be listed. Then when the time comes for performance evaluation, use this to determine the pay raise. Finally when hiring someone, state that while these things are not a requirement, wearing the proper safety equipment/uniform every day for 3 months will result in a 50cent pay raise!

Option 1: Go back to my former employer (restaurant management), left on good terms but the job was terrible. Not great pay, but it's something I was good at and would need minimal training.

1fgsvqx,"Help me understand my boss, please","I have been with this company for 2 years now. The owner/director of the company is based offshore in her home country, while we have a manager physically based here in our office. It's a small company with only about 5 employees and everyone reports to this manager, including myself.

My manager & I share a similar job title (hers being more senior of course). So being a lean team, we sometimes have to divide tasks between the two of us. It didn't take me long to realize that my manager doesn't actually know how to do the work, which was a surprise given her title & age (she is over 10 years older than me). I expected someone at her position to be somewhat knowledgeable or experienced, only for me to discover that her industry knowledge is (objectively) around 3/10. She also didn't really have any prior relevant or meaningful experience in the field. My coworkers, who have been around for longer than me, confirmed this. In fact, they were only waiting for me to discover it on my own. My manager's lack of skills is so obvious not just to the team, but even to our clients, partners, vendors & external stakeholders--so this is definitely not just a personal opinion. The only savings grace is that she is a smooth-talker & has her way with people.

Because of that, I quickly found myself handling most of the workload, including hers. Over time, she also saw how my performance speaks for itself, and has grown reliant on me to do almost everything. At first, I didn't mind it as I thought I preferred a hands-off manager over a micro-managing one. But over time, it took a toll on me both physically & emotionally. I became resentful of her because I often have to work late into the night or over the weekends, while she gets to go off as early as 2-3pm some days (our official working hour is until 630pm), citing reasons like picking her kids up from school, attending yoga classes, concerts, or even going for happy hour with friends. The company's owner/director most likely has no idea that these are happening. Coworkers have tried voicing this out to the director before, and my manager would 'behave' after getting told off, only to return to her old ways within days! I hate that I am constantly overworked while she has all the time in the world for her commitments outside of work, social life, pleasure, etc. She'd also spend the majority of her time being on the phone with family/friends or scrolling social media while the rest of us are rushing to meet deadlines.

Her behavior is clearly unprofessional, which explains why nobody in the team likes or even respects her. Everyone is just trying to be cordial & professional, but my coworkers and I are definitely close-knitted while my manager is basically like an outsider to us. We resolve many issues at work together, which often includes working overtime, deliver projects on time & meet targets. It's not an understatement to say that we run the whole company by ourselves.

The company's owner/director is someone with solid experience in the industry and I respected her a lot. Unfortunately, because she is based overseas, she has little to almost no visibility about what is going on. She only gets her updates from my manager, who is really good at claiming credits for the team's hard work & portraying herself as being in control and managing us well. The truth is, she never does or couldn't even be bothered. She is just lucky that we are all responsible & capable individuals who take our work seriously, which is why things have been going well so far (there were times when it didn't, but again, my coworkers and I would resolve it on our own). Blinded by this situation, the director often rewards my manager with special treatments such as extra vacation days (that she could take even during crucial period in the middle of a big project), gas allowance, and even monthly grocery allowance!!! While the director hardly rewards any of my or coworkers' hard work. Words of affirmation are hard to come by, let alone any monetary rewards. But again, when someone tried to voice it out to the director, often the director would diminish our concerns and justify my manager's behavior. I've tried speaking up myself and received the same response too. It doesn't help that my director is non-confrontational in nature, and tends to perceive our (valid) complaints as us being negative and whiny. In the past, a few employees had left due to this toxic manager too, resulting in an almost 'mass resignation' but somehow that still didn't open up my director's eyes.

Glad to report that after many stressful breakdowns and sleepless nights, I have finally found a new job & in the middle of finalizing the contract. I am dreading my resignation day since I don't know what to tell the director. In the past, ex-employees who expressed strong grievances against my manager have only been unfairly shamed & labeled negatively by both the director & the manager. Some learnt from that & chose to hide their real reason for leaving (the toxic manager) in order not to burn bridges.

1. I am hoping someone in this group can perhaps shed some light on the unhealthy dynamic at my workplace & provide insights as to how this situation could have been handled better. To be clear, since I have found a new job, I have no intention to try to change things around here. But since it's a personally truly traumatizing experience for me, I'd like to hear an outsider's perspectives, especially fellow bosses/managers.

2. If the director asks me the real reason behind my resignation, should I be honest, or not at all and keep it really generic/neutral (found better opportunities etc.)? If I were to mention my manager at all, how frank or tactful do I have to be? Keep it mind that I'd like to maintain a relatively good rapport with my director.

Lastly, an important detail that was not mentioned earlier: My manager and director are of the same ethnicity & nationality, while the rest of the employees are not. At first I refused to believe that race plays a part in this whole equation, but sadly after being here for 2 years, I can confidently say that it does. Also, my manager and director were friends before, hence my manager was hired not based on her actual skills/experience level for the role, but because of a mutual friend's recommendation. Which, again, explains a lot.

TLDR: I am quitting my job but would still like some help in understanding this horrible situation at work.

I work at a firm that I enjoy. It’s a small team of people I enjoy working with, my boss seems to care about my development, and it’s relatively low stress. However, my boss doesn’t have the power to promote me or give me a raise (we’re a small team in a large firm that overlooks our value).

Another firm is interested in me, with this firm being specifically focused on my line of work. It seems to be a good firm, a bigger team but still small enough to know most colleagues (which is important to me), and I’d have more responsibility and a significant raise (over 30%).

1fgnp4e,"Stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to go for an opening in my company that pays a lot more, but am nervous because of the possible fallout.","For context. I am 27 and living at home.  I am a high school graduate and have about 45 college credits. At my current position I make 20 an hour working remotely about 40-45 hours a week. It’s ok, but nowhere near enough to rent an apartment or save up to buy a decent house on my own in my state(I want to stay here, or an adjacent state because there are people here that are  important to me.) Even with a roommate, I cannot afford to live on my own. My end goal is to move out. Whether to find an apartment or put a down payment on a house(Preferably the latter), I need a significant pay raise to be able to afford to live on my own. I’m in a toxic home environment and need to leave(I didn't mention this to sulk, it is relevant to this whole situation). 

Even if I could, I would be kicked off my current insurance and would have to pay out of pocket, which would be even less money for living expenses(I currently am being treated for several conditions and need the insurance). My company offers insurance, but the out-of-pocket max is around 3k with a $400 monthly premium, which I cannot afford. At my current pay I need every dollar. 

There is a project coordinator position at my company that opened up this past week that I am thinking about applying for. The pay range is 20-35 an hour. Although not the same role, I am confident that I can directly translate the skills I currently use to that role. A degree isn't needed either. The listing stated I can substitute a degree for experience, which I have. I have been at my currently company for 2 ½ years and have gotten *exceeds expectations* on both of my previous years’ performance reviews. I recently received a performance based bonus. I created more efficient processes that reduced time needed for project, therefore reducing TATs, as well as trained a new hire to help with the workload. I am hoping I can leverage all of that when interviewing for this new position to get the highest rate. 

The thing is, my current manager is genuinely one of the best I’ve had. He’s very hands off and doesn’t get mad when I sometimes make mistakes or sometimes oversleep(I always make the time at the end of my shift). I work overtime whenever it is needed to get a project done, or get things in motion). He always approves PTO (even on short notice) and lets me leave early if I have a doctor’s appointment and make up the time at the end of my shift. I also like my job. I get to work at my own pace and communicate primarily through email/teams, which is where I thrive. I really want to stay in this role, but because the pay is significantly better, I will consider the move. 

My concern with this coordinator role is that 

1. It will involve more meetings and face to face(over zoom) interactions with people. I am very introverted and, as mentioned before, thrive in backend work. 

2. My new manager won’t be as flexible as my current one. 

I also want to go back to school. I live right around the corner from a college, however they do not have Business Admin classes after hours. I was going to talk to my manager and to see if I could leave for less than 2 hours twice a week to go to class. I am pretty confident that he would let me. I am also currently looking into SQL and getting a CompTIA cert, anything to get me a better paying job.

If I do get the job, I am not sure that my new manager will allow me to go to school during the day, so I will have to find another college to go to after work, which leads back to the toxic home environment. I do not have reliable transportation. All of our cars are in my dad’s name and he has taken the keys from other family members(Mom included) when they get into arguments. I have tried to get my own car, however he has threatened to kick me out if I did, even though he later denies it. My Dad and I are currently not speaking so I am already on thin ice.  While he has not taken my car away, his unpredictable moods and temper makes me anxious about committing to something like that long term, and about this whole situation in general.

I’ve tried online schooling and have not had any success with it. I need to be in class to focus and be successful.

With my current manager, I am afraid that if I ask for a comparable pay raise and/or talk to him about the new job and I don’t get it, it would negatively stain our working relationship moving forward and possibly lead to me losing my job. 

I'm really nervous. I really like my manager, however the pay isn't enough. This is my first corporate job and I don't know what to do at all. Am I overthinking this?

Any advice/ perspective would be appreciated.",Disgamer,2,1.0,6,1726325138,2024-09-14 14:45:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fgnp4e/stuck_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place_i_want_to/,9,2024
1fgnndw,Do I go back to my old job?,"I work in HR, and I previously worked for a very small private company. I had my reasons for leaving at the time, but looking back I’m wondering if I should have left at all.

My old job:
- Small, private company
- $84K salary
- Remote company, no physical office to commute to
- Leadership likes me and always supports me because I perform well - but they lay off people that don’t perform
- Flexible schedule and salaried, usually 8-4 / 9-5 but they don’t track time as long as your work is done 

My reason for leaving is there are a lot of layoffs in the HR world right now, and I don’t know if my small company will be a company in 5-10 years (the CEO is in her 50s). I was also placed on a very difficult client with the promise of going back to my old job as soon as they’re able to.

New job:
- County government (chosen for stability)
- $27.73/hr ($57K if I work 40hrs/week)
- Great new manager
- Was told hybrid two days in office when I interviewed, but on my second day the HR Director put a notice that it would change to three days in office next month. It’s about a 40 min commute and I have to pay to park in the on-site garage.l
- Hourly environment where they track every minute of every day, I’ve been salaried for 10 years and kind of hate this level of micromanagement

I reached out to my old manager saying I may have made a mistake and they said they would take me back in a heartbeat. I’m just conflicted on what to do. I have 26 years left in the working world and I know I could just stay at this county job until I retire, but would I be happy? If I take my old job I would worry about having to find a new job in a couple of years.

Another thing to consider: My husband and I are going through IVF. The first round failed and our insurance benefits are exhausted. My old job is great around being able to work around appointments, etc. This new job being hourly will be hard. The new job has fertility benefits on their insurance but only $30K lifetime, and with my old job I make that up in about a year with the increased salary. Affording childcare would be significantly easier with my old salary as well. 

In my head, it makes the most financial sense to go back to my old job and just aggressively save an emergency fund with the increased salary in case something happens. I’m just very anxiety prone and like the stability of government work - but I don’t know if it’s the right environment for me and worth the large pay cut I took.",ZealousidealMap7101,7,1.0,7,1726325011,2024-09-14 14:43:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fgnndw/do_i_go_back_to_my_old_job/,9,2024

The only problem is that I have no clue how to approach people and what to ask.

The event will last multiple days. There will be conferences and cocktail receptions, but we will spend most of our time doing speed-""dates"". I will have 25 minutes to spend with each person.

My company is a service-buyer, and I will be meeting sellers. Some I have worked with already but never met in real life, some are completely new sellers I am just gathering information about.

My question is, how can I make these moments enjoyable? I tend to just meet people, introduce myself and ask them ""tell me about... (what they sell)"", but after around 10 minutes the conversation is dry and awkward. I really want to know people but it looks like everyone just wants to hand out their brochure.

Also, apart from the pre-organized speed dates, how can I approach people? I am happy to say hi but then I don't know what to say. I am quite nervous as dinner will be in a room with big round tables and I don't know anyone I can sit with.

1fgmhxk,Was given a written final warning which I believe to be uncorrect,"So in short I work on a per case basis where we have to register our time. I've always kept up with my cases and did my work very well. But there were many days especially during the holidays - there weren't enough cases to work on. Customers would take days to respond, the vendor would take a day or hours to respond.

I am on a sick leave for a burnout, and received yesterday a letter in which they mentioned about my time registration. The manager checks every single case I work on and judges whether I spent too much time on it or not. Completely micro-managing it.

With a particular case, it was an RMA procedure and I was given the instruction to escalate it with the vendor and follow their RMA procedure. Then the customer escalated it why it wasn't configured yet, but I had no idea of course that we had to configure it. I was not instructed.

A month later, same customer, same thing, I escalated with the vendor shipping a new unit. 

The mistakes I made were basically because in their contract they had the right of a replacement unit within 4 hours which would come from our stock. I did not even know that at all. We have a billion of contracts varying from customers to customers. Nobody informed me. The customer themselves didn't even know.

If I do not register at least 6.4 hours of time (remember - most of the time there's nothing to do at all), and make another mistake - I am getting fired immediately without a notice period.

•Spanish (once again I’m half considering it but i’m super bad at listenings but I feel like it wouldn’t be that terrible??)

I don’t really have any extra-curriculars except for this tech programme I did, being a student librarian at my school and doing DofE bronze (which i haven’t got a certificate to prove). Work experience wise Ive only worked at a pharmacy for a day. I don’t do sports or play an instrument which is kinda bad if I wanna do medicine, so to make up for it i guess? I’m thinking of doing Core Maths which is a level 3 qualification and is equivalent to an AS level, alongside my 3 a levels, and my school said it helps with the maths content in sciences.

One of the sixth forms I’m considering doesn’t necessarily force you to but kinda pushes you to do an EPQ if u only do 3 a levels, but I know that it’s a lot of extra work and you have to keep ur whole process organised for the production log, but i’m not really opposed to the idea? Also some unis will reduce ur grade offer if u do it (but it’s also less unlikely they’ll do that for medicine)

I feel like I’m just kinda considering everything and am really unsure what to do so there are my main questions:
1. Would it be better to do an EPQ or core maths with my 3 a levels?

2. Is Spanish A level similar to GCSE? As in do you learn new vocabulary for different topics and stuff or do you do something else like you have to write an essay in spanish about something (or something like that)

 3. Would doing an EPQ/Core maths help make up for my lack of extra curriculars?

4. What’s the main difference between business and economics?

5. What can I do outside of school to prove and passion for medicine and where can I find these opportunities?

6. What topics related to medicine could I write an EPQ on?

Any advice would be extremely appreciated and sorry for the long ass post!

1fgld6z,How do people who pursue a business degree while working in an unrelated job pivot their careers?,"Hey all, I'm currently a very hands-on technician at a startup. I hate the repetitiveness of my work and really love learning new things as an academic at heart. I've just finished a MS in Engineering Management and am starting an MBA. I love having the chance to implement what I'm learning, but the opportunities to do so are limited, so I'm looking to pivot to another company in a more business-oriented position such as operations management (my focus in my MSEM). I also have a PhD in physics as my background is very technical.

Many people choose to pursue a business degree while working in an unrelated job, but how do they pivot into the industry? Do most of these people work at larger companies where they can begin to take on more business-focused responsibilities? Do they, as a mid-career professional, take an entry-level job to get experience? Do they take a year off from work to do an internship? What is the usual move here?

Yesterday my director called and requested a meeting between himself, the deputy director and me to discuss my short and long term career goals; my direct manager was not invited to the call.

- How do I maximize this unique opportunity to discuss my expectations with my superiors beyond reiterating that I want a promotion this year?
- Do I bring up the other soft offer as a leverage point? It’s possible they already found out and I don’t want to seem like I am acting in bad faith during the discussion.

1fgjosh,how can i disclose that i recently started another job in an interview without ruining my chances?,"hello, sorry for the wall of text but all of this is relevant context to my very specific situation. please help me out because i'm in a bit of a panic..

context: in my country, we have professional internships designed to get young people into the job market. the state pays for half of your salary and the company pays for the other half, so it's beneficial for companies to hire interns to save money and there's a 90% chance they'll give you a return offer.

i just graduated and got my master's degree in july. i got 3 job offers right away, 2 of which were professional internships. i accepted the professional internship that seemed the most beneficial at the time despite it being a bit outside of my field and i regretted it immediately. i have a 12 month contract and i have completed 2 months of the internship so far.

a week after starting my current internship, i applied to a job that i know would be perfect for me and i've only recently been contacted to schedule an interview with them on the 16th of september. this is my dream job, at my dream company and it's within my field. they asked if i was in any other selective processes and i said i was in one, because i do have another option as well, but i have not disclosed that i am currently in the midst of a professional internship already (i didn't lie or anything, they just didn't ask on the screening call and it wasn't on my CV at the time i applied because it was so recent).

i am worried this offer would be a professional internship as well (likely scenario given this company's history) because, while interns are allowed to quit their internships, if the reason is not deemed ""justified"" by the national job center (and they can be a bit picky about this), we aren't allowed to do another professional internship for the next 12 months. 

because of this, i want to disclose in the interview that i am currently in the midst of a professional internship to avoid any legal problems if i do get an offer and so that the company can think of potential solutions to circumvent this issue in case they do want to hire me.

i was wondering: what is the best way for me to explain why i'm leaving my current internship so soon after getting it? 

i don't want to seem like a red flag, i don't want to speak negatively of my current employers because i've heard that it's a bad practice since a potential future employer would be concerned you'll do the same to them. i also don't want to be discarded because i quit so fast - i know employers don't want to invest in someone who might just leave right away. i dont want them to get that impression from me but i also want to be transparent about my situation because it's going to affect what kind of contract i can sign.

how can i go about this in a tactful way? thank you in advance!!

1fgiqot,Getting into journalism with an LLM with specialism in Environmental Law and Sustainable Development,"Hello everyone,

I’d like to share my somewhat unconventional journey into journalism and would greatly appreciate any feedback you might have! I'm worrying a little bit...

I hold a BSc in Environmental Sciences and International Development, which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, upon graduating, I found myself uncertain about my next steps. Over the past two years, I’ve gained experience working with NGOs in conflict-resolution, refugees, and started a blog. Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for research and writing, specifically on environmental justice issues.

I realised I wanted to pursue environmental journalism and research, focusing on topics such as environmental justice and the complexities of water conflicts and natural resource governance in relation to climate change. I am even considering to pursue a PhD in this area to fully be immersed in the research and discourse. 

I recently applied to SOAS for an MA in Environmental Law and Sustainable Development. While I wasn’t admitted to the MA, I was offered a transfer to the LLM in Environmental Law and Sustainable Development, which all covers the same modules. The primary difference, as I understand it, is the degree title.

Although I don’t come from a legal background and don’t aim to practice law, the modules in the LLM and MA (again, both have the same modules) are highly relevant to the areas I want to specialise in. Be it, during a PhD or should I get into journalism.  

The reason why I'm keeping my options broad (A PhD in development and a career in NGOs, think tanks, government policy, advocacy, or journalism) is because I believe these fields somewhat interconnect. Am I wrong?

If I get into journalism, I wouldn't want to be a local reporter, although I understand this is how many people start off with. It's a competitive industry. I was thinking that I would be writing articles on the side along with my work and research in academia/think-tanks.

The course offers excellent modules on development, natural resources, and law, with a particular emphasis on the Global South and the challenges of development and conflict resolution. This is what initially attracted me to the program.

However, I’m now wondering how an LLM might be perceived on my CV, especially since I don’t plan to become a lawyer. Would it be seen as a valuable asset in the eyes of employers within these sectors? 

And specifically, how might an LLM be viewed by an editor considering me for a journalism role?

1fggm4u,Asking to restructure bonus schedule? ,"
I work for a start up mental health drop in clinic. I recently got promoted to head of resources and client development. This promotion came with a bonus with a base 10% of my annual income with additional bonus based on meeting specific metrics, to be paid out every six months. A couple of questions about restructuring the bonus. 

Is it reasonable to ask to restructure the bonus to be paid out quarterly. My reasoning behind this is that a large metric the bonus is based on revolves around number of clients that graduate our program. This occurs every 3 months. So, to me, it stands to reason that the bonus should reflect the graduation of these clients. I would ask for 5% plus additional metric bonuses every three months instead of 10% every six months. 

Other question revolves around the graduation itself. This is usually a big event that I personally (and individually) plan every three months. It tends to result in hundreds of hours of work. For the last two graduations, I have received an additional bonus of a set amount, payable after the event. This additional bonus has always been informal. Is it appropriate to ask to formalize the bonus, stating in writing that I will orchestrate the graduation each month, with an expected bonus to be paid out at the completion of each of these?

1fgeky0,Feeling Lost in My Career Path as a Graphic Designer – Should I Learn to Code,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in a bit of a career limbo and could really use some advice. For context, I worked as a graphic designer at a small agency for two years (from November 2021 to January 2024), but unfortunately, the agency faced financial issues, and all employees, including myself, were let go.

Since then, I’ve been actively applying for graphic design jobs, but as of September, I’ve only made it to the interview stages and haven’t received any solid offers yet. While going through this process, I’ve also been exploring the field of UI/UX design because I enjoy creating visually appealing apps and websites. So far, I’ve been deepening my knowledge in this area, and it’s been quite exciting.

Recently, I’ve been toying with the idea of learning to code. I’ve always felt that it could be beneficial not only to create beautiful designs but also to bring them to life through coding. But I’m not entirely sure if this is the right path or just me trying to diversify my skill set out of uncertainty.

So, my question to you all is: **Do you think it’s a good idea to expand my skills into coding alongside my design skills?** Would this be a good investment for my future career, or should I focus more on honing my design and UI/UX skills for now?

I would love to work at school with technology integration, helping teachers or being in a help desk/IT role in a school setting, but I’m not sure how to accomplish that or what skills/certs I would need. 

I’ve been very anxious lately due to this and I would appreciate any help!

1fgda1u,How to restart a career,"During the pandemic I went through a really tough time. I had been building a career within event marketing, which was heavily impacted by the industry shutdowns. 

I managed to retain my job with the company I was working for at the time, but eventually left due to layoffs. I secured another role with a smaller organisation, but quickly felt out of place in its work culture. 

That contract ended after its 12-month period came to a close. 

During this time my father had major heart surgery. My grandfather died. My long term partner of 8 years and I separated. And I struggled with a lot of grief and some mental health issues as a result. 

 I took 6-months off to reset, moved home to my parents and was really feeling back at “square one”. 

I had a few false starts re-entering the workforce. Some casual work and a very disorienting experience of being somewhere I grew up in and left behind more than 10 years earlier. 

I ended up studying and have just about completed a certificate iv in something unrelated to my career background. It was purely out of personal interest, but important for me to complete at the time. 

I also began a post grad in teaching, thinking this would be my way back into full-time work, in a new role and setting. I’ve had some set backs. Mental health got the better of me and I’m about a year away from completion of the degree program.

Seeing the arts and events sector come back to life has left me wanting to step back into my previous career and leave teaching behind.

Trying to explain all of this in job applications and interviews is incredibly challenging - perhaps even unnecessary.

Long story short — I have a 3 year gap in my resume, a completed certificate and partially completed degree to show for my efforts during this time. 

Any suggestions on how to ‘pitch’ myself with the gap and unrelated study?",bjame__s,3,1.0,2,1726284950,2024-09-14 03:35:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fgda1u/how_to_restart_a_career/,9,2024
1fgd2sr,Torn Between a Dream Move to London  and My Career in the U.S. — What Should I Do?,"Ever since I was 18, I’ve had a dream of moving to England. I’m 24 now, a dual citizen of the U.S. and England, and currently working for a Tech AI startup as a product manager. Here’s a bit about my background:

	•	6 months as a software engineering intern at BMW
	•	1 year as a product management intern
	•	2+ years full-time as a product manager
	•	I’ve worked on a project from 0 to 1, generating over $1M in revenue (from just 4 clients so far) without even going to market yet
	•	Won an industry award for product of the year

I love what I do, the team, and the company. However, I’ve always been upfront about my plan to eventually move to England. Recently, I spoke with someone higher up about my dream to move to London and potentially have the company pay for my master’s. Unfortunately, I was told that, due to the importance of the project and the lack of team members in London, I’m needed here, and working remotely from London isn’t possible.

On top of this, my long-term career goal is to work for a big tech company like a FAANG. I know getting a master’s would help me be more competitive for those roles, but I’m torn between pursuing that dream and my current work.

Here are the options I’m considering:

1. Stay in the U.S. and have my company pay for my master’s – They’d likely ask me to sign a contract to stay for X more years, which delays my move to London.

2. Pay for my master’s myself and move after – I could stay for another year, pay for the degree out of pocket, and move once I’m done. I also have a second business that can help with the costs, but it won’t be feasible to run it if I move to the UK.

3. Let the company pay for my master’s and break the contract – I could let them pay for my degree and then break the contract after a year, relying on my second business to help me cover the costs of leaving early.

4. Apply to master’s programs in the UK and find a new job – I’d have to start job hunting in January and apply for scholarships to fund my master’s in the UK.

I’m stuck, and I don’t have anyone in my network who can really give me solid advice on what to do. What would you do in my situation? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",Dehstt,2,1.0,0,1726284253,2024-09-14 03:24:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fgd2sr/torn_between_a_dream_move_to_london_and_my_career/,9,2024

I'm 49 and achieved a lifelong dream of getting my BS in Finance from WGU this month. For the past 29 years I've worked in administrative assistant roles for various companies, (secretary, payroll, tax assistant, home builder assistant) I've never been in management.

I  got it for a reason and it would be ridiculous for me to not utilize it in trying to achieve the ""next level"" in my career growth. I have a drive in me to see what I can achieve in life. These are  my delimmas though, #1) I absolutely love my current job, I call it a comfy pair of pajamas, it's so easy I can do it with my eyes closed, I pretty much listen to podcasts all day in my private office and enter info all day. There's no office drama, the people are really nice. Enter my panic attacks now that I have graduated; weighing my options. I can either stay put, the office is small with no room for advancement.  People stay in their roles until they retire. I am in line to take my superior's job when she retires but that will not be for another 6 years. I feel like only then I could ask for a large jump in salary because of my degree I obtained while working there...#2) I search Indeed or online for new positions I could do with a Finance degree,  99% of postings I look at want a specific 3-5 years of experience in things I've never done before so I feel discouraged and too nervous to even try to apply. And delimma #3) I've waited all my life to be ""this comfortable"" at work, my biggest fear is leaving this job only to get in over my head and take something I will struggle at or get laid off from.

So my old employer had an extremely predatory non-compete, but I worked and reside in a state where non-competes are banned. I confirmed with my own employment lawyer, and also the legal team at my (soon to be) new employer, and we have all determined the non-compete is unlawful. So I was extended an offer and I plan to accept. My old company has been continuously ‘reminding me’ of my non-compete, and being fairly threatening. They do not know of my current pursuits but unfortunately I have had to request documentation from them a few times so I’m on the radar. My new job is very much customer facing, it will be pretty important that I update my LinkedIn and general social media. 

What I’m trying to determine is whether I should take preemptive legal action against my old company, because I am 90% sure they will serve a cease and desist once they find out who my new employer is. Would it look bad to my new employer if my old one takes action first? Will I set myself up for long term legal battles if I take action and send the cease and desist first? Is any of this bad for my reputation in the professional world?

I started looking for full-stack senior and mid-level jobs lately but I am getting rejected a lot, sometimes after an interview with the recruiter and the rest of the times after I sent my CV. I should note that I regularly practice my interviewing skills and I constantly write interview summaries and talk about them with friends from the industry with more experience than me, so I think that it might not be the way I am being interviewed.

I am trying to understand why it happens, and something I assume it might be a drawback is the ""lack"" of years of experience with those technologies. It wasn't 4 complete years of any of those technologies and I think it might make the recruiters think I am not proficient enough with any of them.

Is that something I should worry about, or it is just a matter of time until I will get more offers and proceed to more advanced interviews?

Thanks!",JSONSchema22,1,1.0,1,1726260637,2024-09-13 20:50:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fg55e3/am_i_not_qualified_for_using_many_technologies/,9,2024
1fg4evg,Current State of the Software Engineering Job Market,"To start this off not everyone has to agree with me. I am simply voicing my opinion on the topic and my personal experiences with the current job market. I have never been one to post on Reddit but this was just something I just needed to voice because my parents recently were laid off and I have been looking for a job for so long and I have nothing to show for it.

The current job market is tough. Many senior and junior developers will tell you to simply improve your skills, work on personal projects, and grind Leetcode. However, times have changed significantly since COVID. Interviews and job listings now demand different things from developers. The idea that these actions alone will land you a job is outdated and misleading. While there is some value in honing your skills and working on projects, it’s no longer the game-changer it once was.

This leads me to my biggest issue with the tech industry: it's increasingly about who you know, not what you know. Networking is important, but it shouldn’t overshadow actual skills. I had a friend who spent most of his time in college looking down on computer science students and partying. His father ended up pulling some strings, asking a colleague to offer his son an internship. He was even given the exact interview questions beforehand. Despite lacking the necessary skills, he got the position.

Another person I know applied to over 1,000 jobs but remained unemployed. He took a teaching job and eventually met an employee from a major company who handed him a position. I could pull hundreds of instances where this is showing but I'm not here to tell you all of them. Imagine a world where this kind of networking becomes the norm: the tech industry would be flooded with unskilled programmers who neither have the qualifications nor the passion for the job. These employees would, in turn, hire others based on connections, leading to poor productivity and office politics dominating the work environment.

My next problem is the lack of merit-based recognition for personal projects. I followed the advice of experienced developers, found passion in building projects, and competed in hackathons and contests. I've won many of them. You'd think companies would care, but they don't. I’ve spent countless hours perfecting my programming abilities, tried 20 different resume templates, tailored each resume to specific roles, and thoughtfully answered every interview question. Despite all that, someone who knows a higher-up can still land a position that I’ve worked hard to qualify for. It’s disheartening to see.

The expectations for new grads and interns are also unrealistic. While it's reasonable to expect passion and a willingness to learn, employers often demand perfection across a vast range of skills. At a recent conference, a senior developer went on a rant about how entry-level programmers ""don’t know anything"" at a deeper level. But here’s the thing: companies are asking for 30 different skills that can only truly be mastered with job experience. Entry-level candidates don’t have the time to perfect their fundamentals because they’re too busy trying to meet the 50 other requirements listed in job postings. Plus, most job seekers aren’t just applying for one role; they’re applying to anything they can get. This forces them to learn a little bit of everything just to have a chance.

Finally, there's AI. While I appreciate the incredible potential AI brings, its rise couldn't have come at a worse time. In an already difficult job market, AI makes it harder to distinguish truly skilled candidates. Worse still, it’s reducing the need for junior developers. Senior engineers can now use AI to complete tasks that were once handled by junior engineers. So why hire entry-level employees when AI can handle it?

In conclusion, the tech industry is facing a fundamental shift. The old advice of ""just improve your skills and network"" no longer holds as much weight in today’s job market. While passion and hard work are still important, the growing emphasis on personal connections and unrealistic expectations for entry-level candidates is creating a problematic environment. AI, while revolutionary, is also contributing to this shift by further minimizing opportunities for junior developers. If the industry continues down this path, it risks becoming less about merit and skill, and more about who you know, leading to a workforce that lacks genuine passion and competence. P.S. If you agree with this, please upvote and share! I'd love to get this in front of Primeagen and NeetCode—I really enjoy hearing their takes on these issues!",Lost-Stock690,0,0.33000001311302185,3,1726258721,2024-09-13 20:18:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fg4evg/current_state_of_the_software_engineering_job/,9,2024
1fg4dhe,GM EV Master automotive Technician. Lateral career move?,Hello reddit community! Little background about me. I've been an automotive Technician for GM for about 11 years now and almost master certified in GM totally. I am however EV master certified in GM. I'm tired of independent and dealerships. It's always political. And management has just been abysmal. I was fired while at training in Troy last Wednesday which took me by surprise. As they just hired a new service manager a month ago who's been bringing all of his buddies in including Technicians. So basically I've been replaced. No write ups. No tardiness. Rarely any come back work. Anyways enough of me complaining. Basically I'm just asking with 11 years automotive experience and tons of tools is their any lateral career move I could make to get out of this junky dealership environment? Or advice?

I'm developing a tool with a friend that creates personalized resumes with just one click. We're building the tool and I want to better understand how you all navigate the job market these days to improve the experience based on that.



If you could help, I have a few quick questions:

- How many jobs do you apply for per month (on average)?

- How do you usually prepare your resume and select the jobs that interest you? (Do you have a specific process? How do you go about it?)

- What frustrates you the most about the job market right now? (It can be anything)

- Do you follow any influencers focused on the job market or AI? If so, which ones?

1fg3dst,"Laid off last year, now company wants me back.","Hello! I was laid off from my job in October 2023. I had only been there since June. They laid off a few people from each department due to budget cuts. I was obviously one of the lucky ones laid off from my department. Everyone else had been there at least 5+ years. I started a job with a new company in May in a similar role. This job has been way more overwhelming and stressful. The atmosphere and culture here is great, but the work is not. My previous job was my favorite job I’ve ever had, but I was only there 4 months. Well, my old boss reached out to me and wants me to come back. They are hiring for my role again. Side note: my boss fought hard for me not to be laid off in the first place, but she essentially had no say due to being the lowest on the totem pole. The pay they’re offering me is about a 35% increase from what I was making there. My family thinks I’m crazy for considering going back to a place that laid me off. I am, however, trying to think about what would make me the happiest. I asked my old boss about the financial situation of the company because I want to avoid being laid off again. She reassured me that the company is in a much better situation; she also said if they tried to lay me off again, she would quit. She has been there for 25 years, and I truly trust her. I’m in the very early stages of my career, my old boss is a great trainer. My new boss is a little younger than me and is not the best at training. My previous supervisor also wants me to take over the department in the future when she retires in about 3-5 years.

1fg3a0j,I messed up and need some advice on what to do ,"I recently got hired at new place.  I already have one (work at boyfriend’s restaurant) and as the employer and I were going over the schedule she asked about Friday and I let her know that Fridays I am needed at 4:00pm at restaurant. Apparently that’s also a day she really wants to put me on the schedule to work with ortho doctor. I told her I would let her know if I can find coverage. 

Forward to a day later, I made the mistake of assuming boyfriend would hire someone new. Instead, he is just going to stick it out for the days I will not be there and reasonably expects me to be there Friday evenings (one of the busiest days for restaurant industry). Well, I told new manager that “I do not have any coverage and my boss (bf) will begin hiring process so that will hopefully change soon”. She replied with “as long as you have a plan and it's temporary, we can definitely work with it”. Now I am stuck because I am needed at both places.

I have a masters degree in a high demand and somewhat technical field. I do well at work, find it fulfilling, and make a decent income for a single person living a comfortably humble lifestyle. I have many hobbies and enjoy my time outside of work. 

The thing is I have been suggested a few times by different higher up people that I should focus more on career development. One time they straight up told me it’s an up or out culture. Recently a senior manager referred me to apply for a manager position. She seemed not too thrilled when I said I didn’t think I’d be a good fit, but still insisted that we should keep talking about this topic. I’m super grateful and flattered, but not sure if that’s what’s good for me or what I want.

I’m not a career person, I just happen to know how to navigate things at work. I’ve tried to explain that I’m more interested in horizontal development when I get to expand my expertise, instead of climbing the ladder. I’m worried they’d think I’m lazy and trying to avoid responsibilities by not wanting to follow the more traditional career development path.

I like the work and the company, I don’t like having more work stress/people managing and making more money is not a big goal of mine. Am I being childish and stubborn?

At this point I am unsure what education I will get to switch my career,  I’ve decided that I don’t want to work in healthcare anymore. Thinking of online schooling to switch career so I can continue working. I like the sciences, I honestly would like a job that allows me to work independently, have opportunities to maybe work from home, limit working with other people for majority of time. Naturally introverted, I like to work alone work and have peace of mind. I would be willing to get an associates or bachelor degree. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.

1ffxua5,How to tell your supervisor that you will soon be her supervisor?,"Hi, 

A couple of years ago, my senior (A) who is also a close friend became my supervisor when our previous supervisor retired. 

Around the same time, we had a new manager (B) who is tasked with driving transformation at work. Late last year, B told me about her plans to reshuffle the org chart and put me in charge of an entire section including A, along with a few other peeps who hold higher job grades than me. In other words, she is promoting me above the rest. 

I’ve specifically been told to keep the plans to myself as we are still looking at how to best restructure the department to suit the needs of the company. 

How should I handle the communication with my supervisor such that trust is preserved and we can continue to at least have a working relationship? I suppose she would feel blindsided as the assumption is that she will always be above me due to seniority. Any advice on whether I should be the one to break the news to her when it is time? How to manage the disappointment to all those who are of higher jobs grades and believe they are the only suitable candidates to be the new lead? More importantly, how can i continue to work with all of them in the future?

I'm having a bit of a crisis- I'm a senior in college right now studying Computer Science, but the market is horrific and my options are looking slim. Additionally, I am feeling rather disillusioned with the idea of working in this field. I came across a Masters of Engineering program at the University of Arkansas that is fully online and accepts CS majors conditionally (I meet all the requirements), and am considering it as an option.

  
My main question is this- If I were to complete the Masters of Engineering program, which doesn't specialize in any one discipline such as Electrical Engineering, would that be sufficient in starting my career in engineering?

1ffwm3q,Is Pharmacy a good choice for me?,"I’ve had my heart set on doing pharmacy since last year, but since browsing r/pharmacy I’ve had doubts. Most of the complaints tend to centre around the fact that becoming a pharmacist takes around 7-8 years and garners an immense student debt, along with the long hours, oversaturation and lacklustred earning potential.
From where I'm from, an undergrad in pharm can be pursued straight after high school and is a 4 year degree ( with 1 year of internship ). I also come from a relatively wealthy family and so debt would not be an issue at all. 
The only issue I can think of is the oversaturation, but what I’ve noticed is that alot of the pharmacists on this sub are from america. If i'm not from america or europe, do I have anything to worry about? I’d really like to pursue clinical pharmacy ( which requires 2 years postgrad study ), but if this is a path that's especially vulnerable right now, what paths should I ( instead ), choose to pursue after obtaining my undergrad in pharmacy ( that is, if I should pursue pharmacy at all ).
I chose pharmacy over medicine because I wanted to do something that was straightforward and repetitive, with fixed hours, so that I may largely pursue my dreams in writing but still had a comfortable salary to fall back on. Given circumstances, should I just drop the idea altogether and go for medicine?

1ffwg4x,How to Effectively Find a Job Abroad from Your Home Country?,"Hello everyone,

I'm reaching out to ask for your help.

I’m 33 years old, a law graduate, and although I completed my degree in 2018, most of my professional experience has been in the commercial (sales) field.

I've always been curious to explore the legal field, so about a year and a half ago, I decided to take a risk and change my life. I quit my previous job and enrolled in the Portuguese Bar Association’s trainee program.

However, this new phase of my life has not gone as expected. Besides receiving a very low salary (to the point of needing help from my parents), the prospects are not very encouraging. I also feel that I’m not enjoying the area as much as I thought I would, and at this moment, I believe the chances of getting my certification are quite slim.

The low wages in Portugal, some current frustrations with the country, and a strong desire to gain professional experience abroad have led me to decide that I would like to leave the country.

Thus, about four months ago, I began looking for a job abroad.

I’ve mainly been searching through LinkedIn, and although I’ve had a few (very few) interviews, I have not yet received a concrete job offer.

I have 8 years of professional experience: 6 years in sales roles in well-known companies and 2 years in the legal field. I am fluent in English (I have an IELTS certificate to prove it), and I have intermediate knowledge of Spanish and French.

Currently, I’m focusing my search on countries within the European Economic Area, aiming for roles such as Sales Development Representative/Business Development Representative or positions like Legal Assistant/Junior Legal Specialist.

Since I’ve been searching for some time now, I’m feeling quite discouraged by the lack of responses. I’m beginning to think that, outside of more technical fields (such as IT or engineering), the willingness to hire someone who would need to relocate is practically non-existent. Perhaps my skills are too common as well.

I would greatly appreciate any advice you could share on the best strategies to find a job abroad. Which job platforms have worked for you? What are the fields with the highest demand, where you think I could fit in? Any other tips would be highly appreciated.

To conclude, I am open to any kind of profession, as long as I can earn enough to live a simple and happy life.

Thank you for your time and for all your comments.

1ffwbo5,Questions to recruiters / HR in France - CVs in English to a French (or a non-English job description) job description ?,"Hello Everyone,  
  
I hope you are all good. Since coming to France two years ago from Pakistan for my masters in Three European countries (France, Estonia, Finland) and a bg in chemical engineering, I have spoken English since my childhood. I do speak intermediate French but not very good in writing. I also currently work full time in a French country where I work completely in French. My English is still way better than my French ofcourse but I am learning more French. Hence, I don't feel very confident of my French CV making skills and technical stuff in French.

I have some questions related to some job applications and I am sure many people in this group work in HR in france (or places where the local language is not English e.g. European Countries, etc.) and also in businesses, hire talent on a regular basis. I have some questions which I believe many expats like me would have had at some point in their business or job search journey in France or in a non-English country. If this is you, please do add your opinion or tips 😊.

* When you hire talent, and let's say you posted the job description in French saying ""English is mandatory"" and the job description has words/Terminologies in English, normally when you receive applications from exapts and they send their CV in english to that French description, how does it make you feel ? Does it bother you as a recruiter or HR person ? I assume that it doesn't matter as most people in business world speak English here and I have always done this and it has worked for me before. What are your opinions about this ?
* If I send a CV in English to a job description in French, how does that stand with the ATS system ? Do any recruiters here use ATS ? if yes, how does it work in the ATS system trained on a French job description receiving a CV in English to that job description ?
* If you are recruiter who uses ATS systems on a regular basis, can you share what does the candidate selection/screening look like from a recruiter's perspective ?

Hope the questions and the responses help others and THANK YOU in advance !! ❤",UnRemarkable_Bit5429,1,1.0,0,1726238244,2024-09-13 14:37:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffwbo5/questions_to_recruiters_hr_in_france_cvs_in/,9,2024
1ffvx0b,"HR is asking me about a new hire wanting to be employed here, because I happen to know them from college","Hi Reddit, basically I'm needing advice on the title.
Someone I happened to graduate college with started at my place of employment this week. There were about 80 people in my class / major so we all knew of eachother for the most part. I did hang out with this person and chat with them whenever I ran into them, but we weren't close. We were both vocal about knowing eachother when we did our little team meet and greet so my job does know that we know eachother outside of work. 

They started 2 days ago, and this morning I received a message from our HR rep (who I've not had the most pleasant interactions with. Example: I had an issue where something happened with one of my superiors that I was uncomfortable to bring to said superior and went to HR for guidance. They asked if I went to said superior about the issue. I told HR I was not comfortable speaking to them yet and wanted to talk with HR for guidance. HR person went ahead and talked with my superior and forced a meeting between all of us.)

Anyway, I recieved a message this morning from HR, saying they want to touch base and see how things are going with the new hire.
I responded so far so good, they've just been working on training videos so I hadn't had a chance to really do any training with them. Then HR asked if they mentioned not liking the position or it not being a great fit.

This is where I need advice. The new hire has NOT said anything about not liking it here, but I have noticed they are not here today yet (15 min late so far).Do I respond to HR? Do I ask why they don't reach out to the new hire? Should I reach out to the new hire and ask what they would prefer? I've noticed our HR can be shady so I'm just not sure how to approach this, if HR should even be asking me this, ect. 

A side note, we also had someone hired a couple of months ago, and they NEVER reached out to me about them. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be amazing! Thanks!",No_Pick1394,33,0.8600000143051147,40,1726237201,2024-09-13 14:20:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffvx0b/hr_is_asking_me_about_a_new_hire_wanting_to_be/,9,2024

1ffumpg,Deciding between security or risk with two potential jobs? ,"USA

I’ll be interviewing with one of the big window and door companies soon, for a B2B sales position. 

Base salary is $50k and they have uncapped commission. W2 with benefits as well. Better day to day schedule and weekends off. Construction sales on the B2B side seem’s far better than a B2C sales job. 

I have a job offer for a parts sales position at a dealership, would likely make around $60k between base which is $45k and commission with a union. I have some time before I would start but the job is mine if I want it. Schedule is slightly better than my current job only requiring 2 Saturday’s a month, and seems lower volume in terms of walk in and phones which brings me to my next point. 

I currently am in a similar B2B parts sales position and make around $57k now for a big retailer. I hate my job. It’s stressful, hard on my body, non-stop walk ins and phones, low pay for the money I make the company, typical negative workplace environment. 

I think the sales job if I am offered it would obviously be the choice in terms of work life balance and enjoyment. Also a lot more potential for money. I’m comfortable with people, understand B2B sales already, have a proven sales record.

I’m a young parent in my late 20’s. I’m unhappy where I am at now. I’m okay with a career switch. 

I’m between job security at the dealership or potential with the outside sales job. 

I don’t want to approach the sales job with rose colored glasses because of the potential numbers I could make.

1ffud1r,Sleep problems driving me crazy ,"

It may sound silly or overrated, but I have been facing a lot of sleep problems since I was 7. I suffered from insomnia, and it took me about 3 hours after lying down to finally sleep. I'm 17 now, and these problems have increased. I stay awake until 4 a.m., and after half an hour, I wake up, and my body starts to shake in a weird way that I can't control. In the morning, I can't resist the feeling of sleepiness, and I end up sleeping for 1 to 3 hours, sometimes more. The issue is that during this nap, I get sleep paralysis. It's the scariest experience ever. 

I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've started hallucinating, and I feel so detached from reality. Music gives me headaches, and my brain is exhausted. Recently, I started thinking about suicide to end this pain. I can't think properly anymore, can't focus on anything, and I'm extremely tired. All I want to do is lay my body on the floor and keep looking at the ceiling. I need help. I need to understand what's wrong with me.

1ffucgv,Rant: My Latest Interview Experience – Should I Even Bother Learning SQL Joins and Java/C#? ,"So, I had this interview recently, and honestly, it was a rollercoaster from the start. Things kicked off fine with the usual basic intro – you know, talking about my experience working with PHP (Laravel), Node.js, and NestJS, mainly focusing on backend development.

Then, the interviewer jumps straight into OOP concepts. We discussed stuff like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation – the whole shebang. I answered those easily. 

Then, they threw in some Leetcode-style easy problems. I solved them. But THEN, the twist came – SQL questions.

Here’s the thing: I’m no expert when it comes to SQL. I’ve mostly worked with ORMs in my projects, and I rarely hand-code SQL queries. So, when they started asking me about SQL joins and more complex queries, I kind of blanked. I mean, I get the basic stuff, but deep down I knew I wasn’t prepared for the advanced SQL questions. And honestly, do people still do this much SQL manually when we have ORMs? Is learning SQL joins even worth it anymore?

To make it worse, the interviewer gave me some “helpful feedback” at the end. They told me I should learn Java and C# because they're more “relevant languages” (for context, they were looking for a full stack dev with Angular and .NET). Like, really? I’ve been focusing on PHP, Laravel, Node, and Nest for backend, and now I’m being told to learn another two languages?

Here’s my dilemma: Should I bother spending time learning how to write complex SQL queries, or should I just keep doing what I’ve always done – look up the syntax and figure it out when I need to?

And on top of that, should I even bother learning mainstream languages like Java or C# when my focus is on problem-solving and backend logic? I always thought that as long as I have strong logic and problem-solving skills, learning a new language wouldn’t be a big deal. But now I’m starting to wonder if I’ve been underestimating how much emphasis is placed on the language itself.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this. Should I go all in on SQL and mainstream languages or just stick to my guns?

P.S. I did mention to the interviewer that I mostly use ORMs instead of raw SQL, and he was fine with that. But when it came to the specific SQL question, he said SQL would be better and more optimized. I agreed and solved it using ORM, but he pointed out that it wasn't optimized and could be done better with raw SQL.For context, I have about a year of experience working as a full stack dev, primarily focusing on backend development",Mayank0000001,1,1.0,1,1726232997,2024-09-13 13:09:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffucgv/rant_my_latest_interview_experience_should_i_even/,9,2024
1fftv1d,Working from Home Issues with Coworkers ,"I work in a branch office that is part of a larger organization, at this branch there are only 3 people including myself. Here are the work from home rules:

1. One of us has to be at the office during office hours
2. We only have to be in office 2 days of the week

One of my coworkers has to work and be on the road (just locally) for 50% of her job, she usually goes out to meet with clients and comes back to the office, or if it doesn't make sense she will work from home, but she is usually in the office 3-4 days a week.

My concerns are with the other co-worker, we will all decide on what we are doing for the month but she will change it randomly that makes it impossible for the rest of us, for example she will say I am working in the office on Wednesday and Thursday, but then on Tuesday she will come in and say she's switching her Thursday. To me if you committed to that day on the schedule then you should be here that day. I get that things can come up but it doesn't seem fair and it ends up being on me since my other co-worker is out doing her job.

The other thing is that she never works a full day at the office, even when she's here she Will leave in the afternoon and ""work from home"" yet doesn't answer her emails, isn't on teams and didn't even know how to access the VPN. 

This is only my first month here and I don't want to rock the boat, I report to a VP and she reports to the CEO. I haven't said anything but because of her I have come in every day and have never worked from home even even though I have entitled to work from home 3 days a week.

Ultimately I am just happy that I have a job that I love doing. My other co-worker who is on the road brought this up to HR and basically said that she feels that someone needs to dictate the hours to us instead deciding for our own but I feel like even if someone decides the problem co-worker will switch or leave halfway through the day HR said we will talk about it at a meeting in a few weeks so I am leaving it alone, but I would love any feedback and opinions on this

1ffrhrs," Seeking Advice on Where to Relocate Abroad with Family: Tech Job Opportunities, Quality of Life, and Safety","Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on where my family and I should move abroad. I'm a frontend engineer working in tech, and we currently live in Italy, but I'm not seeing a promising future here in terms of work opportunities or possibilities for my daughter. My family consists of me, my wife, and our one-year-old daughter, and we're also considering having a second child soon.

I'm open to suggestions on the best countries to move to, considering the following factors: safety, job opportunities in tech and other fields (my wife works in digital marketing but is interested in transitioning to product management or HR), quality of education for children, multicultural environment, career aspirations, and overall quality of life.

For example, Germany appeals to me due to high salaries, good quality of life, safety, and strong career prospects—Munich, in particular, seems like a great option. On the other hand, the US seems less appealing due to concerns about maternity leave, job security, and overall safety. Canada looks promising, but I'd love to hear if that matches reality. I've also heard good things about Copenhagen in terms of quality of life.

Do you live in any of these places or have other recommendations? I would really appreciate your insights on the best places to live and work in tech with a young family.

1ffpmbs,Laid off…Company wants to hire me back with no incentive. ,"Hi all. I was laid off the first week of May of this year from a smaller sales driven company. Recently they had some staffing changes and have called me to offer me my job back. 

I was not given a severance after the lay off. Just pay for the time I put in that pay period and any owed commissions. This put me and my family in a horrific financial spot. 

During a meeting with an executive team member to discuss my return, I asked for a simple yet fair “sign on bonus” if you will that would equate to approximately the amount that they would pay their typical headhunter to fill this position. The counter offer I got was to “front load some commissions” Effectively, a loan of the potential money I would make on commissions a few months down the road. 

I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with. However, after being treated as disposable it is very difficult for me to jump back into this, especially without any concern for my family’s wellbeing on their part.

1ffof63,Should I take few steps back to move forward?,"Currently I have 3 years of work experience in an automobile company. I had joined and served as an EA to one of the CXOs. Recently, I transitioned to a more field oriented sales role in said company because I thought it would be helpful to get some front line experience. I hate my new role and I have come to the conclusion that this type of work is not for me. 

Moreover, I do not want to work in this industry anymore. Essentially I'm looking to switch to a different industry. This has been my mood for the past 2 years but the comfort of the job prevented from seeking to change. 

For the past month, I had been applying tirelessly to marketing and strategy roles I could find. But till date, nothing has bore fruit.

Apart from lacking the relevant experience (which I am trying to bridge by enrolling in courses and doing self-learning projects), I think the issue could be that my current ctc is on the higher side and deterring any potential recruiters. Plus, my variable pay accounts for only 3% of the full ctc.

My question is - would it be worth it if I was open to a significant paycut, just so I could land a job more in-line with my goals? Any advice from people who have done this would be greatly appreciated.

1fflcqa,Is this job worth it? (31k salary) ,"I am around 3 months post grad with a bachelor’s degree in journalism. I have 5-6 internships on my resume and 2-3 real work experiences in the industry. I am also currently studying for the LSAT and plan to enroll in a part time program in Fall 25/26. I didnt consider law school until after graduation and I met a lawyer through my internship. 

 I took an internship with my dream company following graduation hoping it would turn into a full time role, like my recruiter hinted at. Long story short after my internship ended I was ghosted by my recruiter and never heard back despite having interviewed and being considered for not one but two full time roles… I wish I knew what happened. The salary for both positions was around 40k, based in Connecticut. 

Since then I have interviewed with 3 other companies, and landed an offer an a News Reporter/Anchor in a small market in Mississippi, with a salary of 31k. This is extremely low but right now i have NO income. Im living with my mom in Texas. 

Finding an apartment i can afford with that has been impossible. 

I make myself feel better about the pay by considering if I had decied to go get a masters like most of my friends id proably be taking out 30k in loans rather than making it as a salary. 

With the rate of this job market I really dont believe I will find something else.

This role is the perfect opportunity to grow as a journalist dispite the pay. I should also note my contract is 1 year, so I’m free to move to another company/station after a year. 

So basically, should I take the job just to gain more experience in my industry? Since I plan on going to law school in the next 2 years anyways, I know 6 figures is in my future somewhere. 

I am so stressed I cannot even be excited about this job offer, even though this is the perfect role for me (despite the pay) and I love the station and my colleagues would be great. My parents are not offering me any help financially, and I know I am a full on college graduate, but it’s hard not to compare yourself when you went to a big SEC school surrounded by kids with loaded parents and still get their life funded after graduating.

backstory:

- work in a sometimes low stress but then sometimes zero-to-sixty job, where it can easily become very fast faced and high stress

- keeping it vague so just know that it involves transmission / distribution all the way from 12kV up to 745kV

- some ""clicks"" or ""switch actions"" are very very critical and cannot be fudged up, at all, ever (IE, opening a 345kV breaker dropping tens of thousands of utility customers when you meant to open a 69kV breaker via scada parallelled bus not resulting in any loss of load just a big f\*\*\* up

- 85-90% of ""mouse clicks"" however, are not this and do not need micro-managing as they are me reviewing circuits, loadings, etc.

- i however am being trained where the ""trainer"" is legitimately, telling me where to click 80-90% of the time, on shit i have full discretion over (IE, do i use this file explorer or that file explorer to open that file?)

- at least 80% of the time he is preemptively telling me, ""okay next you click there"" all fucking shift long and get this - he's ""proud"" of how he trains.

- guess what? the guy he trained now trains new people like that so it's worsening.

anyways, what the hell gives with these kind of people? this ""trainer"" will also talk all damn shift long sometimes for 30 minutes straight ABOUT ANYTHING, and once talked for i swear TWO hours straight, about random ass shit.

I was hired to work on this one project, and for the first 2.5-3 months I barely had anything to do despite asking. At month three, my peer-level coworker (technically a step above me) was very abruptly (and sounds not justly) fired. Since I've been here, I've heard of multiple other people on the team that were   abruptly fired, and overall there's been a lot of churn in the department. They've also been trying to hire an AVP role for 9 MONTHS now but somehow have found nobody good enough.

We're a team of three now, and I've taken on basically all the fired-guy's tasks. I've received virtually no training and am making do with some SOPs, many of which are poorly written and outdated. I think I'm doing things correctly, but I'm not sure. When I ask her questions and she looks at me with what seems like complete contempt and then will rush through an explanation. 

All day I hear her in her office ragging on other coworkers behind their backs (calling them dense, incompetent, etc) and so I've become increasingly scared to ask her anything, let alone ask her about something I need further clarification on. She's given me no feedback, so for all I know I'm the one she's calling dense. She's never even once asked me ""how are you doing,"" or ""how do you feel like you're settling in."" Or a simple ""I know things are crazy right now, I appreciate your flexibility.""

Considering I was hired to work on something completely different, and now I've (uncomplainingly) taken over this over guy's role despite having no experience in it, I feel I'm doing pretty good. But I sense she dislikes me and thinks I'm stupid. But I'm also kind of peeved I'm doing senior level work, but not receiving senior level pay/title. I see they're advertising for his role, so they plan on sticking someone in above me who I will now likely have to train on these systems, which doesn't seem just.

All around, I feel kind of used. I don't feel like I can start looking for another job considering I've been here 4ish months. I also felt like I needed to stay here a couple years because I left my last job after 1 year (non-existent manager, bad hours, 10 PM calls on Saturday, that kind of thing, insulting compensation for what they expected of you). 

I'm feeling so demoralized after these two experiences. I don't feel I have the ""psychological safety"" to bring these things up with her. But as the junior-most person on the team, why am I having to be the one to do all the outreach? I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable here.

1ffheat,graduating May 2025 -  4-month contract - start a new job or stay with the same team ,"Hi, 

I'm seeking some advice for my situation. Currently, I'm pursuing a 4-month internship this the fall. In winter 2025, I am going back to school to write my master's dissertation and complete my master's in environment in spring 2025. My priority is to enter the job market. 

At the moment, I'm completing an internship with company A (transportation + environment) for the fall. So far it's been amazing and it's related to my master's dissertation. Most colleagues have been bridged as students and there is a lot to work on.

  
This afternoon, I received an email from company B (health and substances) for an interview for a part-time student contract while I'm in school in winter 2025. The job is not related to my master's, but would allow me to explore a new team. 

  
Last week, I had an interview with company C (wildfires). Today, I received an email saying how they were impressed and they wanted to give me a part-time student contract while I'm in school. During the interview, they mention that there might be a chance for me to get bridged. 

  
And maybe worth mentioning, during the summer, I got interviewed by company D (environment and endangered species) for an internship, but decided to move on with company A. In August, I reached out to company D to let them know that while I was interested in their company, I chose company A because it was in my interest, AND also because it was related to my master's. Company D totally understood and said they were seeking a 2-year term employee for their team and that I could be a potential candidate. Since then I haven't heard any news. 

  
As these companies are all in the public sector and that I'm graduating not long after the fiscal year, it's hard to know who will receive funding and which team is more prompt to hire new people. 

  
These are all good opportunities, but I know each option holds a different scenario. Another caveat is because 4 months part time is so short, it's hard to fully get your hands on the projects + leave a good impression with the restricted amount of time (< 20 hours) vs being full-time for 4 months. 

Also... in our country, elections are in less than a year, which means there is more instability. Company C expects an answer by early next week. 

  
I'm just not sure what to do... Advice?",Designer_Safe1115,2,1.0,0,1726186210,2024-09-13 00:10:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffheat/graduating_may_2025_4month_contract_start_a_new/,9,2024
1ffgyi4,New role opening up but I have only been in the company for 3 months. ,"
I started my current job almost 3 months ago, and next week marks my 90-day milestone. Before this role, I had a 1.5-year gap in my career due to mass layoffs and recovering from an accident. Even though I have 3+ years of experience, I took an entry-level position at $23/hour because I needed to secure an income. The company I work for is a multibillion software company in the Bay Area. 

So far, I absolutely love working here—the culture, my colleagues, the technology, and the tasks I handle are all enjoyable. However, the low pay is a downside, and I feel like I’m not being fully utilized given my background and skills.

I have weekly 1:1s with my manager, and our discussions always feel productive. We've talked about me taking on new responsibilities and adjusting processes, leveraging my previous experience. Recently, a new role opened up that includes some of the tasks I’m already handling, which weren’t originally part of my job description. My experience matches some of the requirements for the position.

The director sent out a message to our team of 25 asking for input or questions about the new role, and I’m really interested in applying. My manager has been very supportive, but I’m concerned about how they may view my interest given the career gap I had and the way they’ve pushed me to go beyond my current role. The pay range for this new position is higher than what I earned in my previous role, and I felt that salary was already reasonable.

How should I approach this? ",rutherne,3,1.0,1,1726184894,2024-09-12 23:48:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffgyi4/new_role_opening_up_but_i_have_only_been_in_the/,9,2024

Am I right to ask for a raise? How do I reveal that I have this information without getting myself in trouble?

A few other notes on the salaries:

* People who have been with the company the longest are earning less. Is it a bad idea to clue in my coworkers as to how they're being screwed over?

1ffgje1,I am autistic and deaf. I think I no longer want to work as a software engineer or in other IT development areas. I am looking for new and simpler careers.,"Hello! 

After two and a half years working as a software engineer for a company, I came to the conclusion that I no longer want to continue in this role based on my experience.

However, I have enjoyed Linux and programming since the 2010s, and been passionate about IT since I was 9 years old. I like working on both backend and frontend projects, but I prefer tasks that allow me to work independently on simple projects. I enjoy using Docker, GitHub, GitLab pipelines, and git.

I’m not interested in working on complex projects. I dislike unit testing and prefer not to work on MVC projects, even though I like Django, PHP, Python, and C#. I also hate outdated and unsolvable projects, as they negatively impact my performance and could risk my job security. I am fine with rectifications when necessary.

I prefer not to work in teams because I do not want to assist or help anyone and because I am selective about friendships. Additionally, I decided not to ask or seek help from others any more. My focus is on protecting my job, maintaining my performance, and earning my merits independently.

Therefore, I am now seeking new and simpler career paths.",gusbemacbe1989,1,1.0,1,1726183642,2024-09-12 23:27:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffgje1/i_am_autistic_and_deaf_i_think_i_no_longer_want/,9,2024

1ffgc7c,Asking for severance pay,"For background in 24 (f). I work for a small business for over 2 years. 

My boss has accused me of doing things with absolutely no evidence or Documentation.

She keeps on saying I need to figure something out with you or

I haven’t seen anything like this in my 15 years of business or 

I need to see what happens in the next few weeks or

This job isnt for everyone 

If I make an innocent mistake I get a threatening text saying she needs to figure something out for me.

Why has she kept me for 2 years then?? 

Yes I am in the beginning phases of a career change. 

The only reason I’m staying is because I’m waiting to be called for next job. It isn’t a stable job in the beginning until Im hired full time so I just figured what’s the point of starting something else if I’m leaving

If my boss keeps on threatening me my job could I ask for a severance pay?

She could be miserable and just enjoys bothering me.

Does she want to fire me but is fearful of a lawsuit or I will take action against her? 

Is it appropriate in this situation to ask for severance pay?

I don’t mind keeping it until my next job. Maybe she is mad because she knows I’m on my way out.

I’ve just had enough of the threats, I wanna do her the favor and just ask for severance pay.

Rather not work for her if I can get it. But wouldn’t she have given me that option if she really disliked me??? ",Electronic_Ad_6354,0,0.5,7,1726183068,2024-09-12 23:17:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffgc7c/asking_for_severance_pay/,9,2024

1ffeymo,Help Negotiating new job,"I have the opportunity for a new job and I have never had to negotiate my compensation and benefits. I'm really not sure how to go about this except for waiting until I'm offered the job. I would love some tips as I am worried I might come off anxious, demanding, or desperate.

1. Job title bump from Sr. Manager to Director. I have been a director in my last 3 roles. The person I would report to is VP. This is super important to me and I would take the title bump over extra money. There is someone with a title similar to what I want and I don't want to step on their toes. They is a Director of International Marketing and XYZ, but I only want to be Director of Marketing domestically. Id even be open to Director of Marketing - CRM (or something like that).

2. Vacation that's already planned. Normally I would not take a 2 week vacation in the first few months of being hired but I have an international trip planned for Thanksgiving through mid December and I don't want to cancel it. It's specifically to see a seasonal event. Do I bring this up when negotiating? I don't want to spring it on them later and be denied since tickets are already purchased.

3. Salary - The job ad said $120,000 - $150,000. BUT when I talked to the company's recruiter during screening he said $150,000 and he could go up to $180,000. I'm not sure if the job ad was wrong, he misspoke or if he was just impressed with my resume. My last salary was $150,000. I was laid off several months ago for budget cuts. I want a job but I also don't want to undersell myself. I've heard the trick of asking ""How much do you have set aside for this role"" and then responding with ""I would be okay with that."" But that does sound a little like I've set them up to be trapped or something.

4. How do I bring this stuff up? When they email me that I have the job do I email back my needs, do I wait for the offer letter then respond, or do I ask to set up a call to negotiate (and do I call it negotiation or do I just say discuss my needs?)

1ffeicv,Leaving a job gracefully when there isn't much grace left. ,"Hi everyone. I recently resigned from my job on the spot after months of mismanagement that culminated in a constructive dismissal. I worked in an office for 3 years that went through a significant change in leadership along with a data migration. With this came a pretty demoralizing change in company culture where I went from being trusted to do my job, to what amounted to a scapegoat for longstanding issues in the company. Without saying too much, the culture shift came with a high degree of micromanagement and some pretty inappropriate concerns about my plans to have children. I tried to make the best of it, but the stress resulted in me not performing very well. A long commute and inflexible schedule made conducting interviews while I worked impossible. Over the course of 3 months I racked up a dozen ""PIPs"" and had my self esteem drained to nothing. I wasn't sleeping, eating well, or taking care of myself the way I should and this came to a head last week during yet another impromptu performance review that occurred during my scheduled break. I stood up, stated that this would be my official resignation, and promptly left the premises with my things. I should note, my husband works for another company under the same ownership, at a different location. He's the golden child of the company.

During my time at this company, I did not have much interaction with the CEO, but my husband does. CEO loves my husband, and hired me after I moved from out of state at a time where I was looking for work. Despite the role not working out, the man did me a solid and has treated my family incredibly well. I am debating if I should send him communication to thank him for the opportunity and apologize about the promptness of my resignation. On one hand, I want to wash my hands of the situation and keep my departure quiet. I don't want any communication to be interpreted as unwelcome or make anyone uncomfortable. On the other hand, my husband thinks I should reach out for the sake of formal closure, and that this won't be interpreted badly. I have never left a long term job like this before. Any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. I am not interested in reporting anything legally speaking as the company is small enough that eeoc will likely not apply.

Old Job Boss called me and offered me my same job back but at a different location.  Saying you and I both know it won't be as stressful (smaller footprint).   Still doesn't change the nepotism issue (he says the CEO/owner has handled it), no 401K and back to 100% customer facing role.  But it's 100% job security.   

I have been looking for other jobs since i took this new one as I could tell something wasn't right but so far nothing of substance has happened (most are 50% plus pay cuts) or same type of job I left in Feb.  Is there any reason I should consider going back that I am not seeing?   Late 40s F, BS and MA Degree - business, 20+ years in Director level operations roles.

1ffe2fl,What the fuck do I do?,"greetings reddit.  

ive been practically living on this sub for the past few months, and finally decided to make an account just to ask my own question. this seems to be the place to ask for career guidance so  here’s what’s what: 

I (27M), did my undergrad in music and film. naturally the past few years have been pretty shitty, employment wise. note- I’ve had no trouble getting work but it’s just that i dont like the jobs that i can get. did some teaching, some retail, some freelance shit. but things changed. I changed. maybe it’s just part of growing up but i want more stability and security in my life and career. seems pretty obvious but im sick of excelling at jobs that ultimately lead nowhere. Sucky part is that im not qualified to do any of the jobs i actually want - ones that i can support myself on and build a fucking life. so im looking to go back to school. I like learning about economics, and excelled in the courses i had to take during undergrad, so i figured i could look into that field (econ, finance, accounting, etc.). Ive been looking online and found that if i take some prerequisite courses, i could get in to the masters in econ program at a state school near me. (I read that a masters would hold more weight, and i wouldn’t have to go through the hassle of a second bachelors.) But while i was making all my arrangements for courses and applications and whatnot, i stopped myself. Im the type to oftentimes put the cart way before the horse. here i am lining up a shot i dont even know if i want to take! So then, after reading some subs from people who also pivoted, i decided to look into temp work. I can get some more professional experience and may find that i hate finance work! I liked studying it, but i have to make sure it will be something i can be comfortable working in. (The time to explore and study fascinating things like a 19 year old undergrad has passed - i need my further education to be solely relevant to my career.) I think it’s a good idea, temp work. best case scenario i can get in with a company i really like, in a field i didnt know i would like, and work my way up and eventually go back to school at night and have the company pay for it. Wishful thinking maybe, but i know it happens. im totally second guessing myself here, but the question has to be asked: am i making a mistake? should i not just take the shot i have lined up with the econ masters? It’s a versatile and employable degree, i think, so should i just focus on that? and is temping going to be a bunch of bullshit that is just going to cost me MORE time? im just so desperate to get a career in order. i feel so ashamed and late and like such a burnout compared to my friends. i do my best to drown out that kind of talk and just focus on what i CAN do, but still. I’m looking to play the long game here.

    I'm planning to migrate to the US soon, specifically Portland, OR. I need your advice☺️

    I got my associate's degree in 2014, worked in a foundry for 3 years in different positions, such as: steelmaker, continuous casting machine operator, got a bachelor's degree in materials science (specialization: metals) but then I joined the army and stayed there for 6 years.

I would like to know how things are in the US at foundries.

1) Is it difficult for a foreigner with a foreign education to get a job in a foundry? What is the approximate salary and does education affect the salary?
2) I would like to use my materials science degree for the first time😁 How difficult is it to find an internship/first job without experience as an engineer?
3) maybe you can advise me on some development paths?
 4) I am also interested in retraining as a design engineer (I loved drawing in CAD systems)

1ffd1sw,Can I get fired because my HR fucked up,"I work at an organization where I joined as part of a leadership program with almost 25 of my peers. It's been more than a year since I've been working here. Recently, our managers had to fill in a form regarding our performance. A lot of details are quite mundane so managers often ask their employees to fill it and then make changes before submitting. This template also has details regarding your performance rating amongst other things.

The HR wanted managers to fill this form and then upload it to a drive location. However, they did not restrict the access on it, and so everyone could access it. Besides, it wasn't mentioned either to our managers or to us that there was any confidential data, and when I asked my manager regarding a few questions, he suggested I look at a few filled forms and draw inspiration.

Today, our HR gets 10 of us on a call out of the blue. Turns out, someone from senior leadership alerted them that this is publicly available. When we mentioned that it was publicly available, they put the onus on us- saying that we should have know that such information is privileged.They tracked the view history on the location and sent us a mail asking to acknowledge that we viewed confidential data and understand the seriousness of the situation (which I did not acknowledge because it seems like an excuse to shift blame).

I want to understand how bad it can get. I spoke to the others on the call and they seem to think we will get away with a warning at best, but I'm not too sure because HR is usually pretty strict about such things.

Who is at fault? And is there anything I can/should do to protect myself?",CarnationsInTheRain,32,0.9200000166893005,36,1726174162,2024-09-12 20:49:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffd1sw/can_i_get_fired_because_my_hr_fucked_up/,9,2024
1ffcuew,26F - what career to pursue next?,"I'm based in the UK. I (26F) am unsure of what career to pursue next. I have a BA in English Literature and graduated in 2019. Throughout uni I worked in retail / tutoring and a had brief stint as a carer. After uni, I worked in retail until covid hit and my company put me on furlough and then let me go. I was unemployed for a while, and I decided I wanted to pursue my childhood dream of being a writer.

I went on universal credit, and did a content writing apprenticeship, built a website and u.c helped me find a temporary content writer role. It was an unfulfilling role and I realised that I didn't want to do writing for a living. I travelled for a few months and when I returned in May 2022. I decided I wanted to work with kids because I wasn't sure if I wanted to have any of my own and figured working with kids would help me figure out if that was what I wanted in the future. I've been a TA for two years and I never intended to stay as long as I did. In fact I was learning how to code on the side throughout 2022 / 2023 but I felt so incredibly burnt out from the experience, waking up feeling stressed due to the pressure to have a stable and successful career, damaging my eyesight from sitting in front of the screen for so many hours a day, pushing myself to my limit to learn this skill whilst struggling to grasp the concepts I was learning. Eventually I gave up at the start of this year after bombing an internship interview and realised that I couldn't go on because I didn't really want to be a programmer, I just wanted more money. I ended up working at a nursery which I loved for seven months, which was great but they weren't hiring for a permanent role and I also didn't want to continue working with kids. I also felt like I feel like I've got everything that I needed out of this experience of being a TA and I'm ready to move on.

I realise that I've bounced around a lot, which has meant that I haven't been able to make much money, and the roles that I've been in have all been minimum wage. I know I want a stable income in a low-stress career, but I’ve realized that healthcare, teaching, and working with the general public aren’t for me. I also don’t want to work with kids anymore. I’m more of a creative person, so highly technical roles or ones where I’m glued to a screen for hours don’t really suit me either.

I don’t have many technical skills, which makes me lean toward a more creative, non-technical career that aligns with my strengths. I don't thrive in fast paced roles / environments. I’m just not sure if I’m asking for too much—a stable, low-stress job that’s also fulfilling and allows room for creativity. It feels difficult to find the right balance between what I want and what’s actually possible given my skill set. I've been looking at marketing roles, but I'm not 100% sure if this is what I want to pursue.

I’m also hoping to relocate at some point in the future, so I’d like a career that gives me the flexibility to make that change when the time is right.

1ffbaei,Should I quit my toxic job? ,"I've been with my current employer for nearly 7 years. Every performance review, I've said that my 5 year plan includes trying to get a promotion. I've always asked what kind of experience and skills I should seek out to put me on the right path. I'm not looking to be a people manager. I'm a technical expert so looking more for an in-role promotion - more senior sounding title, more pay but stay with the same team / team leader.

Last year I also finished a PhD and said I'd hope to be able to develop my role to put my skills into good use and would like to see a title / salary boost in the next annual performance round. Did I get it? No. Did my boss explain why? No, despite me asking what I could've done (better). He said it's a question of when (not if) and said perhaps 3 years. So I'll have spent 10 years in a role with no growth at all despite getting a phd and lots of other valuable training and experience in the meantime? I've developed a shit ton of work. 

I'm not delusional about my value. I do a lot of technical design and development work that our organisation wouldn't be able to do if I wasn't there. I am well respected by senior management. And I also have good presentation/ communication skills (so not a technical nerd that can't really manage projects or people). 

The reason I've been denied I think is that my boss is a micromanager with a huge ego. He's the type that steals credit, talks over you, hoards the chance to present to senior management even when he's had no role in doing the work. I can imagine he wants to keep me as subordinate as possible as I'm now much better qualified than he is. I don't see why I'm a threat - he's a senior person - you'd think he'd be happy with a high performing team. But no - he wants to be the best and brightest and will stomp out any self confidence anyone else has.

I got a new job offer and am thinking of going for it. Very intellectually challenging work and the hiring manager seems very supportive - complete opposite of my current boss. The catch is that it involves a 35% paycut. Research just doesn't pay as well as a corporate job. The salary is fine just not super generous like my current place. 

My instinct is to just move on instead of using the new job offer to squeeze out the promotion from my line manager. It's a misery to work for him. And for any future promotions I'd have to put up with this subordination again. 

He's going to be screwed once I leave. He'll be found out that I've been doing the work all along and he's just selectively put his name on stuff (despite really not achieving much at all the past few years).

The pay (& benefits) of my current place is pretty amazing.

1ffahs8,How to a Difficult & Avoidant Manager in My Side Hustle?,"I'm 31M. I am currently working in a short-term academic contract alongside my full-time career. I've run into an ongoing frustrating situation with a Manager I onboarded about a year ago.

In September 2023, I helped onboard this Manager for this NFP Organisation where I have admin access that I granted and upskilled them. I never had any personal issues with the Manager, and I wasn’t seeking any leadership, I've been in the NFP Organisation long enough that I randomly have admin access. In December 2023, this Manager randomly tried to terminate my academic contract, despite me working in a different area of the organisation. I believe they saw me as competition, although I have no interest in leadership. I'm just focused on my academic commitments lol

This attempt to cancel my contract led to a lot of unnecessary stress, with it taking around 12 weeks to resolve the internal politics. I raised a formal complaint, particularly since I have good relationships with the CEO and C-level Executives. It was clear imo the Manager acted with malice, and they got a slap on the wrist, I didn’t push for harsher consequences. I just want them to stop crossing over into my career without any legitimate reason.

I had noticed this a week ago, this Manager has blocked my phone number, removed me from email listings, and even blocked me on LinkedIn. I’m still contracted for other additional work that requires me to submit deliverables to the Manager by the end of October. It’s getting to the point where other Lead's in the NFP Organisation are asking me for advice on how to deal with this person, with the common comment that the Manager is avoidant and difficult to work with.

I’m not interested in making this into a bigger deal or having to deal with another headache. It’s frustrating that I can’t do my side job in the normal BAU process whilst navigating through this random drama. I just want to finish the October contract work without any further issues, and focus on my main academic work that does not involve this indidivudal.

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can handle this situation professionally, and potentially without escalating it further?",Renskol,1,1.0,1,1726167728,2024-09-12 19:02:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ffahs8/how_to_a_difficult_avoidant_manager_in_my_side/,9,2024

I'm in a tough spot at work. I’ve been with my company for 5 years, started as a student, and now I’m doing a PhD while working full-time for the last 3 years. My director, who’s also my mentor, suggested the PhD. I love the job and have a clear vision for my future.

Recently, a coworker my age quit; he earned about 30% more than me. A top consultant at the firm suggested I take over his work since we worked together, and he thinks I'm a good fit. The directors offered me a 10% raise through my manager; I countered with 30%, and they came back with 15%. We’re meeting next week to finalize.

I've been underpaid from the start, and when I ask about salary criteria, the directors get defensive, mentioning things like their wives don’t earn as much or that ""we’re all equal."" I need to stay another year because of my PhD and upcoming professional license, but even with 30%, I’d still be underpaid since I’d be handling two roles solo.

How can I apply maximum pressure in negotiations, regardless of the outcome? I know I need to leave eventually, but I need to stick it out for at least another year. My mentor is an passive aggressive ego maniac whos close to retirement and is really, really narcissistic person. Not only my thoughts if it clears anything up.

1ff9yif,Is it time to throw in the towel?,"I’m beyond frustrated with my newish job. I was laid off because my old company went bankrupt back in Feb. and was able to land on my feet pretty quickly; however, it’s for a job and an industry I just don’t enjoy. There are some days I’m excited about my work and am eager to make an impact but other days I’m like fuck this shit. The company is large and global but don’t have their shit together at all.

I work with a lot of older people who are old school, so it’s obstacle after obstacle. Even some of the marketers on my team don’t have a clue what they are talking about. I just feel like I entered some alternate universe and am being gaslit.

The role is Digital Communications Manager and was advertised that way but it’s really more of a digital marketing role. I have experience in web, social, and emails, which was what the role started with and was the original expectation set by my boss…great! Now it’s also paid advertising, webinars, and influencer marketing. These are all seperate jobs and things that require specialized people whereas I’m more high level with this extra stuff and don’t have time to do it all.

I’m just not as happy as I should be, and I know you don’t always love your job, but I did really enjoy my last few roles and am usually able to find the positive in a bad situation. The very low days I legit feel like I could cry because of how disappointed I am about this role. I’m not sure if I should throw in the towel and start the job search again. I came from a fun travel industry and got free travel and generally loved the people in the industry, so most industries would be worse in comparison, so I’m just not sure if that’s clouding my judgement. I think I’m more or less frustrated too because I feel like I used to learn from the people I worked with and respected them but now I feel like I’m surrounded by people who I can’t learn from and we just don’t see eye to eye at all.

My big concern with leaving is I have a job hop past and have been in management the last 2-3 years, so I know job hopping isn’t great now compared to when I was entry level and young.

I did have one interview recently and I’m praying I get moved through the process as I would take the job in a heartbeat as it’s more communications vs marketing and in my last industry, but there hasn’t been anything else yet.

Otherwise, the pay and benefits are great in my current role. It’s also incredibly stable. There are more people than not who have been at this company for a decade, two decades, and even three decades. I totally have golden handcuffs on I think…

1ff9lfw,"3 Months into my new job, and I'm feeling sick of it (USA)","I'm posting this since I'm just looking for advice on what to do next. For background, I've been working as an Electrical Engineer for 3+ years full time (4+ years including internships). I'm working as a Electrical Design Engineer, primarily working with embedded PCBs with microcontrollers and peripherals devices.

So I started working at a new company about 3 months ago since I wanted to move back to my home state for personal reasons. Moving required me to leave my previous job since working remotely perminantly wasn't allowed with my role as an EE. Community to my home state and my previous job wasn't an option since it's a 5 and a half hour trip by car.

I loved my last job and I loved the work I did. But right now, I feel the complete opposite at my new job. I made a list of things I like/don't like to help give context to what I feel is missing.


Things I liked at my previous job:
- The Schematic and PCB Design 
- The products I worked on
- Felt challenged appropriately
- More flexibility working from home and working in office
- More PTO (20 days)
- PTO was all accessible on first day of hire
- Unlimited Sick Days


Things I didn't like:
- Some of the ME's were difficult to work with.
- Had a more experienced EE that was a total dick (he left almost year before I did).
- Felt like information wasn't always communicated to the proper channels.


Things I like about my new Job:
- I'm in my home state.
- I have an opportunity to be an EE lead to set standards and best practices for future projects.


Things I don't like about my new job:
- Our engineering department is overloaded with projects currently. Too many projects with too little man power. When an issue comes up, one project entirely gets dropped temporarily to work on it.
- We don't have a schedule for any project for when it.
- My director is so busy that he has to constantly move meeting (i.e. weekly project status meeting, but weekly check in, etc).
- Sometimes meeting feel like they start whenever they want and end whenever hey want (i.e. had a meeting literally last all day a couple weeks ago).
- Similar thing when just asking my director a question. Sometimes going into his office for a 10 minute discussion turns into a 90 minute discussion.
- The work I'm currently doing isn't challenging or rewarding.
- PTO feels weak imo (10 days)
- Sick Days feel very weak (5 days)

Since I'm at the 3 month mark, I'm honestly at the point to where going to work to me means getting a paycheck. I don't want to go to work, I don't want to feel bored at work, I don't want to talk to my director for an hour when it could have been a 5 minute discussion. I'm just not feeling this type of work. I feel like once I get to the 6 month mark and if I still feel this way, then I feel like I should start looking around for other opportunities.

Please comment your thoughts on this, and if what I'm feeling currently makes sense or not.",ThePeacefulOne,1,1.0,0,1726165508,2024-09-12 18:25:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ff9lfw/3_months_into_my_new_job_and_im_feeling_sick_of/,9,2024
1ff98dg,Seeking Advice for Transitioning to Product Development (Non CS background),"Hi everyone,

I recently joined a product-based company as a lead in Product Development. The main product involves both mechanical and software solutions, and my role is to support these two teams. My background includes 4 years of experience in the civil engineering design field, and I'm quite proficient in coding and problem-solving.

Given my non-CS background, I'm curious to hear from anyone who has made a similar transition. What advice do you have for someone in my position? How did you navigate the shift, and what steps did you take to prepare? Any specific skills, resources, or strategies that were particularly helpful would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your insights and experiences!

1ff9616,Transitioning to Product Management. How Should I Best Use 3 Months to Upskill?,"I’ve been out of work for over a year, applying for jobs without success. I’ve come close a few times but not successful. At this point, I feel it’s time to pivot and make the most of the next three months to upskill.

I have a background in business (Bachelor’s degree) with experience in marketing and project management. However, I realize my technical skills aren’t strong enough for the product management roles I’m aiming for. My goal is to land a PM or strategy-focused role in the tech industry, though I’m open to suggestions on the specific sector.

I’ve been pursuing certifications (obtained my PMP) and have basic coding and design skills. I’m planning to dedicate the next three months to focused learning. 

My questions are:
1. What skills should I focus on to become a competitive PM candidate?
2. Are there any free or affordable resources you’d recommend?
3.Would it be worth investing in any specific paid courses?
4. Is three months enough time to significantly improve my tech skills, or should I focus on other areas?

Should I start studying the AAT (accountancy qualification here in the UK) while actively searching for apprenticeships, which shows my interest? Should I do some online courses, such as learning excel?

1ff8kic,In person or online??: rejecting a job offer you’ve already accepted ,"I was offered a job by a company I really like and (verbally) accepted. Only issue was it was a starting position with kind of low pay so I started looking for part time afternoon work to supplement; from that search I was offered my literal dream job. However that job is (didn’t realize when applying) a full time position, so I wouldn’t be able to feasibly do both at the same time. 
To clarify, I haven’t signed any paperwork yet for Job 1 so I’m not breaking any sort of contract, and I told them I was looking for supplemental part time work. I know exactly what I want to say to Job 1, because I would like to leave on a good note; I’m just going to tell the truth and say that the decision boiled down to numbers. Job 2 has already started sending over offer letters/employee paperwork offering a higher salary and better benefits. 

My main question is, Job 1 is a small but growing business, so getting management in person can be a bit of a challenge. I know it would be the mature thing to talk to them in person, but how should I go about setting that meeting other than a “can we talk?” email?? Or would it be fine to just reject them via the computer?

1ff8i2s,Company Growth and Offshore Labor - Mixed emotions.,"Hey all I could use some fresh perspectives here… I work middle management for company of about 600 people. I’ve been successfully managing a team of 8 people, and things are going great… However I’ve recently been informed that the company is looking to offshore more than half my team by end of Q2, next year… I’m currently not concerned about my own job as it’s incredibly niche, and I have a very tight relationship with the VP, who I report to directly... 

My main problem is that I have a very good relationship with my team, I’ve worked hard to cultivate a positive environment, I do believe I’ve gained their trust and respect. I likewise have a lot of admiration and appreciation for the work they put in, and do not underestimate their impact on my success. That’s why I’m having an incredibly hard time with this higher up decision to offshore their jobs. My team has been 100% remote since the pandemic… 

My boss is convinced this is the necessary path of all companies experiencing growth, and that we have to make a the move for long term sustainability, as we grow into other markets and pursue a national footprint.

I’m no saint, but am having a hard time accepting this on an ethical and moral front than I thought I would… Four of the people currently on my team are stay at home moms…  A part of me wants to just leave, but I make 6 figures and have an invaluable relationship with members of Senior Leadership there… I also do not have a college degree, and am unsure if I could make comparable money somewhere else, or if I would be faced with the same challenges in management elsewhere, even if I were to leave, as it does seem like more and more companies are opting for AI and Offshore labor…

I’m torn on if staying will cause my integrity/morals on this to be compromised, and if I’ll resent myself for it, or if AI and Offshoring is inescapable, and I’d be foolish to relinquish my position when this is likely happening all over…

1ff82nn,Fresh MBA in a Silent Job Market,"I graduated with an MBA at the end of August and have been applying to jobs since. I have been actively searching for work over the last 3 weeks and haven't had a single interview request. The stranger thing is I also haven't been actively rejected as much as I expected. Recruiters have been quiet as well with maybe one phone call a week. I apply to 30-50 jobs a day on company websites, contact recruiters, and network as much as possible. 

I am disabled, and my disability has led to unemployment in the past as I juggled my health, my MBA program, my volunteering, and responsibilities of my job. I lost 3 jobs in the past 2 years, however one of them was due to the firm not bringing in enough clients or revenue to support my salary, the next one the position was dissolved due to the firm seeing no need for it (it was a newly created position), and the latest was due to my skills not being adequate for the position (I didnt have sufficient knowledge in IR, global politics, or US National Security. The position was an Analyst role but should have been advertised as an investigation role). When asked about my employment over this period, I explain the situations as I have here (more professionally and with less emotion) and for the aforementioned last 2 positions I explain what I learned from the situations. Further, I am a director of a non-profit and use the experience in my resume to help show I can stay at a ""job"" for several years. Prior to starting the MBA, I had years of stable employment. I am industry agnostic, but am looking into the fields I have the most experience in which are biomedical and food/beverage.

I am reaching out to resources to help me on the job hunt concerning my disability since it has significantly impacted my ability to attain and maintain employment. But, especially those who have postgraduate degrees, has anyone else encountered this kind of job market? I know it's a numbers game at this point, but does anyone have any tips? It's odd to me how I am not hearing back negatively concerning jobs I applied for when I also am not getting any calls for a basic intro interview. I am losing hope in general, and maybe that's premature since I essentially ""just started,"" but I feel awful and don't want to feel bad about myself as a person.

1ff6dqf,My new “dream job” is a nightmare,"A few weeks ago I was made an offer for a job I have literally been trying to get for 5 years (paralegal/legal assistant). I have wanted to be a paralegal since college but never got the opportunity due to inexperience. 

I was working a state gov job (DMV) and was randomly called by a law office job I had previously applied for/interviewed for months earlier. They had a new opening and were interested in a second interview. 

Anyways, I started this week and it has been a terrible mess that is giving me extreme anxiety. It’s beyond obvious that they weren’t prepared for me to start. They had nothing set up for me and I had to call IT myself to get into my accounts. The lady assigned to “train” me keeps disappearing and isn’t helpful. When she does show me stuff, it’s very quick and not explained in a clear way. I’ve just been sitting in my office not knowing what to do. The attorney who initially interviewed me didn’t even recognize me when I started and forgot that he interviewed me. All of the info he thinks he remembers about me has been wrong. I have no previous paralegal training so I don’t understand what is going on or what I’m doing. The attorney who hired me said she would train me from the ground up and help me get in the field yet I’ve barely seen her. They expect me to do projects soon but I have no clue what to do. 

Oh and to top it all off, I was told since I didn’t start on a Monday, they would have to take from my PTO to make up for the hours I didn’t work this week even though I wasn’t an employee on those dates????

I really do not know what to do. I have never wanted to quit a job after the first few days but this is already mentally killing me. I am so sad this is happening. All of the paralegals here haven’t been here any longer than a year so it sounds like high turnover is an issue.

1ff6c4o,My coworker gets half my commission and does nothing ,"I work in a sales job, so I make commission for the majority of my pay. The company allowed two sales reps in the same territory: me and Larry. That's very unusual, usually there is only one rep per territory, but Larry essentially threatened to leave the company unless they gave him my territory as well. He's able to work in all territories across the entire state, but I can only look in one territory in the state. In order to avoid conflict, the company has a system where for any deals in our territory, we split the commission. So if he gets a deal in our territory, we each get 50%. If I get a deal, we each get 50%. The idea was that we would cooperate to help each other in the territory and each bring deals. 

  
This system was set up 2.5 years ago. In that time, I've scored 3 big deals, and he's gotten zero in my territory, and zero in other territories. He's spent his entire time looking in other territories. He has one deal he's working on in another territory, so I guess that's at least something. But I only get a cut of his if he finds it in our shared territory. So I've done 100% of the work in our territory, but he and I are each making 50% of the commission. 

  
I talked to my boss about the situation and that it's not a fair system. But I'm getting pushback. They keep telling me how they can't lose me, how I've generated $50mil for the company, how important I am to the company, how I'm their star rep. But then when I address a blatantly unfair commission system, they say they can't do anything about it and ""but look at how much money you're already making, be grateful for that!"" 

  
I'm rocking the boat by pushing for this issue to be resolved. And I know that I have a lot of leverage because I do generate the most sales out of any sales rep at the company. But I feel stuck because 1) if I stay at the company, I'll personally make about $2.5mil over the next 3 years. But really, that should be closer to $5mil because it's split. 

I feel bad about rocking the boat. But I also can't even sleep at night knowing how much money I'm losing out on. The consolation prize is that they may give me commission on Larry's deals in other territories, but that may only be one, if he can actually get it done. 

  
What would y'all do in my situation? Continue to fight it and risk rocking the boat to hard? Let it go and just accept half the commission? Leave the company and leave the commission on the table?

1ff61od,Should I quit my job?,"Should I leave my job?

I just graduated college and got lucky and found a job pretty quickly after graduation. I’ve been at my current job for about three months and even moved two states away (mostly because i’ve always wanted to live there) but am finding out that this may not be a great place to work. I’ve accepted I’m new, and I’m going to make some mistakes. A few problems that I’ve noticed:

- They said I could work 40 hours a week, but kept pushing me to work evenings and weekends for the same pay. It’s salary, so I thought it was normal. After some time, I found that this was hurting my mental health, so I went back to keeping work between the hours i’m actually there. Again, they kept pushing, and my boss eventually gave me an ultimatum: work evenings and weekends, or go part time. I chose part time

- We managed to work out 25 hours a week so I could work on some freelance work. A week went by, and he told me to put in more hours. I’m doing 30 a week now, which isn’t all that much more, but it still bothers me.

- I will admit I made some mistakes. I always have claimed responsibility and made sure that I apologized and did better moving forward. When I make mistakes, instead of being spoken to privately, my boss and co workers will announce it in public Slack channels. It’s humiliating. I feel embarrassed and ashamed. I also remember one of the key takeaways from my management class: Praise in public, talk about areas of improvement in private. This has happened multiple times, whether it be in Slack channels, or in person with the small people we work with in person.

- My boss has also said I should keep my passion as a hobby as I am under qualified to keep it as a profession. This one really hit home. I cried for a while after he told me this. I have been told before to keep my dreams dreams because I won’t make it. I pushed through and worked hard and achieved those, so I eventually got over this, but it still bothers me.

Reading this back, I see how this looks pretty negative. The company is for a really good cause, but I just can’t stand the workplace and the environment. Please let me know if I am crazy or valid in thinking this. Also, let me know if I should quit. This is my first “real job” out of college, so I’m not sure if this is normal or not.",tony6203,3,1.0,14,1726156689,2024-09-12 15:58:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ff61od/should_i_quit_my_job/,9,2024
1ff5zvu,Help me think straight. 24 F from Nepal with little to no experience in the field looking forward to do masters in the US. What is the best thing to do atm? ,"
Hello, so I graduated in September of 2023. I have a 3 month experience of dotnet intern. I applied to study in the US after graduation and haven’t done any work since then. The reason I went straight to study masters is if I don’t do it and stay back in my home country (nepal), my parents will marry me to a guy, I want to be independent before I get married. 

I was rejected in my first interview attempt in the May. Since then I have been working as a freelancer in fiverr. No big projects tbh. Just subtitling and translating for videos. I have tried to secure a job in my country for past few years but am unable to do so. 

The uni I selected was not that great so I’m not really bummed about not getting the visa. But this time I have got into my dream school (northeastern, Boston uni). The tuition is too high (56k) and given the job market and frankly I don’t have much confidence in my skills as well, I’m not really sure if I should apply for second attempt. 

I gave a test today and couldn’t solve a single coding problem (I didn’t practice but yeah). I’m a good student. I was a topper my whole high school years. Got a 4.0 gpa in undergrad. I did all my assignments myself and have been praised by my teachers and colleagues as well. My boss at previous job even gave me a good offer to make me not quit. I gave up because I wanted to focus on my studies and the office was too far away from my house. 

I’m feeling so stuck in my life rn tbh. I know I have been running away from my problem. My parents are allowing me to go abroad because I have promised them I will study and come back and get married. I know if I stay back and do a job, they will ask me to get married. America is not only the option, I’m thinking of studying in Germany as well. But given the language problem and my skills not being extra ordinary I’m not sure if I will even earn back the money I’ll invest to study there.

Honestly, I’m even sure if I want to code. I like coding. I enjoy building things. I built a website for my dad’s company as well. It’s weird the passion seems to have gone. I’m thinking of starting my own business now as well. Sometimes I feel like I should learn from my father business and start my own small business. I want to pursue dance as well. Thinking of learning kathak in October. I’m not money minded. Little money will satisfy me too. I just want to something of my own. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated. I am 24 but I feel like a failure. I don’t want to marry rn. I know I won’t be able to pursue my masters abroad if I marry. I’m just so stuck rn. Please be as blunt as you can. I need some tough love rn.

1ff5f7e,Need some career advice. I'm a Computer science graduate currently working in cybersecurity at a Big 4,"I'm currently a cybersecurity consultant at a Big 4 in India with 2 years experience. The first project I was allocated to was a SailPoint Production support analyst role, which I worked for 9 months in. I didn't really like what I was doing even though. People around me keep telling its a good role. Then the project I'm currently on is a PAM grc role which I've just started and I don't feel good about it also. In my current company in pretty much stuck in the IAM domain and it's really difficult to change within the firm.

I'm currently in a rut and considering different options. Either to change companies for a better role within some other domain in cybersecurity. Something like DFIR, Penetration testing or some role in Data protection and privacy. If this is the path I'm to take I would need some advice on this. 

Another option would be to go back to software development. Since I'm a computer science graduate I already know the basics. Just need to revise DSA and system design and probably get a good SDE role. Which could be considered as a step back in my career but the pay raise is significant so it doesn't really matter in my head. 

Or should I stick with IAM. I know it's a good career path but I don't know how to progress and it since there are very few resources available online to study and improve my skills. 

What path do you suggest. I would personally prefer doing Software Development or changing domain in cybersecurity.

1ff4kov,Wondering how to break out of technician-level role into some higher-level engineering work,"Hi folks, looking for some, well, career advice.

I am an over-educated technician trying to figure out how to ""level up"". Currently I do repetitive hands-on manufacturing work for a startup - the company is small and there are no meaningful promotions. I'm trying to find a way to move companies that won't result in me landing an equally soul-crushing job.

I have a STEM PhD from an Ivy, just completed an MS in Engineering Management, and am working toward my MBA, all self-funded (except the PhD). I pursued the masters degrees because I found the material incredibly interesting, but now I am itching for some higher level work. 

In my own time, I've tried to implement the things I've learned. I've spent hundreds of hours on projects like implementing statistical process controls and quality systems into our manufacturing system, and presented my work to the company (no one came to the talks, except for one intern). I've advocated for myself in 1:1s and acted as ""project manager"" for projects where I was the only one working on them, even doing advanced budget/resource planning and retrospective analysis, including failure mode analysis.

I really want these kinds of things to be my job, and not a hobby. I'm tired of doing hands-on technician work all day. In my opinion, I've represented my advanced work on my resume very well, especially the implementation of SPC and quality systems, with numbers for yield increases and cost savings. I've been applying to these kinds of roles (manufacturing engineer, project engineer, etc.) for over a year now and have not gotten so much of an interview. I hate that my full-time job prevents me from taking, for instance, an internship to allow me to break into the operations management space. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering if anyone has been in this situation, and what they might recommend. Thanks!

During the job offer, I asked the HR if the 7-day Christmas office closure will be deducted from my 12-day Annual Leave (I also have 8-day sick leave in a year).

It's been 2 years since I joined the company and am stuck at my current role. Also, not a big fan of my current manager - I have wanted exposure / stretch projects to work with other teams (Product Management) but I often find my manager to block me in those situations. I prefer a manager who can mentor / coach me to advance my career. I have asked for promotion 3 times and asked for advice on how to improve myself. The answer that I often get is 'I am not sure if there's a headcount for it' / 'I need to ask'. During our 1x1, there was never anything related to career. I am the one who always intiatie the discussion which is quite frustrating. Howeer, deep down I know my manager value me which has led me to excellent rating during my annual performance review and got a great year end bonus.

I also want to become a Product Manager down the path, which is slightly overlapping with I do currently but with no hands on exposure.

In the meantime, I applied to a more senior role in my previous company and I asked for a 25% increase to my total package. I am in the midst of negotiating the offer but I think I am getting close to it. However, my previous company has was toxic but I can land a senior position (not product management), and more pay.

1ff38dj,Should I quit after 7/8 months at first job out of college?,"I currently work at a financial wealth management company and just got a job opportunity working for an airline which I am extremely interested in. There would be a pay cut but it’s 4 days on 3 days off (10 hr shifts) and I could bartend a day of the week if I really wanted to which would easily make up the cut. The HR told me I am their number one candidate and regardless I’m doing the interview for experience if I don’t end up taking the job. The company I work at now, it was a great introduction to the business realm which is what I majored in (administration and strategic management).
At this job I have to dress extremely nice, it’s an hour there and back due to traffic/construction, and the work is extremely stressful. When I signed up for this job, I didn’t realize I was going to be doing so much operational things as it’s an administrative role but I am in charge of making financial updates on statements, running portfolios, updating accounts, etc. The worst part of it all is that I hate working for rich people as it’s hard to have to suck up to them everyday. While some are really nice, about the same portion are very entitled and rude. For instance, I literally read off a script at work to confirm call for meetings and I got talked to because I didn’t say “May I speak to ______” and the client told them I was unprofessional. Or the other day I had a very nice outfit on with a blazer, white shirt, black pants and white socks and was told to wear black socks as it looks way better. I understand performance is critical in a work environment, but the pressure of being perfect has made me bring work home with me. However, I do get to WFH twice a week which is nice. Anyway, I am very excited about this new opportunity but obviously the pay cut sucks, but the HR told me after a year is complete, people move up relatively fast (especially if they have degrees) and I will automatically get a raise regardless if I want to become a lead, supervisor, manager, etc. I just need the base experience. During my interview I want reassurance that I can build myself up and eventually use my degree to do project management for the airline or something along those lines. Also, being young, flying for free is something that is important to me along with other benefits which I plan to discuss during my interview like PRO, HC, or 401 (K) information. I could go anywhere I wanted if the time is right and travel the world like I’ve always wanted to even if it’s for a weekend or whatever. I guess my question is, do you guys think I should go for it if I don’t necessarily like what I’m doing now, I can’t see myself staying on this career path anyway and although it might suck at first, I know what I need to do to adjust to the pay cut and I just mainly want to know that after a year, I can build myself up and use my degree eventually at this well known airline company.

1ff2sl6,How to Find Time to Interview,"Hey everyone, I have been struggling with a limiting belief for a while. I am wanting to find a better job. I have been with my current company for about 6.5 years. I am currently a branch manager for a rental car company. Currently, upper management reduced my team of 5 people to 2 people running a 100 car branch. It’s exhausting and I believe I have built a strong analytical, leadership, and management skillset. Plus I am now more result-oriented than I have ever been in my career (currently in the top 3 branch in Revenue in the entire state). 

This is my limiting belief: I don’t see how I have time to do interviews. I work 7 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday. My wife says “you just need to be open with your boss and tell him you are going to need more time out of the branch to find another job” but I don’t think that would end well… Most businesses and corporate office are closed out of this window I work. So I’m feeling stuck. I don’t have any space at my house to have a designated work at home space and can’t afford moving to a different state.

1ff2qus,Bad situation ,"I really need advice asap, I’ve just started at this job around a month ago and so many red flags have started to show up. I’ve gotten paid my 7500 sign on bonus which If I quit I have to pay back (I had to pay bills and don’t have it anymore), if I quit within 12 months I have to pay everything back. The whole red flags are micromanaging coworkers, coworkers that can’t handle my disability (Tourette’s), work place that is unsafe (working as a surveyor for surface and underground mine). They’re making me do shit that is heavily illegal and can cause issues with the company’s stock price (basically making me do survey volumes of stockpiles on really bad equipment and bad accuracy control points causing massive discrepancies; this could cause me to end my career quickly and in legal trouble). Now I’m sitting at my desk and about to cry because my coworker has reported me for harassment because of my Tourette’s. I’m not sure what to do.

Previous post details: 

Massive Red Flags after 2 weeks 

Accepted this job which did sound too good to be true, they promised me training and development, good gear to work with and newest technology. After 2 weeks, I came to space and no one is there to train me and I’m on my own in a dangerous work environment. I’m a Mine Technician in mining, so I perform underground work on a daily basis. This company gave me 105k and 15k signing bonus (catch is if I leave I have to pay back the 15k, luckily I did not use it). The environment is not safe, im the only one working in the department and they have high expectations of me while they lied to me during the interview. Not sure what to do, the stuff they gave me to do my job is inadequate and old from the 1990s, while I was exposed to newer technology’s. what do I do?

Now I have an upcoming offer which is 25k less but fully paid health benefits and good pension. This place did not lie to me but I’m scared of quitting my current job. 

Ps. company is now gaslighting me saying if I can’t do my job without training I’ll get fired right away.

1ff2hf8,Pursuing a new opportunity with a baby on the way?,"Hi there... ah the age-old question! Should I stay or should I go?

I have been with my current employer for almost 7 years. Recently I had a new opportunity present itself, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying. I am looking for opinions and would appreciate any unbiased advice!

I haven't received an offer yet, but am well-qualified, a strong candidate, and think I stand a solid chance of being selected.

Important factors I am weighing:

* My wife has a steady job, but I am the breadwinner in my family. My industry can be somewhat volatile and highly subject to interest rates and changing regulations. We could likely live off her income for 3-4 months if needed in the event of a job loss.
* My commute is currently 2-3 hours per day, 3x a week.
* My wife is pregnant with our first child and our little one is due in March.
* My wife and I are generally risk-averse people. She has been with her employer for a long while and I don't personally see myself as someone who would be comfortable job-hopping every few years.
* I have been with my company for almost 7 years, and with that feel a certain level of loyalty to my employer and my team. That said, a lot of the people who made me love where I work have since left or retired. It is definitely not the same ""feel"" as it was even 2-3 years ago.
* I have experienced a ""career limiting event"" (medical) but also do not necessarily need/want a promotion over the next few years as we focus on our family.
* Leaving my current company would fully burn a bridge and blackball me from ever joining the company again in the future (based on multiple previous colleagues' experience). Additionally, my current company is fairly influential politically and in the industry so I fear it may limit my opportunities at other companies.

|Factors|Current Position|New Opportunity|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Schedule/Remote|Hybrid - 2 days at home, 3 days in office. Will likely never be approved to be fully remote based on multiple prior colleagues' history - even with another offer for a remote position|Fully remote (which would be so lovely for my young family - we would still have childcare but I would love to be able to be home earlier in the day)|
|Commute|2.5 - 3 hours per day (\~1 hour in the morning, \~1.5-2 hours in the evening)|None|
|Compensation|Similar|Similar, could be a paycut depending on negotiations (\~$8K)|
|Bonus|Typically 15-17% of salary|Typically 15% of salary, but last year was significantly higher|
|Benefits|Standard + fertility coverage|Standard, would lose fertility coverage|
|Parental Leave|4 weeks paid|8 weeks paid|
|PTO|3 weeks + I have the option to ""buy"" additional vacation through a vacation buy program|Unlimited PTO, no set minimum. I have heard anecdotally that unlimited PTO can be a bit of a trap.|
|Work Travel|I can go for several months without travel but then will have multiple travel weeks back-to-back depending on project needs|\~One week every 3 months|
|Workload|Can be hefty, but my supervisor is attentive and conciously manages our workloads|Overall the volume of projects at this company would be less and therefore I'd have less projects; however, I think I would have more hats to wear|
|Stability|Extremely stable, Fortune 200 company. HQ'd in my home country|Very small company compared to my current company, HQ'd internationally which I fear could add some volatility. The unit I'd be reporting to is financially sound but it does sound like there are some financial missteps within the larger company.|
|Supervisor/Team|I've had some hiccups with my current supervisor, but we are in a good place. My supervisor has high expectations but is generally a fair leader. I really enjoy my peers on my direct team; the project team I work with is a little more touch-and-go. I do have a wide variety of SMEs available to me for technical assistance.|I have previously worked with my would-be supervisor for a few years and think we would work together well.

1ff2h2z,I think my company did me a dirty,"My company did me a dirty, 

I had left a good stable job, that was paying me close to $40 an hour, benefits, WFH 3 days a week, 3 weeks of holidays a year, etc, to work as a Territory Sales manager, at my old company. Before when I was working at this company, I was earning over a $100k a year, and had lots of freedom, lots of fun and got to travel often. 

But the new job after 4 months, decided to wind down the program, as the client wasn’t being cooperative, as to how we can sell for them. Now to keep my job, I had to take a demotion, and with the demotion, the VP promised me that I would be making the exact same pay, but now it would hourly, as my base salary was a manager. 

I signed the contract, which labeled me as a team lead, and I would be paid $24 an hour, in the capacity of a team lead. 

After a couple of weeks, I noticed that my pay had a discrepancy. They were only paying me $16 an hour, and when I emailed payroll about the discrepancy, they said that “you are going to be paid $24 an hour in the capacity of a team lead”

I messaged, emailed and called the VP, who finally after three days, called me yesterday, and said “Oh I thought you would be ok with $22 an hour” He then said he would correct my pay discrepancy and get back to me today. Surprise he didn’t. 

So question, is this similar to constructive dismissal? Because I feel the VP wasn’t being very forthright with me, and when we had our call, he rushed me through it, saying he had to catch a flight. The call lasted only a minute, even though it was a scheduled call. 

I feel so played right now. I am trying to get my old job back, but so far no luck. 
The contract says they will pay me $24 an hour as a team lead, but what is so  convenient is that I will only work 8 hours as a week as a TL. The rest of the time they expect me to work as a rep for $16 an hour. 

The VP promised to follow up with me about my pay, by yesterday. But hasn’t. 

He even rushed through the call, even though it was a scheduled call and he told me to call him then. After a minute, he’s like “oh I have to go now and catch a flight” like who the f@ck does that? It was a scheduled call, like give me at least 5 minutes. 

I also called in sick every day this week. Let them fire me so I can at least get unemployment. 

TLDR: promised $24 an hour but now only paying me $16 an hour and won’t respond to me. Called in sick in response. ",Great-Ad3774,56,0.9200000166893005,73,1726147401,2024-09-12 13:23:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ff2h2z/i_think_my_company_did_me_a_dirty/,9,2024

1ff0xa8,Should I drop out? ,"I study architectural engineering. It's literally only two weeks in my first year and I'm already suffering. 
I have 9 courses, 13 lessons in total/week, which means I either start really early (8 am) or finish really late (6-7 pm). Thus I have basically no free time, no chance for a free day, and I'm tired most of the time. I can't meet my friends after school because I'm just so exhausted mentally and physically that I go straight home and crash in bed. Out of the 9 courses I have to take I only like two, mathematics and history of architecture, all the others I either hate, don't like, or bores me.  Although the professors are really good, I just can't enjoy the lessons. Not to talk about the huge amount of homeworks and drawings we have to do. 
I applied for this major because it required creativity, but only after one week of constant drawing I feel like I'm losing passion for it. Most of the time I'm so anxious because of all the school work that I can eat half of what I used to, and completely forget to drink anything, going to school nauseous, lethargic and with a knot in my stomach. I go to uni feeling miserable and come home wanting to cry my hearth out. 

I've been considering dropping out, but I'm afraid because of three reasons:
1) what if I regret it. I've only spent 2 weeks here, so maybe it will become better. But at the same time I'm afraid that if this continues it's gonna cost my mental health. It's already much worse that it used to be, considering the fact that until this point in my life days I've felt sad or anxious were very few. 
2) I don't know what other major I'd do. I chose this because at the time it seemed like an interesting thing to study. I thought that it would make a nice career and I could imagine myself doing it after I tried, but I was not completely sure. Although I researched before applying, it looks like I didn't do a good enough job. But if not this what else? I have no idea. And it truly terrifies me. I'm already 20, 21 by the time I could apply to another uni or major again, and I can't be sure I'd get into the new uni or major I choose, meaning I'd waste another year. 
3) what my parents would say. I'm the first child in the family in 3 generations to go to uni, and not only that but one of the most prestigious ones in my country. They've done so much for me and supported me with everything, buying me all the supplies I need and renting me a flat near the uni. How would they react if I said I hate the very thing I chose before the first month? I don't want to disappoint them. 

I just feel so lost, I really don't know what to do. Any ideas or suggestions? I'm pretty much open to anything at this point.

1ff0rna,Should I Take This New Job Offer?,"Hey fellow redditors, I’m at a crossroads in my career and could really use some advice.

I’m currently working in a secure job at a mid-sized company. I’ve been here for about 2.5 years, and while the job is stable, I’m not learning anything new or gaining the growth experience I had hoped for. On top of that, the commute is brutal—I’m spending hours every day on the road, which is taking a toll on me both mentally and physically.

Recently, I received an offer from a multinational company (let’s call them Company X) for a Business Manager role, which sounds like an amazing opportunity. Here’s the catch: I wouldn’t be directly employed by Company X. Instead, I would be on the payroll of a third-party Indian company (Company Y) that is handling the role.

The job offers work from home, which is definitely appealing, especially since it would mean no more long commutes. Plus, it’s a step up in terms of responsibility, exposure, and working for a big-name company, which could be great for my resume and career development. However, the third-party arrangement makes me a bit uneasy. I’m worried about the long-term prospects of being on a third-party payroll, especially when it comes to job security, benefits, and future growth.

Here’s my dilemma:

	•	I’ve got 2.5 years of total work experience.
	•	The new job at Company X offers work from home, better responsibilities, and a chance to work with a multinational company.
	•	However, I’ll technically be employed by Company Y, the third-party company, which leaves me uncertain about stability and how it might look on my resume.
	•	My current job is secure but offers no real growth, and the long commute is becoming unbearable.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What would you do—stay in the secure but stagnant job, or take the new role with the third-party payroll and the benefits of working from home?

I would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and advice. Thanks in advance!

1ff0g1j,"2 versus 1 week notice: written, in person or both?","For context: I've been at this job for a little over a month and felt pressured to take it after the former company let us know they'd be cutting all mental health therapist salaries by 20,000 by x date. I was left scrambling being a homeowner and there not being another person to split bills with. I started applying to jobs like crazy. 

This current job at the time seemed ideal. I had 4 interviews. It was nearly a 2 month hiring process. I'm still at the job I mentioned above, on a part-time basis, as I phase out my above clients. I've already given notice there & we left things on very good terms with the door open. 

This current job is no longer ideal, and just over 1 month in and I'm already completely aggravated and less than enthused to be here because of what has happened. At each interview, I gave them my 3 non-negotiables. Each person assured me I'd be able to receive these things here. since then I've realized this is not at all true, and has just been a bait & switch the whole time. I'm a social worker by trade and this is already a very undervalued field. I'm frustrated because, had everyone just been transparent from the start, i would have never signed any offer letters nor wasted anybody else's valuable time further, similarly as I did (respectfully) in other interview processes. All of this, coupled with the incredibly high insurance premium and the fact that mental health therapy is NOT covered under the new policy (something else I also asked about & was told it was, now I'll be paying $92 out of pocket per session), leaves me with significantly less in takehome pay and still not enough to cover bills and after doing all the budgeting and even taking everything out of my budget possible, or making changes where I can, I still need a second job because they lied. The things I asked for in my interview are things that are required in my field for licensure renewal and career growth. I see every other discipline here getting them and it hurts. 

I received an offer I've been waiting on and had 2 options for start dates. I applied to this job the same time I did the one I've already started working at. It was just a slower hiring process. I would've taken this job 1000x over had i heard sooner. Seems like a better option overall. So now my question is - 

do I give written or verbal notice at this current job, or both? Do I give 2 weeks, or 1 week? Or do I just send an email tonight and not show back up tomorrow because I'm so furious and have multiple legs to stand on. I know this will burn a bridge either way, and I'll be listed on the company's ""do not rehire"" list. I also have intrusive thoughts that this current company will try and blackmail me and somehow find out information about the next company and try to get me fired there. Or that something will go entirely wrong with the new job, and they'll fire me for whatever reason. Or maybe this is just my workplace trauma talking. 

TLDR; I'm in a pickle career wise and not sure what is appropriate here, I've been in a lot of traumatic workplace situations.

1ff00ok,Will I get flagged on a background check?,"I got the job offer (yay!) but have a question about the background check.

During the interview process, which lasted about a month (starting in early August), I was laid off on 9/4. My final interview was on 9/6, and I didn’t mention the layoff because I wasn’t asked about my current employment status.

Here’s where it gets tricky: My official job title was ""Product Specialist,"" but I had the responsibilities of a Product Manager. I even provided a letter of recommendation from my supervisor that referred to me as a Product Manager (every interviewer saw my recommendation). Additionally on my resume, I listed my title as ""Product Manager (Product Specialist)"" to reflect my responsibilities better.

Now, I have two questions:

1. On the Employment Verification form, I indicated that I was employed until September 2024 (I’m no longer employed). Do you think they’ll have an issue with this since they assumed I was still employed during the interview process?

2. My HR department said my official title is ""Product Specialist."" However, my direct supervisor advised me to list ""Product Manager/Specialist"" on the form and provided his contact info for verification. Is there any chance this could cause problems in the background check? I’m assuming they’ll only contact my supervisor and not HR directly since I only provided my supervisor's phone number.

Reaching out to you all to discuss about a job opportunity that I have received. The HR round is due, but post receiving more clarity on the exact role by the other HR, I am a bit sceptical about proceeding ahead with it given since it doesn’t align exactly with my career goal. I wanted to get your opinion here,

Brief of role: 
It’s a project manager cum assistant role. As per my conversation with the HR bifurcation is like will be 60-40, i.e. 60 for project management role and 40 for administrative role. He mentioned that I will be managing the projects of the person that I will be reporting to who is a senior vice president and I will be doing the administrative work for him. I will be handling his meeting schedule, travelling plan, and that stuff so I’m not very sure about the administrative stuff. It’s not a core project management role, so should I proceed ahead with it or not? How hectic will this be? I asked him that how hectic could be, but he didn’t give me a clear reply on that given the project management is also a very hectic profile in itself, so sceptical if this could be balanced out. 

Anyone who can throw more light on this role, is it worth taking shot or a pass?

- I live in Europe so no school debt 
- I am already 25yo
- I have a bachelor degree (online) in tourism and hospitality which has been useless
- jobs are hard to find in my country

I am considering completely changing field. I am doing a baking course (basic and advanced) so i can learn some useful skills but i also want to go back to university and have a real experience.

I have always been passionate about helping animals, i have good problem solving skills etc and i found out there is a vet tech degree in my country (3 years).

I feel like now i have no real skills and i want to get my shit together. I make money online and i am making jewelry to sell but it is a long process. Meanwhile i want to grow some skills.

A lot of vet tech say it is not worth it because of pay, stress, burn out and i see a lot of negativity but this type of degree have a lot of transferable skills.

Initially i used my bachelor (which i took when i was having personal issues and i could not do a real university in person) to go to teach english abroad for a few years (Tefl). I did a celta and thought teaching could be a solution but i had a bad experience, i found teaching to be stressful and exhausting. I looked for jobs here in Italy and i was not taken seriously at all. Everyone wants english speakers, people with better, more related degrees or experience etc

I kinda lost my motivation so i had to idea to explore the vet field but the negativity is a lot. I realized there is no way i could handle 5 years of vet school because of my mental health issues, the workload of things to study etc plus i have always struggled in some subjects like math and chemistry. Vet tech seems more doable and i like it better.

I found a way to do some exams early next year and then if i pass a test enroll next year (for the first year), but i don’t want to throw myself into something so new randomly.

1feygj9,What do I study and where do I go to study( crisis) (uk help please)?,"19m, I have just taken a gap year to sort my life, travel and pick up Hobbies, I am set to study computer science at the university of reading, I have always been into computers and curios about that sort of thing, however I have been told and have researched a bit and it looks like there won’t be many jobs as the market is oversaturated and there is lots of competition.

So really I have 2 options
- go to reading and potentially waste 3 years be in lots of debt and not be able to get a job 
- go to my local university( university do Hertfordshire ) and study engineering, however I am worried that because this university isn’t great and not ranked high, I worry I then won’t be employable, I would also like to know if I got my bachelors here, would you be able to do a masters at a good university

I first took pre-science and I got computer science but I didn't start the cs major at all, then I decided I should switch to pre-medical and I am now majoring in medical ( doctor ), I am confused on what I should major on, I tried everything from talking to a career counselor, professor, taking career test and lastly asking students.

I sent resignation effective right away and the Owner of the company talked to me and said that he will talk to the manager to get this resolved.  As a result the manager set up a meeting to make everything straighten out he also promised to change his toxic leadership style. Now the problem is, I feel so exhausted with the job, to the point that I no longer want it. I understand that the manager sincerely apologize but the job is already toxic and pressure is too high, btw I worked in sales, So everything is about the numbers. I only realized i no longer want the job the moment i sent the resignation letter and felt so much relieved. I realized I can leave the job. I can be free from that workplace and there are lots of opportunity outside. The problem is, the owner is so kind and generous. I dont want to hurt his feelings.

1fewuyr,I’ve never had a coworker that’s made me want to quit so bad. ,"To get started, I think I’m being harassed by my coworker about something I didn’t do. 
My (21F) coworker (25F), let’s call her Amelia, is claiming I stole something from her 6 MONTHS AGO! And it comes all of a sudden ever since I became lead and called her out for not working while on the clock. 
Back story: Around 6 months ago I’d say, Amelia gave me a ride home. It was a kind gesture, I usually take the bus. Nothing else to it. I thanked her, offered her gas money, she didn’t take it. End of story. 

Few months later the dynamic of our team is shifting. I notice that Amelia is not helping out the team. She just lets others carry the load including myself. I let her know that I feel this way subtly by trying to delegate her to do certain tasks. I let my boss know that her work performance is messing with the team’s productivity. I notice she has minor conflicts with many people. She has a way of later spinning the story to make them the victim. She’s unable to take constructive criticism from anyone and claims either someone’s on drugs or that they’re a psychopath. One time she was telling me about how someone gave her a ibprofin, and she was convinced that they gave her fentanyl. Anyways off topic…

Later on, one day I’m in my bosses office and Amelia comes in aggressively asking for my address. I asked her why? She said she’s conducting a timeline because a pair of sunglasses has gone missing from her car. I asked her why I was apart of this; she said because one time she gave me a ride home and now her sunglasses are missing. Mind you, that ride was 4 MONTHS ago at this point. I reassured her that I did not take the sunglasses and that I’m not a thief. I gave her my address so she can make the police report. Big mistake. I feel stupid for doing that but i genuinely just wanted to help. 

I ask my other coworkers about this anyways because it was weird. They said she was asking multiple people the same questions. 2 months after this situation and I’m still having problems with her. She ignores me when I need to communicate something to her about work. She sits around and doesn’t help. Im sick of it. It’s starting to feel personal as she will only act this way towards me or when im there. One day I confronted her about it alone.  I let her know that I don’t feel comfortable having conflict with someone and that although we don’t need to speak about personal stuff, I need to be able to talk to her about work. I apologized if I’d offended her ever in the past and she could let me know if she feels we have a problem. I said all this and in response she said, “we don’t have a problem, I don’t know what you’re talking about. You seem to have the problem. I act this way towards everybody and I’m not gonna change.” Not the response I was looking for but if she feels like we don’t have a problem I’m going to let it go then. 

A few weeks after this confrontation I think we’re doing better. Until a few days ago, another coworker approaches me and says that Amelia is telling people I did in fact steal the sunglasses, and that I steal stuff from people so watch out. I’m very nervous at this point. I do not steal things and especially now that I’m a lead I really can’t have someone walking around spreading false information on my name. That’s a very serious allegation. I go directly to my boss about this issue. My boss says she will talk to her but also tells something weird Ameli told her. She said the other day Amelia asked her, “what do you call a person who steals a lot?” My boss said “a cliptomaniac?” Amelia goes, “(my name) is a cliptomaniac” My boss decided to tell me this because she now feels I might be getting harassed at this point. I don’t understand. Why is Amelia so hung up on building a narrative about me that’s not true? What proof does she possibly have that’s making her believe I would do something like this? 

Bear with me here. I go to HR finally right after my boss tells me this. HR tells me that I shouldn’t care what people think of me and that I’m doing a great job. If Amelia wants to create a police report she can. I leave feeling reassured that the situation might be as ridiculous as it sounds. My boss reassures me that she will still talk to Amelia about this as it’s creating an uncomfortable work environment for me and if she truly believes I did this to her we can deal with it personally. 

Fast forward to today. The day the conversation was supposed to take place with Amelia and my boss. It took an unexpected turn. Amelia doesn’t know this conversation is going to take place. Hours before the meeting was supposed to start, Amelia goes to my bosses office. Along with her is head of security and maintenance. 
Amelia is requesting an investigation and look at the cameras because she is completely convinced that I was the one who stole HER BAG! Thats right, now it’s no longer just a pair of sunglasses. It’s a bag that has the sunglasses in it! In fact, she claims she saw me with it at work just the other day. Like what?? How does that make sense. What criminal in their right mind would take the item they stole back to the place of work?? My bigger question is what evidence could she possibly have that has her fully convinced I would do something like this? I don’t steal things. In fact I hope they look at the security cameras because I’m sick of this. I’ve been going through this harassment for months now. I work very hard at my job every day. Im trying to go to college. I don’t like to be stressed out about a crazy lady who thinks I’ve stolen something and has my address. (Which is still my fault on the address part). Should I be nervous? 

The more she drags this on the more mentally unstable I’m seeing she is. I’ve never been in this sort of situation before. What do I do?

1few8hs,Am I just a glorified secretary?,"One of my colleagues told me recently that she thinks of me (26F) as a secretary, and I was quite offended by this. However, I started to think about my work tasks and started to worry that maybe she’s right. I work in academia and am the only administrative employee in our research group. Here is a description of my position:

Title: Research Coordinator 

Main responsibilities/tasks
- Coordinating and negotiating contracts and agreements for new research projects that come in from either regulatory bodies or private companies funding the research
- Negotiation and set up of budgets for research projects as well as financial follow up and reporting
- Keeping track of data deliveries and assisting with data applications
- Ethical and data processing approvals such as writing Data processing impact assessments, etc.
- We have guest researchers who come and visit our group and I typically receive them and welcome them to our group, ensure they have the necessary access and practical things are set up
- writing and coordination of various reports for the research group

Other things I also do:
- planning seminars, workshops, etc.
- I order coffee for the office
- I make the schedule for our weekly meetings
- kind of a main contact point for random administration things

So my question is, am I just a glorified secretary? My worry is that many of my colleagues are academics, and since I mainly only work with the PIs for the projects, they only come into contact with my for small administrative things and know that I order coffee. How do I get them to respect me? Should I move on to something else considering I have a masters degree?",ShoeMaleficent5585,2,1.0,7,1726123618,2024-09-12 06:46:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1few8hs/am_i_just_a_glorified_secretary/,9,2024

1fethrs,Where Next? ,"I have always split my energies- my artistic passion (which I went to school for and I continue to do high profile projects as a freelancer, but no one can make a full time living in the field) and my “work life” (arts administration, museums, project management). I actually really appreciate and take pride in the more professional aspect of my career. I need some sort of stability in my work environment and get to work on cool projects for cool places, but I also can’t imagine giving up my artistic passion completely. 

I also like combining these- I’ve started a community resource group in my field that’s gotten a great reception. I plan on working to monetize this soon, but it also wouldn’t be enough to live on.

1fesbdx,Manager Wants to Trade Me to Another team,"Throw away since I know at least one of my coworkers is on Reddit.

I was informed today, casually, on a team call, that my manager has been in discussions with another team manager about swapping me for one of theirs. This revelation, which was brought up for the first time in front of other teammates, caught me off guard. 

Some background. My manager and I have had our differences, I won’t get into them, but it’s enough to say that there is sometimes some tension. There is a hiring freeze for the whole company in the US, and teams are only allowed to hire in low cost countries. 

To me, this news felt like an end-run around the hiring freeze. They can’t fire me, because backfilling my position would create an imbalance in regional coverage. The “trade,” in her words, would be off the books - HR would not be involved, pay would not change, and for 6 months I would be shipped off to the other team. She tried to frame it as an “internship” (which is so condescending since I am in a “senior” position with a family and a house to care for), and growth opportunity, but idk, something seems fishy. By trading me for another US teammate, she gets around the hiring freeze, and gets rid of me without firing me. None of this has been run up the flagpole to our director or their superior, but has been discussed in some detail behind my back with the other manager. 

IF she’s being sincere (I have no idea if she is), I don’t hate the idea, and it could be great. BUT, if she’s not sincere and this whole thing is just a rouse to get around the hiring freeze, then I should probably be concerned about my job, no? If this insane plan doesn’t get approved, is my job on the chopping block? I’ve brought this all up with my manager after the team call - my uneasiness and the optics around the hiring freeze, but she reassured me that it’s just a growth opportunity. 

Some additional context, we’ve been going through layoffs pretty consistently for the past year, so I’ve been keeping my resume updated. I haven’t had any negative performance reviews. 

We are all remote if that makes a difference.

1feqs3u,Confused College Girl- looking at careers in entertainment :),"This is my first time posting on Reddit lol. I hope people respond!

I desperately need advice on my future career/education! Thinking about it is stressing me tf out. I am a Senior in college majoring in Dance (please don’t judge lol). Initially, I had my heart set on pursuing arts management post-grad and working at a dance company. Well… I don’t want to do that anymore.

Now, I have my heart set on working in the entertainment industry. I am interested in casting, talent representation, a lawyer working in entertainment, and a concert organizer. If you can’t tell- I am all over the place. I have a lot of different interests. I also LOVE event planning and writing; though everyone I have spoken to has told me that these are side hustles.

I am taking a light credit load this semester and considering getting a certificate through UMiami Online. I have read on other Reddit forums that people think getting a certificate is worthless and a waste of time. I’ve also read that attending any university online isn’t worth as much as attending a brick-and-mortar school. 

Does anyone have any career advice about any of these professions? Should I try to get a certificate? Pursue law school, maybe? Master’s programs? 

 Or… do I sound delusional? Should I just go back to my original plan of working at a dance company? Any help/suggestions are welcome! I am super open-minded and also want honesty. Thanks in advance! :)

1feqm5k,From Rising Star to Nightmare to PiP in 3 months...,"So about 4 months ago, my boss quit with little notice.  Prior to his departure we had talks that I was perfectly ready to be promoted in October based on my performance.  When he quit, I was auto placed under a new supervisor who essentially washed his hands of the situation and said to just wait for them to hire someone.

Without a boss, I started to positively turn some negative dynamics with our client that had existed on my team prior to me rolling on.  I even won an award for my work.  I sought out a leader a few rungs above me for help.  Understanding my concern of being looked over for a promotion with someone new, she reached out to people on my behalf and I received absolutely glowing reviews!

When my new boss joined, there were some immediate red flags for me.  I was really trying to help her understand the dynamics of what was going on, but she instantly turned biting of any ""issue"" and demanded to know who was to blame.  When I explained the communication structure I had spent the month working to change, she immediately criticized my proposed structure and said that I was missing who was to blame.  She became extremely angry that I asked the client if we could push back a deadline for an employee who had to drop everything and drive several states away because his dad had a stroke (the client was fine with it and I even offered to do it myself if truly necessary, but since the employee had more knowledge and was nearly done, it was better to just wait and extra day).

I informed the upper leader of the red flags I was seeing and was advised to manage up.  Then she presented the new boss with her findings and told her to set a plan for my promotion.

The lead of the account pushed for my new structure despited my supervisor pushing against it.  As soon as we finished presenting to the client, my supervisor immediately pulled my entire team into a meeting and told us ""the client hates you and doesn't trust you.  So I need you to go through your work for this year and send me every mistake you made"" then made us each go around the room and give our thoughts on this ""feedback"".  I'm not gonna lie, I was absolutely horrified.  This goes completely against our ""culture"" and every leadership training we have.

So in our 1:1, I pulled her aside and was like ""hey every one of the people in that room was labeled a high flight risk when I joined, since that time we lost your roll so the risk is even higher.  This account has had some real struggles and the group you just yelled at has been the one to face those struggles head on and has been the ones fixing the problems you just accused them of."" Her response was an instant rage of screaming ""they don't like you either."" ""Who said this?"" ""This is my style and they have to get used to it.""  I stayed calm and told her the way she was approaching even this conversation is divisive.  The reason I was ""hated too"" was because one time the client asked for a ""quick data pull"" and I sent it to him in an excel as he typically requested and not a power point slide as he would have found more useful. 

Obviously, I went straight back to the upper leader and said ""well that didn't work"" and told her what happened.  Her advice, keep my head down.  I went to HR and the upper leader had already sent my boss to HR who felt it was all resolved and my boss was willing to make a change after hearing what she had done wrong.  I requested to move teams, but HR said there wasn't room for me to move unless I go out and win us more business to create a spot.  Lucky for me, I love winning new business and I had just won a new account... except they decided the account would be based out of another city's office sooooooo I can't be on it... ok onto the next one... and I did.  Mentally, I wanted to give my boss a chance to change (mistake) and set a mental date for when I would let HR know if the coaching worked.

My boss has become increasingly more hostile to my team.  She accepted my POV less than before, better to not say anything, but then again it was daily Russian rulet of who would get in trouble for not responding to her demands fast enough... god forbid you ask for the context of what she wanted when she said things so vague as ""I need data now"".  The moral of my team was going off a cliff.  I knew I was her scapegoat, but I'm also in a position where I don't need to work, I just like my job (normally) and I love the company. So when I saw a ""bomb"" unassigned in the wild, I would pick it up and respond to it.  She would scream at me, but wouldn't attack my employees or colleagues (win). 

Well, one of my colleagues employees decided she would say something about how we weren't getting the info needed to do our job.  The rest of the team joined in... my boss said she would look into it, but during our 1:1 she screamed at me that I was to blame for the problems (not my per view) and there were issues that I was answering questions without the right context... to which I responded ""well to be honest, the team approached you today about how they aren't getting the context they need and you have been very upset when no one responds and hostile when asked for context."" After my half hour of being yelled at, time was up and I emailed HR who was conveniently on vacation...

My supervisor sent me an email saying I needed to stop participating in winning new business.  I dodged by thanking her advice, but would continue managing my time as needed to complete all tasks I needed to in order to move my career forward.  She emailed it was not advice but a directive and was part of her ""career plan"" for me to ""make better decisions"", to which I responded that we needed to loop because this was not part of the career plan she had missed the deadline to write 2x's already and seemed to have a lot more to do with my feedback for her.

So HR and a leader above the upper leader who helped me previously (real top of the food chain) informed me today that I'm being placed on a PiP for ""insubordination"" and ""performance issues"" (first I'm hearing of a performance issue) in a week.  My boss is going to be the ""steward"" of the PiP, but HR and the upper leader are going to be heavily involved to ""ensure fair judgement"".  They didn't know what the PiP will look like beyond ""measurable improvements in attitude and performance"" and ""lots of documentation""...

I just feel so angry and defeated... part of me knows I chose this by my response to get HR involved to her directive.  Without it, even if I could get off her team, she still would be destroying my team and the relationship with the client (it is now in the worst place it has ever been)... but I'm also so depressed this is where the corporate world is... Someone loved by their client, coworkers, employees, and former bosses can have their career ripped apart by an absolute asshole without a clue of what they are doing in 3 months...",Littlewasteoftime,131,0.8899999856948853,112,1726103899,2024-09-12 01:18:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1feqm5k/from_rising_star_to_nightmare_to_pip_in_3_months/,9,2024

1feq6eu,"At 19, I just started college and am totally lost on what to do career wise.","I'm sure something like this gets posted frequently, and I have sought help from my university but it seems like I need more broad advice or maybe hearing about someone in a similar scenario.

For context: I won't lie, the thought of having to pick a field or subject and have a career doing that for many years of my life constantly just to live sounds so awful. I am anti-work, wishing I didn't have to live that way. Call me lazy, whatever, I wish I could explore the wilderness, listen to music, read books, and exist without the stresses of money and a career that takes up pretty much the significant chunk of my life (lol, don't we all?) But I know I have to, it's just a way of life as a human. I guess at this point now I just would rather find something I can tolerate or even like, but I am so so insanely lost.

I am introverted, very short for a guy (5'5""), I like nature, I'm a bit shy and not confident (so not good with sales or leadership), creative, enjoy writing but really just as a hobby, direct, and excel with writing and understanding more so ""english"" or literacy skills way over math or the logical problem solving skills.

I've gone from wanting to pursue ornithology, to computer science, to game dev, to now kinda leaning on wildlife biology, but I genuinely am lost, and looking for more perspectives.

My dream is to move to Oregon (I'm currently all the way on the east coast), live in a small apartment or something like that, have a dog or cat, and have enough free time to be able to socialize, pursue outdoor activities like hiking, biking, etc., have down time to occasionally travel by car to places, and just exist.

What career paths can I take that might work well with how I am PERSONALLY with the way my brains works, maybe my interests, and my goals?

Maybe this is way too broad, and I'll just end up deleting the post, but I'm hoping that if anyone has ever been in a similar place in life and found some answers, to please let me know. My parents hold high expectations of me. I am so lost, and feeling very hopeless as of current, and could use any sort of advice.

1feq444,Asking for a friend ,"Here is the situation. For nearly 20 years, a Latino man has worked for the same company raising up from a trade into supply chain management. His boss who had been there for 40 years was fired and he took on the role for the last 5 months (he has been groomed to take over for the last 6 years). All the while, the director has been praising how he has turned the dept around and telling him he is exceeding expectations and on track to get a 5/5 on his PA. The job was finally posted. He interviewed well. All the month long hiring process he was led to believe he’d get the job. He didn’t get the job and the whole dept is shocked and confused. They gave it to a woman who has been with the company for almost five years. Now of course he’s going to be expected to share his knowledge and train her in stuff she knows nothing about (I was her peer at one point; I know how little capability she has; total personality hire). What should he do?

Important factors: his expertise is manufacturing and supply chain management. He just bought a house a month ago and is not interested in relocating. He also has a pension, so he doesn’t want to leave the company. There is no chance he will be able to move up now in his current department/division because the vacant leadership roles have been filled by young people and this is a place people stay their entire careers. Should he work for this severely underqualified person who has no experience in this part of the business or leadership in general or jump ship for another department? Should he just give up entirely and ride out his career with no more ambition? Should he try to make her life a living hell and embarrass her any chance he gets so she’ll have a mental breakdown (she’s diagnosed bipolar and does not at all handle stress or confrontation well) and leave? Petty, I know, but I’m so angry for him. Does he do the bare minimum and hope she fails without his support, risking his own reputation?

I’m so devastated for him and I want to help him but I don’t know how. He deserved that job. He earned it. He proved his worth over and over and they slapped him in the face with disrespect. It sickens me. There is speculation about racism which is why I included that info.

1fepvxh,Frustration,"Feeling frustrated 

Frustrated Analyst

I’ve been working in FP&A for 4 years as an analyst at a larger but not giant company (fairly close to F500). 

1 year of experience doing corporate expense and 3 years of CapEx. 

I’ve absorbed about as much responsibility as I can within the role but it does not seem to be enough for a promotion. I am essentially completely independent. 

For example: I arrange all meetings with business partners for our planning and forecasting. I run these meetings with my manager not present more often than not. Many of my ad hoc requests from our business partners come straight to me. My manager checks off my work but generally that is about it. Almost all communications with business partners with titles director and lower come straight through me. 

I have extensive experience with if, sumifs, pivot tables, and various forms of nested and text formulas to manipulate data as needed. I can operate excel quite fast with only keystrokes. I produce reports that please both my manager and director first try. 

Just feels like I’ve been passed over for every promotion. Watching everyone around me get them. At this point I’m curious if it’s just because I don’t provide value or if there is another reason I’m being passed up. My view is that I’ve done myself a serious disservice by staying at a company this long without gaining a title. I grew a lot, but I probably should have branched out sooner.  

If I really provide no value, then I wish my manager and director would just tell me. 

I’ve decided to start looking for new jobs. 

I’m welcome to any thoughts and criticism. Please let me know what you think and any advice you may have. 

I just got upset when I stumbled upon across all the title bumps.. jealousy is not good so I try to always avoid that. It just sucks watching multiple peers get promoted while I’ve been stuck in the same shoes for years.

1fepnju,Help changing my name trying to escape internet allegations,"So I'm going to be graduating soon with a computer science degree, but a while ago someone told the police that I was going to do some seriously bad stuff, and even though the situation was resolved after a few days, there were still lots of news articles about it. Now if you google my unique name that is all that comes up, from reputable sources as well. There were no charges and no conviction, so I'm pretty sure I'd pass a background check, but I guess I'm worried about what happens if the hiring manager googles my name.

Let’s say for example my unique name is ""Orion Corleone"", if they google it the hiring manager will probably say, ""what is this and why were there alarming allegations against you"", and I just want to avoid this conversation, so I'm probably going to legally change my name. At this point most people know me by an alternate name already, let’s say ""Ryan"" instead of ""Orion"", so if I change my name to ""Ryan Corleone"", this won't be too big of a change. This solves the issue of the allegations coming up if a hiring manager googles ""Ryan Corleone"", since it only shows good things when you google that. However, if for some reason the hiring manager were to use bing, the allegations still come up. In fact, no matter what I change my first name to, bing will still bring up allegations, so I'd have to change my last name as well if I wanted to fix the bing searches, like shortening my last name to ""Corle"". So, I guess I could do that, but would it look fishy or anything if they ask for my family member's names for some reason and they see that they have a different last name as me? 

I've been reaching out to some of the news sites that show up under a bing search for ""Ryan Corleone"" to have them remove it, and one of them has agreed to remove it from search, but I'd need to do this with maybe 9 different places including journalists who posted on twitter. If I wanted to reach out to all news sites that show negative results for my original name, ""Orion Corleone"", I'd have to reach out to a lot more sources. To my knowledge there is no law saying that they would have to take them down. I've seen law groups claim they can get a court order with a defamation lawsuit, but it seems much cheaper to just change my name. 

I've read some posts from the transgender community about trying to escape their ""deadname"" when going through the hiring process, and apparently their old name can come up, at which point the hiring manager usually assumes it was just their sister/brother. Now, if I change my name to ""Ryan Corle"" and ""Orion Corleone"" somehow comes up, I don't know how that would go. I've talked to a lawyer and they said I could just explain that I wanted to anglicize my name, and it won't be a red flag that they'll look into unless it's some kind of high security job.

I have gotten jobs since the articles were published online but they were not jobs that required a bachelors degree or anything so I suspect their background check / hiring process is more relaxed than something paying a serious salary.

I am going to do positive SEO to add good articles to bury bad results, but I don't want to start doing that yet when I'm not sure yet what my name will be. I already have some good search results for ""Ryan Corleone"", but for some reason this is only for google and not bing. (bing just shows the allegations) I think I am leaning towards going with ""Ryan Corleone"" and keeping my last name, and just really trying to get the news sites to take down their articles, and hoping the hiring guy doesn't use bing. This is partly because I do really like some of the positive things that come up for ""Ryan Corleone"" as I've done some software development under that and have been mentioned in a blog.

A downside of changing my name is that I can't list some jobs on my resume anymore because they had my name as ""Orion"" still. Because of this I am going to try to get the process finished quickly so that I can be hired under my new name and put that on my resume.

A wildcard solution would be the GDPR's ""right to be forgotten"" even though I live in the US. It says here [https://www.enzuzo.com/blog/does-gdpr-apply-to-citizens-outside-the-eu](https://www.enzuzo.com/blog/does-gdpr-apply-to-citizens-outside-the-eu) ""The GDPR applies to those US citizens that live and reside in the EU. If they consent to have their data handled, then the GDPR will apply to them. However, the GDPR does not apply to US citizens living in the US or countries outside of the EU.""

So it seems like I just need to live in the EU and the right to be forgotten would apply to me and I could make the request, not sure if I could get away with a week long stay or if I'd have to get a temporary residence permit. Bing's form [https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools/eu-privacy-request](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/tools/eu-privacy-request) only asks for a proof of residence in its form to apply for a right to be forgotten request, so I guess I would need to live in a country in the EU, and get an electric bill and then use that as a proof of residence. It's not clear if this blocks the search results from appearing internationally though, since it says ""Request to Block Bing Search Results In Europe"" and this in thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/10a2nl8/comment/j43da1i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/10a2nl8/comment/j43da1i/) there's some debate as to whether this would actually block these results in the US or not.

I might also want to mention that if ""Ryan Corleone <City> <State>"" is googled, there is a tiny amount of the allegations that show up, I'm not sure if the hiring manager would look that up though. 



TLDR: Not sure if I should change my name from current “Orion Corleone” to ""Ryan Corle"" or ""Ryan Corleone"" (keeping my last name) in order to avoid defamatory news articles. ""Ryan Corleone"" has some positive stuff in google search but bad stuff in bing search, ""Ryan Corle"" is a blank slate for both. I’d add positive SEO to both.

1fepm6k,Associate vs Assistant Director?,"Currently struggling with feeling ungrateful vs. wanting the best outcome for my overall career progression.

My boss and I discussed for two years that my progression from Senior Manager would be to Associate Director. I work at a large, slow moving legacy company and we finally heard back after months of paperwork and back and forth that I was approved for my promotion… to Assistant Director.

I’m wondering if there is merit in making a stink and seeing if I can get it changed to what my boss and I agreed on (he recommended Associate Director, and HR came back with Assistant Director), or if I should just take it as a valid progression. I’m confused because the job “grade” for this Assistant Director promotion is the same as other Associate Director roles; Assistant Directors generally have a lower job grade code than what this new role would have.

My hold up is that there are huge salary differences between these two titles in the general job market, and I want to make sure when I leave my current company that I would be setting myself up for success somewhere else. Would being an Assistant Director make it less likely that I could reasonably apply to a Director role for my next career move? Would having an Associate Director title make it more likely?

1feos1f,"I graduated from a foreign university, now I live in Florida and I have no idea what to do with it","Hi everyone!
Here’s my story. I graduated from a Venezuelan university (universidad central de Venezuela) and got my psychology license. I love my career, I worked in private practice for two years before I came to the states.

I’ve been in Florida for three years now, I got my RBT certification and been working in the ABA field for a year because it was the closest thing possible that I could do without a US degree.
However, i can’t pay my bills with it. As an immigrant, everything’s twice as difficult. I don’t have any support and all I can think is, either I get my psychology major here and succeed, or go back to Venezuela. At this point, I’m seriously considering going back because I’m so stuck in this situation and the financial struggle is too much for me.

Can any of you guide me through the steps for either validating a foreign psychology degree in Florida, or doing something that will get me closer to that direction?

I’m so desperate because I feel like I wasted 5 years of my life studying hard only to find out my title means nothing here. Please help.

1feor6b,Landscaping or CDL?,"I've been working landscaping for four years now.

I'm currently a FireFighter and I've gone back to working landscaping for my old company working part time for $18 an hour 3 to 4 days a week depending on how my shifts lay for the fire department.

Currently bringing in about $48k before tax with the FD

and about $600-$700 every two weeks with landscaping 

I love to drive and am interested in getting a CDL. I'm getting burnt out with landscaping and the pay isn't making it feel worth it.

Do you enjoy your job driving with a CDL whether it be class A or B, or would you rather do landscaping? Are there any landscapers out there that have gone to a CDL or vise versa and why do you like landscaping or Driving?

1fenjel,Seeking Career Guidance for a Remote Opportunity in Finance/Banking or Real Estate (35M),"Hi everyone,

I'm a 35-year-old who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business administration/banking from a community college, though I’ve never worked directly in the banking or finance sectors. I’m still interested in pursuing something in this field, ideally with a remote opportunity so I can work from anywhere.

Here's a bit about my background:

* **Current Situation:** I don’t have a formal job. Most of my income comes from rental properties—my wife and I converted our home into three units (we rent out two) and I also manage four other properties.
* **Side Hustles:** Right now, I’m doing driving gigs with Uber and Spark while searching for a more permanent part-time or full-time opportunity.
* **Real Estate Investment:** I’ve been involved in managing properties and renting out units for additional income.
* **Customer Service and Hospitality:** I’ve had a range of customer service and hospitality roles since high school.

While I’m grateful for everything I’ve accomplished, I feel like I’m having a midlife crisis of sorts. I’m lost on what to do next for a fulfilling and financially stable career that I can enjoy. Ideally, I’d love to find something that allows my wife to stay home with our future kids while I take care of the finances, alongside income from our rental properties.

I’m open to learning new skills, even starting at minimum wage if the opportunity feels right. I’m wondering if anyone here has suggestions for a career pivot, especially something remote that aligns with my background or my interests in finance and real estate.

Thanks so much for any advice you can provide!",Careful_Success_5424,1,1.0,2,1726095013,2024-09-11 22:50:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fenjel/seeking_career_guidance_for_a_remote_opportunity/,9,2024

1femmq0,Struggling with anti-social atmosphere in Engineering,"So this past year I’ve been on a grad scheme on the engineering floor at a very large company and I’m really starting to struggle with the lack of socialising at work. Whilst I’m not the most extroverted person there’s hardly any small talk around me, no “how was your weekend?” “How are you getting on” etc. It’s gotten to the point where I can actually feel my own social skills starting to regress. It’s frustrating because the finance floors and general business-y floors have much younger and sociable people working there, they will eat as teams in the canteen whereas my colleagues just sit at their desk eating and working. As my department is more hands on I am in the office every day and my highlight of the week is when the other grads from other parts of the business come in once or twice a week so I can catch them for a chat at lunch… 30 mins of normal conversation is the highlight of my week… What hasn’t helped is the post-pandemic wfh culture as now when people are in the office it’s for a specific purpose or they have to be there twice a week so they just turn up and then leave. Being in a big office building that’s dead 3 days a week is actually getting quite depressing. I also moved to the area from hundreds of miles away without knowing anyone which few other grads/employees seem to have done. I signed up for language classes but only me and one other employee regularly turn up and I’ve struggled to make any friends outside of work as I moved to near the office due to the onsite nature of my role but the area is mainly for retirees or young families (I’m 24). I’m trying to work on being less introverted and I’m aware I need to try harder at making friends outside of work so that I’m not relying on work for social opportunities, although naively I did think work would play a large part in that. I have another year left on my scheme which I plan to see out but not sure what my answer would be if offered a position beyond that, the money is good and it’s a reputable company but I’m starting to question if it’s worth it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated especially on dealing with joining big companies at a young age that now have wfh culture embedded in them.",whyalwaysmeP,3,1.0,0,1726092568,2024-09-11 22:09:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1femmq0/struggling_with_antisocial_atmosphere_in/,9,2024

1feliyv,I don’t know if I should find a new job or stay in a toxic environment that pays well,"I am an analytical chemist who works in an industry that I am not necessarily passionate about. I was hired into this position recently and have worked here for about 3 months now. Not only do I not really like the work I do, but my mentors have been far from good— one ignores me and one is blatantly toxic and rude. My manager really seems to be on my side and has sat my mentors down and told them off for not teaching me and being rude. They aren’t replaceable at the moment as they are specialists in their respective duties and don’t have anyone who has trained under them yet besides myself. Things are slowly changing for the better, it seems like, because my manager seems to have no intent of letting me go, but it doesn’t remove the fact that the workplace feels super toxic.

The main reasons I’m staying are the money and the location. It’s close to home and pays better than almost any other analytical chemist position I’ve seen in my area. I say almost because I just saw a posting for a government chemistry job that pays marginally better.

My issue is that I don’t know what decision to make. Not sure if I should be putting in the energy to look at other positions, or just hope the toxicity gets better? Training is going horribly in my opinion and although things are slowly improving, and I’ve started to enjoy some of the work, it’s not something I want to do for the next few decades. But I’m scared to go from one toxic workplace to another, especially with a post-training raise and a bonus coming up. I don’t know what the government job will entail. For reference, the new job’s salary range is $45k-$69k, and I currently make $55k, so I don’t even know if I’d get offered a good pay.

Is it obvious to anyone else what I should do? If I go for the new job what kind of salary would be worth settling for if it’s lower than my current?

1fek9w8,What would be the best option for me right now career wise? I really need to get out of what I do," I graduated in Fine Art 6 years ago. One year after, I enrolled into a master degree in Art History, Patrimony and Visual Culture. I finished in the end of 2022 with a project and presentation of the thesis. I had many practical experiences during those two years, but after finishing my studies, I haven't really made much inside the field.  
 When I started my master degree, I was already working and kept on that until now. I teach 1st and 2nd grade kids inside a public school program that promotes arts and expressions. Besides that, I teach in two private studios, adults and kids, and work privately by commission. Money wise, it's not making me rich, but it's not too bad honestly. I'm an independent worker so, no contract. However, that by itself wouldn't make me leave this type of job, but the rest does... Teaching in the private owned studios is very gratifying, and very well payed too. But in the school, my main source of income and the most stable, it's a different story. It's extremely stressful, repetitive, and the main challenge is by far the behavioral aspect of having a class of kids to teach, and not the subject itself. In short, most kids are there because they have to, not because they want to and I spend most of my classes addressing behavior issues rather than actually doing stuff. With the passage of time I've learnt more strategies to deal with it, but with some groups it really is something I dread, sometimes I just wanna leave and never comeback. On top of that, this is a dead end job, there is no possibility of progression besides the work hours that are attributed to you each year. Some of my colleagues have been doing this for 10 years, still no contract, no raise, or anything other than a couple more hours attributed.  
 In short, I really want to move on and do something else, I want to stop teaching because I have to and do it only privately if I want to as an extra, not as my main thing. The difficult part is, now that I've spent almost 2 years disconnected from academic world, I don't know where to start looking, besides, everything here in my country regarding culture work is very precarious and there aren't many positions to begin with. Most of my colleagues didn't really end up working in the field as well. I don't mind going to other countries, would probably prefer something inside Europe, since I live in south Europe, but moving to other parts of the world would also be an option. So, I would like to know your opinion on what are the best steps moving forward? If it helps in some way I am 27, I'd be open to study again, but I must admit that enrolling in a phd or something like that right now it's not financially viable if I stop working, and I really want to stop doing what I am doing, so maybe only with a scholarship.",Sukyrah,1,1.0,0,1726086516,2024-09-11 20:28:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fek9w8/what_would_be_the_best_option_for_me_right_now/,9,2024

I've never been away for a prolonged period from my family, since all my friends lived near me, and both my middle school and high school were really close. Now I live alone in the biggest city, which seems even bigger compared to my small town back home. 

The thing is, I've been constantly miserable since the start of the semester. It's my first semester here, and I just don't know what to think of it. I have 9 classes in total, some of them 4-5 hours long, so I don't really have any free time or chance to meet with my highschool friends who live in the same area as me. Out of these 9 classes I only like 2, mathematics and history of architecture, all the others either bore me, can't understand at all or simply creeps me out. It's not even that I don't pay attention, I really try to, but it just really can't hold my interest for long. I chose this major because by description it sounded interesting and also because it is partially creative, but now whenever I have to draw or have to learn about drawing I simply feel demotivated or after 1-2 hours of constant drawing feel hatred bubbling up in me for the course. 

I can't decide if I feel this way because this major is just really not for me or because I feel homesick. It's not that I don't have contact with anybody outside of uni, I have regular phonecalls with my parents and middle school friends, meet with my highschool friends on Fridays and have already made friends in uni, But whenever I am alone or doing schoolwork I just feel so sad, demotivated and helpless.

1feinxp,Should I move at 30?,"So I’m from the suburbs of a major city and left to go to college in a small town. Loved it there, made good friends, and swore I’d never move back home. Upon graduation I moved about an hour away to a slightly larger area and took a job. I was unfortunately laid off due to circumstances out of my control. In a panic, I moved back to my hometown. That was in 2020. 

Fast forward to today, I’m 30 years old, have found success in my career, am single, no kids. My previous employer (the one that laid me off) and I have actually stayed very close. He has offered for me to come back. 

My dilemma is this. I don’t like the city I’m in. Traffic. Most people have different views than I. Just not my scene. 

I like the area down there much better. More access to hunting and fishing, slower pace of life, less traffic. But, I’m also nervous to move to a smaller town at 30 years old. I do still have some buddies down there but they’re married so we wouldn’t be going out on the town together. I’d need to make new friends for that and hopefully meet a woman. 

Should I go for it? Or am I right in thinking it may be too lonely?

1fehusa,I was offered a new job; feeling guilty and conflicted,"I currently work for a small company. I enjoy it most of the time—my boss and I get along great, we have a small but mighty team that works well together, and I get to travel frequently which I love. However, because it’s such a small company, there is little room for growth and I’m worried that if I stay, I’ll just be doing the same things I’ve been doing since I started. Also, the company culture is…not great. There is a lot of pettiness, gossip, and sometimes inappropriate comments that are brushed aside because we’re “family”. The CEO means well and tries to take care of us with group outings and nice benefits, but my heart has sank far too many times after realizing that I was the subject of ELT gossip that trickled down to my peers.

Yesterday I was offered a position with a better salary and title than my current job working at a university. I used to teach high school, so the thought of being on a campus working with students really excites me. I would get to be more creative and do more than just sit at my desk. The only thing holding me back is knowing how blindsided my team will be and how bad the fallout will be when/if I give my notice. We are about to enter a busy season, so I know that the work I leave will burden my teammates. Is it normal to feel this guilty? Is this a sign I’m not ready to leave?

That, and it was the only company who even offered an interview out of the hundreds of jobs I applied to. Since the day I started working here, I knew immediately I was in the wrong field.

1fegjcu,What is with the flood of low-wage inquiries by new users lately?,"In 1994, I was offered a secretarial job with starting pay $50,000.  My boss was making $70,000.  That was fairly normal in a LCOL area state-wise, but precise city-wise it was a MCOL area.  Graduates with specialized degrees and skillsets made even better.  By 1999 my boss was making $110,000, and I was at $60,000 upon graduating from college.  Evidentially, based on price of housing in the area, cars that people drove, and the lifestyles they led, many made more, MUCH more.

We could argue all day and night about various regions, states, city vs. rural pay, but the truth is, you simply need to sit down and define how you want to live.  Look at how your employer and co-workers live.  Look at the price of housing in that very specific area.  Look at the cost of insurance, food, daycare, further education (you're always going to need it or you'll be obsolete sooner than later).  And a harsh reality is that in many industries, agism is completely normalized in Corporate America especially.  Out with the old and in with the new.  Almost all corporate executives these days reward themselves handsomely by trimming costs and offshoring job.  They do this by ousting older workers who tend to come with a higher insurance premium (they negotiate this with corporate insurers every year and reassess who to keep based on health conditions you may have -- I know this because I have been ousted 3 times after employers learned of a chronic condition I had, which never affected my work, but was reported to my employers by insurance executives as the reason premiums for the group were increased).  This again is normalized.  And the point is, along with all of the other precise budgeting you need to do, you as a responsible adult must be able to afford to save for a retirement that will come many, many years before the government grants you permission to access Social Security you funded, but also your very own savings.  And when you access it early, as you almost inevitably will need to do, the government will steal an additional 10% in ""early withdrawal penalties"".

These are hard truths, but I've had over 30 years of observations and first hand experiences that make it far more than anecdotal.  They are merely facts now.  Look around.  Notice anything?  Where did all the older workers go?  Oh yes, they got culled recently.  Anyhow, another factor you MUST MUST MUST account for is periods like what we've recently experienced.  None of the fund managers will tell you this, and none of the financial calculators will tell you this, BUT we go through periods of rapid devaluation of the dollar.  Call it ""stimulus"".  So, as you budget for surviving this, enjoying life, saving for your unemployable future, AND business cycles of rapid currency devaluation and market wipedowns... just make sure you account for all.  Once you've added all of that up THAT is tells you what your bare minimum wage or salary MUST be.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  If you settle for less, you are destining yourself for financial ruin.

Anyhow, with all of that in mind, and the absurdly high cost of living now, this absolute flood of low-wage commentary is very suspicious.  It reminds me of a decade or so ago when large corporate hospital executives started making a short investment, expecting about a 4 year return on that investment... and that was, to go into the high schools and direct schools to get students to flood into a variety of healthcare positions.  The entire objective was to saturate the market.  Naturally students didn't care or get what was happening, but their advisors, the schools, recruiters and all were steering them to ""well paying positions"", and so they did, and so the market was flooded, and the executives started reaping the rewards soon after and wages plummeted.  Similar has been happening lately with ""go into the trades"" initiatives, and ""educational tracks"" designed to railroad even the most gifted students away from college and to trade schools.  If you're paying attention to it, you have probably had to fight with educational admins and downstream teachers for years over this as your child repeatedly voiced aspirations and pursued a path towards college.  These things are conspiratorial, ""it's just business"".  Our military has similar campaigns when recruitments get low.  We all know this... well... observant adults do.  

However, this thing happening now, where social media is being flooded with contradictory low-wage inquiries, this is new.  I don't know the best way to combat it except to tell you.... define your budget to survive in this economy, work to live and insure you are paid enough to actually enjoy life, but also paid enough to save for the future.  And these numbers being espoused so much lately, trust me, they are so low they are silly, and if you do the math and the budget, you know this too, so ignore them.  It's a campaign of some sort.",agreeablederivative,0,0.25,0,1726077248,2024-09-11 17:54:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fegjcu/what_is_with_the_flood_of_lowwage_inquiries_by/,9,2024

1fefgsq,discussing promotion upon starting?,"Hi all, please let me lay out my case first.

I was interviewing for a sales job (I have been in consulting and project mgmt before) and the job itself was for level 3/4 (let's say we have 1-5 levels with 5 as highest). 
I got the job but my salary structure got changed so HR told me it would be more beneficial for me to stay in my current level (2) than being promoted (due to changes in % between fixed and variable components). 
My future boss also said I have never done similar job so he thought it would be more fair to existing team members that I first stayed at 2. But he ""promised"" to note it down that we would look at my performance in 6 months to 1 year if I will be able to make it to level 3. 

I will start this job next month, and I wonder if I should bring this up to him in the first official 1-1 and lay out the path to this promotion (i'd not consider it an actual promotion, as it sounds more like they underqualified me back then). Meanwhile I have already proactively got onboarded with a lot of topics, asked colleagues to shadow them, and am ready to pick up some official tasks on my own. 

Do you think it makes sense that I'll do so or he will think I'm too pushy in this regard?
Also, any recommendations on making myself visible as much as possible while being an introvert? I have difficulty in making my way up within corporate, despite almost 6 years of experience.

All of the applications I have submitted have been in cities other than where I live. There is absolutely no room for personal or professional growth where I live, and I want to start fresh in another city. Since submitting applications in other cities, I had one job that required me to interview in-person for the first time. I couldn't justify traveling 300 miles for an interview for a $20 per hour job. I was hoping for a phone or virtual interview, at least at first. I did get one pre-screening phone interview for a different job. The interviewer informed me 3 separate times that the position I was applying for was in-person.

However, I...really don't feel like doing that. And I know it will burn bridges, etc, but I'm wondering if it's really *that* bad? I hate this company and it's been so bad for my mental health that it started to cause physical problems (TMJ, frequent illnesses, constant headaches that required a neurologist check-up).

Would it be awful to put in a 1 week notice and take some time to decompress?

1fedp9y,"Was a software engineer, took a break and now thinking about Psychology?","I am 29F currently living in Michigan, USA. I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and Masters in Data Analytics. I have worked for a total of 2 years and 6 months in a software engineering position which also involved analytics work.

My company shut down due to poor management of finances and recession. I was let go of my job in May of 2023 because of everything shutting down. I have not worked since then.

I have diagnosed anxiety, and the pressure of keeping up with a work visa, doing a pretty demanding job, and then suddenly being laid off with only a handful of days to find another role was too much all at once (work visa stuff). I was already exhausted from the job because it was constant high brain usage the whole 8-10 hours of work plus it was very fast paced. It consumed me.

My husband suggested I take a break and it has been pretty great. I am relaxed and have a better relationship with my husband and myself.

One of the reasons I wanted to stop was also that I was deeply unsatisfied with the my work. I want to do something that matters and is positive for the world, but all I was doing was help big box stores ship product faster via robots. I could not bring myself to care one about it one bit. Also the job left me waking up stressed and going to sleep stressed.

Since growing up I always wanted to do something in the medical field, but I didn't have enough knowledge and exposure to all types of possible careers. I come from a country where it's just doctor, engineer or lawyer. My parents being engineering professors, it was a no-brainer choice back then. But as I finished my masters I had this constant feeling that I am in the wrong profession. I was offered a research role in a children's hospital with analytics that i could do technically, but there was no clear growth path because of my computers background and the pay was so so low. I had student loans so I took up the software job instead.

Things are a little different now, I am fortunate to have a husband that earns pretty well and provides for us financially so that I can live comfortably without working. We do not have kids, nor do we plan to in the near future. After this break, i want to work or just do something. But i cannot bear the thought of coding for some soulless company again. (I realize the incredible privilege I have to even think like this.)

I was also doing therapy while I was on a break and it turns out i might have ADHD. I stopped therapy after a while because i felt the therapist wasn't really attentive and I had to always remind them about the appointments, assignments, and they were always late. I started doing some googling into ADHD and therapy and such and it sparked this little flame in me. Should I pursue psychology myself? 

Now how can someone with ADHD and anxiety get into education? The thing is I have always excelled in academics. It's something about school that feels so easy to me. Any deadlines or projects out of school or work, forget about it. My to do list for life is gathering dust. But I have an almost perfect GPA in my masters (3.94, damn that one A-). I also feel a little excited about the possibility of going back to school for Psychology.

But the big question is, is that really a possibility? Can I become a therapist or do research in psych with my background of computers? Can I directly do masters and a doctorate? Also am i too late to think about this at 29? Should I meet someone first and talk about it? Who should I talk to? I really have zero clue about this path. 

I will appreciate any thoughts you guys have on this and apologies for the long story. Thanks!

1fedn6x,"Was a software engineer, took a break and now looking at Psychology?","I am 29F currently living in Michigan, USA. I have a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and Masters in Data Analytics. I have worked for a total of 2 years and 6 months in a software engineering position which also involved analytics work.

My company shut down due to poor management of finances and recession. I was let go of my job in May of 2023 because of everything shutting down. I have not worked since then.

I have diagnosed anxiety, and the pressure of keeping up with a work visa, doing a pretty demanding job, and then suddenly being laid off with only a handful of days to find another role was too much all at once (work visa stuff). I was already exhausted from the job because it was constant high brain usage the whole 8-10 hours of work plus it was very fast paced. It consumed me.

My husband suggested I take a break and it has been pretty great. I am relaxed and have a better relationship with my husband and myself.

One of the reasons I wanted to stop was also that I was deeply unsatisfied with the my work. I want to do something that matters and is positive for the world, but all I was doing was help big box stores ship product faster via robots. I could not bring myself to care one about it one bit. Also the job left me waking up stressed and going to sleep stressed.

Since growing up I always wanted to do something in the medical field, but I didn't have enough knowledge and exposure to all types of possible careers. I come from a country where it's just doctor, engineer or lawyer. My parents being engineering professors, it was a no-brainer choice back then. But as I finished my masters I had this constant feeling that I am in the wrong profession. I was offered a research role in a children's hospital with analytics that i could do technically, but there was no clear growth path because of my computers background and the pay was so so low. I had student loans so I took up the software job instead.

Things are a little different now, I am fortunate to have a husband that earns pretty well and provides for us financially so that I can live comfortably without working. We do not have kids, nor do we plan to in the near future. After this break, i want to work or just do something. But i cannot bear the thought of coding for some soulless company again. (I realize the incredible privilege I have to even think like this.)

I was also doing therapy while I was on a break and it turns out i might have ADHD. I stopped therapy after a while because i felt the therapist wasn't really attentive and I had to always remind them about the appointments, assignments, and they were always late. I started doing some googling into ADHD and therapy and such and it sparked this little flame in me. Should I pursue psychology myself? 

Now how can someone with ADHD and anxiety get into education? The thing is I have always excelled in academics. It's something about school that feels so easy to me. Any deadlines or projects out of school or work, forget about it. My to do list for life is gathering dust. But I have an almost perfect GPA in my masters (3.94, damn that one A-). I also feel a little excited about the possibility of going back to school for Psychology.

But the big question is, is that really a possibility? Can I become a therapist or do research in psych with my background of computers? Can I directly do masters and a doctorate? Also am i too late to think about this at 29? Should I meet someone first and talk about it? Who should I talk to? I really have zero clue about this path.

1fedhhc,"Career change - how, what, where?","Navigating career change. Where to go from here?

Hi everyone! I’m a 26F with a background in biomedical engineering. After school I was in an engineering role for about 3 years, unfortunately lost my job due to company cuts and then switched into a corporate medical sales role for a different company. Most of my background has been within the medical space. 

I’ve been with this sales role for almost 2 years not and just not loving it at all. I mainly took this role cause I needed work and was willing to try something different in the medical space and getting laid off tainted engineering for me. While working this current role, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with a rough autoimmune disease that consumed the last year for me (has been very tough mentally and physically) and changed my perspective on a lot of things in life. I have now realized that I cannot fake the sales life anymore and it is not filling my cup. I’m exhausted at the thought of it and it’s draining me on top of my current medical issues, even though I am getting those under control now. I just cannot meet the demands of this role anymore and cannot travel 75%+ anymore. 

I am open to leaving this role and would love to find something that I love to do in life- “fills my cup”. I am stuck on where to look next and what type of jobs to research/apply for. With my engineering background I obviously gear towards troubleshooting, creativity, medical device field, problem solving, etc. and with sales I have a lot of business skills, field education, product specialty, etc. I would like to do something remote if possible, works with problem solving or project management or something more creative. 

Anyone have suggestions as to what type of roles/job titles I should look for? How do I navigate applying to roles that I may not have a background in? Anything is appreciated!!

- What should I be doing to get a decent job right out of uni? What skills should I be learning that may make me more employable? How should I be positioning myself to be a good candidate in the job market?

- Is a GPA important ? 

- Should I get an internship during the masters studies

1fecczu,Should I quit?,"I’ve been with my current company for over 7 years and I’ve had three different bosses over that timespan. The company has treated me very well, I’ve been able to ladder up, and my coworkers are great. However, the job is rough. I’ve been the Marketing Operations Manager for the past 4 years and while I’m very good at it, I’m facing burnout and no longer feeling motivated or inspired by my work and I dread clocking in every day. My current boss hasn’t been the best leader and I feel like I’m doing part of her job most of the time in ensuring our team’s morale is doing okay and running the all hands meetings or putting together the agendas for them because she’s too busy or traveling. My previous boss was amazing but took a different position in the company but he inspired and motivated us and made sure we were all collaborating and having good team morale, a stark contrast to my current boss. I also feel beat down from the constant back and forth between Marketing and Sales and the frustrations our team has with feedback we receive and trying to get them to at least try to do something even if we don’t necessarily agree with the direction. The company is also facing lower sales than we’ve had in the past and it feels like Leadership is just chasing the shiny things and not being strategic. This is my first job out of college and I feel like maybe my time here has run its course but it’s all I’ve known and I am a bit terrified of applying and interviewing for other jobs or figuring out where I want my career to go.

I love my job and I feel my work shows that. I get a lot of recognitions and compliments about my knowledge and willingness to help. I received a new boss last year and within that year, I have learned so much and have been taking on more work (which I love). Due to a new re-org, my boss was moved to a different position and a guy on my team was randomly promoted to my new boss. I thought that was strange since they never posted about a new manager position. (I worked as a manager in my last role and with all of the additional knowledge I’ve learned in the past 7 years, I would’ve liked to have applied). On a call with my Director, my new manager told me he would like to “shadow me” as he is impressed with all I know and would love to learn. My director thought this was a “great idea”. I’m frustrated as I now am (for lack of better words) training my new boss, yet he gets the promotion. 

Any thoughts on what to do/how to approach? I love this company and really would not like to leave. I would like to retire from this place.

1febz5d,Should I change careers? (23M),"This is a follow-up to my last post if you haven't seen it:

TLDR: I currently work remotely in tech sales, it is also a contracted position, with my contract ending in March 2025. This does cause a little bit of anxiety as I'm not sure what to do if I don't get hired full-time before the contract ends. I am a top performer on my team, generally being in the number 1 or 2 spot. I am making about \~$70k a year and with the next promotion, I would be making around \~$150k/year. I don't hate the job, but I find that I often feel isolated because of the remote nature, even though I do most of the time enjoy being remote. I also lack fulfillment from my position and don't think that would change from my promotion. So I started looking for other positions I would find a little more fulfilling. 

Now what I'm looking for advice on is this part: I started looking around for some change and started interviewing for some positions that have to do with my college degree in Communications/Marketing and I ended up being offered a job at a boarding school not far from where I live. This job would be a 10-month position where I get the summer off and all the breaks the students receive (a week-long break every 6 weeks or so). I also receive ""free"" housing, food, and utilities. I say ""free"" because I need to be a dorm parent one weeknight and rotating weekends. On the weekends I essentially have to be in the dorm the entirety of the day besides a few hours. The huge caveat is the pay, which is \~$35k for the 10 months, cutting my pay essentially in half. It isn't a super expensive area to live in so I would say all in the housing, food, and utilities would be at most $2k/month. Still not closing the gap between salaries and I have the extra workload of having to be a dorm parent.

  
I'm not super worried about that pay decrease as I don't have any large bills, I have a rather small amount of student loans and that's about it. The position is also talked about as being a fast-track position to an Associate Director position, which will increase my pay, but this school doesn't pay much for any position. Having the title of Associate Director would be the more important part. Is it worth taking the pay cut and moving careers? Now that I have an offer in my hand I'm questioning if it's right to leave my current position.",Front_Silver9153,1,1.0,0,1726066080,2024-09-11 14:48:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1febz5d/should_i_change_careers_23m/,9,2024
1febyfv,Pursuing a career that I can only do in HCOL areas,"26M I have a good job right now but I’m looking to leave for something I love doing. If I continue to do the job I’m doing now I can eventually get into universal fields where I could live wherever I want. I like this job but I cannot say that I love it. 

The job that I want I know that I love, I find it interesting I’m excited to go to work and I think about it when I’m home. It’s a well paying career, the only thing is in order to consistently have a job/job security I would need to live in either Boston, San Diego, or San Francisco. These are all great cities but I will never be able to buy a house here. I’m not really turned off by not having a house. If you stay away from the trap of living in one of those “come with everything” luxury condos you are left over with money to save. For context I’m able to save about $1500 to $2000 a month for retirement/investing. I know that stock market returns move at similar rates compared to real estate and not having to deal with house repair problems is nice.

1febmtt,My boss wants to dictate his preferences onto a project I am working on for another team. Is this normal?,"I hope this is the right place to ask this. I am facing a weird issue that I encountered before but want to know if this is normal, or okay, or if by boss is overstepping.

I first encountered a situation like this when I was in a developmental program at my company which required me to do a presentation. It was an opportunity program, not a corrective. The program was not associated with my department, and my boss was not involved in it. He was invited to see the presentation and my work when it was my turn to present at the end. He offered to go over it with me and help prep before I was to present.

Great!  I got feedback, but there was a phrase my boss heard in a presentation that he *loved*. It was adjacent to what I was talking about, but it didn't particularly relevant and I didn't care for it. He suggested it, I said a noncommitted 'okay' and left it at that. Afterwards, my boss mentioned in passing that he didn't hear that phrase. I ignored it and that was the end of it, but I thought it was weird that he expected his suggestion to be in my presentation.

Now, my company is migrating to change our intranet. My boss is in charge of one section and has dictated specific standards for page design. That is fine. I will follow them for our pages. I agree with a cohesive view.  However, I am working with another team on their section and have taken more liberty with the pages that don't meet the standards my boss put for our own pages. I don't mean they are crappy pages, but I don't follow all the same arbitrary rules. Example: My boss says we do *not* use photos. If we want to represent people, we use stock cartoons. It is just a thing for him.

I am almost done and showed a colleague on my department team, and he said that my boss was upset at these pages (I don't think he knew I did them specifically). For example, I have a photo and he said 'We don't use photos. Why would they do this?'

I know my boss, when he finds out I did them, will want me to change them. But they look good and I don't think they need to. It isn't for him and our department/section, so I don't think they need to follow the same rules.

So is this something to be expected? Like, should I dictate his wishes when working on projects with other teams because he is my boss?",jeshurible,1,0.5699999928474426,5,1726065205,2024-09-11 14:33:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1febmtt/my_boss_wants_to_dictate_his_preferences_onto_a/,9,2024
1febk8p,"My job involves coding, which I hate. Should I quit?","I work in a type of consulting that involves a lot of data analyses, which I have realized I hate. I worked with data for a bit during my senior thesis, and I thought I enjoyed it enough to work in this industry. Turns out, I hate data work, and it makes me feel like a complete idiot and diminishes my confidence completely. 

Also, the work of my firm is such that I have to look for a new case/project every few months; you get staffed on a project, and when it ends you have to find another one. It’s like getting laid off every few months and having to find another job. This causes me so much mental anguish because “utilization” which is how much I can bill is ultimately a measure of my contribution even though not finding a case for a month at times is not on me at all. We usually work 10-12 hours during cases and then 0 hours during downtime. 

The only positive of this job is that they don’t fire analysts, so there is job security despite the situation of the market. They do fire senior staff and associates as well, but they don’t fire analysts because we’re not paid as much but work a lot during cases compared with associates, for example, who are paid about twice or more. 

I hate everything; I hate myself; I feel like I’m stuck, but I don’t have any skills that could help me just get out, and find better work.

He brought up an anecdote that the first day a boy of color started school with him, everyone watched him play basketball at recess expecting him to be amazing. After this, I brought up that I completely understood as a kid thinking that way if you are not exposed to other cultures in your childhood. I had a similar upbringing to this. I mentioned that I used to think this way as a kid as well, but now as an adult, I prefer to live in a more diversified area and live amongst other cultures I don't quite understand, and learn about them through eating their food, talking to them, etc. in an effort to gain a broader perspective of the world. My manager responded by chuckling and shaking his head, looking down and saying he ""had to go"", and my coworker followed.

What's so hard about this is no one thinks similarly to me. I have no one to connect with or confide in. If anyone at my level of employment does think similarly, they don't try to get closer to me because they can sense that the people at the top (i.e my manager and some other higher level staff he's friends with there) don't have respect for me. But this is due to our contrasting beliefs, and causes my manager to not give me as much of a chance as an employee and put me on more pertinent projects. He probably does not have a lot of trust in me either for the same reason. I only have 2 other coworkers, so this isn't a huge crowd to begin with. I have another manager, but I'm afraid to talk to her about this because a) she is the client, as we are contracted out by a larger conglomerate, and b) she has known my manager much longer and will surely tell him that I confided in her regarding this. She keeps her political opinions more private, although she lives in rural New Hampshire so I can only imagine that she has similar beliefs to him.

I have no one I can trust or confide in. It is impeding on my motivation to do well for this client and at my job as a whole.

1fe8xvp,Remain in Edinburgh which I love or move to Dublin for Amazon?,"# 

I came to Edinburgh from abroad this time last year of my MSc at UoE and found a SWE job here 3 months before the end of my studies. Was working part-time and now that I'm done with uni I converted to full-time. I make 30k GBP and the people there are really nice, non-toxic, always willing to help and in general its a good workplace (which is rare apparently).

During that one year I made vary close friends, managed to find a decent flat with an amazing roommate, perfect location with affordable rent and in general fell in love with the city.

A week after finishing my dissertation I got a call from an Amazon recruiter (had applied online for grad SDE months ago) for an interview. Had the interview and got the offer a few days later. I will be making 80k EUR base + stock and bonus. The resume prestige is gonna be nice too.

I have heard mixed opinions on Dublin but the general consensus feels quite negative. I'm in a position now where I know what's the best thing for my career is, but finding it hard to leave a place I have settled at.

Here's a small breakdown of the pros and cons of leaving Edinburgh for Dublin:

Pros:

* Amazon prestige for later jobs
* Money
* New experience, possible new friends I guess
* Could probably work for a year and try to internally transfer to a place I enjoy

Cons:

* Expensive
* No friends
* Need to find a new flat and move which is a hassle but yeah I guess im just complaining
* Possibly hard to find more friends because the Greek community is wayy smaller (im greek)
* Love Edinburgh, objectively nice city to live in, Dublin not so much (no hate, just what I found online)

I am 95% taking the job, its just feels weird leaving behind a nice life you built. Any advice, alternative POV, missed pros/cons, similar experiences would really help.

1fe8ut3,Should I return to my old job? ,"I left my job in January to take care of my sister and her cancer battle.  I liked the law firm but didn't like my boss because he refused to communicate with me directly and always used HR to give directions during the 6 months I was working there. I just felt it would've been more beneficial to work and communicate directly with me but he was too busy (although honestly I think he was avoidant).  I physically worked in the local office of my city and got along great with everyone physically in the office.  The attorneys I supported, however, were in different locations so my work assignments came from their office location.  The attorney I was assigned, however, typically preferred coordinating tasks through HR though I learned that is not the norm for this firm.  So it was weird.  I was not enamored with the job. It was ok I just prefer getting assignments directly rather than funneled through HR.  Anyway I left after 6 months when my sister's cancer treatments began. 

While I was caring for my sister, I accepted freelance jobs in the meantime to keep a foot in the career field and some income coming in working primarily with solo practitioners.  The assignments were flexible. My sister's treatments have since ended and I need to return to workforce because financially we're tight.  I've been applying to lots of places and just not getting interviews admittedly I've only been looking 6 weeks.   I noticed my old position at my prior firm has posted.  Should I apply for my old job back?   I hesitate only because I worry about the communication issues again (with instructions coming from HR instead of the attorney directly).  Or should I just continue my quest and avoid my former firm?

1fe8hyq,"I'm Very Nervous, Any Advice?","I just put in my notice to resign and am excited to start my new role, but I don't know what to expect. 

I graduated highschool and 4 months later started a traineeship with my current company, finished this up after 1.5 years and was promoted to a full-time employee. I've been with this business for just over 2.5 years and a few days ago was asked if I would start a position at what I believe is my dream company. 

While I am very relieved I didn't have to go through an interview or reference checks to be offered this, I am also worried I just don't know what I'm getting into. I like this company, but I don't know how other businesses operate, I don't have anything to base this move off. 

For extra context:
I love my colleagues now, they are around 8-20 years older than me but we go out a lot and are VERY close friends. I'm nervous I will come off less professional because I have never experienced a ""normal"" co-worker relationship. 
The new role is offering around $20k more, government based and much less work. So I couldn't say no. My last role had me really underpaid and lots of overtime and travel. 

I also have an odd relationship with my manager. I'm very thankful to her for giving me these opportunities and trusting me with a project that had me flown to another town in my state. I am able to confide in her and she cared about my mental health. But at the same time she has also said some hurtful and not appropriate things to me. I displayed interest in a few open roles under her department which she said she wouldn't accept me for because I am too young. 
I understand you will have good and bad managers, but is this common at all? 

I'm just hoping for different perspectives or advice on how to adjust to a new role, especially with no previous experience.

I don't know.

1fe88k1,Is a road to a Masters worth it?,"Hello everyone!

Just looking for advice or personal experiences of people going into the field or pursuing their masters. Although I went for a bachelor degree in “fine arts”, it correlates to design and media. 

I have two roads to consider. With my current experience I can attempt to get a full time job related to the marketing/design field by taking an additional certificate for public relations OR, any minimum full-time solely to save up for a Masters program.

Although I want to pursue my masters, I would find it nice to start an entry level job to gain experience instead of relying on a masters to get me into a career.

So for anyone here, have you ever went straight for a masters? Would it be better to put an effort to gaining a full job and work from there? My masters itself would be reliant on media/digital industries. I can see myself getting into marketing but I would still need to get some credentials.
 
Long story short, I think it would be nice to collect some experiences from people who have attempted going into “advanced academia” or job hunting themselves. Thank you!

1fe7wjv,How to deal with this situation at work ?,"Hi guys, would like to ask for advice on how to handle this situation. So basically, I've noticed that someone is touching my things at work. I don't have solid proof but I have an idea about who the culprits are. Worst part is my colleague who sits next to me refuses to divulge who it is. Just a sidenote, he is also one of the suspects. My relationship with my colleagues at work have, as far as I know, been cordial at best. I don't really know whether this is being done as a joke or not as a result. Its not a big thing, things aren't missing or anything, just that some stuff is put in a funny manner. Like my stationary would be arranged in a smily face that kind. I'm thinking of a few options.

1. Just ignore it. This seems like the most logical thing to do but at the same time the hardest. Knowing that someone is out to get me is quite unsettling.
2. Confront the suspects one by one in person. This doesn't seem like a good choice either as I might be accusing the wrong person.
3. Send out a general message to everyone in our work group to not touch my stuff and say its childish. But this seems like it will put a dent in my relationship with everyone.
4. Escalate to HR. This seems like a last resort situation and I don't want to be seen as making a mountain out of a molehill

I moved to DC for my current job but it was never my plan to live in this state. Now that I’m here, I absolutely love it and I don’t see myself leaving anytime soon. 

I recently got an offer for a job that I applied to back in April and it’s based in NYC. I continued doing interviews with them in July and August bc back then, I still had the intention of moving back to NY but now, I don’t. Luckily, they’re willing to make the position fully remote to accommodate me. This associate role aligns better with my career goals and I can see more potential for growth in the future. But, I honestly don’t know if I want a fully remote setting bc I do enjoy going to an office.

My current job is very entry level assistant work and I find myself not caring for it anymore. There doesn’t seem to be any room for growth and I don’t see myself staying for over 6 months. Like I’m already applying to other jobs in DC now.

So i've been working for this comapany for around 2.5 years now and have brought up the topic of promotion and expectations from someone in my role and though we have discussed in great detail what these expectations are somehow during the time of appraisals and promotions some more points always get added to this list which apparently ""I don't meet"" as per my manager and which gives him an excuse to not promote me. Not to mention that these expectations are well above my pay grade and are the things that generally a tech lead would deal with, plus he wants me to contribute to some extra projects in the org for which I'll get paid nothing for slogging away all the extra hours. I had politely declined to do these things and now my manager is hell bent on making my life even more miserable.

that he won't promote me, it was the final straw and I have been on leave since and have started looking for a new job.

I was going to do an analytics minor and hopefully get into people analytics, but I’m having some regret now. It’s a really good business school and I already have the credits of a Sophomore so I’m afraid I would be set back so much if I switched now. I hate math, coding, and all of that stuff. I was kind of pigeonholed into it by my parents. The HR stuff was my attempt at getting away from it while still making my parents happy and being in denial about how much I hate it. I’m starting classes and realizing I’m going to be absolutely miserable, and I don’t know what to do.

I’m a really good writer, and love that. I do want to end up in some type of office job. I want to make enough to live on, save for retirement, buy a condo one day, etc. I’d be horrible in any type of sales. I looked into city planning, sociology, geography, anthropology, etc. when I was younger, but I don’t want to go into academia and my parents freaked out bc I would be unemployed forever if I did those apparently. I’m really interested in that type of stuff, but don’t know any job I might like that corresponds to them.

I have since done a 3 months internship in Germany in a life sciences company focusing on product marketing/strategy. I want to end up in a role where I can work on marketing strategy and business development -preferably with some analytics work.

For context by the way, I have dual nationality (British and Dutch - relevant for admission into certain EU courses) and I am not exactly able to afford private universities insane tuition fees which is why I'm not looking at those as options even though I would be able to get direct admission into their courses. I can just about afford a year course for premasters/MBA at around 6000 euros max.

It says it give a chance to build business with a specialization in marketing and 4 internships guaranteed throughout the course. I am considering this because it could improve my networking skill, communication skills, and academic skills With marketing skills, i could help in grow my father's business of stock broking and financial services Maybe explore the finance sector, or maybe work somewhere for 1-2 years, then go for an MBA with good work; for example, I might have better opportunities for a better MBA college. the colleges cons are that its fees is around 8.5 lakhs for total course around 2.5 lakhs per annum , another is that it is their 1st batch so yeahh, but  they have good faculty from what I can see on web; another is that they don't offer a degree but we pursue online/distance learning from srm University, Chennai  Another is that I would have a gap of 1 academic year, which could affect my chances for an MBA.

1fe382m,Switching degrees?,"Hi. I was enrolled in university for Business Administration in 2022-2023 but had to drop out due to medical reasons. Now that im able to go back, im debating whether or not to go back into Business Administration or International Hospitality Management. 

One of the reasons why I was a little relieved when I dropped out was I felt like I wasn’t prepared for the maths in BBA, but during my down time I have been studying nonstop and am confident I can excel this time. 

But to be honest, I don’t know what career I want to pursue. I want to try finance but don’t know if I want to dedicate my life to that career (I know finance is broad and there are different industries within that industry, but I don’t have much idea about all the specifics of it which is why I’d like to explore first if that makes sense)

I cross references the subjects BBA and Hospitality has, and they both have finance subjects and I’ve also seen people enter the finance industry with a hospitality management degree so it makes me think that maybe Hospitality management is much more flexible than a BBA degree.

I understand they might be working hard and all. I did enjoy the peaceful stint, traveled, partied, and tried many new things.   
Now as I am aging and responsibilities are around the corner I am want to up my game. I am a duffer in the skills department as I have been in this chill job for 4 years now. All I can put up in the CV is operations, team handling, and problem-solving with some basic examples.

I understand that I might need to shift fields to grow and find better prospects and I am prepared for it and the learning phase. but what I am confused about is what path to take?  
I have a few things that I need help on, what would be a feasible path and one that is good for some years to come

1. Coding (I fully understand that learning it might take up to 1.5-2 years to be employable)
2. Financial Advisor (Have some experience already in this field but will be hard to reenter)

1fe29n8,My humble take and experience on current job market ,"I am currently out of work for almost 1.5 months and I am looking  for job since more than 2 months as I knew my last working day. For these past months I have tried everything that I know of and after applying for more than 500 jobs, I  did not even receive 1 interview.  I wake up every day, read about available positions,  customize my resume and cover letter for each job and apply to as many positions as I can. 

What I have received so far is automated rejections from bot emails which I cannot reply to and ask for any suggestions,  rejection without explanation and when asked for their explanation they gave me one skill that I didn't have ( which was not mentioned in the job description) and other reasons like they hired someone and hired someone internally. I applied to many jobs on indeed and got 4-5 interview requests (happy emotions), but after replying to set up an interview all of them ghosted me. I sent follow up messages, called the clinics where I applied and either didn't get an answer or talked to in the worst tone and told that ohh we hired someone.  After all those hopes and expectations of finally getting  a chance,  all my hopes were crushed badly. I still didn't give up and continued the process.

Did a quick Google search on tips to job application and number 1 tip I  found was networking.  So I tried doing it, I messaged all the philosophical ""gurus"" on LinkedIn who posted about respect and transparency and help and all the good adjectives on motivation and hard-work and when I messaged those people not even a single person replied back. I could see few of them read my message but no reply.  I guess all talk and no action.

I am truly starting to question my abilities and qualifications. I am a Dentist back home with experience and doing volunteer work for underserved communities. I came here with high hopes and motivation only to find that I cant even land basic jobs. What happened to common decency? Sorry for the long rant.

1fe0wmc, What kind of career should I do if I think like this?,"This might sound strange, but I wanna give a scenario to show how I think and even problem solve (if that's what you wanna call it). What kind of career is good for this kind of way of thinking and might I say, logical way of thinking?

There was a girl in my college who was kind of religious. Let's call her Tess.

One day, Tess was talking to her friend, also a girl, let's call her Jenn. 

Tess said something like: it would be cool if your sister and I got to know each other. (Seems normal enough)

Then Jenn said, ""yeah, my sister and my best friend. That's so cute. I would love that!"" They were being vague so nobody would understand them. That piqued my interested. What did Jenn mean, ""my sister and my best friend?"" Do they mean dating? I thought, is Tess lesbian or bi? And that also means Jenn's sister is Lesbian or Bi. 

Anyways, I kept that in mind, but I did not look too much into it. At that time, I was wondering if a religious girl like Tess would be a lesbian. I wasn't sure because of how vague they were.

Then another day, Tess was talking to another girl, let's call her Nancy. Nancy had a young daughter, around 7 or 8. Nancy was saying that she doesn't want her kids watching LGBTQ+ shows and cartoons with LGBTQ+ characters or themes. She said, ""kids are too young to learn about this stuff"". Tess became extremely defensive after Nancy said that. Tess said, ""gay kids feel better if they see gay characters"". I think kids don't know their sexualities, but that's my opinion. I don't want a social justice debate on here. I am just stating what they said. They went back and forth and pretty much had a debate. Tess was pretty angry and offended about this; you could tell. I don't remember the exact convo, but it went something like this:

Nancy: if my kid is lesbian, I will accept her, but I want her to get to that on her own, not because she saw it on a cartoon. I also want my kid to have kids of her own someday.

Tess: your daughter can have kids even if she's lesbian. She can do fertility treatments or adopt. 

I felt that throughout that disagreement, Tess wasn't trying to see eye to eye at all. Nancy was trying to be understanding. 

I thought, why is Tess getting so worked up over this? She's religious; why is she supporting kids seeing LGBT+ stuff? I know there's some ""hippie"", liberal Christians. That wasn't her church. I don't remember her sect, but her sect was ok with gay ppl, but not ok with homosexuality as an act. I thought, why is she supporting LGBT things so much when her religion doesnt? This is what I thought at the time. I learned that there's a lot of people who follow religion, who also support LGBT+ or are LGBT+. I thought, maybe she's gay if she is so passionate about this and it seems personal for her. Still, I wasn't sure because just because she supported LGBTQ+ rights didn't mean she was also LGBTQ+.

Lastly, Tess dressed kind of masculine.

Anyways, considering everything, I came to the conclusion that Tess is a lesbian, or bi, or some kind of LGBTQ+. This disagreement with Nancy especially confirmed this. She or anybody never told me if she is. I still did not have any confirmation.

Fast forward to years later, I ran into Tess. She got married. Guess what? She married a woman. I don't really care Tess is a lesbian. I accept LGBT+ people and everyone. I just used this example to show how I think and figure things out. 

Sorry, is an unexpectedly long post. I just hope it conveys my thought process and how I think. That being said, what kind of career should I purse? What kind of career rewards this kind of figuring things out? This is just an example, but in general, I can figure things out given some clues. I was thinking maybe I can do something investigative? I am thinking maybe I could be a lawyer. But still, I want to know my options. 

I am 3 years out of college. I majored in a humanities subject. I am currently working in a small office. I have done this for the past 3 years. I live on the East Coast and open to relocating. I am looking for what career I should go into. Does this help indicate what kind of career I would be good at or does it just mean I have a good gaydar 😂? Thank you.

1fe0n3g,Considering Leaving My Workplace ,"Hi everyone. Using a throwaway on here \*just in case\*... In 2022, I started working for a large public school district. It's now my third year working there. I am a paraprofessional, so I'm one of the only hourly/part-time employees in the building. I don't have a contracted position. 

For the first year and a half, I was very content with my position and colleagues. Obviously there were tough days here and there, but nothing too stressful. However, around this time last year (2023) I started feeling a noticeable shift in the way a particular colleague approached and interacted with me. For reference, we hold the same position but she has been there much longer than me. It began as subtle one-upping, but it has since devolved into what I believe constitutes workplace bullying. I'll provide some more concrete examples below: 

* Asked me if I was related to our supervisor because ""someone told her"" I was. When I answered that I'm not related to the supervisor, I asked if she could tell me who told her this false information so that I could clarify with them that it isn't true. She suddenly backtracked and claimed she did not know who told her/where she heard this, leading me to believe she was trying to start rumors and gossip. 
* On a similar note, she asked me if a different colleague of ours, one I work with more closely, was asking parents and families for money, which is not only unequivocally false to my knowledge, but extremely illegal, and not something to insinuate about a coworker without confirmation. She replied in a similar manner to the incident above: denying that she remembered/knew who had started the rumor in an attempt to incriminate. 
* When I completed a project a few weeks ago, she said ""now you're finally working!"" Operative word being ""finally,"" as though she assumed I had not actually done anything in my previous 2 years at the school. 
* Here is where it got really bad: we had a team meeting a few weeks ago, and all of our school administrators were present and leading this meeting. This colleague takes it upon herself to tell me that one of the teachers was wondering when he could meet with me about a student in his class in front of our entire team. I responded by saying that this had been addressed with me back in January, and that I have since been in regular communication with the teacher. I emphasized that this was resolved in the middle of last school year. I felt targeted during this interaction. 
* After the team meeting with our administrators concluded, I headed back to the office I share with her and one other colleague. As I am packing my bag to leave, she begins talking to our other coworker. I am now catching up on reading some text messages my sister sent me while I was working, and I chuckled at something she had sent me. The colleague flips out and says I'm giving her dirty looks and that the topic she's discussing with our other coworker ""doesn't concern"" me. Correct, it does not, which is why I am not inserting myself into the conversation. For the first time, I defended myself and said ""It seems like you're accusing me and taking an aggressive tone, and I do not appreciate that. I was looking at something on my phone and I don't like how you're targeting me this way."" Of course this is not verbatim, but I did not use any profanity and used ""I..."" statements. 
   * After she scoffed and left, I immediately emailed my supervisors for our district and approached one of our administrators, all of whom told me to pursue conflict resolution training with this colleague. The school-based administrator told me I was ""taking it but also dishing it"" because I corrected the colleague's accusation that I had not followed up with the teacher during our meeting. I admitted to being short and curt in my tone. Our district supervisor told me, point blank, ""what do you even want me to do?."" 

I could keep listing the small instances of disrespect she has shown me over the last year, but I'd be typing for hours. These are some of the big ones and I am sincerely concerned about my position being jeopardized by this loose cannon coworker. It has taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel I am being held to unfair expectations of taking responsibility for nasty behavior which I did not provoke simply because most of it happens when she and I are alone and not in front of any superiors. I tend to understate and diminish the severity of cases when I've been disrespected, but this one is so blatant and so awful that I really think I'm not overreacting. I have started applying for other positions due to the lack of response and the continued retaliatory behavior of this colleague.

1fdze0a,Fired then get hired somewhere else with previous employee ,"I work in the healthcare setting and I may be an overthinker…. I need reassurance or some sort of guidance. 

I got fired from a job about 3 months ago. For no particular reason. I was only doing what I was trained, *and I was trained by someone who wasn’t even there for half a year*. I followed her training down to the T but then something happened in the kitchen and they fired me over it. Even though my job is to take care of patients. 

Things kind of ended awkwardly and I got walked out of facility. 

I remember the lady that trained me saying how she “hates her previous job” how they’re so short they keep asking her to come full shifts even though she gave notice… 

The whole situation that happened 3 months traumatized me because I’ve never been fired before. I’m a hard worker, I always follow job description and I’m looking for ways to improve. 

So August comes and I apply for a healthcare position that my trainer previously worked at. Mind you, I’ve worked for the company before but different location. 

I get the job. And the first day comes and the girl that trained me at previous job is there…

I then have so many questions because
1- she was bashing this place saying how she quit but now she’s working here (and I’m 99% sure she still works at previous place still)
2- I’m sure she heard what happened at my previous job so I’m not sure if she’s going to run around telling everyone? 

Me and her always got along but the altercation that happened, she’s closer to the other girl than me… so I’m not really sure what to think or what to do…

Has anyone faced a similar situation? What other career paths in India might be viable besides an MBA? I’d appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to build a successful career given my current circumstances.

I am on a contract by my tech company, but the client might try to buy me out next year as a permanent employee. Who knows. They've already renewed our contract once and NEED us there. Free snacks 24/7, at least 1 free meal a week, good free parking spot for events downtown, leave work early almost every day. idk if my next job will have any of this or not.

This place is a 40 minute commute each way and pays about $30/hr.

Because my favorite coworker is trying to leave and our new boss and other coworker is micromanage-y (and put me on a PIP- which I'm about to successfully complete), I also started interviewing at other places. Currently, it looks like I'm going to be offered the same exact role, but for a different company in a location about 20 minutes from my house instead of 40, with pay somewhere from $32-35/hr (I can update this post if they send an official offer.

1fdxqp3,What job offer to choose?,"Can someone help me to decide?

1, 22F, Fresh graduate with a degree of financial management and living in the province.
I am currently deciding what job offer to choose.

1. The first one is from a subsidiary of San Miguel
Properties as a Negotiator with 21k as basic pay (high offer compared to others) with mandatory benefits. I will be a project employee and the contract is good for 1 year.

2. The second offer is from PNB as a Bank teller with 16k as basic pay with mandatory benefits, bonuses and incentives. Will start as probationary.

Which job offer is better? At first I want to work in a subsidiary of San Miguel because SMPI is a huge company and it's good for the record plus the salary is high. However, I am contemplating now to choose PB because of its job security.

1fdxehf,New Job Woes,"I started my current job about 60 days ago and I feel like I’m out on an island. I’m in consulting and left my previous role because of lack of available work and a toxic management team. Now I’m feeling like I made the wrong decision. At my old company I was already working with about 15 clients at this point, at my current company I’ve had one project that I admittedly made a tiny mistake on during the first pass but this never made it to the client and the only reason anyone found out was because it took me longer than was budgeted for the project. Now I feel like because of this I’m not getting any projects or clients sent my way and they aren’t trusting me. I’ve also had clients I’ve worked with before that reached out to me saying they were told that I didn’t work at the company I’m at now. Sorry for all of the rambling but this has been keeping me up at night. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be great. I don’t want to look for a new position this soon and the firm I’m at is very respected in the field but I’m starting to question if this is a good fit or not.

1fdwzg5,How do I find a mentor to help me navigate politics for the promotion I deserve?,"I am a very ambitious person. I’m so obsessed with my career, due to a lot of factors: I wasted my early twenties after college chasing my ex around the country for his career to areas where there weren’t ample opportunities within my desired industry, thus sacrificing a legitimate career of my own. I’ve been working in professional offices (mostly as a receptionist or customer service rep) since 2012, but I finally entered my dream industry in 2019. I divorced my ex in 2020, threw myself entirely into my career, yet I am still struggling to climb the corporate marketing ladder in 2024.

I’m finally realizing that my lack of promotions aren’t because I’m not capable. When I left my first marketing job in 2021, they had to hire two people to replace me. I had requested a raise and my senior colleague had gone to bat for me to actually be promoted in addition to the raise, but our marketing director denied us just so she could get a promotion and a raise with the available funds from senior manager to director. Things looked very promising at my next job. Instead of assistant, I became a coordinator, but my amazing manager left the company four months after I started and it all went downhill from there. I did her job for two months until a replacement came along. He was our second choice. Our first choice had to decline because she didn’t want to come into the office every week, and I was disappointed because she seemed like she’d really mentor me. My new manager didn’t even take all the managerial responsibilities away from me, and said he was impressed by me because I did “so much” and I was the “glue” of the corporate team. 

So, I prepared a speech and had done the research prior to my first annual review at the company. I knew I deserved a raise and promotion. The woman who hired me originally had been promoted her first time with the company around her one year mark as well, and I knew I had earned it. My manager gave me a near perfect review - which the VP told me would never happen, because “nobody gets 5s”, but I did. However, when I began to present my research, he cut me off and said, “I know you want to become a specialist, but the VP thinks you’re not a ‘brand God’ yet and the Director of Social thinks you’re ‘too literal’ to be a specialist.” I was so deflated. I asked if there was a path to promotion, a timeline, a plan we could set to improve and get me to where I wanted to be. He shook his head and said no. I met privately with the VP the next day and she was surprised to hear how disappointed I was with my manager. She said he “adores you” and then told me that normally it takes four years to be promoted from coordinator to specialist. I knew this was a lie…my old manager had been promoted twice in two years.

That night, I texted my old manager about this. She told me she was a “typo queen” who made far worse mistakes than the ones I described to her. She encouraged me to look for a new opportunity elsewhere. That’s when it hit me…this lack of promotion had nothing to do with my abilities or professionalism. It had everything to do with politics.

A few months later, I was recruited by a tiny, privately-funded startup. I didn’t like their name, branding, product, service… but I liked the manager title and the money they offered. I was also eager to leave my workplace where things had taken a toxic turn since my review. I accepted the job but knew I had made a mistake when the startup told me on my first day that they had laid off two other people I thought I would be working with. I learned a valuable lesson through this experience: startups this small don’t need marketers, they need sales. They expected me to conduct cold outreach on my personal LinkedIn, and via email. I was desperate to leave but the job market had become worse than ever. For the first time in my entire life, I got laid off in June 2023. I couldn’t get an interview anywhere. In October 2023, a temp agency contacted me about an opportunity with a well known company. It was for an assistant marketing manager position, and I would only work 35 hours a week, and I would only be paid $30 an hour. It felt like a big step backwards but I had no other options. The recruiter told me to make it clear in my interviews that I didn’t have interest in growth, which is a lie but I was desperate. It became clear to me why: the director who hired me and led me to believe I would report to her pulled a bait and switch and had me report to a nepo hire who had finally been promoted after nine years with the company. He is, by far, the worst manager I have ever had. He is lazy, insecure, awkward, egotistical… I could go on and on.

I’ve pushed through, gone above and beyond, and was rewarded with a raise without even asking. The VP has commended me for my ideas, and the director initially told me to bring ideas directly to the VP, but then my manager told me not to do that. He has taken credit for one of my ideas before. I do not see a path forward to growth at this company unless I do not work for him.

TL;DR: This brings me to my question: how can I find a mentor who will help me learn how to navigate politics towards a path of success? I do not want to wait nine years for a promotion like my manager. I do not want to be stuck in entry level jobs for the rest of my life.

1fdwtgt,Devoting three months to PM. What should I learn?,"Hi everyone,

I've been out of work for over a year, applying for jobs consistently. While I've come close a few times, I haven’t been able to secure a role. At this stage, continuing without making some changes feels counterproductive. Job hunting has essentially been my full-time focus, and in my limited downtime, I’ve pursued certifications like the PMP. Now, I have roughly three months I can fully dedicate to learning and improving my skill set.

I have a business bachelor's and experience in marketing and project management. However, I feel my technical skills aren't as strong as they need to be. My goal is to transition into tech, ideally into product management or a strategy-focused role, but I’m aware of how competitive the current job market is for these positions. For context, I’m based in Canada, and while I’m unsure of which specific industry I want to focus on, I’m open to advice on that front as well.

I have basic coding and design skills, though I’m unsure if three months is enough time to significantly develop them. My focus is on landing a product management role, so I want to make the most of this learning window. I have full days for the next three months to dedicate to learning, and I’m hoping to find free or low-cost resources to strengthen my qualifications. However, I’m also open to investing in paid courses if they come highly recommended and provide real value.

While I’ve interviewed for a few APM roles and read into product management, my direct experience is still quite basic. Are there any courses, resources, or strategies you’d suggest that can help me become a stronger candidate for product management or strategy-focused roles by the end of this period?

Thanks for any advice!",throwthrowawaze,2,1.0,3,1726013033,2024-09-11 00:03:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdwtgt/devoting_three_months_to_pm_what_should_i_learn/,9,2024
1fdwh3j,"I got a job two months ago, don't hate the work itself but the company itself seems... unstable?","Basically the title. I got a job at small business that does payroll and tax stuff two months ago. So far, I really like the work itself, and I get along pretty well with payroll and withholdings and things like that... but here's the problem.

The business I work at is small, like, family owned business small. There are only two other workers than myself, making us a team of three. The lady who owns the business does not work at the office (and I've not seen her come in once for these two months). Anyways, my coworkers are in their mid-seventies, and the two of them have pretty severe health issues. Since I have started working here, one has been in the hospital twice, while my other coworker had to take a week of leave because of bronchitis. On my third day working there, I was the ***only*** person in the office for a 9 hour shift- and honestly, it was really, really hard, because I'm a new graduate and I don't know how to do a lot of things yet.

And to be honest? I don't think things are going to get better. The people working at this office seem happy they could hire me... and it seems like they have intentions to have me help run this small business, in like a year? But I don't intend to run this small business. I never applied for this job thinking I would be running a small business for an owner I've never met. It would be pure hubris to think I could. Like I said, I'm a dumbass who just graduated from college (I'm serious!)

But I'm afraid if I leave this job, I won't ever be able to get an office job again. I was unemployed for a long time after graduation. I don't want to look like a job hopper.

I work at a company that handles custom products as a production artist. Today a customer called about their order (which shipped a month ago) because the title on one of the items was partly incorrect. We ended up sending a free replacement, costing us around $200.

Looking over the history of the order, I was the only person to work on the design/send it out. Before anything was produced, the customer was also given a draft design to check and approve and my manager usually also checks orders at the end of the day (though this isn't a guarantee). 

My boss (not manager and works remotely from a different state) was angry, which is not surprising. It was a hairbrained mistake that leaves me dumbfounded on what I was thinking a month ago. I feel beyond stupid. I've been here almost a year and yet I feel like I still make so many mistakes. None like this, but its like constantly hitting a wall with minor things here and there. I am constantly second guessing myself and can't stop thinking I am one foot out the door all the time with the boss. 

As an extra sting, he threatened to charge me half of the cost if such an error occurs again. I wish I could find a different job. but my luck has been beyond awful.

1fdutyf,Should I leave construction for being a line cook?,"I (26m) am from Baltimore MD and for the past 3 years I was a foreman at a landscape construction and design company doing plant installs, tree work, fences, decks, patios, ponds, fountains, and retaining walls. Super enjoyable work and everyday was great pretty much. But the owner and my mentor was basically jk simmons from whiplash and drove away everyone but me. I was using my truck to load and unload materials by myself, teaching the new guys, and planning the schedule for the day all for $20/hr, usually hit 30 hours max, no benefits, no gas money. Not to mention the constant verbal and emotional abuse. I left back in May. For the past few years I’ve also been in and out of restaurants and bars and for the past year I’ve been bouncing and bartending at a local bar/tavern.

Since May I have been struggling to find reliable, good paying, and rewarding work. Worked at a fabrication shop for a month doing welding and woodworking but they were late with my second paycheck by a whole month (Making $18/hr). Worked at a national corporation tree place for a few weeks that had mandatory overtime with no enforced lunch break or breaks of any kind and was logging 11 hour days all for $20/hr. And of course, using my truck occasionally for their tools. Then worked at a home renovation/restoration company as an apprentice finish carpenter for $17/hr, late payroll, being forced to use my truck, no benefits, and oddly alot of exposure to lead paint without a heads up that it was lead paint. 

I’ve applied to over 200 jobs off indeed, emailed 50 different construction companies (carpentry, masonry, paint/drywall, and even landscaping), plus went to jobsites around town. Barely any responses back and if there are, they’re saying they aren’t hiring. I’m running out of tread to run on at this point. I’m STARVING to learn a new trade like carpentry especially, I LOVE building things especially outdoors. I’m punctual, never complain (out loud), always bring a positive attitude and also piss clean. But so far all I’ve gotten is low pay, no benefits, and grown ass men yelling at me and copping attitudes. 

So I’m considering becoming a line cook either at the place I work at right now, or starting in the dish pit at a fine dining restaurant. If pay is gonna be about the same at either industry, I’m considering cooking more now because I have noticed in my time in restaurants that the people take themselves a little less seriously, I know I can probably get a line cook job since those seem to be hiring, and I do genuinely enjoy restaurant work but just in a different way. It’s not so much a backup plan as much as just a shifting focus from one passion to another and trying to monetize it. 

I’ve worked since I was 12 years old. Started working summers and school year weekends at the local zoo, a local farm, and a hardware store. Moved on to restaurant work and selling my art and also landscaping myself and handyman shit. Then the place I mentioned above. This genuinely is the first time in my life where I’ve not gotten an interview and walked out of there with a job.

I’m also married btw so while its fine if I am making low pay for a while, its not just me I’m looking out for anymore.

1fdur2a,Should I leave my current job for a $30K pay bump? ,"I’m a Data Analyst who’s been at my current company for almost 2 years now and when I started I had the ability to work fully remote which was perfect for my lifestyle. Fully remote eventually moved to 2-3 days in the office which was still ok as my wife is only in the office 2-3 days as well. So the days she goes in I work from home and the days I work from home she goes in. It worked out perfectly and allows us to share a car which is a huge help for us financially. Wound up getting news that they want us in the office 5 days a week which was going to be a huge burden on our current lifestyle. 

Started applying for new jobs after the news and ended up landing a new job that pays $30K more and allows fully remote work. I know it sounds like a no brainer to leave but aside from the RTO mandate, I really enjoy my job. I want to eventually pivot into data science and I’ve been getting more projects assigned to me within that realm. My manager is great and has always been willing to put me in a position to work on stuff that interests me and will allow me to eventually maneuver into a space that interests me. My team is also really easy going and a pleasure to work with. The only downside is it does take a while to level up and I do feel like I’m being underpaid for the amount of work I do (I’m the only person on the team with data skills). This new job will have a team of data analysts so I feel like the work load will be more spread out and I won’t have to wear so many hats.  I also want to the leave the door open at the this company and potentially come back in the future. I don’t want to burn any bridges by leaving so soon. 

What do you guys think I should do? Should I bail or try to work something out to where I can continue to work from home at least a couple of days a week? If I’m able to negotiate 2 days work from home and $10-15k pay bump, I’d probably stay at my current company.

Despite holding a Digital Media degree and having substantial writing experience, all my remote jobs have been problematic. My first role had a terrible editor who insulted me, prompting me to leave for a better company. However, at this new job, I faced poor pay and demands to work on Christmas, leading to my resignation. An assistant editor position at a major publication was abruptly rescinded in favor of an internal candidate, which was heartbreaking.

Work Experience, 2 years of intern (20 hours per week) doing Junior Linux Administration. I then got a part time helpdesk job as tier 1 and did that for a year and a half (making $18 per hour). I am now currently working as a tier 2 helpdesk tech for a different company (making 60,000 annually on salary) and have been for 7 months. So in total I have about 4 years of IT experience. I also have my associates degree in IT and soon to have my Bachelors degree in Cyber Security. I also have the CompTIA A, N, and S+ certs. I am 23 years old FYI. 

Questions:

1). Am I progressing at a normal, quick, or slow rate? Ultimately I want to be shifting positions and getting raises as quickly as possible. My next jump is a system administrator. Am I ready? Am I not?

2). How much should I be paid based on my experience and qualifications (Currently on Salary Full time at 60,000 annually in Utah)?

3). What roles pay the highest in IT? I am also interested in Cyber Security which is what my Bachelors is going to be in. Should I jump to a entry lebvel cyber role now that I have helpdesk experience or should I gather sys admin experience or network admin experience first?

I imagine I have transferrable skills and I just want to explore a different career path than what’s expected of doctors - which is to sacrifice a ton of your time, youth and health for gratification later on. And while I do appreciate that doctors can make good money and it definitely increases and you get more senior, I feel like my time is my most valuable resource right now, and I want to be experience a different work model. Could a career pivot work for me?",bagladygettingrich,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1726005296,2024-09-10 21:54:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdu1s3/career_pivot_medicine_to_techcorporate/,9,2024
1fdtuno,Feeling stuck,Hello everyone I am 26 years old and I work in the Powerline industry. I bring home around $2k-$3k a week depending on how many hours I work. I make $40 an hour and $140 a per diem. I’m still an apprentice so there’s room to grow but I feel unhappy at my job. I feel like I have more potential doing something else or starting a business. I’m struggling with ideas that could make around what I make now and also something I enjoy. The work is hard but I don’t mind working hard it is mainly the culture and people I meet that make the job miserable. If anyone has a similar experience or advice it would be helpful.

I cannot survive being jobless for 3 years. I hate being jobless, it depresses me. There are TONS of jobs in cities that are a few hours away. I am certain I could find some kind of work there, but then I would have to leave this town or do some weird thing where I sleep at a hotel during the work week and come home on weekends. 

I do not know what to do. There are SOME jobs in my area here and I have applied to all of them, now all I can do is wait… And this waiting is killing me.

1fdtmly,Lost person needs your two cents? ,"I’m a 28 year old woman, living in UK. I graduated and became a film and video editor, had a really good run with it for nearly 10 years.

Then, migraines grew worse and worse staring at a screen, and I intensely wanted to actually live a life rather than watch it happen behind a screen. 
So I quit, went to travel around the world volunteering and living. I actually lived in a ship for 6 months and I sailed between two countries! 

Alas life has a way of slapping you in the face when it’s good. 
I realised I had bipolar, had a bad episode and it entirely altered my thought process.
So, I spend a year in a major low, I have come out of it since May.
I still get episodes but I can manage somewhat.

So, which brings me back to I have no idea what career to pick up. Go to uni, study what? 
I don’t have a brain for mathematics and numbers. I’m really creative but I have learned not to make money of that. I hate sitting behind a desk and I love being on my feet.

I want to advance and do well, but bipolar is well, a very consuming albatross. 
 
With all of this said, what do you think? Please give me some ideas if you can, my soul feels malnourished. And I feel myself becoming lazy and comfortable. Constantly scrolling, socially acceptable form of addiction.

Please, give me your two cents if you can.

1fdrta7,Should I Just Quit?,"Horrible work experiences - need advice
I need to vent. I've been an entertainment journalist for about four years, and it’s been a nightmare. I have a Digital Media degree and years of professional writing experience, all of the jobs I've worked for have been remote. My first full-time role had a terrible editor who insulted me personally, leading me to leave for a better company. There, my new editor demanded I work on Christmas, despite prior agreements, and paid poorly. I resigned. I then had an offer for an assistant editor position at a major publication, but it was rescinded abruptly in favor of a candidate who was already employed there, which was heartbreaking.

I worked briefly at a content farm but had to leave to care for a sick parent. After my parent recovered, I was hired by their sister site but was later let go. I found a great job at another site, but had to leave due to my parent's illness and constant editing revisions. I questioned returning to the field but was rehired by my old job. A few months later, I was let go due to job cuts.

I took a break and was later contacted by a company that liked my resume. Despite initial hesitations, I joined them but was scammed—they promised payment for my work but never followed through.

Alongside these challenging work experiences, I've also faced situations where I was led to believe I had secured a writing position, only to be left without any follow-up. Despite never being told that my writing was lacking, my encounters with difficult bosses and unfortunate circumstances have taken a toll on my self-esteem and left me feeling disheartened.

This pattern of being exploited and misled has left me disillusioned and hesitant to pursue jobs in this field again. Has anyone else experienced this? I feel lost and unsure of what to do next, but I know I can’t avoid seeking work forever and will have to fall back on my other degree.

In addition to this, I’m struggling to find a job in any other field, and no one I know seems able to help me with my job search. What can I do to when I feel like I’m designated to face nothing but more negative work experiences?

If I do a MBA I’d want to be full time and do it in a year. Just wondering if anyone has experience with getting their MBA and if it helped them find a more fulfilling career path?

This job started as an internship that turned to employment. The pay is shit but I was okay with that because I had no real experience other than school and it felt like a good transition from the restaurant industry to office life. 

I’ve been working Monday - Friday at this office job and then at a restaurant as a server on the weekends.  My restaurant job has informed me that I need to work a minimum of three days a week or id be let go within the new year. 

I’m at a point where I’d love to JUST work as a paralegal and completely leave the restaurant but my current position pays awful. We’ve had guest speakers in my classes that have advertised job positions for the state or other private sectors and they would pay nearly double what I’m getting for starting pay.

This is my second racial discrimination complaint at this company and I have only been here for 11 months. I started studying to become an actuary. I was so tired of getting rejected that I lied on a resume to get an entry level position as an adjudicator. This is a $10 pay cut to work from home, I had lied about the year I graduated and where I’m located and I got to round 2 of interviews. I’m feeling bad about lying all of a sudden. I think I would be great for this job and it would give me the relevant experience edge I would need when I finally pass my actuary exams and begin looking for entry level jobs AND I would be able to work from home and use my free time to study.

1fdqqdl,Poor timing has made me feel helpless  ,"
I recently got hired for my first job a few days ago, after submitting an application to this position on Indeed a month ago. Once they did not get back to me within a week (which was what Indeed predicted), I forgot about it and continued my job search, but never closed the application. Since then I have been hired and received Onboarding papers to complete, of which I have two left, so I have not started [paid] training yet. 
Once I do complete these papers though I do not know how soon they will start me with training, and I am anxious for when they schedule me, because to do poor timing I have a wedding and wedding related things to attend to this weekend, and a family vacation next weekend (both planned months ago). In both my interview and application I said I’d prefer weekdays, and the manager at the interview seemed pretty chill about it. The person who has been helping me with my papers and things is someone else though, and I do not know if or when I should let them know I am unavailable. If there is a waiting period between completing my Onboarding papers and starting training then it should be fine, but I dont know if there is. Either way I know it’ll probably look bad on me, but I will find a way to make it up. But until then I dont know what to do.

1fdq9ns,"Discouraged, overthinking my boss's feedback ","I was hired about two months ago to work for a Hospital in my state as a content creator (analyst) for the Decision Support team. I was very honest in my interview about my qualifications and what I was learning in my MS and even showed some of my work done for projects during my MS program during my interviews. I graduated three months ago and worked as an intern for a few months in my last semester and I have some previous work experience (in a very different field) using this one specific application we use here, but I am not an expert (AT ALL)  in this application we use. I had a meeting with my boss this morning and he mentioned:

- I'm slow to deliver my analysis 

- He needs to give me too many insights when I'm using this one application.

  
He mention that his expectation was that I was an ***expert*** but I **NEVER** said or insinuate I was one during my interviews. I was never given any deadlines for any of the analysis I've done so far and when I asked, the answer was ""there's no deadline"". He's very particular on how things need to be presented but there's no set standard so I try to mirror the format of previous analysis done by other analysts and still I'm not even close to what he wants. I ask for help when needed and I agree I need to improve myself, I am already taking some extra trainings that I paid and started last week so can improve my work. 

I don't mind feedbacks, I rather know where I'm failing at a very early stage so I can improve than no feedback at all. We did set new expectations and I have about two months to improve myself ( I've personally set this deadline for myself).  I know I am a good professional, I've won awards and recognition in previous jobs but how to not feel discouraged? How to use this as a fuel to drive my personal and professional improvement? My head is in spiral thinking I'm gonna lose this job and have to leave the country (bc I'm an international)  or that I need to start looking for a new one.

1fdq0nf,"Do I have a weak character or does the company culture really not sound great? Should I leave my current, chill job for this new, higher paying job?","I had an interview today for a project manager position. The interview was immediately off-putting as the room was filled with 10 - 12 other team members sitting in on the conversation and I felt very uncomfortable and nervous. Everyone was also extremely young; the president of the company was 24 years old, maybe 25 at most, and so was most of the staff, which was weird to me.

They were instilling this work ethic of hard work, never having a stagnant moment, and constantly having to put in your best work. It's weird because I don't like having a stagnant and monotonous job, but when they were explaining all of that, it felt very intimidating and was a big turn-off. I do like the idea of being comfy at my job and knowing what to expect, but they want to put me through a rigorous training program to learn all about marketing, HR, and management and squeeze that into 3 months, and then eventually become a manager of operations for other people.

They went on a lot about not having a dull moment, always trying to grow every single day, that the company is a basically family where everyone knows everything about each other, and to succeed in this role, you'll have to put in more than 100% every day.

I'm 23, and I don't really have a lot of experience, so that was really scary to hear. However, I did very well in the interview and handled myself well despite feeling like I needed to throw up during it lol. Basically, they offered me the job from the sounds of it. They said they didn't want to have to wait a week for me to meet all of their criteria and wanted me to do the orientation today. I told them I'll do the orientation tomorrow, but the whole thing felt so rushed and pressured to me. I mean, I guess I already have the job and they'll be introducing me tomorrow.

The hours will start at 10 am and will go to 7 - 7:30, and I think we're also working on Saturdays. The pay is a a lot better than my current job and has a lot of opportunities to make more through bonuses that are commission-based. (Making $3200 a month, and this new job will be about $4000 - $4400)

Feels like I have to be proactive a lot socialize and be on top of things all the time. It sounds weird because those are all good qualities, but their mindset and work culture feel very intimidating to me.

Right now, I'm working a digital marketing office job where I do the same things every day and it's very monotonous and boring. I kinda hate it, but I also kinda love it; I just need some balance is all I think. It's nice because I work independently for the most part, and people just leave me alone. I work probably like 3 - 4 hours a day in the 8 hour work day, so I have a lot of free time to do other things or just chill. So I feel hesitant to leave my current job for something else that would be radically different. But maybe it would be good for me to leave? My gut instinct is that I won't like it, but again, maybe I'm just scared and need to toughen out.

TLDR: Is my character just weak in this situation where all those ""working hard qualities"" feel like a turn-off? Should I just get over myself and go into this job with long hours and rigorous training programs or stay in my current, boring, and chill job and wait for a job that I feel more comfortable going into? I'm not sure if the work qualities are somewhat of a red flag or I simply need to be tougher.

1fdq0ce,Need Advice on Salary Negotiation – New Grad Offer from Aerospace Company,"Hey everyone, I’m seeking advice on negotiating an offer I received from a large aerospace company. I’ve interned with them for the past two years and stayed active throughout the year between the summers. 

Here’s a breakdown of the offer I received:

* **Position**: Software Engineer - Early Career (Level 1)
* **Location**: Bay Area, CA
* **Base Salary**: $103k /year
* **Bonus**: 3% annual incentive based on performance (up to 175% of target)
* **Relocation Package**: $5k lump sum
* **Offer Expiration**: September 24, 2024

# My Background:

* I'm graduating with my BS in computer science in June 2025.  
* I interned for **two years** at this company:
   * **1st year**: AI/ML research project.
   * **2nd year**: Full stack development, where I built a **director-funded full-stack application** from the ground up. 
      * I handled the entire project myself, including things like managing the tech stack, navigating security approvals/meetings, and doing all of the frontend and backend development work myself – tasks typically handled by senior engineers or project managers.
* I’m about to join a team that isn’t directly related to either of my two intern projects but is more aligned with the **full stack work** I did this year.

# My Situation:

* I don’t have any other offers at the moment, but I’m actively applying to companies as positions become available. 
* I was hoping for a higher salary, especially considering the **unique nature of the project I worked on** and the additional responsibilities I took on during my internships (project management, environment setup, etc.).
* I’m unsure if I have enough leverage to negotiate with my **two years of internship experience** or if I should hold off until I have other offers to compare.

Does my two-year internship give me enough leverage to negotiate, or should I try to use the unique nature of my full-stack project as a bargaining chip?

1fdppgn,Started A New Job and I Feel Miserable,"Hi everyone, I'm a 32 male in the UK and I'm not one to make posts about this sort of thing but at the moment I feel I could really use some advice or at least some opinions to try and clear my head and work out what I do. I have worked in the construction industry for around 10 years now however for the last 2 years I have worked a retail job as the amount of stress and incredibly toxic workplace behaviours I had to take daily put me in a place where I had to give up. 

My reputation was always good, I had a strong work ethic and I cant confidently say that I was good at the job, the job just wasn't good for me. 

So for the last 2 years I've worked in a food shop which although has meant less pay and more unsociable hours it obviously came without a lot of the bad experiences I had gone through also and the work was easier and the working environment was better. 

Out of nowhere a few weeks ago I was approached by another building firm and I decided I would give it a go, the background check I did on the company was a lot more positive than what I had previously worked in and of course it meant better pay, better potential career path and back working only week days and no night shifts during the week. I was offered the job and was very excited to get back into it.

Now I have just finished my 2nd day and just like the day before I feel utterly miserable, lost and depressed...... and I know its only the 2nd day but I feel like I want to tear up :(

The last two days I've felt completely overwhelmed as the type of buildings and the systems that this company uses is incredibly advanced and I feel like I'm learning everything all over again and my new co workers seem very unimpressed already that I don't know any of it. 

This has led to me being left out of the days activities and just left to find tasks or work to do on the building site alone. 

The culture there although I cant say there has any bullying from what I've seen so far there is a constant feeling in the offices that I'm not really welcome there, they have no interest in what I do only what I don't do and I cant shake the feeling that after two years away from the industry I don't think I want this career / culture anymore, its not a healthy or happy place to be.

Now I'm in the position where a big part of me wants to go and start finding another job after only the 2nd day,  I have hardly any savings so I can't just leave without finding something else first and my few close members of family are all heavily stressed and some depressed at the moment due to some sad events that have happened over the last 12 months and I know for a fact it would destroy them if they knew that I was miserable, I want out of my new job already and I'm feeling myself getting anxious and worried myself as I am the only one supporting them through their own hard times. 

So what do I do, admit failure and look for another job already even though the job market isn't great if I'm looking for a new career industry,,,,, or stick this job out for a few months and see how it goes (its a good chance to save money but also if I'm feeling this way after 2 days would it get worse in a few weeks / months).

I'm sure everyone says this but I am a hard worker, I know I'm adaptable, I'm a good person and I'm not necessarily looking for anything special or a job that's awesome every single day. I just want a job where I can do some good, work hard, get on with my team and/ or co-workers and earn some money to live and although I thought this new job was finally some good luck coming my way, I feel its another obstacle that I have to overcome but have no idea in my head what I do about it.

A 6-week program with strategies for balancing your calendar and health. You'll get hands-on experience with a software tool designed to help you integrate everything seamlessly.

**Program Outline:**

* **Week 1:** Lifestack Orientation, Subjective Feelings & Sleep
* **Week 2:** Lifestack Energy Boosts, GTD & Food Timing
* **Week 3:** Lifestack Integrations, Pomodoro & Breathing
* **Week 4:** Lifestack Extension, Bullet Journal & Movement
* **Week 5:** Lifestack Web, Distractions, Hobbies & Hydration
* **Week 6:** Lifestack Momentum, Body Doubling & Mindful Eating",mk5140,0,0.5,0,1725993570,2024-09-10 18:39:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdpcto/energy_schedule_health/,9,2024
1fdp6ey,Is it time to call it quits?,"I’ve been with this company for 2.5 years now and haven’t gotten a raise since 2022. They sing my praises, tell me they’re lucky to have me, etc. I’m in customer support so of course we’re judged based on satisfaction ratings and I’m always told I’m well above the benchmark. At one point I was even told I’m over performing and to take fewer support tickets.

Whenever the topic of raises is brought up, I’m told the same thing, we’ll talk to higher ups, we do think you deserve one, we want you happy yadayada. Then that can keeps getting kicked further and further down the road. Meanwhile, people are being hired/promoted in other departments, so money is certainly somewhere.

It’s just annoying because this is a fully remote job; relatively laid back, autonomous, and we all know how hard it can be nowadays to find remote gigs. But at the same time, prices aren’t coming down and I’m effectively making less every year.",Routine-Jello-953,1,1.0,1,1725993124,2024-09-10 18:32:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdp6ey/is_it_time_to_call_it_quits/,9,2024
1fdp5h6,Should I leave my new job after 3 days?,"I (26F) applied for jobs (in the healthcare sector, UK) through a generic recruitment advertisement, which means they will allocate you to a department when a vacancy opens.  After months of waiting to be assigned to one, they finally matched me to one and I said yes because I desperately needed a job. 

I just had my third day at the department and to be honest I am quite disappointed. This post I am in currently is a brand new post at a super low band, there is no job description, so no specific duties. Even the manager and nurses don’t know what I am supposed to be doing. They said they were hoping I could help them figure it out along the way. I feel that someone above them told them they needed to hire someone at my band and they don’t know what for. 

Some of the few “duties” include greeting patients, offering refreshments, keeping the fridge stocked, and maybe updating patient records. But that is all, and so far there have only been 2 or 3 patients. Often times, a patient arrived but the nurses won’t let me participate in the assessments because it’s a “high risk patient”. So, I just end up waiting by myself at the staff room and then just overhearing conversations about how the assessment went. 

I have literally spent these past 3 days just sitting at the staff room reading files and stuff, doing absolutely nothing. In fact, I am writing this reddit post while “on shift” because there really isn’t anything for me to do. At all. I feel incredibly frustrated and useless. I have many skills and knowledge that I cannot apply here due to the nature of the job. Just been here for 3 days and I feel miserable. This is not what I had in mind at all, I feel sad and this job really doesn’t seem to have the potential to get better. 

I am also required to do 8 nights shifts a month, which is something I definitely do NOT want to do at all. Normally it would be a deal breaker for me, but I really need the money right now, so I can’t say no. I would also consider doing night shifts if it was essential for me to be there, if I was truly needed. In this case I am obviously not. So, this is also a huge motivation for me to leave the department. 

And no, I didn’t know about the night shifts when I applied. I didn’t get to choose my department. I did say I had a preference for this and that departments but with no night shifts, they said okay we’ll allocate you to a post that doesn’t require this. But months passed, and no vacancies, or no one would take me (there are other things to consider about my particular situation but that’s for another post). This was the only one that would take me. 

One of the lead nurses did mention that if I wanted to be transferred to a different department I could do it, all I have to do is speak to the manager and see what he can do. But I feel like it’s way too soon for that, 3 days? I don’t want to give the impression that I cannot commit to my job. I feel it’s too soon. I was thinking of 1-3 months at least? What do you think I should do in this situation?

1fdouz9,Any “non-sit-down” jobs for bachelor’s degree holders with a salary of at LEAST 50k with benefits?,"Based in Bergen County, NJ area:

I’m seeking advice on transitioning to a new career. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Family Science and Human Development, specializing in Family Services with a collateral in child advocacy (graduated May 2024), where I maintained a 3.86 GPA and made the Dean’s List every semester.

Currently, I work as a Records Manager at my local building department, handling permit processes, fee processing, and inspections. While this role has been a stepping stone, the sit-down 8 hour desk job and $35k salary don’t align with my long-term career goals or passions.

I have a solid foundation of diverse experiences:

Executive Assistant at the Mayor’s Office: Supported the Mayor and town operations by managing public inquiries, organizing official procurements, and maintaining departmental systems. This role required meticulous attention to detail and strong organizational skills.

Assistant Guidance Counselor Intern at a Middle School: Contributed over 300 hours supporting 240+ students with diverse needs, including creating and modifying IEPs and 504 plans, managing the Real-Time portal for scheduling and attendance, and handling HIB investigations. I also led support groups and collaborated with external organizations. 

School Nurse’s Aid: Conducted health screenings, managed confidential health records, and supported student health and privacy.

Babysitter: Over four years of experience providing personalized care to children, managing daily routines, meal preparations, and responding to emergencies.

I’m looking for a role where I can stay active and work hands-on, with a salary over $50k and benefits.

If anyone has recommendations for careers or opportunities that fit this profile, your insights would be greatly appreciated!

1fdor3u,I think I hate my major,"I study architecture. It's literally only two weeks in and I'm already suffering. I have 9 courses, 13 lessons in total/week, which means I either start really early (8 am) or finish really late (6-7 pm). Thus I have basically no free time, no chance for a free day, and I'm tired most of the time. I can't meet my friends after school because I'm just so exhausted mentally and physically that I go straight home and crash in bed. Out of the 9 courses I have to take I only like one, mathematics, all the others I either hate, don't like, or bores me.  Although the professors are really good, I just can't enjoy the lessons. Not to talk about the huge amount of homeworks and drawings we have to do. I applied for this major because it required creativity, but only after one week of constant drawing I feel like I'm losing passion for it. Most of the time I'm so anxious because of all the school work that I can eat half of what I used to, and completely forget to drink anything, going to school nauseous, lethargic and with a knot in my stomach. I go to uni feeling miserable and come home wanting to cry my hearth out. 
I've been considering dropping out, but I'm afraid because of three reasons:
1) what if I regret it. I've only spent 2 weeks here, so maybe it will become better. But at the same time I'm afraid that if this continues it's gonna cost my mental health. It's already much worse that it used to be, considering the fact that until this point in my life days I've felt sad or anxious were very few. 
2) I don't know what other major I'd do. I chose this because at the time it seemed like an interesting thing to study. I thought that it would make a nice career and I could imagine myself doing it after I tried, but I was not completely sure. Although I researched before applying, it looks like I didn't do a good enough job. But if not this what else? I have no idea. And it truly terrifies me. I'm already 20, 21 by the time I could apply to another uni or major again, and I can't be sure I'd get into the new uni or major I choose, meaning I'd waste another year. 
3) what my parents would say. I'm the first child in the family in 3 generations to go to uni, and not only that but one of the most prestigious ones in my country. They've done so much for me and supported me with everything, buying me all the supplies I need and renting me a flat near the uni. How would they react if I said I hate the very thing I chose before the first month? I don't want to disappoint them. 
I just feel so lost, I really don't know what to do. Any ideas or suggestions? I'm pretty much open to anything at this point.

1fdnuu5,"Bachelor in English: Linguistics, Literatures, and Cultures at University of Saarland.  Worth it as a 25 year old?","I graduated with a bachelor in Law from Brazil, have been working for 2 years earning a comfortable amount for my experience, but I hate it and I hate it here. 

I know no place is perfect and I probably hate my situation more than the country itself, but it’s also true that in Brazil, unless you study Medicine, Law or Engineering/CS, you most definitely won’t have job opportunities that allow you to have a comfortable life, unless you already come from money.

I have European friends and they all just studied what they actually like without any worries (some didn’t even study at all and became DJs, and live just fine) and still have the social security that a “stable” country that care for its citizens can offer. Most of them don’t even notice this privilege. 

Now, I have always truly loved literature and if I were a citizen of these countries (not all European countries, I know, but Germany and Switzerland, where I have friends from, are definitely included), that’s what I would have studied. 

I speak C1 German (studying to get C2) and have been thinking for a while about restarting a bachelor’s in Germany and working there in my future. 

There some master courses in other fields that I would be eligible for with my Law degree, but they’re in very specific fields and there aren’t many options of programs. 

I don’t want to be a lawyer anymore, so I won’t go through the hassle of getting a license in Germany as it’s, justifiably, a very long process.

At first, I considered a bachelor in Industrial Engineering, that was my second option when I graduated high school. I talked to professionals in the field and it’s a job I would enjoy and the opportunities are good and diverse. 

But if I’m being totally honest with myself, Literature is where my heart lies. It’s the only field that actually gets me excited. I was good ‘friends’ with a German literature professor that taught at my university, and looking at his career path, working in so many different countries and with literature, being the literary director of libraries in Luxembourg, that’s a path that I can imagine for myself and that I would like to work for. 

The problem is I’m not a citizen of the EU, which will automatically make everything harder. And I would definitely have to get a PhD in the field, and I’m already 24, so by the time I finish a PhD I would be at least 33-34. 

Another problem is the job opportunities in the field. Many graduates end up working in adjacent fields, and that’s not what I won’t. I’m not sure if spending a decade pursuing something just to eventually work in something else is worth it. 

I know only I can make this decision, but I would like to hear more about people in Germany that know the job market better than I do, and even more so from people in the field of literature in Germany. 

Thank you and sorry for the long text. ",SpecificOk8499,1,1.0,1,1725989947,2024-09-10 17:39:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdnuu5/bachelor_in_english_linguistics_literatures_and/,9,2024
1fdnpjm,How do I ask for extended vacation time or do I just quit?,"For context I'm a retail manager at a small family owned business, and my family is planning a trip to the country we're originally from. It'll be almost 10 years since I've seen my family and I also have some legal matters to take care of while there (dual citizen), so this trip will be very busy. Theres a family event that is cementing the trip in late november/december although i havent bought tickets yet so idk exactly when. 

 I've been at this company for 8 going on 9 years, I've never requested more than a a week off so I'm not sure the best way to discuss this with my boss. 

However last year I got in trouble at work for approving a month long vacation for 2 of my employees. There weren't any issues we were just spread thin for 2 weeks. But my boss made a point that 'ppl can't just take a month off whenever they want, only unemployed people can.' [I'm paraphrasing]

I take that to mean if anyone wants a vacation they should just quit. I have a bit more job security than my employees and my bosses like me and stuff but I'm afraid they'll immediately tell me I can't take the time off right before the holiday season. For the record I'd 100% be back at least a couple weeks before christmas and am willing to come back to work.

- should I beg and grovel for my boss to give me the time off?

- should I turn in my resignation and state the reason being my vacation?

-how far out should people put in their vacation requests?/resignation?

I've been applying to other jobs for a while but haven't found anything yet. 🙃 scared to quit without something to fall back on.

1fdnkze,Handling Competing Offers - Second Opinions Welcomed.,"So recently I found myself laid off and we back out to the market, after a few months of interviews I have received 2 offers. My background is in Engineering and I have around 10 years of experience doing so. I wanted to get some additional buy in and see what others input on the decision to make. 

  
Job A) 142k/year but on an 18 month contract. 4% 401k match, 15 days PTO/Sick. Ok benefits. No relocation costs covered. While I wouldn't be working for a national lab, I would be working at one (think along the lines of particle acceleration equipment). Project runway is on the order of 15+ years so the possibility of renewal is there, along with possibly making the jump to the nation lab itself (which would be pensioned + great benefits) but no guarantee on either. 

  
Job B) 130k/year full time employee for a ""startup"". I say ""startup"" because they technically are but are pretty well funded. 5% 401k match, 20 days PTO/Sick and all 10 federal holidays can be considered floaters. 5k towards relocation. Decent Benefits. This would be for an experimental nuclear fuels/reactor company. 



I guess I am having a hard time valuing the difference in pay versus the contracted position. Both jobs I feel would be pretty cool to work, Job B having a slight edge because my work would be realized quicker since Job A will be in a design phase for another 10+ years, but not a huge deal overall. Job A does have some name recognition in the market, more so than Job B. I have negotiated as much as I could so these are final numbers. How would you value these two offers? What do you think? How would you proceed? Thanks!

Hi all, I have a specific job as a technician. After 7 years I decided to move back to my home country because things at that company, but also the country where I lived were getting out of hand (management/politics making weird decisions because money). I was also happy to be with my friends, my family and ""my own people"" again. I took a month off from work to sell my house, find a new rental apartment (not buying because I wanted to make sure first I could keep my job at the new company, worst I could imagine was getting layed off because the work I provide sucks) and then settle down. 3.5 weeks into my holiday HR called me explaining they were sorry but the company was moving to the other side of the country. I had the choice to move along or resign. I was baffled they even hired me while they knew I had to sell my house and while they knew I couldn't move along again because the distance of my new house is too long to drive daily. In the end I resigned and found another company 1 hour away from my house, which was also too long of a distance to drive every day and that company was also unstable as ****, also not paying wages in time and etc. Again I resigned, all this was happening within a year untill I got recruited to work in another country, again the same job. The wage looked nice, the country as well. Only to hear ONCE AGAIN, after 2 months now, people will be layed off because apparently there's a reorganisation going on. HR told me I am fine because I provide a good job BUT they don't know what will happen in the future.

I am so sick and tired of all the moving. It comes with a bunch of paperwork, cancelling health insurance , find a new one, moving my stuff, selling my stuff, tax paper work, register in your town, tell government you moved out of the country, relationships that break apart, only to be able to pay my bills....I truly love my job as a technician. I growed from nothing to having this job and I am so damn proud of it. But all the misery in these companies are making me depressed and I am sick and tired of fighting to keep my head above water. I feel stressed and depressed. Why are companies treating people like numbers or toys.

1fdlm3y,Should I take the paralegal position? ,"I’ve been working as an intake specialist at a successful personal injury firm for about 9 months now. After a long career in automotive finance, I decided to switch to the legal field and have really taken to it. I’ve excelled in every metric set by the company, even outperforming some 10-year veterans.

Today, my boss pulled me aside and offered me a paralegal position with one of our busiest attorneys. She wanted to extend the offer to me before they start hiring more paralegals. I have a general understanding of what paralegals do in personal injury cases and I’m excited about the opportunity, but I’m also unsure about how to proceed.

I haven’t received a formal offer yet and I have a lot of questions about transitioning from my current role, as well as what specific tasks I’d be handling. I’m open to new opportunities and take pride in advancing my career, but I’m hesitant about whether this is the right move.

My working situation is causing me unhappiness at the moment, and with no one to discuss it with I have arrived here for your advice.

I was working at a large tech reseller as a network and security specialist for about 18 months until recently. I loved working there, it was an amazing job in terms of mental stimulation and responsibility. I was essentially made redundant, and with bills to pay I have ended up working for a cybersecurity vendor in the UK, as a ‘cold caller.’

My job at present is relentless, there is no mental challenge and is mind numbing and monotonous work. It does however pay the bills for now.

The reason for the post is this. No company in the UK is hiring for anything requiring the skills I built at my previous job. With me only being 21 years old, what would your advice be to me moving forward?

My mental state is dire at the moment, so hoping one of you guys could advise.

Is it worth it to move laterally and relocate? If more money, then okay might make sense.

1fdi4de,Changing careers to a recruitment consultant from a food technologist (quarter life crisis 😭),"TLDR: How much can an entry level recruitment consultant make in Australia, with base + commissions. What are the progression opportunities like?


So as the title suggests , I’m wanting to get some opinions from current recruitment consultants (especially in Australia) on whether it’s worth it to change into this career.

For a bit of context, I graduated  university last year with a nutrition degree, and currently work as a research and development technologist in the food industry. The job itself is pretty cool, and we get to work on some cool projects that eventually can end up on the shelves.I’ve only been working this job for about 6 months, but kind of feel like I’m having a quarter life crisis now at almost 24, and have started wanting to switch careers into something with an uncapped earning potential. 

 I’ve come to the realisation that there is no opportunity to earn any additional income in this field. I’m on a fixed salary, and whether we stay late, launch 20 products or 1 product, we still get paid the same, and it’s pretty much unheard of to make commissions in this type of role. 

Idk why it’s been hitting me so hard now only now,  but I’ve finally realised that the only way to get ahead is to work a job that rewards you for how hard you work. 

So over these past few weeks I’ve been spending nearly every night researching what careers I could go into with my current skillset, and stumbled upon recruiting. I know it’s more of a sales role, but I’ve worked sales in the past while I was studying, and honestly didn’t mind it. There’s also a few agencies that specialise in recruiting into the food industry which I think ide have a good chance of getting into 

I know there’s a lot of stigma and mixed feeling about recruiters,so for those of you that have worked in recruitment, do you actually like your jobs? What is the commissions structure like in Aussie recruitment agencies, and what is the typical salary like for new consultants 

Thanks so much!!!

1fdg73h,How to navigate leaving a company after a month in a cover letter?,"I started a new job a month ago, and although it sounded promising and offered great career growth it all a bit of a shit show. 

I worked for an incredible company for 3 years, however I didn’t really enjoy my role and there was no further progression unless I wanted to become a manager. I’d peaked at a senior position at £35K. I have an engineering degree that wasn’t necessary for this job, and felt I could earn more in another position. My manager was super cool (honestly one of the best people I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with) agreed I could secure a better role outside of our company. With many tears and an incredible farewell from this company I started my new journey. 

It’s been hell since I started really. At the end of my first week refreshing emails, my manager apologised for not really being around and that we would meet in two weeks time when he got back from annual leave. 
In the meantime I asked for work, for guidance and to sit in meetings with my colleagues with little progress being made. 
I had a corporate induction day in another city, with the email invite sending me to the office rather than the venue. I was parked next to the venue, walked 20 minutes across the city to the office, only to be sent back to the venue immediately. I was 15 minutes late and the presenter then had the audacity to ask me if I had a difficult journey getting in, in front of everyone. Red in the face I had to explain that the email sent me to the office. A couple of people caught up with me on break explaining they had the same email and their managers had emailed them the night before telling them to go straight to the venue - my manager did not. 

This was almost the last straw for me, but then last week I met with my manager and things felt promising of looking up. I explained my hopes of progressing and explained the rocky start and how that made me feel. He sounded like a took it on board and I hoped there’d be some changes. 

Another new guy started in our team last week, who is about two levels more senior than me. He was already friends with the guy in our team who is also at his level - basically a step below our manager. 
Since he started he’s been invited to all the meetings, taken into meeting rooms for hours at a time to go through all the projects we have and what he’s expected to contribute, given a workload off the bat and expected to hit the ground running. 

I have nothing to work on. I sit there for 8 hours a day refreshing emails and being told to ‘enjoy it’. I am so bored, I don’t understand what’s going on half the time, there was no onboarding or training plan in place for me. The only work I get is the grunt work of updating contact details for projects and now whenever someone has a question about contacts the team are sending them to me - I have no idea. I only got the details that they had already sent me, I was given no additional resources to work from or contacts on who can provide the details, or any information on who the contacts we have actually are. 

This isn’t the opportunity I signed up for and I think I need to cut my losses before I become more miserable. There’s a few opportunities I’ve seen that sound like a much better match, but I don’t know how to address my short time with my current company without raising any red flags. Any advice is appreciated!

The interviews l've done so far were from my own efforts and not recruitment because they were so useless.
I told him this and he justifies it by saying before COVID they let you just walk in this and that.

I feel he keeps giving me outdated advice that just doesn't work anymore as the job market has changed and it's so much more competitive since
COVID.

He keeps saying you are over qualified and experienced he doesn't seem to understand that even with all my experience and achievements, I'm still struggling!

He also advised when you see a job advert, that I should ring and call about the job. Make up some questions on the spot to show you are interested.

He said this made him get a job offer in 2-3 weeks. Again this was a while ago...
Well I tried that and emailing cover letters. They just tell you to apply through their site. Or the hiring manager isn't in. The recruitment sub told me this is a terrible idea as it seems like you are being pushy? 
That recruiters only reach out if like what they see on the CV. Brown nosing them over call will not work.

When I told him I called a recruiter twice as well as physically went in to the place (which isn't nearby), I still didn't get a call! He said you need to push your pride aside and keep being persistent.

However, I'd rather be persistent in my own applications than chasing recruiters that don't bother calling me back after multiple attempts.

I'm annoyed he mentioned it being a pride thing when it is nothing like that. I just don't want to waste my time and effort on something that is pointless. If I cared so much about my pride, I wouldn't be applying for entry level jobs but here I am...

I'm thinking of doing 10 applications a day that are tailored with cover letters and email them the company as well as in the application.

1fde4ul,Weird situation with coworker. Is there anything I could’ve done differently? Why do I crave his attention?,"
Long story short when I joined the company I’m working at this more senior colleague was my buddy to help me adjust.

The moment we met I felt this insane attraction like we were both starring at each other and lightning up when when walking in the same room and feeling a tension. We were following each other on Instagram, liking and casually replying to our stories now and then.

He was a massive help for me, he had extreme patience and understanding a lot of things, navigating the corporate world and advocating for me whenever he could.

I was really shy about it because we never really became friends as he was more senior (the age gap between us was not big - 5 years) and we didn’t have many work projects in common. Weirdly his sympathy for me remained obvious (to me) and I was really thinking that one day we’ll be more then coworkers because I never really felt this connection with someone else before (not even on dates). A few months pass by and I find out something - he is engaged. Yikes.

I think I became a bit more awkward after that but we remained in good terms.

The thing is that we are not friends now, we don’t work together (I moved to a completely different department) he’s married.
He still replies to my stories sometimes and likes my photos but that’s it… I never made myself appear too friendly to him.

I was going through a rough time adjusting to my new departament and I asked him for some advice, he did one 1:1 with me but he never really checked up on me afterwards, never asked me if things got better or anything…

I don’t know why but I feel very bittersweet about him, 3 years layer yes… as I said I never acted in any way and I am respectful to his marriage but I don’t know why I feel like I still crave his presence around me and it made me really sad that he didn’t “feel” for me after asking him for advice.

1fde2g6,I'm desperate and need a better job,"I work online as a Chinese translator (CTL) and I specialize in translating between Chinese and English. I've been studying Chinese for about 4 years, dedicating time every day to practice translation and other aspects of the language. It's my main focus in college anyway.  


I have been working on translation with small scans (Teams that translate Korean manhwas, Japanese manga, and Chinese Manhua)  


Through my work, I have translated hundreds of chapters with care, love, utmost accuracy, and readability. I have gained credibility and trust as most people have acknowledged my translations.  
  
And here comes the problem-- Even though all my series are highly viewed compared to other series, I still only receive a minimum of $2.5 and a maximum of $4 per chapter (each chapter takes 1 to 4 hours max).  
  
  
I don't know about you guys but I find translating Chinese to English, especially in genres like cultivation, incredibly challenging and demanding. It requires exceptional skills, and I feel frustrated that I'm not compensated fairly for this difficult work. I've tried to find better opportunities, but larger scans seem uninterested in translating Manhuas nor have they even tried to have a look at my translations. Couldn't carve my way through freelancing, either. So, is there any way to get a better job? A translation job with higher payrate?


P.S: 1- I am a student, I can only work online so that I don't fail.  
2- I like translating manhuas (literature translation in general) but I don't do it out of hobby, My family's financial situation basically screams ""We're broke"" So yeah, I support them alot with that money, but it ain't enough even if I work myself to the bone.

This is my first job out of college and I was so proud. I'm really worried it's not gong to work out and I'm going to be so embarrassed. I always stay late and I SWEAR I try so hard. 

Any advice would be appreciated please. ",Throwy_throw,24,0.9399999976158142,41,1725957316,2024-09-10 08:35:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fdd132/can_you_recover_from_a_pip/,9,2024

1fdbamh,Hiring Manager Questioning my ability to lead. What to do?,"I had a final interview for a manager position at a large company. The hiring manager has always seemed to like me but is concerned that I don't have a lot of management experience, which is true. I got a lot of behavioral questions from the panel like, ""have you ever managed a difficult person, what did you do, etc"" 

 I come from a small company where everyone has gotten along great. The hiring manager later told me specific that there's currently some issues in the team, such as an employee who doesn't do any work. I think he's afraid that I'll leave like managers in the past who weren't able to deal with it. What I don't understand is why the hiring manager is using this as a strike against me. It doesn't seem fair that I shouldn't get a shot just because another employee is the problem. What did he want me to say, that I'll put them on a PIP and fire them?

1fdb896,"At a crossroads in my career. What shoudl I do, and how should I feel? ","**In a pickle with my career—need advice.**

I work as a technician at a Fortune 500 company and have been developing my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Robotic Process Automation. I hold degrees in Supply Chain Management and Management Information Systems, plus a Business Analytics certificate. I’m also an adjunct professor for an analytics course at my alma mater.

While I've contributed to automation projects that saved time and gained shadowing opportunities with engineers, I still juggle engineering tasks with my technician responsibilities—without additional compensation or a clear path to an engineering promotion. Despite proving my skills, management’s only response has been to ""work harder"" with no tangible career advancement. To make matters worse, a new hire with less relevant experience was brought in as a manufacturing engineer, which has left me feeling frustrated and undervalued.

The company has good internal development programs, and they’ve invested in my growth, but I'm now burnt out and have started doing the bare minimum. I want to move into an engineering or analytical role, but the current job market makes me hesitant to leave. Should I stick it out and hope they notice, or start looking for other opportunities?

1fdb0zt,My boss threatened to fire me.,"So I work at a decent place somewhat close to where I live and recently, my boss threatened to fire me because I showed up late to work on a weekend after three months of not doing so. I was meant to help open with my co-worker, but I unfortunately did not set my alarm the night prior (I drifted off to sleep before doing that) and so I slept in. She also has scheduled me to work mornings on weekends and I am not a morning person at all (she scheduled me to work in the morning on weekends from the get go when I got my job despite knowing I struggle).

My boss has every reason to be upset with that and I wholeheartedly take ownership of my mistake, but she reached the conclusion that she will fire me if it happens again yet I'm not late usually and 98% of the time, I'm on time. I do good work and I have picked up shifts in previous weeks when she has needed me to (which ended up making me lose five days of sleep and yet I still showed up to my job on time). 

The idea that she will fire me if it happens again has been making me sick and actually depressed (like random bouts of suicidal ideation and wanting to punish myself in any way I see fit even after I already have). I haven't even been fired yet, but I literally don't know what to do and the way my mind has been processing this information is just fucked. I've been thinking of resigning because of it, but people around me in my life have been telling me not to and that it's stupid, but I can't seem to push that option out of my mind. It's my first job too and I like my job for the sake that it's peaceful, but also because of it being easy to get to.

However, if there is anything that I can say about my job that I don't like, it's the fact that my boss never talks with me in private. She pretty much said she will fire me in front of customers and my co-workers and oddly enough, when I first started working, she insulted my appearance, but then blamed it on being busy all the time and not thinking.

Anyways, other than that, I need advice on what I should do because I'm lost. Do I resign? Do I let her fire me if I am stupid enough to fuck up again? I have no idea. All I know is that I'm tearing myself to shreds mentally each day because she said she would fire me over a mistake I made that I haven't made in a while.

1fd9m4k,Looking for post grad advice (MBA vs other Masters Programs)?,"Hi Everyone, 

I'm turning to this thread as I'm looking for some career guidance / personal experiences. 

I'm currently 26Y with an undegrad degree from a top Canadian university. I've been working in asset management for the last 4 years and have 2 promotions under my belt, along with the CFA ESG certification (I know this is not saying much, but highlighting it anyways). 

I had planned for myself to write the GRE / GMAT exam this year and apply to US MBA's for the 2025 intake, however, I made a miserable first attempt at the GRE earlier in July. I put in the adequate amount of hours, but I can only imagine that a rather large life event that I'm currently going through was subconsciously dragging me down. Since then, I haven't been able to find the motivation to make a second attempt, and hence closed the door on applying for 2025 MBA's. I figured I would first work on feeling better before I waste time in botching up another attempt. 

However, now, I find myself with a great urge to leave the city I'm in an get a fresh start one way or the other. Given that it's a bit too late to start thinking about 2025 MBA's, are there any good and well respected Master's programs for experienced professionals in the US that I could think about attending instead (that doesn't require a standardized test score)?

I saw some pretty interesting programs from NYU (MS in Business Analytics & AI, MS in Fintech, MS in Quantitative Management)  
  
What do placements from these programs look like?   
Are they worth my time and money?   
Are they recognizable and prestigious enough to help me get ahead in my career?   
  
Or should I really be thinking about sucking it up and making an attempt at enrolling for a 2026 MBA program instead?

I’ve been considering a career change for several months and would appreciate your advice.

While my original role didn’t require a college degree, I’ve since moved into a highly coveted position within the industry that does require one. I have an associate degree and am not particularly interested in returning to school at this time. I do not need to leave my current position, I’m just explaining that I’ve done this in the past. 

I’ve always wanted to transition into finance or banking and am wondering if this is a viable option given my experience and success. I have a connection with a senior contact at a bank who suggested a Business Banking Relationship Manager role, which seems like a great fit. However, I’m unsure about the seriousness of this opportunity.

I’d greatly appreciate any recommendations for positions or companies that might be open to candidates without a bachelor's degree. I’m also open to connecting via direct message for more detailed advice.

1fd6utw,Connection between your play personality and job satisfaction? Jobs for a collector?,"I’m not sure if this is a relevant place to post this but I’ve recently seen a few articles/ videos about the 8 “Play Personalities” classified by the National Institute for Play. I immediately noticed patterns in what I loved as a child, what I do on my free time, and the video games I enjoy. Also noticing I’m not getting any of that same fulfillment from my career…

I have a very strong connection to the collector type:
- Excited to buy new toys as a kid so I could get more of the same for a “set”
- Crafting multiples of similar things (making 50+ beaded keychains for no reason, made tons of duct tape finger snowboards as a kid just to show people)
- Video games where I can fish, catch bugs, forage and then sell- a very satisfying loop
- A favourite video game where you scavenge storage units/ barns for antiques then sell them
- Collecting “achievements” or money in a game as well as real life
- Finding garbage/ items outside to journal with or display
- Finding hidden gems at thrift stores

I am also clearly a creator (sometimes linking to collecting):
- Love having a tangible outcome (preferably a set lol)
- Making keychains, jewelry, collages, clay pieces, painting rocks, journalling
- Crafting, inventing, and making potions as a kid
- The satisfaction of making something yourself rather than buying it

I currently work in a lab with no tangible outcome of my work, or metric of “doing well” and it doesn’t feel fulfilling. 

My question here is what types of jobs would you see fitting for a collector? Something that scratches that foraging instinct? A perspective shift?

I’ve always thought about being self employed- whether that be making products and selling them, finding deals on used items and selling those, or something entirely different. But it feels out of reach. 

Now with my ramble out of the way I’d also love to hear if you see a connection between your play style and your job satisfaction? Share your insight!

I have an offer from a Tier 1 company with great learning opportunities but worse work-life balance, a smaller role, and potentially lower pay. Should I stay, take the Tier 1 job, or keep looking for a Tier 2 opportunity?

----

M32 MCOL

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice from this group. 

I've been at my current company for a while now, and overall, it's been a good experience. The company is well-organized, has a solid product, and my direct manager is fantastic. 

My role gives me a lot of visibility across the business, which has been a big plus.

However, there are some significant downsides. Despite being stable, the company isn't growing, and leadership lacks a clear strategy. Some key leaders actively resist any attempts to drive meaningful change, which has been really frustrating. 

As a result, I'm worried about stagnating if I stay here too long.

Recently, I've been interviewing, and I have a potential offer from a Tier 1 company with a strong brand and massive growth trajectory. 

This opportunity would offer a ton of learning and the chance to see how a successful business operates from the inside. 

On the flip side, the culture is notoriously cutthroat with much longer hours. My new role would also be smaller in scope (managing only one direct report versus several now) and more execution-focused. Plus, the pay is either comparable or slightly less than my current salary.

Here's where I'm stuck:
- Stay in my current role: It’s comfortable and I have a good setup, but I worry about getting stuck without real growth prospects.
- Join the Tier 1 company: I could gain invaluable experience, but at the cost of work-life balance, reduced scope, and potentially lower pay (about $40-$50k). I could maybe negotiate salary to be a bit higher. 
- Keep looking for a Tier 2 company: A middle ground where I might find better growth opportunities without the extreme trade-offs.

What would you do in my position? Has anyone else faced a similar choice?

 I'd love to hear your experiences or any advice you might have on navigating this kind of career crossroads.

1fd642d,"Just moved cross-country, conflicted on what to do now","My wife (30F) and I (33M) moved to Milwaukee from southeastern MA 8 months ago following her accepting an offer at her dream job. Since high school, I've been delivering alcohol (beer for 5 years, liquor/wine for 9), and I enjoyed both of those jobs very much. My last job before the move was a union job with a few great perks; paid just over $100k/yr, 4-day work week (optional 5th), guaranteed daily pay (regardless of hours worked), pension, and fully-paid health insurance.

After taking a few months off, I interviewed at Wisconsin's largest liquor distributor for the same job I held in MA. Interview went very well and I received a job offer. However, even with nearly 15 years of experience, they wouldn't budge on starting pay, and offered me the same pay as someone with zero experience (I only asked for $2/hr over that in the interview). So, feeling slighted, I figured I'd look into the trades and ended up doing a short stint with a chimney masonry company as a tender/apprentice. **Never need to do that again.** That's a job that'll break you down much faster than delivering booze in downtown Boston. 

Hearing the local UA plumber's union had a great benefits/pay package, I figured I'd shoot my shot there, and I was accepted as a ""qualified apprenticeship candidate"" after taking an Accuplacer exam. I sent numerous applications out and called various union shops all around Milwaukee, unfortunately without any bites. My acceptance letter is valid for a year, so I ended up getting a related job at a pipe/plumbing supply company as a delivery driver. So far everyone at the company has been really cool, the pay is decent, benefits aren't too shabby, they paid for my crane operator's certification, and they gave me a higher starting rate based on my truck driving experience. Even sweeter, the job is **much easier** than liquor delivery; like night and day.

So things should be great! Relocated with the woman of my dreams, bought a house together in a nice town outside of the city, and got a (relatively) cakewalk job delivering pipe. A guy should be happy, right?

Well...

I'm not. Not even close. Something just doesn't click with this place and I really can't tell what it is. Not sure if the driver-facing cameras are wearing on me (trust me, they are the worst part of the job), or what. Also, delivering to these union jobsites has given me some insight as to how the apprenticeships typically work; you follow the work, meaning if the job you're working is 100 miles away, you need to suck it up and drive 1.5-2 hours each way to work every day until the job is done and you can **hope** the next one is closer to home. I think if I was 10 years younger and we weren't thinking about starting a family in the near future, I'd consider cutting my teeth and just going for it, but I'm trying to weigh whether it would be worth it or not at this point. My wife has a mandatory 50hr/wk schedule and is going to be the breadwinner no matter what I do, so I'd hate to put more responsibilities on her when she finally does get home by not being there to take care of things.

I just saw a job posting for the DPW in our town, which I know is a decent job with good benefits. It also helps that I could walk to work without a problem if I were to get a job there. Part of me is hesitant, as I only started my current job 3 months ago and I tend to have a guilty conscience about things. 



So, all things considered, here are the options I've come up with:

1. Stay at my current job and hope eventually I find a way to be happy with it

2. Use the experience I gain with this job to get into a plumbing apprenticeship and roll the dice with possible long commute times, but work toward a very valuable skill

3. Start applying at local DPW/city jobs when they come up and move into something like that



**TL;DR Moved with my wife to a very different area, trying to find a new career path that makes me as happy as my old job did.**



I had to vent to a third, unbiased party, my wife has been wonderful about this, but I can't keep dumping it all on her.

1fd2dax,Cybersecurity or Cloud Engineering? Which one should I go for? ,"Thinking of Changing careers, need guidance

Hi there Amazing folks

I am a 25M from Pakistan and have been working in finance sector as an Internal auditor for roughly 3 years now. It started off great and I am making decent money out of it but I have hit my end point with this career. As a financial Auditor here in Pakistan, I often have to report cases of financial corruption and discrepancies to the govt and while it sounds like a Cool job, its really not. Given how morally and politically corrupt my country is, I often get serious threats including but not limited to death threats for simply doing my job well. 

And I just have had enough of all this now. I thought of applying my financial and accounting skills to some other field such as banking and cost management but seriously the jourey had been an eye opening one. There is corruption wherever I ever go in the financial sector and I fear that If I stay any longer in this system, I might just become a part of it. 

I also cant move abroad since I don't have a degree per say and only certifications (I am a Chartered Accountant) and will need to invest atleast 3 years to get done with all the accreditations and licensing to apply abroad. 

So I have decided to switch careers and try my luck in IT sector. But I am at a loss on how and where to begin.

The possibility of AI eventually making me reduntant and jobless in future is a massive comcerm for me so I only wanna go for sectors in IT that would be hard to be replaced or over taken by AI. 

In my limited research I have have found out that following tech fields have a big hiring potential as well as they seem somewhat harder to be overtaken by AI. These are: 

Cloud Engineering 
Cybersecurity 
AI/ML

I personally dont think AI/ML is for me as it might require me to get a full fledged degree to land a decent job in that field and thats not my plan. I wanna go ther certifications and personal projects route.

Leaving me with Cybersecurity and Cloud Engineering. And I just cant decide which one to go for. Both seem to have their merits as well as demerits

Its looks like landing an entry level job in Cybersecurity will be exceptionally hard while on the other hand, Amazon just layed-off around 27000 employees from their AWS platform which sounds really discouraging.

Please help me. Guide me on what should I do and which route should I take? 

My current IT related skills/certs are:

ComptIA A+ 
Good understanding of Python, HTML, and CSS

Note:- If you guys can suggest me some other tech related field that:

● Is somewhat AI proof (i know nothing is AI proof, its a basic tool but you get my point)

● Doesn't require a degree

● Can give me a decent chance of landing a good enough job abroad (EU, North America, Australia)

Then please me, do tell me about it. 


Looking forward to hearing from you guys

I was at the HR department for my work placement and there I met one of my future colleagues (she’s a nurse) and another person who was applying for the same role as me.

It was just a photo of a pink container of juice and there’s a label that said 100% regret and dragon fruit etc.) as my lock screen and the nurse kinda got distant after she saw that, but the guy remained neutral. I’m a healthcare professional and I shouldn’t be this unprofessional. I actually didn’t think that the underlying meaning of this meme would be that deep. I actually thought it was just a fun meme.

1fd0hn6,In a pickle with my career. How should I feel and what should I do?,"In a pickle with my career

Please excuse the long background; I feel that it would provide more context. I will add a TL;DR at the end.

I'm currently in a peculiar spot at work, and I'm unsure of what to do let alone how to feel. I work for a Fortune 500 company as a technician. For the entirety of my time there (I only just hit 2 years, so in the grand scheme, I get it's not too long) I've been developing my skills with Robotic Process Automation, and further enhancing what I studied in school - which was SQL, Python, Tableau, PBI. I double majored in Supply Chain Mgmt & Management Information Systems, and I also received an accredited Business Analytics certificate from my college - having reveived high honors, and I'm currently also an adjunct professor at my alma mater teaching an analytics course. While I'm proud of my accomplishments, I'm also frustrated with how seemingly inept I still seem and with recent hiring practices at work.

I'll start with my ineptitude. While I have completed a small amount of engineering level automation projects that have saved process time for the company, I recognize that engineers have way more opportunities to contribute to projects and I'm not nearly on an adept level with how they apply the same skills I have within the company. However, they don't have to worry about the fires technicians put out day-to-day, and work more, but are also paid more. Because I have voiced my skills to my bosses, they have recognized my other skills separate from my coworkers, yet still expect me to juggle engineering projects with my technician responsibilities with no additional compensation, no shift in responsibilities, and no timeline to a promotion to an engineer (the most they have said is, ""work hard and develop more and only then will we pitch the idea of opening up a spot in our department for a new engineer to our manager"")

Career-wise it hasn't all been bad. I have received job shadowing opportunities with engineers that have lasted 6 months, and time to devote during that shadowing time to projects while supervised. After an interview with another engineering team in our area, they even offered to develop a new shadowing program that involves their entire team and I,  solely focusing on engineering for a few weeks before I go back to my tech responsibilities. I hope afterward this doesn't lead to them expecting me to still contribute at an engineering-level while still being a tech.

Now onto their hiring practices -- absolute ass IMO. I was hired on with peers from college (some not even having the same degrees) but hadn't yet graduated with my degrees. They were hired on as Sr. Techs and I was just hired on as a tech. After graduating, and basically proving my skills to them, I was promoted to a Sr. Tech, which I'm grateful and proud for. However, now, we have an addition to our team that was hired on with just an Econ degree and the same cert I have, and they were hired on as a manufacturing engineer. After having voiced my desire to grow within the company, only to be told to work harder and become a subject matter expert and go-to contact for our area, and only to have someone with less qualifications for this type of engineering role get hired on willy-nilly (I know they don't have the same amount of projects under their belt, and my guess is they'll just train them to get up to speed as an engineer), I'm quite beside myself and extremely frustrated and confused.

While this company paid for my last year of college, has good internal workforce development programs (Coursera licenses, etc), and have seemingly placed a good effort on my skill development, I am mentally bogged down by how they operate.

I have developed (with help from the person I was shadowing) projects that have saved hundreds of hours, led a university engagement project for our area involving my alma mater, and continuously seek skill improvement through courses on Udemy and Coursera, and now I'm burnt tf out that I recently only have been doing the bare minimum and saying no to extra projects for the time being.

I want to progress into an analytical or engineer-type role, and it sucks in this current job market. Do I bite the bullet, suck it up, and say ""that's how corporate America is"", then continue loading more onto my plate and wishfully expect them to notice me? Or do I leave and start looking for other jobs? The latter seems more appealing but I've just heard horror stories of the current job market for tech.

TL;DR Work offering some opportunities for growth, but also oftentimes exploitative in their approach. I've been with this company for 2 years. Should I start looking for other places while acknowledging I have a gap in my skills that is continuing to atrophy in my current role?

1fcyxm9,Started new job last week - is it too soon to apply for another internal position?,"My husband and I relocated for his job last month. I applied for a few jobs at the same organization where he works, and got hired in a role that is fine, but I don't love it and it isn't a super strong fit for my skills and background. I started this role last week. 

Today, a job was posted in the same organization, in a different department, that seems like THE perfect fit for my skills, interest and background. Pretty close to a dream job. I'd love to apply for it, but of course I have a few concerns. I called HR anonymously to ask if they had any policies regarding how long you have to stay in a role before moving to another internal position and there are none. The HR rep who hired me for my current role is also the one hiring for this other role. 

Here are some of my thoughts/concerns:
A) I don't think I would be fired for applying for a new role, but obviously if I don't get it and my current supervisors find out, it would make my work awkward, and maybe impede their trust in me.
B) My partner thinks I should stay in my current role for a year or so, and then if another role like this comes up, I can apply for it then. But I applied to 3-4 roles already in this company, and over those 3-4 months I was applying, I didn't see another role like this.

Is it worth trying for the new role? Are there things I haven't considered? Thanks for your feedback!

1fcyd34,Career Suggestions,"Hey everyone. Looking for a little guidance or suggestions as far as my career goes. I have never really had a specific position in mind that I wanted to attain. I would like to make decent money ($100k + a year), but am not too entirely picky when it comes to the industry. Obviously the lower stress the better. 

I have a a Bachelors degree in Recreation/hospitality administration and am currently about half way through my MBA program. Currently my concentration is in HR management but I’m considering changing the concentration as I hear HR is pretty rough these days. I haven’t started any HR related courses yet in my MBA program so switching wouldn’t be too hard. I’m considering changing to the cybersecurity concentration. However, would I even be able to get a job in cybersecurity with no relevant experience and just an MBA with a concentration?

My work experience consists of a lot of retail management experience. I am currently a store manager of a campus book store. Past experience includes some other big retail names but I don’t want to be in retail any longer. 

Any suggestions on potential careers paths moving forward? Any advice?

1fcxjx3,Engineering - finding my niche,"Mechanical engineer, 5 YOE and a Masters. I’m 2 years into my current company. I was in an active design role up until recently. People got shifted around and I got the short end of the stick, and was told that this is just the way it is. I feel really sidelined and like I’m wasting my potential. It’s time to move on. 

I want to find something where I can excel over the next several years, both technically and personally. I think this requires a jump to a more lucrative industry such as tech or electric vehicles. I don’t find many junior roles offered in these companies. They always seem to be looking for outstanding work experience where someone could walk right into the role, which I haven’t had the opportunity to get. I’ve got some indirect experience through my prior role (design and FEA) along with some academic experience (some thermal analysis).

1fcxg4v,Research software engineer to industry transition,"Hi, I have a theoretical PhD in engineering from one of the SUNY universities and my thesis was related to statistical mechanics. I graduated in 2018 and I wanted to work in FAANG companies as a SWE so I did a postdoc after my PhD in a lesser known academic group to have time to prepare myself for interviews. I was able to solve leetcode medium level problems with practice at that point in time. I am an international with visa issues and on top of that because of covid I had to pick up a research software engineer job in a university down south. The projects I worked on during my RSE role were pretty scattered and I don't think I can showcase strong programming skills with those. I got my green card recently and I am trying to switch to industry but I feel completely lost on how to even prepare as I am eyeing for mid-level roles. I tried talking to people in my circle and the consistent feedback was that my profile was too broad. The projects I worked involved data science work like creating infrastructure to analyze terabytes of data from AWS, and optimizing research groups' codes for performance on HPC clusters, upgrading research codes to be compatible with newer versions of packages, git CI handling, etc. I also need to be Massachusetts based, or completely remote because of family reasons. I feel obsolete and depressed most of the time, I would really appreciate any ideas on how to kick start my job hunt, prep for interviews, and get out of this rut I stuck myself in.

1fcx70u,"Co-worker constantly setting me and other co-worker up for failure, what do we do?","My co-worker (we will call him Marvin) and I started at a company about 7 months ago. Our jobs are to be a clone of our other co-worker (we will call him Adam). Adam has only been with the company for 2 years. 

From the moment we started, we feel Adam has been setting us up for failure. For context we are tech leads.

Here are some examples of things Adam has done:
- withhold important project information until the last minute then claims we should've known all that information already
- dismiss or ignore emails containing questions about project requirements or anything that asks for clarification (even to the point of replying to a completely different email to almost erase our emails from the chain)
- swamp us with mundane busy work with no instructions then tell us we did it wrong 
- email project owners saying Marvin or I will complete a project, we complete the project, Marvin or I tell Adam we will email our results to the project owners, Adam demands we share our results with him, then Adam sends a follow-up email saying we didn't do anything and claims the results are his. 
- CC our boss only on emails where Adam is telling us we did something wrong
- giving us random IT tickets that are outside of company policy and blaming us for the tickets being created
- interrupting us in meetings to tell us we are wrong, even if we arent. Then he re-states what we just said saying his version is correct. These can be meetings with managers and above.
- quiz us on softwares and applications that are outside of our scope or that we haven't been exposed to previously - in front of our manager
- forcing himself into Marvin and my projects and then claims he is leading them now (even if Marvin or I were leading the project beforehand)
-micromange who we talk to, how we send emails, how we speak in meetings, how we spend out time, etc.

Marvin and I have been collecting evidence, which is very easy since Adam likes to leave a paper trail. We want to go to our manager, but we fear that our manager won't actually do anything since any other time Marvin or I have reached out, it gets dismissed or forgotten. Our other co-workers are no help and make matters worse. Most of them are roommates or close friends with Adam. It almost feels to Marvin and I that Adam is leading the department, not our manager, and is on a power trip.

So, what do we do? I fear going to HR since I'm contracted but Marvin is hired on. Should we even talk to our boss about the hostile environment Adam is creating? I've been looking for a new job since I started regardless.

1fcva0z,Is my chem degree worthless?,"Hi, I've been looking to get into getting a job in a lab for the last month. I've applied to about 70 jobs in any industry, with all experience levels and I have had no luck. I just feel surprised that even jobs that have minimum qualifications of a high school diploma won't interview me. They want lab experience, I have some lab experience, but I do have a degree in chemistry which should show that I am capable of being trained in the very least.

I graduated in 2018 and took time to explore other avenues and do internships. In 2020 my life was turned around and I worked in education since I was always a tutor. I loved it and it helped me maintain my chem knowledge and refine my problem solving skills, which I thought would be nice since I always intended on going back to school.

I am just trying to put myself out there again. I'm feeling like no one is going to give me a shot and I'm going to have to go back to school anyway. I've heard that companies who see these years long gaps in work experience don't want to hire you because it makes you look lazy and this is something I never expected to be a problem. I know I am very capable and I'm trying to network with people because I know it's more about who you know than what you know, but wow. Even high school diploma jobs don't want me. I find it to be a little ridiculous that there doesn't seem to be any real entry level work that I can use to build up my resume.

I need some advice. We recently updated our process with accounting revenue in our financial system around a month ago. Last week I messed up part of our financial system because of the new process. This does have some high visibility in the company towards our senior directors and vice presidents. 

My senior director spotted the issue while looking at our financial reports and told me to manually fix the issue. My manager called me on Friday and said that she does have to put this in writing to our whole team but it’s basically aimed at me. The email was highlighting the process and talking about how we need to follow the new process that is in place. 

Advise needed: I am newer in my career (around 3 years of experience in corporate America) and I took steps to do a quick cheat sheet in order to make sure this doesn’t happen again. My question is should I respond to this email (only including my manager not entire team) to highlight the changes I am making to ensure this doesn’t happen again? I want them to know that I am making changes to be more process oriented but I also don’t want to create more attention then it already has.

1fctix6,"22F considering getting my real estate license, but have some questions for those in real estate","I've always toyed with the idea of getting my license.

First, I've talked to a friend in real estate & she said that they start up fees for your own marketing & such is very expensive. I'm wondering is that true for all agencies? Or is that just her experience maybe? 

Secondly, I have bills, so obviously I need an income. So, when I first begin & I'm not selling, does that mean I will have no income? How do I commit to it & give it a real chance without bringing in any income? This is my biggest issue keeping me from going for it. I fear it'll be a waste if I can't give it the attention it needs. I know you can do part-time, but to me, it feels like I wouldn't be giving it enough effort.

It may allow me to work in a foreign country (I'm actually originally from this country and speak the native language) at a small business/healthcare setting where they are trying to build a healthcare business from ground up. I think I'm very lucky but it's also a quite strange opportunity and very unfamiliar to what I was doing before. 

This one pays about 70,000 (about 30% pay cut from my last roles) and I will be wearing different hats as a project manager/operations person. I do think it's very scary because I had never worked in a setting like this before, I will need to refresh my native language to become professional level and obviously prove myself in a new role. I do feel excited about working in a new country because this kind of opportunity rarely comes up for me. The CEO is an extremely nice person and keen on hiring me because he knows me personally. 

The other opportunities are pretty similar and local in the U.S. I frankly am struggling in the job searching process, and am struggling to get interviews in the tech industry. I used to make six figures but this opportunity is becoming more and more attractive to me, as I am eager to find a job and restart my career. I've been job-searching for the past 4-5 months, since coming back from a career break. 

How would you feel about this opportunity? I think I want to stay at this opportunity for at least two years, prove myself, build up some stability and reassess. I feel like I can't be picky right now, all of my other opportunities are from cold applications and have gone nowhere. It's been stressful to just nail down anything.

I'm not sure what I should do next.

I feel like I need more education but for me, I do not feel another degree is the answer. I have 2 and they aren't helping.

Since graduation, I have worked in a hospital call center, as a case manager, teacher, document processor for a medical program.

I am considering getting a trade school certification. Not exactly sure what I should get it in. Maybe radiology, medical coding and billing (could work from home), pharmacy tech. Something...IDK.

I really hate that I'm in my 30's and feel like I'm ""back at the drawing board"" trying to figure out what to do with my life.

In the meantime, Id like another case manager job but I haven't been able to get one. Most of those jobs are hiring for nurse case managers or LMSW.

The MSW program that I just dropped was for 2 years. It consisted of two 400-hour internships. I don't know how I would manage that plus coursework, plus paying for it,(loans? But unemployed) NO JOB, plus working...when I get a job. I was not eligible for accelerated 1-year program, I would have stuck with it if I were.

Hi all, 25M, UK.

I’ve been lucky to work in some pretty cool companies doing some great things, but nothing seems fulfilling. 

This is not me being egotistical, but I’ve ended up at the top at each roles I’ve done and every company has slammed a door shut on promotions, it wasn’t just to me, my peers also weren’t being promoted.

I’ve got some great varied experience, I would love someone to give me advice/life coach me on what to do next, here’s my history:

- (1:1) First Class Masters in Chemistry from 2nd best chemistry school in the UK.

- Part of the ‘COVID year’ when applying for jobs, had 2 dream jobs pulled due to cutting graduate funding and got accepted by an okay FTSE500 tech company. 

- Pre Sales Consultant, moved into Project/Account Management role where my team turned around a dying project to be delivered under budget and under time. 2 years of this being contract out to BAE. Busting 60-70 hour weeks on graduate salary and improved my turnover my 2.4x the person in the role previously. Was doing the financials and saw the person in the role before me was earning 5x my salary, and they wouldn’t even give me a 5k raise to help with cost of living. Left shortly after.

- Sales consultant for SMB, broke their global record two months in a row for most companies starting/restarting trading within my first 4 months there, left after 6 months as they said I would need to be there a year before they consider giving me any learning modules or promotion.

- Tech start up, founding SDR, hitting targets monthly, been here 9 months. Not enjoying wfh and the culture of our founders isn’t great, not relinquishing power and micromanaging.

One thing about all of these roles is it has been constantly boring. I enjoy joining a new company because I have to learn so much so quickly, but after that I am bored out of my mind and I can do most people’s 8 hour days in less than 5 hours (I do still work all 8, but I have to wait for people to catch up).

If anyone can provide a little bit of help on what I should do from here that would be great, I’m happy to globally relocate for work and would change careers too. I feel well rounded from my experience.

1fcrnad,"Negotiating Tips, somewhat forced to accept lower salary offer","For background, I have been at my current job for 6 months. Prior to accepting the position, as a government contractor, I specifically asked how many years were left on the contract and was told there were 3 years remaining. Fast forward to my second day of the job, I learned that the contract was cut short to 6 months and as of 3 weeks ago I am put on unpaid furlough. 

  
I have frantically been applying to jobs for the past few months and finally received an offer. It is a career change so I understand there will most likely be some sort of step backward in terms of pay. However, the salary is significantly lower than my current one (Currently at $98,500 and the offer is for $80,000 which they claim is the ceiling). 

  
I was not in a great spot financially to begin with, which has since worsened without a full paycheck for over a month so I need to accept the job but looking for any tips to help bridge the gap a little to my current number. The company does offer, generally, a 10% yearly bonus. My thoughts would be to ask for that to be converted to a signing bonus and I would like to ask for salary to be renegotiated in 6 months but would love some advice!

1fcrly9,Should i choose IT or finance as a career?,"I am currently 18 years old and will go to university in 2 years (Finland). I am interested in studying computer science or finance, both would probably be studied with the other as a minor subject on the side.

Which path should i pick when taking into consideration that i would finish university in 7 years from now? I am also open to the idea of working in another country. Switzerland would obviously be the dream especially when comparing salaries to Finland.

I am currently studying in a special highschool which will allow me to go straight into computer science. I like what i have been studying but probably not enough to want to do hours of my own unpaid projects in my freetime just to get that first job. Do you think the competetiveness will become less of a problem during the next 5-10 years? Does finance have the same problem?

I have a quick question. Should I negotiate an offer I just got? I got a marketing associate position for 60k/year fully remote + benefits. This is for a consulting firm as a campus marketing associate.

Key info:

* First job out of undergrad

* National average on Indeed and other websites is 66k/year

* I know associates in the past have gotten sign-on bonuses (I didn’t get) + started at 70k (Chicago) and higher 70s (NYC). I would be in North Carolina.

Should I try to negotiate or should I just be happy with what I got and keep it moving? If so, how should I go about it?

1fcqhfo,Burned out and job hopping ,"Writing this a form of therapy, if anything. I'm 34, based in Germany and have been working in IT & Consulting Recruitment for the past 14 years. Looking for opinions on now to proceed as I'm stuck in a bit of a spiral and not sure how to get out of it.

After 5 year stints in 2 different companies (pre pandemic) where I left of my own volition as I'd reached as high as I wanted to go in both of those businesses, I am now at my 3rd employer in 4 years (since 2020) and history keeps repeating itself.

I start a role, have an amazing start to life there, I get a lot of early successes but after 6 months I crash in to a wall whilst I try and juggle the demands of the role, being a good corporate employee and my personal life. Everytime I end up burned out, unfit, drinking and smoking my weekends away, often unable to even think about going to the office on a Monday due to the dread it fills me with. I never get fired and am always seen as a high performer but I end up quitting, swearing I'd take a break to get healthy again. After 2 months out, some exercise, straight living and self TLC later, I take a new job and the cycle begins again. I'm currently at the end of my probation period in my current role  and my boss has told me how pleased he is with my contributions. Unfortunately, I am again at the stage where I feel completely exhausted from the whole thing and am struggling to put a smile on in the interviews and meetings I am conducting and generally, feel totally done in from the whole corporate game.

The problem I have now have is twofold:  there are many expectations I can't deliver on at work as I am exhausted and quite honestly have lost the spark needed to do a good job in the never-sleeping world of Recruitment but if I quit again, my CV has gone from very consistent and solid to very job hoppy and unstable and suddenly, the opportunities available to me become more restricted.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Disclaimer: I know people go down Mines for a living and that being a burned out corporate asskissing millennial is hardly the worst thing in the world.

I got a job offer from a company I interned with this past summer. I enjoyed it, but am unsure if I would want to stay there long term (it's tech consulting lol). I have an undergrad in data analytics and am doing my MBA (will walk in May but take one more class over the summer). I accepted my offer already, it is pretty decent for smaller midwest starting out (high 70s). 

However, my start date is not until late fall. I probably would not be getting my first paycheck until November. I have some things I want to start saving up for like a house, wedding, and honeymoon. My fiance is going to start working in May. 

Some of my current coworkers said I should keep looking for other jobs that could give me similar benefits but start earlier. I just don't know if I will be able to find another job that has similar salary and as good as PTO (20 days, this is really important to me). Anyways, what do you guys think? Should I look around and accept a different offer if it comes along, and rescind my acceptance?

1fcnimz,I Want to Quit Amphetamines – Should I Stop Cold Turkey or Wait?,"Hey everyone, I’m a 21-year-old guy from Europe, and I’ve recently realized I’ve developed a problem with amphetamines (paste form). I’m at a crossroads and could really use some advice on the best way to quit.

For context, I tried cocaine for the first time about four years ago. At first, it was just here and there—sometimes every weekend, sometimes once every couple of months. But at the start of this year, I tried amphetamines, and things have been different.

Initially, I’d take amphetamines once every month and a half, using the excuse that it would help me study. But honestly, I just loved the way it made me feel. I’d go on long binges, staying in my room for days, using until I went through a full 5g. Afterward, I’d return to my normal life without thinking much about it.

But in the last month or two, things have escalated. I’ve been using more often, and for the past four or five days, I’ve been taking it daily—barely sleeping or eating. I don’t even need it to study, but I’m stuck in this cycle now.

The thing is, I have two big exams coming up in 10 days. I know I want to quit for good—there’s no question about that. But I’m scared that if I stop cold turkey right now, the withdrawal symptoms will mess with my ability to focus and prepare for these exams. At the same time, I feel like if I don’t quit now, it’ll be even harder to stop later, and I don’t want this to spiral any further.

So, do I just throw everything I have left in the toilet and stop today? Or should I wait until after the exams, knowing that I *will* quit for good no matter what?

I’m really torn and could use some outside perspective. Thanks for reading.",Bunt1389,0,0.36000001430511475,5,1725882717,2024-09-09 11:51:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fcnimz/i_want_to_quit_amphetamines_should_i_stop_cold/,9,2024

I'm an average person in academics with a deficiency in focus. Something similar to ADHD traits (Never got it tested)

I've accepted my foolishness to not pay attention to my career before. Instead, I travelled and utilised/wasted my time in other activities which were not helpful for my career. 

Q: Ex-MBA courses from IIMs or ISB on the side of building the startup slowly?
Or
Q: Focus on my startup and take the risk of it failing.
Or
Q: Do a Master's in Hospitality Management?

P.s. I sincerely wish to establish my own company, but being from a middle-class family, I have to keep some backup as well in case my startup fails.

1fck4f7,"Career Advice Languages and Linguistics, Italian","Hi, 

I have just completed my undergrad in Languages and Linguistics majoring in Intermediate Italian. 

I am a little lost on where to go from here.  I'm currently deciding between a Masters in Secondary Education so I can teach Italian vs a Master of Translation and/or Interpreting. 

I have been feeling pushed into teaching because it's a reliable consistent income, whereas translation and interpreting can be more sparse. I also fear the impact AI in the future will impact translation and interpreting. 

Can anyone offer any advice, thanks :) ",Irdded,1,1.0,0,1725868616,2024-09-09 07:56:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fck4f7/career_advice_languages_and_linguistics_italian/,9,2024

1fcjtjj,Ironworker looking to change careers/trades while still able-bodied ,"My brother is at a cross roads and I don't know enough about trades to be helpful - and so I come to the collective wisdom of Reddit to find career paths for an ironworker.

He is under 35, works hard, loves having a physically demanding job and takes pride in feeling like he accomplished something at the end of a rough day. No felonies, reads blueprints, done flooring, roofing, general construction, completed schooling for pipe welding and line welding and then went into pre-fab ironworking and recently became a Union Ironworker and likely has other skills that I don't know to mention.

He's never been fired from a jobsite or kicked off a crew, hasnt burned a bridge (that didn't deserve it) and several foremen are still in contact to check in, celebrate successes (and see if they can lure him back). 

My 12 year old son - his nephew - recently passed away in an accident at home. It's had a huge impact on everything, to include my brothers evaluation of his future. 

He doesn't want to stop working hard- but he doesn't want to feel like he's risking his life clipped in at 50-stories. He can do the job - walking iron is fine- we come from a pretty traditional area and he hates the idea that it might be seen as hes ""p*ssying out"" - but he wants to do the job in an environment that isn't so high risk or risks that can be mitigated by his own actions and not dependent on things outside of his control. 

He doesn't want to keep his family worried - he wants a family and to be there for them - he doesn't want three life insurance policies to cover all the most common causes of death. 

So, if you have experience with the industry or any helpful information/advice/suggestions on how to apply existing skillsets into safer applications or what additional skills would beneficial for him to develop. 

Thanks for your help!

1fcizlu,What job do I fit into for my career jump?,"I'm 22 years old. For 3 years, I worked in Sales for tech startups in the US, mostly with companies of fewer than 20 employees, and for the last 2 years, I've been a Marketing Manager at a Swiss Fiduciary with 10 employees.

I'm about to finish my degree in Software, and sadly, I’ll soon have to leave my current company to make a career jump and earn more.

I know how to program, but honestly, I’m not very good at it like other devs. But I deeply understand technology in general.

If I were to become a full-time Software Engineer, I know I’d get frustrated quickly.

I thought about pursuing a career in Data & AI, but again, I don’t see myself writing code and doing analysis all day.

I’m looking for career ideas where I can:

* grow into executive and strategic positions,
* use critical thinking,
* solve problems freely,
* have technological challenges,
* talk to people with interesting businesses,
* and above all, a role where I don't have to go out and sell (traumas from when I was an Outbound Sales Rep).

Any recommendations?

1fcisd0,Career steps - Data Analyst,"I'm dealing with a work dilemma at the moment. I joined one of the larger banks a few months ago as a data analyst. I studied data analytics/statistics in my master's degree and naturally, I've been trying to find myself in that direction. The problem is that my fellow data analysts are more focused on reporting and they don't present their analysis further, they just send the output to the relevant people in the bank who draw their conclusions from it. I'm a bit disappointed about that. Plus, there are almost 10 of us in the department, and the workload of these people during a normal day is not great, as many of the reps are already automated now that the bank has undergone a big transormation. Personally, I have the basics of SQL, which I am trying to continue to learn, I have experience with PowerBI , also econometric software. However, I thought the job would be more interesting... what would you recommend? I am at the beginning of my career and it frustrates me that it has not met my expectations.

1fcf69h,Seeking Advice on Potential Background Check,"Background: So I'm currently unemployed as at the beginning of September. I won't go too into detail, but I was let go from an extremely toxic job that blindsided me with a PIP and let me go just 3 weeks later. There were no performance issues up to that point, the company wasn't performing well and wanted to save money by reducing headcount. I knew I was getting let go regardless of my performance, so I was already applying for jobs to cover my bases.

Good news: I just had an interview last week with the hiring manager of a new potential employer. The interview went really well, and I'll likely have a final interview soon to see if I get the position.

Bad News: Like a dumbass, during the interview, I made it sound like I was still working for my previous company even though I had already been let go at this point. However, when I submitted my resume for this position I was still employed at the previous company. I'm just worried that if I keep up the facade in my next interview that it will inevitably come to light when a background check is done (assuming that I get the role). Since it was so recent, the dates of employment won't be far off, but they would likely notice that I no longer work for my previous company.

**Question**: Should I come forth in the next interview with full honesty and say that I left the company? Should I keep up the facade and pretend that I'm still working there and risk it if they do a background check?

1fcezyt,Just got my first full time job and what do I do from here?,"For context, I’m 21 and I graduated early from university in December of 2023 with a degree in English and promptly started my Masters in Learning Design and Marketing, which I’m still doing part time but should be finished this summer (I’ll be 22 then). I started serious job searching around July and wasn’t getting any solid interviews so when a job that required no education offered me a full time position… I just took it because I began to think my lack of real work experience was hurting me and I was “over educated”. The job essentially has nothing to do with my degree (Employee rotation and data entry) and pays $15.50 an hour and its 100% NOT what I want to do long term. I live with my parents so I’m saving something like 70%-80% of salary so for now it works like I’m getting my masters but I just want to make sure I’m not “wasting” time in a job that may not benefit me. 

What started giving me second thoughts was after I accepted this job, I began to get interviews from jobs that paid better, fit my education, and my career path so with a little “real” experience I could have a better chance at landing these, perhaps? Considering my resume was pretty barren besides one notable internship and several part time student jobs.

Long term, I’m thinking somewhere like six to eight months in I start looking for a job that matches my education level and pays better, would that be reasonable? Is that too short to stay at the job, considering it’s just something low key during my masters? Am I being too overzealous about my career prospects?

1fcd6pn,Healthcare Management Salary and Career Path,"TLDR: I feel overqualified for my current position, my current position does not reflect my duties, and I don't know what options are out there or what I should be making.

Perhaps this is better off in the salary section sub, but I also don't know what my options are for other avenues. I'm a Clinic Manager for a small clinic but a large healthcare system in East Texas. I've gone very quickly from working the front desk to a management position because I have management experience in other industries and have obtained relevant degrees. I have three years of healthcare leadership experience now and have exceptional employee engagement, great NPS scores, and a good rapport with my physicians. 

On top of successfully managing a clinic, I have leveraged my skills to complete several market-wide projects, achieved my Bachelor's in Healthcare Administration and Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Certification, and will soon graduate with an MHA. I also administrate our patient reminder system for our market and report monthly to the COO. I'm in no way, shape, or form complaining about my 60k a year. My salary was calculated before I received my BHA or LSSBBC, and before I started handling the market-wide system. It's more than I've ever seen. But I'm one of three people, including our executive leadership team, to whom everyone in our organization turns for help. 

There are no positions for me to move into that I'm aware of. The people I work the closest with are at the director level and 40k to 60k more. I'm looking at quality director roles at other organizations because I've found that I enjoy diving into the data, thanks to some of the extra projects I've taken on, and I know I can at least break into the 90-120k range. I also don't think there is any room for negotiation at my current location because our corporate team only sees the fact that I have a couple of providers and a dozen staff. Compared to other managers, I'm probably well compensated if managing a clinic my size was my only worry. My last negotiation was last year and had to be done with the COO and CFO, with my boss backing me. I also had a ton of data from MGMA to show that I was making about 15k-20k under the industry standard for my region. 

I know that if I want to earn more, I will need to take on another clinic, which isn't available; I'll need a position created that doesn't exist, or I'll need to look elsewhere for employment.  MGMA puts my salary estimate at 73-89k based on 2021 data, Glass Door says 80-132k  (for my company), and Chat says 75-90k after evaluating my resume and gathering data from my area. Even at the bottom range of the estimates, that's life-changing money for my family. 

  
My CFO says earning a degree or cert doesn't automatically make you worth more money. It's supposed to show you are ready for more responsibilities that will lead to more money. Or, at a minimum, help you qualify for more positions. I've been able to link my degree and cert with recent projects but they make me feel like I don't have a leg to stand on. 

  
All comments are welcome. I'm not sure who else I can have this conversation with. My leadership will talk with me but it will be a conversation I have with the executive team and you better believe I will need to come up with strong evidence for this conversation outside of having new qualifications. They are good people, probably the best leadership team I've worked for, and I know they will take the conversation seriously.

1fcd52r,I’m exhausted and can’t decide on a path to take. What should I do?,"Idk where to begin. I graduated bachelor in health science and I can’t get a job with it. I got over 11 rejections to work as a research assistant. To be clinical research coordinator. I thought about phlebotomy as an entry job but I’m not good with needles I hate it so I can’t do it on people. I thought about MA medical assistant then transition to research assistant but I’m not sure if it will help. I don’t want to pay out of pocket then it won’t help. I thought about nursing or dental hygiene but I can’t do science, I struggle so much. I’m not getting it. I have severe ADD so it’s a struggle. I thought about interior design maybe I’ll do well since there’s no science. But I’m scared that since it’s competitive I won’t get a job, then I wasted another 4 years. Long working hours, late work hours, do work at home. Maybe no work like balance. But that’s what I heard for interior design. Maybe I’m wrong. I’m so scared of any decision that I’ll make at this point. What do you recommend? Or what step to take tell me your experience? Any genuine advice I need it.

1fccmht,Turning in 2 weeks while on vacation ,"Hi! 

I've been in my current role at a library for a little over 3 years now. I was offered a position with another library that pays significantly more and seems like a role I feel really aligned with, and am absolutely interested in taking. They want me to start ASAP. I've negotiated a bit of wiggle room in the start date, and luckily that's being supported by them having not sent me a formal offer / contract to sign. 

However, no matter which way you slice it, I have to give notice for my 2 weeks while I'm away. This sucks as I'm away from Monday-Thursday, which means they only get 6 business days of work from me. I am experiencing tremendous guilt and anxiety over this as I know the department will, frankly, be in shambles upon my departure. I haven't always had a great relationship with my boss, and this summer found out she was telling the other managers that I'd never find a workplace that would treat me better than she did (which another manager familiar with my work thankfully clocked as bullshit and notified me). All this to say, it hasn't always been rainbows, but I'm also grateful for the experience they've given me and feel terrible about providing notice via a phonecall. My boss is most likely to take this personally, despite it being a decision primarily based on growth opportunities and fit.

Are there any tips for navigating this? I am prepared to be terminated immediately if things truly go badly, but given everything I'm responsible for and the fact that the organization would suffer incredibly with an immediate termination, I suspect it's unlikely. Is there any way to make this phone call seem less unprofessional and disrespectful than it already feels? Or am I completely overthinking things?

1fcbyed,Feeling absolutely lost about my academic and professional life (23F),"Hello Reddit. I (23F) am an Agronomic Engineering undergraduate student in Brazil. When I finished high school, I was accepted into a Physics undergraduate degree, but I decided to study one more year because my dream was to study Aerospace Engineering. Three years went by, and I didn't get accepted into this course. I applied for similar courses during this time, like aeronautical Engineering, but I also didn't get accepted. In the last year I applied, I was one position under the last person who was accepted. I was 20, and desperate to start college, so I decided to apply for the same course my sister was studying, and this was how I started agronomic engineering. Three years passed since I started my classes, but my feelings towards this course stayed the same: it's not for me. I tried everything to make myself like it, from research projects in different areas to talking with professionals in this field looking for guidance, and nothing worked. I applied for several exchange programs in an attempt to make my life more interesting, but I failed in everything. 
I feel like I'm always appealing on my second, and third plans, and I'm never doing anything I really want to do. I study full time, I do volunteer work, I give private classes, I work in a laboratory doing a research project and this year I started a small business selling crochet.  From all this, all I got was stress and debt. I'm finishing my third year and I have two more years to finish this course. The biggest problem in changing to another course now is that I feel like I'm wasting my parent's money by doing this, since they are supporting me financially (I don't receive enough money). I looked for other undergraduate options, but I'm afraid everything will happen again. I feel like a big failure. A big and dumb failure. I see my therapist every week and my psychiatrist every month (sometimes 2 times a month) and I'm seeing progress in some areas, but I can't find a way to get out of this hole. I work a lot, but I feel like I never see the results of my work. My self-esteem is negative, and I feel like I'm not enough to achieve the goals I set for myself. Anyway, I really could use some advice now. Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad English.

1fcbuee,"I feel stuck and miserable in my career, what options do I have given my experience? ","I’m 26 years old, married, homeowner in PA, US

So the situation is this. I went to school for HVAC and then also building automation (controls). I received 2 associate degrees (one in each of those fields I mentioned). I worked in commercial HVAC while I went to school at night 

Once I graduated I have been working for a huge controls corporation, if you don’t know what controls is (building automation). It’s basically the programming and commissioning of HVAC/commercial/industrial equipment in commercial buildings.

I have been in my job as a tech in my field for nearly 3 years, and honestly, I hate it. Everyone (outside of work, like my family) knows me as the guy who loathes working. I just can’t stand working with contractors with shit deadlines and going in to work for shit pay. I make around $30 an hour, I could probably move to a company that would at least pay me $40 an hour but even so, I just can’t stand this industry. 

I look at my wife who I’m so blessed to have who works in project management in the healthcare industry and she’s in the process of moving to a job that will pay around $120-$140k a year. I see what she does, and honestly I’m so envious. Work from home is something I’ll never get to experience, and she tells me how much of a help it is for the mental load. She even sees how hard I work and how little I get in return.

I have to commute an hour once a way each day (sometimes 2-3 hours one way). Work my ass off running around putting out fires, and then still get told it’s all shit by our customers, and this isn’t unique to just my job, I’ve talked to other techs and the burnout is so real, everyone gets so tired of this shit. Unfortunately since it’s such a niche field, there’s no union, so that’s out of the picture. If you truly wanna succeed in this field, you need to work 60 hours a week, go home and study this shit, work Saturdays, and honestly I’m not about it, but unfortunately that’s just how the construction industry is, every project is “the most important one in the world”.

My wife understands and is even concerned for me, how miserable I am cause of it all the time and has suggested for me to look elsewhere, but thing is, what can I even do with this experience? I have no bachelors degree so all corporate/office jobs are out of the window? So what can I do? 

I honestly would love a project management role, just not in the construction industry, is that possible without a degree? I just feel so damn stuck. If this is what I have to do for the rest of my life I will, I’ll put my head down and do the work, but I want to at least just not hate it, and right now, I hate it all.

Any advice will be greatly appreciated",KaFeesh,0,0.5,3,1725839316,2024-09-08 23:48:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fcbuee/i_feel_stuck_and_miserable_in_my_career_what/,9,2024
1fcbmtt,Any other Product Managers feel like they’re underpaid?,"L? 

Background: 3 years in IT Project Management, made the shift in my company to product management. Worked 2 years as a product analyst and then in the last year got promoted up to Senior Product Manager. This is all at a Fortune 500 company so lot of bureaucracy. 

I was promoted internally however all my attempts at negotiation led to nothing even though I was point blank told that I’m by far the most qualified person for the job and thus I was given the absolute bottom dollar amount for my role. Market rate as my company deems for my job is 25% higher than my current pay, keep in mind that there is no one else that has my blend of IT, Industry, and knowledge of our product so they had no intention of looking externally. 

Reason my negotiation led nowhere is my director is temporarily in charge of our group due to the original director retiring so he has no incentive to go ask his boss/HR for exceptions when i countered and to pay me reasonably since we’ll soon transition to someone else to manage. 

I brought up the subject of a raise with my leadership but I could tell instantly that they are not going to do anything because they know how messed up the market is so my prospects of leaving are low. I’ve been applying like mad and I know that if I get an offer that they will 100% counter to beat it and keep me, but it’s just been rough trying to find something. The product I manage is $100+ million a year in revenue and rapidly growing, if I leave it will significantly impact our timelines.

Anyone have experience with this kind of situation? I have half a mind of bluffing that I have an offer elsewhere and that I’m leaving but I’ve never done that before and feel like they would demand proof of the external offer so that they can beat it. 

My approach thus far is I’ve kind of mentally checked out. I’m taking my vacation days, cut back on working after hours, redirecting people to others for asks that are not my core responsibility (product support for example). In the meantime with this additional time and energy I’ve been upskilling and applying elsewhere because I don’t see how I could get my comp raised within my company.

1fc8xn0,Better job or location," 



Hey guys, I got a question for y'all - looking for some advice. Would really appreciate any. 

I was recently laid off and just got two job offers on the same day, but not sure which one to take. I'm 30, single, no kids, and just got my masters degree (MBA). I currently live in a small town in southern Minnesota near my parents. All my friends from HS & college have moved to various parts of the country, and my ex gf and I just broke up. No real reason to stay in this area besides older parents. I also got into some trouble 6 years ago (bar fight - acting in self defense). So I lost some friends as well and looking for a fresh start.

Job 1: Director of development and communications for the MN PBS. Great job and good for my resume and future. Its about 4 hrs north MN from my current location. Downsides are the pay is not great (non profit) and the job/apartment would be in the middle of nowhere MN (10-20k people). Also hours away from any major city. So job is great but location sucks.

Job 2: marketing specialist job in aspen Colorado for a luxury real estate company. I love the location and grew up snowboarding/hiking/etc. With the cost of living, the pay is the same as job #1 (little to no savings for each job). I love the location and more to do in my free time, but the job isn't as good. 

Essentially I'm choosing the better job but worse location, or better location but worse job. What would y'all do? I really appreciate any feedback",AMP8156,1,1.0,1,1725831208,2024-09-08 21:33:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fc8xn0/better_job_or_location/,9,2024

1fc8kzw,"How to get the engeneer I work with, to understand that without soft skills, he is making everything harder than it should be.","
First this is a bit of a mess, English is not my first language and it's a bit of a rant.

Technical drafter with 20 years experience. In those years, I've taught new drafter how to become good drafters. I've developed my knowledge not only as a drafter but also in other skills that goes towards teaching and managing. I've been the person they sent to learn from different technicians or engineers and be the middle man between those people because those 2 groups had such big egos that they couldn't stand each other. I am good with people.

About 6 months ago I changed firm and I am now working with only one engeneer, learning about steel structures buildings, it's a learning curve because my experience was in telecom. I love to learn new things, it stimulate mind. The problem is the engeneer has no soft skills knowledge and since he needs to teach me and has no idea that he doesn't know what he doesn't know, he makes everything 10x harder and he think I am not good at my job. 


 I try my best to do a good job, but if he doesn't communicate effectively with me and I end up doing the job wrong well he get pissed off at me. I am very patient, take fault when I really did something stupid (it happens, I am human) , never ever make him feel bad if he makes me change things 10 times in a row because he changed his mind for example. 

As an aparté I want to add here that he is an amazing engineer! He knows his stuff! The company I work for right now is great! I would be sad to resign from this job. 

I have 3 major problems I want to talk with RH. 

1-He has no idea how to be a good teacher and approach everything from an engeneer perspective 

2-He treat me as his employee rather than his colleague 

3-He want and need someone that can be independent in their work but doesn't understand that I need the tools and time to become what he needs.

The reason why I want to talk with RH now is because obviously we developed a cycle of....


Engeneer give incomplete information -> drafter does the job wrong -> pissed off engeneer -> stressed out drafter -> engeneer that give a list of everything done wrong -> drafter that is frustrated because she doesn't get what she needs from the teacher/ manager-> engeneer that doesn't know he needs to develop his skills as a teacher/ manager


Put in that circle a crying drafter and an engeneer that think it means she is not open to receiving feedback. 

It's a mess, but it's a mess that I have the knowledge/emotional intelligence to know what are the possible solutions. Also, seeing as the engeneer and company end goal is to eventually create an engineering team, it will never happen until those soft skills are part of the team. 

How to you take someone with a huge ego and tell them they really learn a thing or 2 because they suck at it? How do you bring this information to higher ups in a constructive way?

1fc81p5,Looking for advice on a promotion,"Hello,

I’ve been working at a senior care facility for about half a year now, initially hired as a housekeeper. I quickly demonstrated my abilities and became known as the best housekeeper in the entire facility, which led to me becoming certified as a caretaker. During this time, I’ve been performing multiple roles, but my pay hasn’t changed – I’m still earning minimum wage.

Over time, I’ve gained a deep knowledge of how the facility functions – from resident relations, maintenance, housekeeping, nursing, and even administrative work to an extent. I’ve also become one of the residents’ and staff’s favorite team members because of how I go above and beyond in my work. Whether it’s taking care of difficult tasks, like cleaning residents’ rooms in very poor conditions, or stepping in to support coworkers, residents, and even their pets, I’ve been doing a lot more than what was initially in my original job description.

I’ve had several execs make it clear to me that my efforts and care is seen and deeply appreciated across the board, but I haven’t seen any change in title or pay. Meanwhile, other employees are often on their phones cruising through every shift without a care. I’m actively going out of my way to learn and help out wherever I can, whether I’m attending to meals for dementia patients, being an unofficial therapist to residents, fixing tvs or furniture, caring for resident pets, hosting events, etc. My contributions far exceed my job description.

I’m at a point where I want to move up in the facility. I’m interested in quite a few potential roles and many of them are drastically higher up than a housekeeper. I have a good relationship with the leadership team, but I don’t want to come off as arrogant when I make my case for a promotion and fair compensation.

How should I approach this conversation without sounding overly boastful, but still communicate the value I bring?

1fc72v9,Nurse Practitioner Internal Transfer- go back to old job?,"Hi There,
I am a nurse practitioner. I had a previous job that was M-F 9-5 which felt not challenging, the hours were great, no weekends, no holidays, no nights. After being in the role for about 6 months I internally transferred to a new position that was inpatient, hospital based. 4, 10 hour shift, 1 week a month, 1 summer/winter holiday. The new schedule is not terrible compared to what my class mates do when they work inpatient, and this new job is definitely more challenging and interesting. 
I have been at this new role for about 2 weeks now and over the past 3 weeks my personal life with my family has gone to absolute shit. I had a family member diagnosed with a health condition that requires a lot of assistance from me as well as another family member who only has a few years left with us. I am regretting taking on this new role. I feel I have a hard time focusing and learning the new role and I also feel like my schedule is complete shit and I’m struggling managing my family responsibilities. 
I am regretting the transfer, I had something with a good schedule and now everything is in shambles. I want to go back to my old role. Although it wasn’t as challenging, I know the job, my hours are phenomenal and I will get to spend whatever weekends and holidays I have left with my sick family member. 
I am worried on how to proceed with this. I got a lot of shit from HR initially for transferring prior to being with the institution for a year and now I am requesting to go back. I am willing to provide doctors notes for validation as well as signing a contract. Hopefully they can understand since I work in healthcare and this is something we see everyday (people’s lives flipped upside down in a matter of a day).

m feeling a bit lost. I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from a top school, but I’m unsure what the best career path would be for me. How many years would it typically take to become a manager? And what does it feel like to be a manager?

I enjoy entrepreneurship, connecting people, and creating an impact. However, I’m worried that in a company, the scope may be too narrow and that there may be too much politics. I’ve tried working on side projects and leading a small team, but I feel like after spending so much time doing tech and research, I’m lacking in skills like making business plans and identifying markets. I’m exploring how to validate my startup ideas in the most cost-effective way, but I feel like my progress is slow and I’m hitting roadblocks.

Would it be better to join a smaller company? Or should I consider pursuing an MBA part-time, which would allow me to find a suitable co-founder and develop business sense? I’m concerned that an MBA might not teach me truly practical knowledge, since business experience is key. Would it be better to pursue a PhD in a specific domain, as this could help me gain deep knowledge of a field and make me a better entrepreneur by understanding the progress in that direction, while also keeping the option of becoming a professor open? Because currently I’m passionate about AI in healthcare where academia and hospitals should have a strong connection.

In short, after earning a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in CS and working as an applied researcher 1 YoE at a big tech company, if my ultimate goal is to become a CEO and build a successful business, should I continue to climb the corporate ladder, pursue an MBA, a PhD, or just dive into entrepreneurship? I want to make a long-term investment in building the necessary skills and networks for this goal, but right now I don’t feel like I have a clear startup idea that I’m passionate about.

1fc6ula,How do I convince my boss I'm not being paid enough to move to NYC,"Currently I'm at a job that pays me 25 an hour in upstate NY, but most of our business comes from Brooklyn and surrounding areas. Because of this my boss informed me that he'd like me to move with the business to the city as I'm the only other employee aside from him. This offer was given with a wage increase to 27 an hour and a stipend of 2000 dollars.

As much as I want to move to the city for this job as I love it, I find it difficult to see myself doing so on the wage he is providing. He says that it should be more than enough to move and it is all he can afford currently (wage will increase as business grows) but I'm feeling uneasy about it. 

I've tried finding places to live but most want your income to be 40× what the rent is meaning I'm limited as to what apartments I can afford ($1200 max following that equation). Even with roommates finding a place that cheap is a struggle and I have 2 cats limiting me even further.

Family and friends think I should be paid more as I do all of the physical work making products for the business and have done a lot to get the business to where it is now. 

I guess my question is, is 27 an hour and a 2000 dollar bonus enough for a move to the city? What should I do to convince my boss otherwise?

1fc6d2i,what to do ,"I’ve been exploring various career paths and recently decided to go back to school to earn my high school diploma, followed by pursuing a computer science degree. I’ve had a range of experiences, including working at a mechanic shop, selling cars, and trying drop shipping and Amazon wholesaling, but none of these ventures have worked out as hoped.

I’m 25 now and am considering whether to continue with my plan for the computer science degree or to switch paths based on a suggestion from a friend. They recommended that I consider enrolling in a body work program at Renton Technical College, where the body shop degree might be available at no cost.

Given my background and current situation, could you provide detailed advice on whether I should pursue the computer science degree or opt for the body work program?

1fc59ok,Girlfriend gets no PTO and can’t take unpaid time off… Is this normal?? ,"First off, sorry if this isn’t the right thread to post this question. If anyone has any other recs, please lmk!

Hi everyone, my (22F) girlfriend (22F) works for the Louisiana state government. She just started working about one month ago, and it’s a M-F 8am-5pm job. She is paid hourly, less than $20… and gets zero PTO. 

She actually has to earn PTO by working on the weekends, but weekend time is never guaranteed. One time she did work on a Saturday and was promised a full 8 hour day, but was sent home after 3 hours because they finished their work.

I’m just very frustrated. I’m a graduate student, so my weekdays are pretty full but I have plenty of time for trips during school breaks still. I asked if I could start planning a trip for January or March, and she is saying she won’t be able to get off of work. I told her she should talk to her boss and see if they can work something out so she can take a proper vacation after working for 6 months straight, but she keeps telling me that “I don’t get the situation” and that it’s very bad to take unpaid leave and she’d likely be fired. But there’s absolutely no guarantee of PTO, and she can’t request time off like a normal hourly retail / restaurant job ya know? 

I just don’t see how this is sustainable for anyone. This isn’t her “forever” job but it stresses her out and she just doesn’t want to be unemployed again. I just want to go on trips because we’re young and I DO have time to spare right now.

I’m sure she’s frustrated with me too because I don’t fully understand / have more free time than her… but has anyone heard of a job like this? Do you have any advice??

Thanks!",Jbeagle1,47,0.7900000214576721,70,1725821778,2024-09-08 18:56:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fc59ok/girlfriend_gets_no_pto_and_cant_take_unpaid_time/,9,2024
1fc4lz1,Ideas on how to frame a request for internal reference on LinkedIn?,"Situation: upon the end of my working student contract at my last company (just graduated), I was not incorporated full time due to financial troubles (despite my project managers having insisted on it due to my good performance). Now, due to various reasons, I am intensely targeting a company at which four alumni of my previous company are currently working.

Now, I haven't connected yet with any of these contacts on LinkedIn, nor do I personally know them (some worked at my last company at the same time as me but in other department, others until right before I incorporated, one worked longer that ten years ago). I have at least one close contact in common with each of them. None seems to work directly at the department where the role I am targeting is, but there might still be an internal referral program. 

Therefore, I want to take the best approach at connecting with them and getting them to refer me to the role. Taking into account the limited number of characters of LinkedIn Connection Requests, which approach would you take? Which specific wording? A rather generic connection request first and a longer message to ask for the reference thereafter? Directly mentioning that I want to request a reference from them in the connection request?

1fc46uv,How to get over imposter syndrome?,"I think I have imposter syndrome and it sometimes messes with my confidence at work. For a little back ground, I’m 26M and I do sales at a b2b funding company. I got really really lucky and promoted very fast. I started when I was 23 as an SDR doing cold calls for the tenured reps trying to create leads. I did really well at that as it came easy to me. I won rookie of the year. 

Then as my first year at my company came to an end, one of the tenured reps left. They gave me a promotion and 25% of his territory which was two states (small sales team). I was really grateful. Months later one of my mentors, someone on our sales team who took me under their wing, passed away. They taught me everything I know. Included me on important calls and brought me on deals. It was a big blow to us. And just like that I was promoted to a senior rep by 25. I now oversee 6 states. In my first full year as a senior rep I hit 130% of my sales goal. 

Here’s the part where the imposter syndrome comes in. I am so grateful to be in my position. I couldn’t ask for a better career. But I am aware a lot of it has come from being at the right place at the right time. That goes through my mind often on big meetings. If we have a deal large enough, we have to present it in front of executives for approval. And while I present I can’t help but get nervous wondering if all these successful, decorated C Suite and other executives think, “Why is this dumb kid presenting to us?” I try to shake it but it truly makes me so nervous and I don’t perform to the fullest extent. Additionally, I am always the youngest at conferences and different events. The same thoughts go through my head when trying to network and shake hands. I feel like maybe I’m not taken seriously or I don’t belong. 

For anybody who’s dealt with something similar, how did you fix your mindset? Does it just come with time and more experience? Is there anything I can work on to get over this?

I currently work as one of the Directors at a company and might need to start reconsidering if this was a good move. I came out of a masters in international business not too long ago and landed this really well paid director job at an educational institute. I have a real estate license and a personal training license which I’ve been using the last year to leverage my business. Of course, like any business, its tough the first year but things are starting to pick up as I’ve always been entrepreneurial. Simultaneously i started this director role about 3 months ago and because its the education field, i joined in the summer and there wasnt much work to do except strategic planning which we have been doing as a team.  Problem is… things moved fast the last few weeks at this job and suddenly i get the talk from my manager and her managers manager that im not a “director role” and havent done “director” stuff and started using directors who have been part of the company longer  as examples of directors even though i havent had the chance to prove myself. Its unfortunate because back during my interview, the managers manager even said she would be willing to coach and train due to my inexperience in a director role and having come out of a masters.. . 

Now I’m thinking… is this worth it? Should I look into my domain - international business and seeing how to combine it with my entrepeneurial real estate work? My mind is spinning because I feel shocked and somewhat betrayed because now they are wanting to put me on a level setting plan and if it doesnt work out, we part ways. It just seems weird.

1fc1v64,Two Great Career Options ,"Hi all,

I am torn between two careers.

I am 26. I have a secure life with finances due to working hard from age 17 though till 25 before taking a year out to study the school I missed by leaving early. Additionally on top of this, when my grandparents passed I was left a sum of money which I used to invest into the future and has worked well. So in this regard I am very fortunate. I am telling you this so it’s accounted for in the responses.

Option A: enlist as an Army Officer (UK) and do this for a certain degree of time. 

I opted to join the Royal Marines straight out of school and selection they discovered an underlying injury and I was advise to leave and seek medical attention before reapplying in a minimum of a year. I did exactly this and it took 18 months to get through it but during that time playing rugby I broke a bone and I was not allowed to join within a year of the breakage… life moved on. I carried on in the job I was doing as I was progressing and then life took over and that removed that option. 

I then purchased my first house and renovated with the money left to me which paid off and by age 24 I realised I was in a job I just ended up in. So I left to study my a level that I didn’t do to allow me to go to Sandhurst. I have now got these and can apply.

However this opened up new opportunities for me as I never thought I could do other jobs as I didn’t think I had the ‘brains’ for them.

I have subsequently gotten into my second career option, B - Become and airline pilot.

I have been completing my ppl course at the moment and I love every minute of it and I can see myself doing it for the long-haul (pardon the pun).

I know it’s a lot of hotels and away from home but either of option A or B entail that and frankly it doesn’t bother me in the slightest. 

So, option A go t Sandhurst or Option B airline pilot.

Pros and cons for A - all paid for, lots of travel, regimented lifestyle and a good career.
Cons - away from home for extended duration. Military lifestyle. 

I used to see the military as long term when I was  young naive 16 year old but now I do not see it long term as it will become more offices based after 4 years and passing through staff college. However it has also been in my mind - whether it’s cause it just seemed like something I could do as I didn’t believe in myself or not I don’t know.

Option b pros - interesting lifestyle, well paid eventually, something I enjoy doing. Find it riveting. Have spoken to countless pilots who said they felt exactly as I did during their initial training and they still have that same smile when they fly 25 years later.

Cons- expensive to complete but I should be able to make it work. Irregular hours/ hard to predict where I’ll be and the times. 

A thought I have is to join the airlines and to become a reserve officer. 

Therefore, I can effectively do both.

In writing this, I somewhat conclude that being and airline pilot and a reservist is the best option if I do not see the army as long term.  I do not wish to exist the military and have to start somewhere again from scratch.

I  am open to all ideas and suggestions, I would just like some impartial advice from people who do not know me.

TLDR: split between army officer and an airline pilot. 26 years old based in the Uk.",Ok_Actuator5425,1,1.0,0,1725812997,2024-09-08 16:29:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fc1v64/two_great_career_options/,9,2024

Now may parents and I have started to think about future such as masters (or no masters). Just for a background, my dad has an electrical paneI manufacturing business. I personally, don’t wanna do masters and I’m hoping to join and learn the business. But it has been a dream of my dad for his son to do masters as he didn’t have the financial means to. And I kinda feel bad saying no, saying that, even if I were to do masters, I’m never gonna do masters in cs as I I’m struggling with it a lot and sitting down for hours on a computer and coding is not something I wanna do or enjoy.

Now for the part I need advice in, Im actually in two minds. Part of me says that I should do a masters in electrical engineering so that I can take over the business from my dad. Part of me says that I should do a masters in something related to business so I can handle the business side of things as I can still learn the electrical aspect of the business as my dad will be mentoring me. 

Now I have been stuck on these two options for long and also me thinking about doing a masters in electrical engineering is something easier said than done.

1fc0hag,Did I make a mistake transitioning from the field to the office? (29/M),"Greetings Everyone! 

Two months ago I was offered a new role within the organization that would see myself moving from the field to the office. I accepted the offer in the heat of the moment and now I can't help but feel ""buyer's remorse"". I can't seem to shake this feeling in order to clear my thoughts and think about things logically. Accepting this role has also required me to locate from a MCOL to HCOL city.

I am living in Canada and have been working in the oilfields since 2017. I came from humble beginnings and worked my butt off and now I have managed to save $550,000. My current job rotation is 14 days on and 14 days off. I earn around $200,000+ a year depending on how much I want to work. 

The major pros for working in the field are: 

- Two weeks off every month to travel 
- Flexible schedule 
- Money and extra for savings 
- Work doesn't come home during my time off 

The major cons for working in the field are: 

- Away from home two weeks every month 
- Potential to work more if company is busy 
- Being outdoors for 12 hour shifts in all conditions 
- Not being able to commit to sports clubs 
- No more progression 

I have never worked in an office setting before as I have only worked in the oilfields. 

The major pros for working in the office are:

- Home every night and no more night shifts
- Away from the harsh elements 
- Being able to join sports club 
- Potential to learn a new skills and contacts 
- Home with partner

The major cons for working in the office are: 

- 50% pay reduction 
- Less savings
- Expensive city to live in 
- Potential for more stress and work comes home
- Monday to Friday so less consecutive time off for travel 

I feel so stuck and afraid that I have made the wrong choice, but at the same time opportunities to move from the field to the head office do not happen often. 

Has anyone ever transitioned from the oilfield to the office? Any thoughts, advice, and words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

1fc081l,Career Change Advice: From Aerospace Engineering to Software/Electrical?,"Hi everyone,

I just graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering, but I’ve been having a bit of a career dilemma lately. I did a couple of internships, but they were mostly related to the rail industry (Canada is not exactly booming with aerospace jobs…). I’m based in Toronto, and I’m finding it hard to break into the aerospace industry here. It seems like there are more opportunities in the U.S., but it’s tough getting there.

So, I’ve been thinking of switching fields entirely and pursuing a master’s in electrical engineering or software (specifically AI or embedded systems). I’ve always had a strong interest in tech, and I feel like making the switch might open up more job prospects and lead to something I enjoy in the long run.

Has anyone here made a similar switch or know someone who has? Is it realistic to make this kind of transition, and is it worth it? I’m also trying to get an idea of what kinds of jobs I could land with this background, whether the master’s degree is necessary, or if I could break into these fields without one.

If I decide to make this change by doing a masters what kind of skills should I start learning to put myself in a better position later

I’d really appreciate any advice, resources, or experiences you can share. This career shift feels a bit intimidating, so any help would be awesome!

1fbzqgf,The person I hate most just got hired at my company,"I started at this job as a manager last year, and I absolutely love it here. I’ve been thriving, and I can really see myself progressing up the ladder long-term. It’s the kind of place where I feel like I finally found my footing, and the team I work with has been amazing. But today, I got news that has totally thrown me off balance.

It was just announced that my childhood bully is being hired as a manager in another department. When I say ""bully,"" I mean she made my life a living hell growing up. From middle school through high school, she was relentless—spreading rumors, mocking me in front of others, and making sure I always felt like an outsider. She caused me so much emotional damage, and I’ve spent years trying to heal from it.

Now, just when I’m in a place where I finally feel secure and happy, she’s about to walk into my professional life. I’m devastated. I can’t even begin to fathom having to work with her and pretend everything is okay. The thought of seeing her every day, having to interact with her, or even just running into her in the break room makes my stomach turn.

I’m trying to figure out how to deal with this. Should I talk to HR about my concerns? But what can they really do? She hasn’t even started yet, and I don’t want to come across as unprofessional or like I’m holding onto old grudges. On the other hand, I also don’t want to be in a situation where I’m constantly on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

I’ve worked so hard to move on from the past, but this feels like it’s dragging me right back into it. How can I navigate this without compromising my mental health or my job? Has anyone else dealt with something like this before?

And honestly, I wish there was something I could use to be able to save my interactions with her to make sure I’m protected. I’m worried she might try to twist things or bring back that manipulative behavior she was so good at in school. Any advice on how to protect myself and handle this situation would be greatly appreciated.",More-Ant6529,141,0.7799999713897705,119,1725807489,2024-09-08 14:58:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbzqgf/the_person_i_hate_most_just_got_hired_at_my/,9,2024
1fbz862,Work is home,"Hey guys! So I am looking for some advice. I am in a position.I have never been in before. This month will make 3 years I've been in Florida. I moved here with my infant, escaping a very bad DV situation. With that said, I have no friends or family here.I knew absolutely no one when coming here. When I got here, I moved into a hotel. I immediately started looking for work and ended up being hired at the hotel I was staying at. So that put me in a position to be working in the same place I was living. I have never been in that situation before. For the most part, it has been okay and some of the perks kinda made it worth it. However, since being here I have realized how toxic my workplace and coworkers are (they also live on property). In the last 3/4 months A lot Of things have changed and not for the better. I am now in a hostile environment.And I find it difficult to get up and go into work every day now. I want to leave and find a new job and place to live. Because one of the conditions here, is if I don't work here, I can't live here. So it's not like I can even politely give a 2 weeks' notice bc then I also have to find a place to live. I make minimum wage, and live paycheck to paycheck. So saving is very difficult. The housing market, where I'm at is extremely expensive.
And most places require you to make 3x the rent and my credit is terrible. So the advice I am looking for is how to get out of where i'm at without ending up on the street. The job market isn't that great either And I am also in college full time online. How do I find another job when I already work a full time day job. It's not as though I can take off work to train for another job.Because if I lose this job, I lose my place to live. But I don't make enough here to afford rent anywhere else. I feel so stuck and i'm scared to end up on the street with my four year old. In the time that i've been here, I still have not met anyone outside of this place, so I still have no friends and family that could help anywhere.

1fbyufh,"Torn between two good options, help me figure it out?","I'm in the offer stage for two great jobs in my preferred industry and I'm having a tough time choosing. Here's the scenario's in brief, would love to know your opinions and suggestions.

Job 1: Brand New Company
Initially part time with plan to go full time within 3 months as a permanent employee. The team is great and talented but they are a brand new company with no history of income. The job offer is dependant on signing this one client, if that client doesn't work out no one will get paid. The client is also a brand new company and I can't find any digital footprint on any of the people involved so I'm suspicious of their authenticity. If all does go to plan it'll be a great full time wage and should be a valid role for at least three years but in the short term less money than job 2. 

Job 2: Established Company with Famous Clients
The second job is a full time freelance contract for 3 months with the possibility of being made permanent and have the contract extended. It will pay 4x more than Job 1 in the first three months but then could end completely and I'll be back to where I am now with job hunting. The company is established and with mixed reviews but the work is with famous clients and will look good on my resume. 

Job 1 feels more risky but if it works out more secure but Job 2 is more exciting. Problem is I've already provisionally said yes to Job 1 but haven't signed any contracts or been given a start date yet, however if I switch to Job 2 I'm worried I'll damage relationships with Job 1.

After taking a few months off and cancelling options like film making and film studies despite making it through at film schools in the UK, I started preparing for the military here in India. After a few failed attempts at the written exam, I started clearing exams for the army and the airforce, I spent more time preparing for the SSB (a long and highly competitive round of interview, psychological and physical tests conducted by the army and the air force), but I failed twice. The seats which I am fighting for are 16 in the army while 4 in the airforce. I have got more SSBs coming up but I need to have a backup plan. Moreover, I injured my back and wrist this year which put me off track and this has affected my mental health as I have not been able to fully pursue my goals or plans. 

I have been advised against pursuing anything in academia as there is no funding for the arts. I left creative arts (photography, filmmaking and music) because it does not provide financial stability. I was asked to think of becoming a school teacher in the UK, which seemed great at first but then after doing research I came to the conclusion that it is no less than a nightmare to be a teacher in the UK. I have done a few linkedin and coursera courses in Project Management and Digital marketing, but finding jobs has been hard+ I hate the idea of doing a stupid corporate job where I will be undervalued and underpaid. I do freelancing and have some experience of being a social media manager in a part time role.

I am creative, hardworking and have a decent ability to study well and do research. However, the changes in my lifestyle because of unfavorable circumstances regarding my health, changing career and making big changes has brought down my motivation and productivity. From working 14 hours (studying + working out + dieting + doing a part time job + freelancing) to being able to do nothing has made me feel horrible.

I took a job with a reputable career trajectory in early 2023. However, it was in a small town and soon realized that I miss the city and lack purposeful work at my new company. I also have gotten distant to most of my friends because I went off to pursue a great career trajectory and the money that comes with it.

Thus, I have been on the job search again to find another role. The problem is I can’t term to find another role. I’ve applied to over 650 jobs in cities across the southeast since February. Gone through 8 interview processes and never received an offer. I’ve spent of $500 on a professional resume coach and interview professionals. 

I’m now 30 pounds overweight, lack a good solid community, seemingly depressed, and desperate to get back into the city again where I have friends.

While I have successful and verifiable experience in project management, event planning and marketing, I have come to the point where I will pretty much do anything to get back into a healthier environment. I am 24 years old and feel like I’m always competing against more experienced candidates. I just feel utterly stuck and it’s draining the life out of me. 

My current role is full of toxicity. My boss is demeaning and verbally abusive towards women. As I man, I was threatened with termination when I would speak up. All my circles of wisdom are telling me to quit which I’m trying to do. 

I’ve tried networking online and with the connections on here. I’ve even tried using Reddit and Facebook to network, which apparently everybody thinks my well thought out tomes for networking are written by AI which is uber frustrating.

Im currently a certified Chemical Technician („Chemikant“ in Germany) working as a Plant Operator at a Refinery. (Operations)

I finished the apprenticeship in 2.5 years, 1 year shorter than the regular duration due to good performance.

In the following 2.5 years I attained 2 extra „german“  degrees, which equal the Bachelor and Master degree in International Standards. (Industriemeister Chemie, Technischer Betriebswirt)

What would be the best next step to get further with my career? I feel stuck and like im wasting my time at this Job since its tied with experience to the Plants and my Degrees feel somewhat useless tbh. 

Also I realized kinda that Connections are more important than knowledge to get further it seems.

I thought about getting a „normal“ Bachelors degree in Chem Process Engineering or do an MBA of some sort.

Open for International work aswell btw.

1fbpxgb,What careers do you have the best possibility of making millions a year in?,"My guess would be finance, like investment banking and private equity. If you get into a top one of those after undergrad, you're on a pretty clear track to make partner and start getting millions a year. And then of course other less common stuff, like quant traders, venture capital, etc. All of that you can make millions in at a top company.

Second would probably be big law. Again, if you get to a top law firm and stick with it, you can make partner with a reasonable probability. And if you do, you can start making millions.

Third would be tech, but its WAY less likely that the previous two. FAANG isn't gonna cut it (very, very few are making millions there, most roles are terminal), you'd need to get to a company that has a huge stock price jump, like Nvidia or a unicorn most likely. So it's a lot more luck based, partially because there's way more tech jobs, it's much easier to break into

They let me go after 4 yrs as I was bottom performer.. Meanwhile due to my repeated failures and other emotional behavior, my wife divorced me. I have lived by myself for 5 years now. 

I got a job as a Recruiter and did well for first 6 months but later due to unable to adjust with toxic behavior at office my performance dipped and again  I was let go ater 1.5 years.

 All of my previous companies had let go of 80% people who were my coworkers. Made me think am i pick wrong companies most of the time?? Those who would eventually sooner or later would go down in biz? Like one such company eventually moved all it's sales operations to US and I was one of the guys let go a few months before that happened while some of my colleagues stayed longer but were let go eventually. Stuff like that is peppered all through my past. 

I am now jobless. Applying for IT sales profile but not getting replies. Don't want to apply for recruitment as the Healthcare Recruitment market is down by 80% since covid and the time I started. I hardly have money for rent next month and been jobless since July this year.

The only thing I have maintained is fitness as I have not stopped working out1-2 hours everyday for last many years. I still workout although I don't want to due too feeling low but working out is in my nature. I don't go to gym. I do home bodyweight workout and have kick boxing bag that i am regular with. This doesnt solve the bigger money problem though obviously. 

Hoping this group will share advice and support to help me stand up as I seemed to have lost most of my confidence and hope.",shekhar201304,0,0.5,0,1725769075,2024-09-08 04:17:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbpezk/could_you_please_share_some_advice_as_i_feel_lost/,9,2024

1fbpbfy,Day 3 of being laid off,I’m still processing my own feelings about being laid off. It’s been really rough for me but I have continued to search for jobs and try to enjoy this time as I have a severance package for the next 24 weeks. I am very nervous and really hope I find a job here soon but my level of confidence has dropped. I seriously wonder if I will find a job like this or even a better one in the next couple of months. Any advice on how to quickly find a job or any advice in general?? I’ve never experienced this before.

1fbp0tx,Advice needed: Is a one year sabbatical something I can/should go for?,"Hey! I'm here for advice from those who may have gone through similar situations. I'll give as much context as I can while trying to keep it short.

* ***Work background:***

I'm 31M, Spain. Currently working for a FAANG company for almost 5 years, and feeling completely burnt out due to many reasons. Namely, internal politics, bad management, lack of sense of purpose, bureaucracy, lack of career development opportunities (within my current department), not feeling valued etc.

During the last June I've tried to interview for other job positions within the company, in another country, for a position I liked more. After 6 interviews, I was told I was successful and passed. But eventually due to some HR mismanagement they couldn't move me. I could try to go for another round of interviews, but at this point I feel so done with the whole situation. Other than being mentally checked out in my current department, I've put a huge effort in the interviews, having even been told I was successful, only to not materialize.

* ***Education background:***

Got a degree in pure maths back in my uni days. I've learned some coding on my own as well, which has been very helpful at work. I would hope all of that would play in favor when coming back, **if** I were to take a gap year.

* ***Financial background:***

I've been saving for a while, managing to save 90k€. No debt, no house, no expenses other than rent and everyday life.

* ***Travel background***

I've traveled around europe quite a lot in short periods of 2-3 weeks, as well as to Japan.

* ***Other background:***

Previously to doing the interviews in June, I was already considering taking the gap year and just go for a one year trip. In July I got a working holiday visa for Japan, with the intention of spending one year there (I've been twice and I'm always waiting for a chance to go back). I would also use it as a base to travel to other countries in south east asia. My second option for the gap year is to travel around the world instead (without a country base). My third option is to stay at home and do shorter trips, but focusing also on other personal things that I enjoy, here.

* ***Doubts***

Honestly I'm overthinking this. Japan's my first option (I need to land there no later than the 2nd week of October), but I do worry about what will happen when I come back home. I was expecting to spend 30k in Japan, and then, once I come back, I would have to find a new flat to rent, which would be *much* more expensive (my current rent can't be increased more than a small % due to gov. regulations). In principle I can get my current job back through preferential hire, some people have done that before and they managed fine, but this job makes me so miserable (yet it's way overpaid).

I guess the elephant in the room is, why am I doing this? I sort of feel that going to Japan for one year, or going for a world trip for one year, or staying at home one year and traveling around here, any of those options feel like avoidance to me. I mean, if I didn't feel burnt out, I would have never considered doing this at this point of my life, so in a way I feel like I should instead power through and find a new job (it feels like the responsible thing to do), which would probably resolve most of what is causing my burnt out. I do not need to go on a one year trip, with all the consequences that I'd face when coming back, in order for me to feel better. In a way I'm feeling like I'd be taking the easy way out instead of facing reality and work to solve my problems, finding a new job and all. On the other hand, I'd love to actually do this (whichever of the 3 options I would end up doing), I guess in a way I'm too afraid of what will come next, and feeling like maybe I would be making a mistake. What if I'm tanking my career by doing this?

Initially I was saving towards buying a house, but with the current market, it just seems so unlikely. I kind of have dropped this idea for the next 5 years or so. Despite saving as much, I'm nowhere near to be able to afford a house. I feel like going forward with this trip idea would be irresponsible as I'd eat up on my savings by quite a lot.

What are the important questions I should ask myself that should help me decide on what to do? There are so many variables to this I am just not able to think straight, I go from ""oh this is a fantastic idea"" to ""I'm being totally delusional"", I go from feeling ""yolo"" to feeling irresponsible. I can't decide and I'm totally overthinking this for months, which is adding to the whole work stress situation.

Maybe someone here has been through a similar situation. Honestly any sort of advice would really help me at this point.

1fbnieh,Should I Jump Ship Now or Wait for My CSP? Weighing Career Moves in a High-Stakes Market,"Hello! 

I've been working in Environmental, Health & Safety consulting for a little over three years now. I joined my current firm straight out of college and have been with them ever since. As many consultants here might relate, the constant travel can be exhausting and makes it tough to maintain a regular schedule. At the moment, I'm traveling for work 5-7 nights per month, often being away 1-2 nights a week, driving or flying across the region. I've managed to find a balance that works for me, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep up with this lifestyle. Thankfully, I'm in my mid-20s, single, and don't have kids, which makes it more manageable, but I'm really yearning for a more stable life and a higher salary.

Recently, one of my clients offered me a job at their facility with a 30% raise over my current salary, no travel, and the option to work remotely two days a week. Right now, I'm making just over $100,000, and they offered me $130,000. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a violation of their contract with my firm to recruit me, so they had to retract the offer. But this got me thinking that there might be other opportunities out there where I could earn a similar or even better salary. Living in NYC, where the cost of living is extremely high, I'm definitely motivated to find a higher-paying role. While my employer has increased my salary significantly (by about $35,000) since I started, with inflation and the high cost of living here, I feel like I should be earning more.

I'm planning to obtain my Certified Safety Professional (CSP) certification as soon as I'm eligible, which will be in June 2025. I'm currently studying for it and feel pretty good about my progress. I know that having my CSP would open up many more opportunities and give me better leverage for negotiating a higher salary in future interviews. However, I'm already considering looking for new jobs that offer more money and less travel. My thought process is that I might be able to secure a job paying between $110,000 and $130,000 right now, but if I wait until I have my CSP, that number could potentially be even higher, maybe around $140,000 or more. This is just speculation based on what I know about the industry.

So, my question is: Do you think it's worth holding off for another 9 months until I (hopefully) have my CSP to start looking for a new job, or should I begin the search now?",Sneaky_Tiger_,1,1.0,0,1725762255,2024-09-08 02:24:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbnieh/should_i_jump_ship_now_or_wait_for_my_csp/,9,2024

1fbl9pu,Should I let go of my dreams of becoming a doctor?,"Note: I need some empathy. None of this is meant in anyway to offend or otherwise insult anyone else but is simply my thoughts as I am in a very low place right now.

I'm 24 on now my third gap year (birthday in Jan) and applying to med school this cycle for matriculation in 2025. It's been my dream all my life. I've lived my entire life pretty much since 7th grade good at science and wanting to be a doctor. I went to Wash U and was doing ok in courses and got a bunch of different club experiences (not much clinical volunteering) but overextended. Did not end up writing a thesis with my lab. I also was worried and kept procrastinating getting letters of rec. I graduated 3.65 overall gpa college honors in biochem and anthro. Basically I was academically good enough but freaked out I wasn't but not volunteering and story wise good enough. I think I just did not receive enough prehealth advice about what I needed or that working hard and full-time was needed.

I had an offer after college for a lab job in St Louis which I sorely regret not taking but turned it down for a scribe job in Boston and moved home. I could've stayed in St Louis but decides to move home because I figured I'd be lonely in my own apartment. Worst decision ever. Far more lonely at home than in the lab job. I was working hard at first for one of the scribe positions but the  from my scribe job in the colorectal surgery clinic in September 2022 and then I took a huge gap from October to January to take MCAT and didn't work and lost those hours. I had no idea how you needed to list hours and now I lacked them with only 1000 hours over two years and just doing nothing else. I wasn't doing anything but studying for the MCAT for some months which makes it make more sense but also had many weeks where I was barely working and others where I worked full-time. I did well on the MCAT in January 2023 (517/94th percentile) and continued scribing but came home each day and did not end up actually putting my app together. I thought my app would look poor with having dropped the research or my PI would not give me the rec I needed.

I was really hung over not taking the lab job in St. Louis which would have been with a great PI. To make up for this supposed lack of research, I finally got a top lab job in October 2023 (1.5 years after graduation) after I knew that cycle was blown due to procrastination and dread that research was required and thought I could become a professional, move out with roommates, and get published to have a research orientation by working at UMASS. It was going well in the lab job until I disappointed my PI and was basically put on a PIP so had to quit it after 4 months. 

With my parents encouragement even after the firing, I applied this cycle but didn't realize how paltry the hours were for my scribe job and realized I didn't do shit discounting this lab job that went nowhere. So now my own home state med school knows I left and my entire job history is a joke and closed research probably as well. I've been doing secondaries super depressed and my roommates know I quit my lab job and I got EMT certified to work on ambulances and volunteer for a year so when this cycle goes south I can reapply. 

But just seeing everyone who has their life together and my peers from Wash U now at Harvard law makes me so depressed. I'm still in this cycle and have applied 10/27 schools I sent my primary to so late because of the EMT course and just depression that this is futile. I'm feeling hopeless I have nothing to say for all of this time except to be an EMT at age 24 to 25 and hoping med schools want me with a year of work behind me. 

I think I need to switch careers to at least know my 20s aren't being thrown out the window for a hopeless dream after I wasted so much time from May 2022 to December 2023 working not even part time at a dead end scribe job. I currently need to renew a lease with roommates who I hardly know and my parents want me in the city but I can't stand others' success right now.

1fbl37e,"Resigned from my job, feeling emotional and lost","Been at my first job out of graduation for 6 years in a very fast paced and dynamic industry. The turnover in my department has always been abnormally high due to the stress and work environment, where the upper management are often micro managing, yet ironically having a lack of direction when big decisions are needed, then blaming those below when things go wrong. 

I love the field I’m in, and perhaps as a result of this I have always been considered high performing due to the efforts I put in, getting upgrades/promotions 4 times in the 6 years I have been here. In a sense, I am in a position of great privilege as I am someone identified to fast track up the ladder. My peers and direct supervisor are fantastic and supportive, and I really enjoy working with them. However, in recent months the situation has escalated to a point where the workload is intense, and my mental health took a serious hit. It has always been bad, which explains the turnover, but it’s just beyond control now. My entire team works overtime, but instead of progressing and exploring developments, we are just putting out fires most of the time. Every day the cycle repeats, and the job I used to love is making me disillusioned. 

Out of impulse, I applied to another company in the same field, albeit smaller, for a similar job scope. In 2 weeks they interviewed me twice, and offered me an almost 20% increase at a lateral move in job title. One of the things that swayed me during the interview was the fact that the management team’s views aligned with mine, and it seemed like they were all working towards having a meaningful impact, which really touched me despite how idealistic it sounds. Hence I accepted, hoping that starting anew would reignite my passion.

Following which, I resigned to my direct supervisor on Friday. She was extremely supportive and mentioned she could see I was at a breaking point because she knows how I really care about my work, and encouraged me to step out and broaden my horizons as well to see how other companies worked.

Now I’m feeling really emotional and lost for a variety of reasons. I likely have to face the upper management and HR next week to explain my reasons for leaving as me quitting was apparently a huge shock, but I don’t want to burn any bridges, so I’m unsure of what to say. I’m also sure they will try to retain me, perhaps by guilt-tripping (I just got promoted this year) and counter-offering. I also feel bad for leaving my team in the lurch, as I was handling quite a lot of responsibilities. I also have a lot of emotional attachment as 6 years is a long time and this is my first job, which is always special. Maybe I am also unsure of whether leaving was wise in view of career progression, as staying would have meant a smooth climb while leaving is jumping into the unknown, especially since my title will be the same. In short, I’ve been stressed and emotional the whole weekend, and am seeking some comfort and advice. Sorry for the long post.

TLDR; quit due to toxic management for horizontal move at 20% raise, feeling emotional and lost",crossroad-,5,0.8600000143051147,22,1725754370,2024-09-08 00:12:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbl37e/resigned_from_my_job_feeling_emotional_and_lost/,9,2024

I am currently employed by the federal government as a web development intern, and plan on continuing my work into the fall. I also have an outstanding offer from a startup for a SWE intern position, where the work involves more novel technologies, I am apprehensive if I can juggle two part time (20 hrs/week) jobs during the academic year, and am also unsure about whether or not I can manage it in addition to applying to places for next summer, leetcode, etc. I feel bad about leaving the federal position, as we are close to deployment, and my boss is really understanding, giving me much more leeway for academic pursuits (research, clubs) during the school year. Given the other position is a startup, I feel it may be more work/stressful, but with objectively more interesting work. What is the best option for me to take here?

Three people have left since I’ve been hired, two quit / one fired, and as such I’ve been doing more and more as the design team has shrunk.

We’re in the process of hiring a new senior designer to fill the place of one who quit, and the business has been slowing down a bit as of late due to new clients not taking proposals. I already negotiated my offer when hired from their 50k to my current salary of 55k.

1fbhlxj,Trying to pursue a Business degree but my current job (which I need) is making it extremely hard.,"Hi, 24m here. 

I currently work, on average, 45 hours per week (Hourly and paid OT, Mandated to average 45 hours per week across any rolling 6 week period). Schedule totally fluctuates and my work location varies by day. I make about 60k per year, but the benefits package is really nice - they pay 100% for my insurance and I have no copays at all, which saves me a giant amount of money due to health issues (about $30k/yr). However, I still want to grow and do better, and have been trying to figure out a way to pursue a Bachelors in Business with a concentration in finance that will work for me.

Unfortunately, it feels like there are only 2 options. Either do a flexible online college program, which people then tell me leads to a worthless degree, or commit to physical classes at a community college which I literally can't guarantee I won't be scheduled during.

I already have about 1 full semesters worth of transferrable credits from a community college. My current job has me working intimately with a lot of business / financial management principals and I'd ideally like to test out of some / most classes. Ideally I'd like to do an online ""at your own pace"" program and just fly through it when I'm off work. I'm 100% confident I could test out of some classes and expedite the process. But most advice I get is that online colleges are scams and I'll get a worthless degree and won't even be considered for any jobs.

At the same time, it feels totally impossible to commit to in person college courses at a community college when I don't even know when I'll be working on a week to week basis. I don't know. I'm just super confused on how to go about doing this and any advice would be appreciated.",Speculatory,4,1.0,3,1725744305,2024-09-07 21:25:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbhlxj/trying_to_pursue_a_business_degree_but_my_current/,9,2024

1fbh9bj,I messed up a lot during my first month of probation. How do I get better?,"So, I started a new job around a month ago. I'm still in the probationary period but I've already messed up lots. Lots of stupid mistakes, lack of attention to detail, lots of slacking and procrastinating, not giving it my all. 

I let anxiety lead me by the hand and took the coward's way out of everything. I took 3 sick day leaves (I know that in my old job I would have only asked for a day off if I was on my death bed) which does not leave a good impression at all. 

My last sick day leave was on Friday, manager sent me a message at around 12 PM and I just ignored it throughout the enitre weekend. I have not been a good employee as I am expected to be and I know it.

My manager is kind and I feel I have taken advantage of her kindness. I had a wake up call today in terms of my dad telling me that if he were my manager, he'd have fired me right away and that I am purposely choosing the road of failure for myself. I'm beating up myself about it but I'm trying hard not to let it let me spiral so I don't end up in the same place again.

Now, my question is, what are the best things I can do right now to salvage this?

1fbgp73,My career journey that turned a hungry boy into a succesful pro and a landlord ,"If you are young and don't really know what to do in your life/career, I recomment looking at filmmaking industry.  
Yes, it sounds a bit unexpected, doesn't it? Well, it worked for me ))  
I run from home to the Army once I reached a certain age. But when I got back, obviously nobody waited for me, and I was totally on my own. Thank God, I had several old friends who fed me from time to time. The Army did a good thing to me and my mentality - I wasn't afraid of anything anymore. And one day we strolled along some street, it was summer, and on the ground floor many windows were open. I saw sone office, jolly people doing something interesting, kinda good vibes. I asked through the window what they were doing, this and that, and one guy said come inside. We did - and I stayed for many years to come. It was a young TV prodution company - 20 people or so. Everybody did everything, and they did need spare hands. I started working at the lowest ""rank"" and basically did most primitive things - carried cameras, batteries, lights, run errands, helped to organise shootings whatever. Then I was promoted to a head of one production groups. Then - as a head of the whole production. We shot films, tv programs, ad spots, you name it. I flew and drove all over the country and abroad. Then my career made an interesting turn as I became a pro copywriter (it's a separate story), but this TV/cinema thing was my life defining part.  
First, in TV/film industry it's kida flat structure unlike big companies - it feels more like a big family. Second - if you work hard, it's seen. This indistry is like a constand gig thing, so nobody needs extra people doing nothing. Everybody knows what everybody does. Hence my rapid promotion. In the start I was paid shit, but for me is was more important to be where I was somebody. Money came later. Third: TV/cinema indistry is incredibly diverse in a sense what you can do and what you can be. I mean you can start like me - carrying bags and cleaning trash, and discover many paths, working close to endless talents in many fields. Makeup? Lithting? Shooting? Directing? Writing? Editing? Managing? Voice over recording? Sound studio? Props making? Stage design? Costumes? Working with actors? Being one? Technical stuff (cars, generators, moving stuff, electricity, cranes, whatever)?  
I mean you work with great people side-by-side, and you show interest to what they do, you can make you assigned to thet particular area and grow there. I was a production guy, but was always interested in creating stories and ideas for TV ads, and I became friends with our writers, creators and edictors. Some my ideas did get through, and I started doing that more and more, until it became my new profession - now I do ads for presidential candidates, consult serious companies and thinki of buying the fourth apartment to rent it out )) But the most important thing in the whole thing was this family attitude, and I'm still friends with many people from that back ago.

1fbfqym,How to write a CV with no work experience,"Creating a CV when you have no work experience might seem daunting, but it’s entirely possible to produce a compelling document that highlights your skills, education, and potential. Here’s a guide to help you write a CV with no experience.

Choose the right format

When you lack professional experience, the functional CV format is your best friend. This style emphasizes your skills and education over your work history, which can be particularly useful for newcomers to the job market.

Start with a strong personal statement

Your personal statement or objective is a short paragraph at the top of your CV. Here, you introduce yourself and summarize what you aim to achieve. Keep it concise, relevant, and tailored to the position you’re applying for.

Highlight your education

When you don’t have work experience, your educational background becomes a key focus. Include the name of your institution, degree obtained, dates attended, and any honors or relevant coursework. If you’ve completed projects or theses that relate to the job, mention them here.

1fbffk9,Manager unexpectedly quit just as I started my role — how do I ask for a promotion?,"Context: 

I was hired for a social media coordinator role 3 months ago & on the job description, the role said it would pay 72K. When they had offered me the role, I negotiated to 72K but HR said that their budget was capped at 68K. Upon my first week at the role, my manager disclosed that she felt angry that I was basically lied to about the initial salary, and she brought this complaint up all the way to the CEO, and then said that she’s been promoted 3x within the last 2 years, so there’s plenty of room to grow.

I have been working alongside my coworker / social media manager for the first month, and because the company is similar to a start-up, along with my role, I have also been doing some of her job responsibilities. 2nd month in — she took a month vacation and I was left to do all of her responsibilities for the month.  

Now as I’m approaching month 3 of this role, the social media manager had just let us know she’s quitting. My manager sent me a message letting me know that she doesn’t want me to worry about having to do her job, and shes already in talks with her boss about backfilling the role — but she wants my input too.

At this point, I’ve done her AND my roles for a whole month (proving that I could do her job) and I’m thinking about asking for a promotion to replace her position. It would cost the company way less money and time to move me up versus hiring someone from the outside. We’re also starting our fiscal year so it’s been busy. Also, I would most likely be getting paid the amount I was initially supposed to get paid.

What do you think / how do I frame this ask? 

I’m worried that they might be skeptical because I was just hired 3 months ago, but her leaving was unexpected and I’ve since proven that I could do her and my roles.

I am currently employed at my company as a Consultant but am being staffed on projects as a Senior Consultant for over a year now. I am curious how I should go about listing this on my resume for job applications. I want to be represented as a senior because I am doing the work of a senior, but my company refuses to promote me (among others) for budget saving reasons. 

  
My thought was to list individual points on my resume where I worked as a senior, but I am concerned this will not catch the eye of a recruiter during a quick scan of my resume. But I do not want to list my job position as ""Senior Consultant"" because this feels like it is lying and would get me in hot water if a company were to ask my current company about my position.

1fbdfdr,2 potential offers after 6 months unemployed. Which would you pick?,"
Hey all, after six months unemployed, I am now at the reference check stage for two different jobs, and I’m having trouble deciding which would be best for my career goals.

My background is in journalism and social media, but after an extremely toxic job in entertainment news, I am looking to pivot into marketing. Right now, my goal is to work as an in-house marketer. I did 4 interviews for a “Content Marketing Senior Associate” role at a major company, which would be the dream. Still waiting to hear an official yes or no from that company as well. 

Anyway, here’s a breakdown of the two opportunities that I think I’m about to receive an offer for. For reference, I live in NYC, maxed out my credit card and am about to lose unemployment.

Job #1: Got the interview through a family connection (seems like the only way to be taken seriously these days). Account Executive role at a PR firm. 55-60K/year. Was warned about 70 hour weeks during the interview process. Glassdoor reviews are all good, but all from interns. Small but friendly team. 2-3 days in office nearby.

Job #2: Social Media Specialist role at a union. 60-70K/year, but I asked for 70. I was asked during the interview if I had experience working with diverse groups, seeing that I was a “white girl.” Hiring managers actually expressed concern during my interviews that I would leave soon after they “dedicated all this time and effort to training me,” pointing out my lack of union experience. Concerned about the company culture, but would have good work/life balance and higher pay. Insurance 100% paid for. 2-3 days in office nearby.

Wildcard Freelance Job #3: Also, a few days ago, I was offered freelance work at my dad’s longtime colleague’s PR agency. They said they’d work with me on finding the right number of hours. Really, really great people who genuinely want to help me. Founder even said I can put down that I’d been there since March so I have no resume gap. 

I just keep thinking to myself that if I want agency experience, I could just get that at Wildcard Freelance Job #3 while I got a paycheck at Job #2. Would probably not have time for Wildcard Freelance Job #3 at Job #1. However, I’m concerned about possible toxic culture at Job #2.

What would you do? Which of these jobs would best position me for in-house marketing in the future? ",Objective_You_4365,1,1.0,0,1725733031,2024-09-07 18:17:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbdfdr/2_potential_offers_after_6_months_unemployed/,9,2024
1fbddl9,2 potential offers after 6 months unemployed. Help me pick,"Hey all, after six months unemployed, I am now at the reference check stage for two different jobs, and I’m having trouble deciding which would be best for my career goals.

My background is in journalism and social media, but after an extremely toxic job in entertainment news, I am looking to pivot into marketing. Right now, my goal is to work as an in-house marketer. I did 4 interviews for a “Content Marketing Senior Associate” role at a major company, which would be the dream. Still waiting to hear an official yes or no from that company as well.

1fbcmzd,Boring job and contemplating a second degree?,"I’m 26, and currently working a rather boring local government job, doing property tax work. I currently make $75k, with small annual raises that’ll cap out at $83k in 4 years. Within 4 or 5 years I should be able to move up to a role with a pay range of $85k-$100k. There’s the possibility of management positions / lateral moves after that, with pay being around the $120k mark. I’m unionized, have a good DB pension, benefits, 3 weeks PTO and 6 personal days per year. I can also work from home or office whenever I choose. 

My issue here is that I’m bored. In high school I wanted to do some type of engineering, but had self esteem issues / really didn’t know how to study and convinced myself I couldn’t do it, so I did a business degree (finance) instead as that’s what most of my friends did which lead me to this valuations role I’m currently in. I never enjoyed any of it, but I made it through the degree no problem. I get 0 fulfillment from my job, I have no interest in it, and feel like I contribute nothing to the world. I’m having regrets now, and I’m at a point in my life where I’ve matured and know for sure I could handle an engineering program, but now it’s a financial / time issue. I can’t just quit my job to pursue a 4 year degree, I have bills and rent to pay. Would it be worth attempting to slowly do this degree part time? I understand it’d take awhile, and I know engineering isn’t a ticket to some rich lifestyle, I fully understand I’d probably never make more than I am now, but there’s the possibility to be working on projects I enjoy. 

I should note that I don’t hate my workplace, it’s supportive, my coworkers are great, and I have excellent work life balance. I also do have hobbies outside of work (playing music, hiking, cooking, my dog) that I do in my free time, so im not just sitting around after work. 

Am I crazy to do this? Or should I continue with my current career and find fulfillment elsewhere? ",theliljwcptdeux,1,1.0,6,1725730952,2024-09-07 17:42:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fbcmzd/boring_job_and_contemplating_a_second_degree/,9,2024
1fbccxb,"As someone who has changed entire departments, my advice to you is : Dont fear career change","I have had the opportunity of being in a non-linear career. This might be hard to digest, but (at least in technology) having non-linear career paths are going to become much more of a norm over the long term than what the current situation is, or how things were before. 

Now this might be frustrating for some people, because

we are always going to have to keep on learning!

In the ever-shifting world of work, linear career paths—where you climb the corporate ladder rung by rung—are more of a relic. 

Think about the advantages. A non-linear career path is truly like a buffet of skills and insights. You sample a bit of this and a bit of that, building a diverse toolkit that’s adaptable and robust. It’s like moving from Human Resources to IT Infrastructure—suddenly, you’re blending people expertise with technical acumen, and your perspective is both broader and deeper than what it was.

(yes, I did work in Human Resources for a small period of time before moving to IT. And No, that's not the reason for my habit of saying 'I'll get back to you') 

Then there’s the adaptability factor. Seamlessly shifting from one role or industry to another takes significant effort, some long nights. This agility isn’t just a cool trick; it’s a survival skill in a landscape that’s constantly evolving. It is all about embracing change. After all, it's the only constant, isn't it? 

Networking in this context becomes an add-on. Your connections span various departments, each one offering different stories, opportunities, and collaborations. There is almost always an advantage (over the long term) of having a contact who knows someone who knows someone in a completely different industry—suddenly, doors open in ways you never expected.

And let’s not forget about problem-solving. With a non-linear career, you’re not just thinking outside the box, it's like you’re discarding the box entirely. Your diverse experiences let you approach challenges with a kaleidoscope of strategies, often leading to innovative and creative solutions.

Remember, opportunities come to open eyes.

So, the next time you discard that goal of doing something in your career which is ""unorthodox"" (could be anything, as small as learning a tool or a technology that is 'outside' of your current career path and you feel like you'll waste time) or someone questions the twists and turns of your career , remember this : non-linear growth isn’t a deviation from the path; it’s a testament to your versatility and resilience. Embrace the journey and let your career be a testament to the beauty of the unexpected. I have done it, and it has only added more value to myself and the lovely people I work with. 

I have written an article regarding this on Linkedin along with much other topics, but I wouldn't want to self-promote like that. so if you want to connect and talk about stuff and if there's a way I could help, please just comment or reach out even!

1fbagj4,i need an advice ..,"Hello everyone, let me introduce myself: I am a third-year Computer Engineering student, and I am also interested in music because I want to be a musician, so I create my own songs (I pay for mix mastering). I plan to start releasing my own songs within a few months. I don't have high expectations at the beginning, but I believe that my recognition will grow as I continue.

Anyway, the issue is that I never feel connected to my university or my department. I am a very hardworking person; during the summer, I work on what I really want for a minimum of 10 hours a day and can make progress. However, during the academic year, everything falls apart. I want to cry every day because there is truly nothing that excites me about my department. I can reach a good level if I work, but honestly, I am sure I won't be able to maintain my mental health, and the field I want to specialize in is not this; it's music.

My question is that I need a job that can provide financial income to quit university. I would love to work as a freelancer. I want to chase after my freedom so much, even if it's just a dream. A high-level managerial position in a company is definitely not for me. At the same time, I am entrepreneurial. I would be grateful if anyone has any job recommendations for me. (By the way, of course, I will not leave university unless I can earn money.)

and yes, I can finish university, yes, I am in my third year, but it would truly be a waste of time because I am not doing anything that adds value to myself other than passing exams related to my department.

1fbag40,College CSE path led to a poor outcome. How can I turn my life around? ,"- Went to a T25 University for CS in late 2000s, graduated in mid 2010s.
- At that time, CS was not nearly as popular, seemed like a good long-term decision at that time.  Spent 5 years in school.
- Had 2 internships
- Has about 5 years of exp, mostly in outdated tech. 
- 33 years old and have made about 120K total savings in my entire life. 
- Lives with parents, still cannot afford to live on own, they have spent more supporting me and sending to college than I have saved so far in my life as to that figure above 
- Has been bullied at every job for not being talented. At my current job, people will not look at or talk to me. I have no network. I have been threatened with violence at multiple jobs. 
- We are on track for a layoff. It's pretty widely known and felt that we are on the last legs. The entire office likely has less than 6 months left.
- My earnings trajectory has gone: Unpaid intern, 13/hr, 26/hr + benefits, 20/hr no benefits, 34/hr + benefits but on track for layoff
- I have no other skills or talents or work experience than computer work, other than menial physical labor. 
- I have no kids and am a single male

1fb8ccf,Been 'dismissed' from my IT job. has my IT career ended? ,"This is a long read, and I will try my best for this to make sense. 

I am 21 years of age, I have been working since I was 18. I love IT, so all my jobs have been IT related. I started off with CEX, although I wanted to pursue my career in IT.   
This incident has happened with...lets say company A and B.  
I have just been 'dismissed' from company B, 4 months into my 6 month probation period.

I was with company A, for around a year and 4 months. I had no problems with the company, although after the year mark I wanted to try something new, mainly for more money. I was an ICT analyst at company A, and did a years apprenticeship for my level 3 IT. I was them employeed full time with them.

Company A, has around 200 companies that they provide IT support for.   
One time when i was on site at Company B, I was approched by a senior manager, as they were impressed by my work attitude and 'could tell i was brought up right'.  
Long story short, the senior manager was looking for an IT assistant, and wanted me to join. They gave me a run down of what I would be doing, and the increase of pay.

I accepted. 

For the first two months it was an absolute dream I could not of faulted the company. I at the time, thought my boss was my friend, as we'd often have personal conversations within one another. We worked in the same room so it was quite a close workship. I don't think my job description was perfectly accurate, although I just didn't question this at the time.

This is where I messed up, I had a meeting with HR and my boss 3 days ago for a 1 to 1. One of their 'concerns' was that I obtained details from company A, and used them within company B.   
For those who are IT technical minded, I used Company B details to add company B computers to the domain of company B.   
However, company B still has a contract between company A for IT support.   
Although my boss knew I had these details, as i had used them from my 2nd day of being employeed at company B. My boss is not technical minded, so she thought i meant something else.   
Before this meeting, I emailed company A to explain what I was doing, and how i was doing it. They (i have proof) was completely fine with how I was adding computers onto company B's domain.

I gained the details from an employee that worked at company A, although in my meeting I just said I remembered them from my time at company A, as i did not want to get the person who gave me these details in trouble. 

Two months into working company B, my boss told me not to use these details, and to just ring up company A to remote on and do the job. I did this, and since then i have not used such details. 

Company B also provided me with with a pool car, a very expensive 80k car pool car. After 3 weeks of me driving this vehice (company B is a retirement home organisation, and they have sites dotted around the country)  they found out I was not insured, i was driving the car without insurance even know they said to me I was. I forgave this and the company provided me the extra money to put my personal car on business insurance, as to be insured on the 80k pool car, I needed to be 25.

My boss also informed me of plans of the company, things I am not allowed to share or even know. And general details that would have got her into alot of trouble.   
In this meeting, she esentially stabbed me in the back, someone who I thought I could trust. It is a bit funny that i just did a full IT asset on every IT equipment on over 20 homes that they have. I have worked my absolute ar\*e off in the job, and to even get to where i was, career wise.

I had only tried my best, i am young and i made a mistake. The grounds that she fired me for was gross misconduct. I just don't understand why It took so long for this to come out.

Would this affect me getting another IT job? I am just honestly stunned. I feel like I could never get any of my points across as i felt like she already made my mind up. Most of my queries were things she said verbally, and as she was at the company for 16 years, why would anyone believe me over her?  
I just feel betrayed, embarrased.

I am going back to my 1st job, CEX. To just mentally recover. Because I am just not in a good place at the moment, and I just don't want this issue to haunt me for when I am ready to resume my IT career.

1fb7sgd,Supervisor asking intrusive questions and giving unsolicited/unprofessional comments ,"Hey just started a job that is the equivalent to a grad role. My manager has been good but has been on care leave and will continue to be on it for the next 6 weeks.

The work environment is nice and the job has security as it’s in the government.

I’ve noticed my supervisor is asks invasive questions and gives me unsolicited advice. He tried guessing my age on day one and when I gave the closed ended answer of no just asked me what year I was born. The same day he poked around about my relationship status and asked if I was planning to have kids. I made it clear I don’t want kids. 

He then asked if I was looking for a partner and my dating intentions. He asked about my single status and said I should plan to have kids and not to worry about the problems I’m worried about having kids ( like my lupus being triggered by it which I mentioned) and that the problems would sort themselves out. He asked about the same things and repeated himself again a week later.

A week after this (last Thursday) he was talking about how this government job won’t buy you a watch buts it’s stable. He said this to me a couple of times before but this time he added that because it was a stable job I should plan to have a family in the future. 

This guy gives me the icks and I’m not sure how to progress with this/ what options are available to me. 

He’s also said he was going to treat me like his daughter but I get the sense the dude might have boundary issues from this and that he passed induction tasks onto me to complete by myself that he was meant to talk to me about or that I can’t really do due to permission restrictions.

* lead and build the new product with a new remote team with no legacy product knowledge
* handle core and complicated implementation while consuming existing legacy apis 20+ years old
* share legacy knowledge and technical details for legacy integrations

The downside? Work has been so demanding that I’m starting to feel out of the loop with everything else—especially with trends, news, and what my friends and family are up to.

It’s getting to the point where I’m missing out on important conversations. My friends and family will talk about the latest viral meme or some trending topic, and I’ll have no idea what they’re referencing. I want to stay connected, but between long work hours and trying to manage my personal life, it’s tough to find the time to scroll through social media or catch up on the latest news.

1fb5ii8,Doing everything wrong... How can I be redeemed?,"6 months ago, I left a job I liked and did well. I don't like my current job, I'm not performing well at all, and my mental health has deteriorated to the point where I can't bounce back. However... they're horribly understaffed, turnover is high, and they expect a learning curve, so I have some security even though I'm not really doing my job duties.

Here's how I've screwed up:

- 3 months ago I told my supervisor that the job wasn't a good fit for me and I'm looking for other jobs. I had hoped to find something quickly, but I'm still here.
-  I have been transparent about my struggles and my mental health.
- I even told higher ups that I wasn't happy and was hoping to leave.
- I texted former managers to ask about returning and basically nymy6old them I hated my new job. It was super unprofessional.  
- I had been accepted to an MSW program and was supposed to start this fall. I thought my new job would help pay for some of the classes, provide educational leave, and provide a work-based practicum. That's not the case. 
- I panicked because I knew I wouldn't have the brain power to do this job & my masters. I got worried about finances. Instead of asking to defer, I impuslively asked to withdraw. Now I'll have to apply all over again & ask people (who I've been cringe towards) to rewrite letters of recommendation. I lost my personal statement too.


I feel like I've completely screwed myself over. I can't manage to pull myself together in this role and have done nothing but cause problems. I'm supposed to be helping disabled people with their careers (vocational rehabilitation). I can't think clearly or critically or have useful conversations with people. I realized my counseling skills were not as good as I thought (I have no formal training) and I lack the organizational skills to deal with all the paperwork and regulations of the job. People are putting their faith in me. I'm supposed to help them, but I've been failing them miserably. I'm overwhelmed and things are only going to get worse as I get more and more cases & people move through their plans.

Management has been extremely gracious and has already spent so much time and effort trying to train me. I don't think I've remained anything. My supervisor gets paid less than me but is expected to work more than 40 hours/week. She's supposed to supervise my meetings and approve my work, but she's basically been running meetings for me because I'm such a mess. Today I think she realized that we're the same age, and I think that made her patience run out. (I'm 29 but I look younger.) 


I had 2 interviews back in June and I got one offer, which I  take because it didn't pay enough & was WFH. I emailed the same company in August, asked them to reconsider, got another offer, then turned that down. I haven't had interviews since. (I had three scheduled: one I turned down because I spoke with people on that team and they were all suffering, one I cancelled because it was with a factory, and the other I missed due to miscommunication [and it wouldn't have been a good fit anyway]).

BUT THEN... 
I got a text from my last manager (who I haven't said anything cringe to) asking if I would be interested in returning. It's promising that he reached out to me, but I don't want to get my hopes up. My coworker who's leaving the role said there will be some internal applicants. I worry that HR and higher-ups won't approve of rehiring me, especially if they speak to my current employer. The other 2 former managers may also speak poorly of me. (I did really well in those positions, but I worry I fucked up with the cringe texts.) My best references are the people hiring me. 
I'm waiting for the position to post. I think I'll write a cover letter to plead my case a bit more.

I'm scared that my brain is so wrecked at this point that I can't interview well & I won't get a good reference from my current employer. I'm horribly ashamed and embarrassed and I feel like I've destroyed my career prospects.
I'm also in so much debt & I have such an expensive apartment that I can't afford to just leave my job or take a retail job or something for respite. Sigh.

1fb4lfk,Discriminatory amd toxic work colture UK,"Hi everyone,

I'm an European citizen that moved from mainland Europe to the UK about 10 yrs ago.

I've never had issues in the past, but after changingy job 6 yrs ago, I've ended up working for a government organization where discrimination, bulling and arrasment seems acceptable.

I've endured it so far mainly for 2 reasons. It's a speciliased job that required 1 year of training and now pays me a very good salary (which I would also struggle to get anywhere else) and it's a very secure job.

The downside is, no matter what I do, I always have to deal with (although a minority) colleges that are openly racist, discriminatory, with a ""pack mentalty"" and bullying behavior. 

Of course during the years I've always challenged it, but I could never denounce it officially, as I'd be immediately marginalized and stigmatized for the rest of my career.

So my question is... What would you do if you were in my shoes? 

Personally I'm planning to trying to pay off my mortgage as quickly as possible, rent or sell my property (hopefully for a profit) to then retire abroad, and leave this nightmare behind me forever. 

Would you do anything different?
Should I change my job for something wouldn't like as much (I like my job still, despite certain people mentalty) with perhaps a pay cut as well?

Ps. I've always embraced and respected the local colture fully. I get on with the banter, I enjoy a pint down the pub like anyone else, and I've traveled and appreciate every corner of this Island before.

1fb3uof,Advice on dealing with stress while working with a CTO of a Silicon Valley startup,"Hi guys,

Pardon me for using a cloned account since I want to be anonymous but my main account is easily recognizable because of the username.

A bit about me: I'm a L2 software engineer with 3 yrs of exp in an Asian country. I'm working remotely for a Silicon Valley AI-first startup.

Recently, I've been very stressful at work but the problem does not come from my workload. It's coming from the CTO working directly with me. Working with him has been an unrewarding experience for me lately as I'm constantly pushed to work harder and faster to meet the deadline of the sales plan. Some of my bad impression on him are:

1. When a task takes quite long because there are many details to take care of at a low-level point of view but he's always thinking it was pretty easy to complete (which, I think, is based on his believe about the ability of coding assistance tools like GitHub Copilot).
2. When there are bugs, his style of communication feels like blaming the team for bugs late deadlines. But when the responsibility belongs to him, he seems to shut off and says nothing. The system lacks proper testing so it's been very hard to detect bugs early during development.
3. He doesn't really have practical software development experience but he acts like he knows everything and is smart. He has a PhD degree, and his work history includes being a research assistant, co-founding a tech startup, and an engineering manager at a big tech (FAANG). He can code but the coding projects look like toy demos.

I know that a startup needs to move fast, and I sometimes (voluntarily) work overtime to meet deadlines without being paid for the overwork. But the stress of working with the CTO is overwhelming me now. Maybe it sounds like I'm being a childish guy but that's why I'm here. I'm looking for opinions and difference perspective from more senior devs about this situation. Are the bad impressions I had my personal problems that can be improved? Should I look for another opportunity?

Although stressful, I'm still working here because:

* It has a good enough pay in the current market situation.
* I'm passionate in developing a product that drives true economic value. It also enables me to have real-world startup experience for my future entrepreneurship plan.
* They give me equities. It might be small but if the company succeeds, it will be a big amount of money in my country. The money will allow me to pursue entrepreneurship in the future.

1fb3t2w,Is long distance the only way if you move around for work?,"Context: 21F, never dated anyone, never even had a first kiss, been on like three first dates total. 

So I’m in my fourth/last year in college and it’s only just now occurred to me that it’s too late to start dating in this area. I’m planning on moving away the second I graduate since this city has no job opportunities in my field (cities that could work would mainly be: New York(my home), Los Angeles, and some cities in Canada) And I want to only date for long term, no hookups or flings

*Ideally* I’d move back to NY and work like hell to get a job offer over there. But my job is mostly short term employments based off projects. So there’s always the risk that I’d have to temporarily move to another city for a job. 

All this to say, I want to date. I’m open to it. But if I enter my first relationship ever, I don’t think I could do that with it inevitably becoming a long distance relationship. Meeting people I’m interested in in my field of work/study wouldn’t even be a solution bc there’s no guarantee that we’d end up working in the same cities at the same time. But do I really have a choice?

Are long distance relationships just a reality I’m going to have to accept regardless of if it’ll make me feel satisfied??

1fb38uy,"Chose the wrong project, stick to it or request change?","I am a policy researcher who recently tried exploring a new sector to work on (public health/environmental health). I recently got hired for a project and attended my first meeting with the whole team. There were two of us who were new hires (the other one has knowledge and exp in the sector).  

There were 2 smaller teams formed that will work on two different research outputs. Basically, the first one was more of inventory/stocktaking of old policies while the other one was producing a new law (oversimplified for brevity). I was originally assigned to the latter one.

During the meeting, the project head surprisingly asked us to pick the output we want to work on. We were only given a minute to explain and choose. Caught off guard, and having little knowledge and exp in the sector, i chose the first choice because it looked more familiar to me. I chose the path of least resistance. It was given to me, while the other output was given to the other new hire (which she was happy about). We hit the ground running and have set deadlines for our work.

However, when i got home and had more time to read and learn about the options, i realized that the 2nd option was more interesting and that I could contribute to the other output too. I am now regretting my decision and disappointed in myself for being inarticulate during meetings and for sticking to the ""seemingly easier"" path. 

Can i ask for advice if i should ask my boss if there's a possibility of reassignment or will this come out as amateur/indecisive/negative? Should i just stick to the option i chose even if it will be somewhat uninteresting (for the next 4 months)?",Bitter_Violinist4757,1,1.0,0,1725702203,2024-09-07 09:43:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fb38uy/chose_the_wrong_project_stick_to_it_or_request/,9,2024
1fb2mr3,"BA’s, MBA’s, CFP’s. Please HELP!!","BA’s, MBA’s, CFP’s. Please give me your honest, unfiltered opinions. 


I am getting a very late start on my professional career, but I recently had a complete career change and want an investment into my future. 

I’m currently knocking out my prerequisites at a community college. My plan is to finish with my prerequisites summer 2025, then transfer to a different online school to get my Bachelors In Business Administration. That is set in stone. After that is where I want advice from you all. 

However, my back ground is NOT in finance. I currently work hard labor in manufacturing plants. So my plan as of now is to get a BA degree and take that route, which I feel pretty confidently will get me 80k post graduation with my direct experience. Tbh, that’s not bad money, and would come very easy as far as work/life balance. But on the downside, my income ceiling in that career path would be 150k. I am by no means saying that’s not something to be proud of, but someone close to me has told me I’d make a fantastic CFP. She is not a CFP herself, but she works in a LARGE firm and has her brokers license. 

The job of a CFP sounds fantastic to me, but I do not necessarily like the fact that they’re commission based. Just looking for honest opinions.



1. For those of you that got your MBA, what career path did you choose? The most common I’ve seen is taking the finance route. 

2. Would it be worth my while to forget the MBA and just get a CFP? 

3. Should I try to pursue both? 

I understand I’m being pretty vague, but I would really like to hear anyone’s thoughts regarding the private equity/financial consulting world and what I could expect if I chose that route ",thuffman1364,1,1.0,1,1725699404,2024-09-07 08:56:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fb2mr3/bas_mbas_cfps_please_help/,9,2024

1fb2b17,"I potentially have a higher offer coming but like my current job, how to work a potential counteroffer","I work at a smaller company that I like. The culture is good. No micromanagement. However, I had a recruiter reach out to me for a role that would be a pay increase. I make 170k base, the new offer is 150k + 60-75K bonus or total 210-225k. So it's be a 40k-55k increase. This is not a done deal, I still have to get an offer, however I am just preparing myself as I think that is always best.

There is another aspect in I get equity at my current company, however it is far below others near my level. I'm at 1/6th the amount of others near my level in equity I figured out from one of them. There could be an explanation to this though. The individual I spoke with said when he first started, he was awarded 0 equity, then 1 year into the job, they awarded him 40,000 shares. My experience was that I was initially awarded equity unlike him, but it was at 1/6th the amount he got awarded 1 year in. I've been working 1.25 years at my current company, so I should be due for this, and I'm told by my manager that I'm doing an excellent job.

The thing is that it is a small company, and the owner has 100% control over every single little thing. He has been extremely busy with our 7 or so projects rarely in the office. On top of that they said they'd start their first employee review in March (because mass exodus of employees) I guess they figured out they need to do employee reviews for potential promotions, equity, pay, etc. However it is now September, 6 months later, and they still haven't done 1 single review for the 25 employees. It just keeps being put off. I have asked my manager 3 or so times over the last 3 months that I was told from another about their share count vs mine being 1/6th others (about 5 people nonrelated to owners) that are near my level. He keeps telling me sorry we haven't gotten to it yet, but gives me no definitive date or seemingly effort to push the owners to do it.

When I figured out I was getting 1/6th the amount of equity as others near my level, in addition to getting no action from asking my boss over a 3 month span to ask the owners for reconsideration, I was also approached by a recruiter. He told me about the role and the compensation, basically 170k (plus small equity) now vs 150k + 60-75k bonus. I might add (in a non-flattering way) I went to an Ivy League university, worked at Fortune 50 companies and am around 30-32 years old, so that may help in assessing if I'm asking for too much or not.

As crazy this sounds, the company culture is still good. I like how much ownership I get over the things I do, very very large things that someone at another company would need much more higher level title to do. Like basically planning, signing term sheets and PSAs for a $10 billion+ project. I like the people I work with. Just management doesn't pay attention enough to when people are making 1/6th the amount of others in equity or when someone deserves a promotion. The headcount has gone down 35% because combo of laying off older high positions people that didn't really do anything, and younger people that weren't as high positions leaving. I should add that one worker just left for another job, the owners tried their best to counteroffer to get her to stay but she wanted the specific work the new company did. So someone has successfully gotten them to try.",Grand-Literature6583,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1725697925,2024-09-07 08:32:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fb2b17/i_potentially_have_a_higher_offer_coming_but_like/,9,2024

1fb1c2b,"Great job offer, but unsure if it is the best for my career","Hello, 

Need some advice on a decision regarding a job offer I got or to stay at current job.

Thing is, after turning in my two weeks notice, my boss was reluctant of me going away, spoke daily about it for the last two weeks and I mean daily, also with his boss had the talk twice. So at the last day, and after being told how much I was letting go in regards to salary increase and bonus and career potential. I was given the promise of being given a Supervisory role (currently an individual contributor) by December by my boss and his boss, this role will provide the possibility of then becoming a manager at the site or at a different site within the same company after getting a year of experience at the minimum. In order to get to that Supervisory role, I would need to work on certain goals that I know I am able to strive for succesfully in the next couple of months. This promotion will come with an increase of 10-15% in salary, putting me at 122-127k by December, thus shortening the gap with the new job offer. Staying with the current company will also ensure that I am exposed to more visible projects with the current site and with corporate, ensuring my name gets out there and allowing for the manager role to come more easily.
Also I have been promised something before in the company and they did delivered on it.

Now for some awareness on both jobs.

Current job:
Most senior member in title, close to being highest in pay, yet that is fine as the difference between the YOE between me and highest maker in the department is over 10, yet salary difference is about 4%. Salary at 110k. This job allows me to live with my family and dog and see my girlfriend regularly even if the commute is long.

Pros:
Promoted twice in three and a half years. (Started at 65k now 110k, showing how much effort I put in and their compensation for it).
One substantial merit increase of 8% on top of the regular increase after the first promotion.
Have learnt the most throughout my career
Company in existence for more than 50 years.
Flexibility on my time of entry (some weeks I can come in at 5 AM others at 10/11 AM as they best fit me).
1 WFH day each week.
Current product project assigned is really important for the site.
Great culture.

Cons:
Commute is 50 min at minimum each way (If I have an important commitment at rush hour this can be easily 1 hour and 20 or 30 minutes each way as well, as an example this week had to drove 2 hours on Tuesday and 1:40 on Wednesday to get to work, left early so was able to only do the 50 minutes on the way back).
Product is nothing new or exciting.
Current product project asigned has suffered enormous delays outside of my control (we are talking years).
Management of current project does not have a clear path to launch the product.
Some coworkers keep on needing to be taught the same task multiple times, as an example a simple task has been taught over 4 times just this quarter.
No mentors on site.
Boss is not able to provide knowledge on industry practices.
I am the most knowledgeable person of the department in regards to the use of industry tools, softwares, data analysis, data interpretation, data extraction, task automation. This in part to no one else in the department steping up to different challenges regarding these topics so I had to learn a lot in order to complete tasks. Also my background and general hungriness, only person that knows how to write code in the entire department so you know how that goes.

New job:
Company is a startup that has been around for less than 10 years but more than 5. Has a valuation of around 10 billion. Headcount has increased 4x in the last two years. Their offer is 140k plus RSUs valued at 25k each year. Will need to relocate. Relocation assistance is provided.

Pros:
After relocation the commute will be 20 mins by car. Could even bike.
Cool technology being developed plus is more of what some will call a tech company with top of the line products.
Free breakfast, lunch and dinner on site.
Abbility to bring my own dog some days on site.
Working on the newest company products.
High growth potential both of RSUs and internally.
Fully covered medical package.
Who will be my boss knows his stuff which indicates that I will have someone that can teach me.
Onsite gym.

Cons:
Will need to relocate, thus leaving my family, dog and girlfriend behind. Though not so far away that I will still be able to see them on weekends if I commute 2 hours.
No current path to become a manager, potentially delaying my long-term career goals by two or three years.
No 401k.
Will live alone in an apartment.
Unsure about WFH potential, maybe none.
Unsure about flexibility with arrival time.
Company has been around for less than 10 years and even with a valuation in the billions the unexpected could still happen.

1fb0ozz,"I’m too confused and dumb to choose which career path should I choose at 22, could you guys help me with the insights  (I would really appreciate if you can read the whole post :)","I'm interested in so many things, but I'm completely unsure which one I should pursue and focus on learning. For context, I have a degree in Political Science, but none in the fields I'm currently exploring. Let me share a bit about my situation.

In the past, I’ve done some graphic design work, which naturally led me to develop an interest in motion graphics. However, here’s the catch—I don’t know how to draw, which makes me skeptical about whether I could handle creating animations. This uncertainty has held me back from fully committing to learning motion design. Additionally, in my country, there aren’t many roles specifically for motion graphics designers; most of these jobs also require video editing skills, which adds another layer of hesitation for me.

I’m also quite interested in UX design because I want to pursue something that involves design and offers job opportunities. I’m skilled in Figma, but I’m hesitant about this path for a few reasons. Recently, there’s been a flood of posts about people leaving UX design, claiming the field is becoming oversaturated, and that it’s difficult to break into because companies are unwilling to train new recruits. On top of that, I don’t have a degree in UX design, which makes me even more unsure.

Another field I’m drawn to (and reasonably decent at) is coding, particularly web development. I’ve taken a Udemy course on it, and I can build websites, which really excites me. However, the issue in my country (India) is that most companies prefer candidates with a Computer Science degree, and the market is flooded with CS degree holders, making me feel like my chances are slim. I’ve also learned Webflow and Framer, but to truly excel in any of these, I know I would need to choose one path and let the others go, which is a tough decision.

My mind feels cluttered because I’m fascinated by all these fields, and I don’t know which one to focus on. Right now, I divide my day into 4-5 parts to work on all of them, but deep down I know that won’t help me master any of them, and that scares me, 

I really want a job in next few months as my current situation isn’t very good and I would need to get a job as soon as possible 

I’d really appreciate any guidance or advice you can offer. How do I make the right choice?",aariv02,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1725690705,2024-09-07 06:31:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fb0ozz/im_too_confused_and_dumb_to_choose_which_career/,9,2024

1faytcb,Career satisfaction or good salary?,"Hello. I’m a 28F in some sort of quarter life crisis. Life turned out not as i planned, which is very normal, but I can’t navigate it. 

Career satisfaction is very important to me but I feel like I can’t be privy to that as I am living in my parents house and basically broke and should be looking for jobs based on salary for my independence sake. 

I graduated with a degree in Pharmaceutical and cosmetic science which I’m not using because I kind of fell out of interest with it. So I moved to Abu Dhabi to be a science teacher for 4.5yrs which was terrible, the country, people and children! Took a serious toll on my mental health which I’m still managing. I came back to do part time for about a year to get my mind straight and recalibrate on what I want to do. I’m a swimming teacher and have been so since I was 16 and has always been my nest to come back to in education and now. I’ve recently just come back from Summer Camp in America where I was a Waterfront director which was amazing. It felt amazing experiencing something new and developing new skills, especially first time in a management position. 

Now I’ve come back home. Really sad and overwhelmed because now is the time to job search for a full time job which I really want to as I don’t necessarily want to go back to swim teaching even though I love it. I’ve been searching around for what sounds appealing but it’s hard to search for something you don’t know what you’re looking for.

For a fact, I know I will not go back into school teaching. I love working with kids but also socializing and communicating with people in general, especially if I can help people. I love traveling and exploring new places. I love problem solving and learning new skills, even better if it’s continuous learning. I love seeing the progress I make in a job or situation, Not progress that is dependent on others outcomes. I love being active and outside, especially around water. 

As you can see I know exactly what I don’t like. But have no real suggestions on what I could like! Any advice on what I could do or try to navigate myself would be soooo verrry much appreciated!

1fayqud,Want to quit my job out of principle. ,"Long story short, my bosses ignored me when I asked for additional vacation days per year. Ive had the same amount of vacation for the last 10 years and I'm good at my job. I followed up again days later and got ignored again (I work fully remote). This isn't the first time I've felt ignored or not supported by the owners of my company. I've been with them for 10 years now and I'm at my breaking point. I make a higher salary at this company than most in my career but that's also because the workload and pace is way faster than other companies I've worked out. Because I make good money I also feel somewhat trapped. I really want to say f*** it and quit out of principle. I don't feel like I want to work for people who think it's ok to ignore their employees. They think they own me because I do make above my career standard. If I quit, I will take a pay cut for my next job unless I pivot to a different career in the same general industry. That may be easier said than done. I know it's not the smartest to quit without another job lined up but I feel so frustrated. I can live for two years without a job if I had zero income in the meantime. This is all years in the making. What do you think? Is it dumb to quit out of principle? I feel like it would be good for my soul to quit out of principle even if it's a financial set back.

1fayb1m,I hate university (rant) (need advice),"So I’m a 21 year old male who is currently attending university, I’m studying a bachelor of arts majoring in history and I am then going to do a post graduate teaching degree. 

Some backstory. When I finished high school I went straight into university and absolutely hated it. I deferred my course and applied to join the army. I was halfway through the the process of joining however I had a change of heart and thought I would at least try to get my degree, as my parents were saying I should at least try to get my degree. (I love my parents so I agreed with them)

Fast forward to the present, I absolute despise university. It’s got nothing to do with the work or anything like that I just hate the uni lifestyle. I can’t even begin to tell you the amount of times I have pulled over on the way to classes and questioned if I even belonged in the classroom as I hated it. As well as this, university is advertised as a place to be yourself however if you speak out about something and it’s not from a “they/them” perspective you get crucified. The teachers are all fucking retarded as well. One of my subjects was based on the history of Greek philosophy. We were talking about stoicism and the whole time everybody was just shitting on the idea of stoicism (including the teacher) instead of actually teaching the concept and what not. I can understand if you don’t agree with it but forcing your idea of it being shitty down my throat instead of being neutral towards it and actually teaching is in my opinion very wrong. 

University is shit and i absolutely hate it because it’s filled with an anti masculine demographic where if your a straight white male your looked down upon.

I would like to apologise if I have offended anyone but I need some advice. I want to join the army but at the same time I only have two to three years left of uni but I hate it so much I don’t think I can see it through.

1fax6ne,It it wrong of me to let my new boss know I’d like to apply to a different job and to ask for her help in getting that job?,"My last job was in the emergency room. I loved it. It gave me meaning. I had a passion for it. I moved states recently. I didn’t get a job in the ER. I found a job at the same hospital in a neurology clinic. I’ve been working there for only one week. I dislike it immensely. It’s bringing out a depressed side of me. The patient interaction there barely holds any meaning, and anyone could do the job. 95% of it is computer work and sitting. I have no passion for this job. I feel like a shell of a person and broke down in tears today. I want a job I love, and the ER is just that. 

A position opened back up in the ER. I miss the care I would give to patients. There’s a personal touch in the ER that gave me purpose. Is it wrong of me to be honest with my boss and let her know I’d like to apply to the ER (again) and ask if she has any pull to help me get the position? They only hire pre med students (I found this out a couple days ago), which I find unethical but oh well. I am very qualified to continue in the ER and am good at it and love it. But it’s selfish of me to quit after one week. I took the position over other applicants. And I wasted time of coworkers who trained me. 

Every crossroad in life I’ve had that’s similar to this, I put in my time and suck it up. But I’m really trying to look out for myself now.

1fax0dy,"Seeking advice: direct report is spinning out due to unrealistic expectations, becoming aggressive, and I am mentally and emotionally drained ","




Hi everyone, I’m in need of some advice because I’m really struggling with a situation at work that’s taking a huge toll on my mental health. I’ve been at my company for almost 8 years, and I’ve always loved working here, but now I’m starting to feel completely drained. Here’s what’s going on:

Recently, we had a team restructuring, and now one of my direct reports, “A,” has become extremely difficult to manage. A has been with the company for a year, and from the beginning, we bonded over shared interests and got along well. She was always very friendly with me, and we even talked about personal things outside of work. However, since I became her manager, things have taken a turn.

Despite only being here for one year, A is already demanding a promotion to a senior-level role, a position that typically requires much more experience than she has. One issue is, I’ve only been her manager for two months, and I don’t know her work product well enough yet to give detailed feedback. I manage using a servant-leader style, meaning I go out of my way to make sure my team is comfortable, happy, and successful, sometimes to a fault. I’ve spent hours and hours with A in 1:1 meetings, trying to gently pull information from her about how she’s feeling and what I can do to support her.

But despite all my efforts, she wasn’t direct with me about her frustrations. Instead, she was complaining to everyone else in the group but me, and people kept coming to me unprompted in confidence to tell me. After weeks of trying to get her to open up, I found out through HR that she secretly applied for a senior position on my team  without telling me, despite me being her direct manager and the hiring manager for the role. She had not mentioned her frustration to me once yet at this point. I was actually relieved when I found out, thinking that this would finally bring her concerns out into the open, but now I feel way worse.

What makes this even more frustrating is that A is being paid $35K more than others in the same role as her, and in fact, she makes more than some of the senior-level employees in our team. Despite this, she still feels entitled to a promotion after only one year. There are people on our team who have been here way longer than she has, with far more experience—some of them have been in this field for 8 or more years—and they are still below her in terms of compensation. It feels completely out of line for her to be demanding even more when so many others have put in the time and effort to grow at a more realistic pace.

When I confronted A about applying for a promotion behind my back, the conversation went horribly. She attacked my credibility as a manager and twisted my words, making the entire interaction even more intense and emotionally draining. It was so bad that it wrecked me for the entire weekend. I deal with complex trauma from my childhood as well as severe ADHD so I had a terrible bout of RSD (rejection sensitivity dysphoria), and this situation triggered it so badly that I ended up crying in my home office for two days straight and was emotionally exhausted for days. It’s not just affecting my work—it’s affecting my life outside of work, too.

When I confronted her about going behind my back to ask if there was any reason she wouldn’t feel comfortable talking to me about this directly, she denied it, chalked it up to a miscommunication, and flipped the conversation around on me and became intense and aggressive.  I tried to explain to her at this company we do not promote people after one year, it’s typically closer to 2 or 3 years before you can expect a promotion. During our conversation, she gaslit me and made several personal attacks, including:
- The fact that I wouldn’t advocate to  promote people like her after one year of extremely good performance reflects poorly on me as a manager and on the company as a whole- I am disincentivizing employees from working hard and this will be a huge issue for talent retention 
- “it’s nice that you’re trying to be nice and you constantly tell me that you want to make sure I’m happy comfortable and successful, but I did not ask for that. What I’ve asked for repeatedly is clear and concrete guidance on what I need to do to get promoted or why you won’t promote me and you have given me absolutely nothing”
- It’s inappropriate and unacceptable that I am comparing her tenure to others on the team when I should only speak about her, and I am telling her it’s an elevator where she has to wait 3 years which is unacceptable 
- She also brought up how we had discussed in the past that another colleague who she used to work with doesn’t make anywhere near as much money and how I wanted to help them (neither were my direct report at the time) and also apparently bringing up how long a different colleague has been with the company. She said I am inappropriate and claimed these things have no relevance to her situation or her performance, despite this conversation not being a performance review but a discussion about her applying for a role behind my back.
-She said she is uncomfortable having me as her advocate because clearly I am where her advocating goes to die and will not be shared with anyone else
-She said it’s not her fault or responsibility that others do not know how to advocate for themselves 

To make things even more confusing, after our heated conversations (where I totally kept my cool and she did not see me sweat), A goes right back to acting like we’re best friends. She texts me cute animal pictures or funny reels like nothing ever happened. While she forced down my boundary between work and personal life and this kind of friendly behavior was normal between us before, it feels really strange now because she’s obviously unhappy with me as her manager. She’s constantly telling other people how frustrated she is, yet she’s pretending like everything is fine with me personally and sending me extra nice fake messages. I don’t know how to handle the mix of hostility at work and fake friendliness outside of it. I don’t want her to think that I am okay with how she talked to me. 

Several colleagues have come to me unprompted to let me know A has been talking negatively about me behind my back, saying she needs a new manager because I’m not advocating for her promotion. The day the restructuring was announced, she told my direct report who has reported to me for years that she was shocked I was her manager because she just views me “as another member on the team” and “not as a manager” - to which my direct report was extremely offended because they have reported to me for years and said they love reporting to me and having me as their manager. But when it comes to me directly, she refuses to have a straightforward conversation about her frustrations.

I finally went to my boss (the head of our group) and explained everything. My boss was surprised by A’s behavior and said it was completely unacceptable and unprofessional. They advised me to document everything with HR for my protection but also told me they wouldn’t change A’s reporting line because they don’t want to “reward bad behavior.” I agree that the behavior is unacceptable and shouldn’t be rewarded, but I am at my wits end and this has been eating away at me, and I am totally walking on eggshells. 

Now I feel completely stuck. I’m scared for when A finds out that I went to the head of the group. The whole situation is already tense and awkward, and I feel stressed even getting an email from her or knowing that we’ll have to attend conferences together. What makes it worse is that I used to love working here, but this situation has changed my entire view of the company. I’m so mentally and emotionally drained that I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this.

Here’s where I need advice:
1. How do I manage A without letting this drain me mentally and emotionally every day? I’m struggling to set boundaries and not internalize her behavior.
2. Is it unreasonable for me to push for A to be reassigned to another manager, even though my boss is against it?
3. Am I being overly dramatic for considering leaving if this situation doesn’t improve? It feels unsustainable for me to continue managing her, and it’s really affecting my mental health.
4. How do I deal with the confusing dynamic of her being aggressive at work but pretending to be friendly outside of it?

I’ve bent over backward to be fair and supportive, but it’s starting to impact my personal life, and I really don’t know how much more I can take. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

1fawxyd,Is it horrible of me to let my new boss know I’d like to apply for a new job and to ask if she has any pull helping me get it?,"I’ve been working in a neurology clinic for a week. I’m feeling really depressed since starting. My last job was in the emergency room. There was lots of patient interaction at my old job and I had a passion for it and it gave me meaning. My new job has less meaningful patient interaction that anyone can do. I have no passion for this new job and it’s 90% computer work which I didn’t expect. I applied for the ER position and didn’t get it. These jobs are all in the same hospital. I found an ER tech the other day and asked her questions, and she said mostly pre med students get hired for the position I wanted which is unethical in my opinion. I’m gonna be a PA and would LOVE to work in their ER, so it’s dumb they’re only hiring pre med students. Anyways, I’m feeling like a shell of a person at this job and I moved to this new state to start life over and find happiness. Knowing there’s a job 500 feet away from me that can make me happy breaks my heart. A position opened back up, but I’m with this neuro clinic now. I’d like to be fully honest with my boss and let her know I’d like to apply to the ER (again) despite only being with them for a week and ask if she has any pull helping me get in. My last job was the same ER position I want. I’m qualified and really really want this. I’d normally just suck it up, put in 12 months and get a new job, but I’m really trying to look out for myself even though I feel really unprofessional and wrong to quit so soon. Especially after getting the neuro position over the other applicants. I wish I had shadowed the position before accepting. I was SO excited to start the job. I even had a countdown on my fridge. But it just isn’t a good fit for me and is draining the life out of me and I don’t feel good in the head. I want my job to bring me joy, and I know the ER can. But it’s selfish of me to do this at the expense of my boss and clinic and all the employees who train new comers.

Have you ever left a job, went back to it, and then left again before? 

I’ve been at my current job for just under 3 years. I recently left this job for a month to pursue a job with higher earning potential, but hated the company culture and day to day of the job itself.

My old job took me back with open arms, but after 3 months I find myself browsing jobs and unhappy again (imagine that). This was my doing and I’ll own it, but I feel stuck now as this would definitely ruin my reputation if I were to leave again so soon.

1favxkv,How to deal with being used as a bargaining chip?,"I'm pretty exhausted with my old company and I'm not sure how to make it any clearer that I have zero interest in going back to work for them. Long story short I took a job at Company A to get my foot in the door in a new industry. It ended up being the most toxic place I ever worked and felt like the entire company hadn't progressed past the 1950s. I did absolutely nothing related to my job title while I was there. Even though the atmosphere was awful I was paid to do a job and I did it well. After a while I got a new manager and things went from bad to worse. He was just an over all garbage human being and upper management refused to do anything about him. Eventually I decided the job wasn't really worth it and quit. After I left and they figured out no one knew how to do my job they started blowing up my phone, social media, and emails trying to get me back. I ignored everything and the messages died down for a bit.

I started working for Company B a little while later. The atmosphere was completely different. My coworkers and management are pretty awesome. The problem is I work in a a very close knit industry. Company A provides products and services for Company B. When they found out I got a job there they started using their contacts at my company to try to convince my upper management that I should go back to work for them. They sugar coated the reasons I quit and tried to make it seem like a misunderstanding so my management was sympathetic at first. After talking to me and doing their own digging they were disgusted with what they learned was going on there.

It turns out while I was gone Company A never back filled my position so they just quit offering the work I did to company B. Now Company A is trying to tell my current company that they wont get the product they've paid absurd amounts of money for unless I come back because they cant find anyone else to do the work. My company seems kind of divided on how to move forward. With massive amounts of money on the line some think I should stay put but I've overheard some closed door discussions of some upper management trying to come up with some promotion/ payout to get me to go back. There is a chance that if they stop doing business with my old company they cant find another local one to complete the work and I cant do any of the work they need done in house. I really want to just move on and focus on my new job. I'm not really sure how to put this all to rest. Its going to blow up really soon and I'm just tired of hearing about them.

That full-time conversion also happened during a period of mass layoffs at the company. I'm doing a solid job, have had consistent positive feedback, and continuously receive new projects and responsibilities in my current role.

When receiving a full-time conversion offer, I negotiated for a small salary bonus, with the company adding the stipulation that I'd have to pay it back if I left the job before completing 1 year in the role. How ""official"" or binding that stipulation is is questionable, though, but it was noted by the recruiter when doing the negotiations with the hiring manager. I always interpreted this stipulation as the company saying ""we like you and you're good at your job, but we know this isn't your dream job, and want to make it worth our own while if we're giving you a bonus."" 

I'm wondering now as I explore new positions at the company if there is some sort of HR flag prompted by that bonus stipulation that's only visible to internal hiring managers anytime I apply. Prior to converting full-time, I had landed an interview for higher-level jobs in different parts of the company, but haven't received any interviews since converting. I also heard through office gossip of a another employee, same department but different team, who's resume was being flagged by HR and stopped from being passed forward for jobs, but that was more because of behavioral issues that colleague was demonstrating. 

I applied to another internal job just a few days ago that was a strong fit, reached out to the hiring manager who was inviting people to reach out to them, and said hiring manager told me that HR was reviewing resumes and would reach out if there was a fit. I interpreted some response as better than nothing, but also wonder if there's more to it because of the reasons described above.

1faro0z,Odd expectations conversation coming from my manager - help,"I returned from maternity leave and not longer after, we had performance reviews. I wasn’t eligible to actually do one but I did get a small raise. When my manager told me about it, they told me that I left as a strong performer and the expectation is I will still be a strong performer. I must have looked confused because it’s like, “duh, I will continue to do my job,” because they doubled down and said, “I know you just came back from maternity leave but we just want to make sure we see your impact especially because we’ve done your raise.” 

I’m still confused because it feels lowkey threatening to me. While I admit I haven’t done as much before I went on leave, I came back to a new team with new team members and I’m trying not to step on anyone’s toes with regards to their work in progress. I’m honestly trying to find my footing again but also, I’ve heard rumors that tenured employees are performance managed out, esp in roles where there isn’t a clear productivity metric to measure performance. I have anxiety so I’ve resorted to documenting literally everything I do and now my manager is asking me to create a new page to document my work that can be shared with senior management. 

How do I approach this? Ignore because whatever, they just asked me to do my job? Ask for clairication?

1faqlyr,What is the name of my position? Is it a valuable job ? ,"Hello, 

I've been employed for 2 years in a position in a semi-public - private research lab. 

The unit I'm in does research on lasers and lidar (with aerospace, defense and other applications).

My job title is embedded systems engineer but I don't think that's the same as embedded systems engineer. 



- FPGA (on Xilinx Zynq and Ultrascale chips) + C/C++ drivers

- Python (I create interfaces for manips, implement algos (or do them with my poor laser skills \^\^), port to GPU with CUDA, a bit of pytorch, multiprocessing, python drivers...)

- C/C++ for some algos and a little on the STm board, but not much in the end

- Some Sysadmin for PCs and nas

- Electronics: schematic design and PCBs.



That's pretty much my job. What do you think my job is called? 

I think it's great because it's very varied and very interesting, but I wonder if it's really a job that will be rewarding for the future? How do I sell myself? I'm not an expert in anything, I just touch everything...

1fapmtj,Haven’t picked up a shift in a year but still “employed” and unsure how to proceed ,"I would like to preface that I am fully aware now that what I did was extremely irresponsible and shameful. Now, I’m trying to do damage control and would really appreciate advice and insight. 

I started a crisis position at a large organization in June 2022. I moved to a relief position about October 2022. I haven’t picked up a shift since July 2023, so a year ago. No one has emailed me about my absence and I still get shift notifications so I know I’m still employed. 

I started graduate school Sep 2023 and I genuinely thought it was okay to keep the role but not pick up shifts so I could keep “being employed” on my resume. I had seen old co workers do this when they began graduate school but haven’t followed up with them. 

Now, I am having to apply for my graduate school internship and want a new job but don’t know what to do and feel extremely in over my head and ashamed. 

1) would appreciate guidance on how to reach out to my old employer. For context, my old supervisors were extremely kind and supportive. 

2) Do I write my last shift as my ending date on my resume? What would the ending date be?

3) Any other advice/insight/someone to talk to would be so so appreciated.

1fapaw9,Company not willing to budge on Salary. What do I do?,"A few weeks ago, I put in an application for an open Customer Service Representative and then the day before I was supposed to be interviewed, I withdrew my application and was going to decide to just stay at my current position which I really enjoy. Currently, I work 4:30am to 2:30pm. The two managers I'd be working under and HR still insisted on having a 'get to know you meeting'. Turns out the, they both loved be and wanted me to accept the potion. I told them I'd think about it. We've been going back and forth for the past week or so working things out. The position would be from ""8-5"" but more realistically probably 7:30-4:30 or so. With work from home if you're sick or have a doctor's appointment etc. This year, I'm going to make about $60,387 based on what I've made so far this year average each week extrapolated over the rest of the year. I make $24/hour base pay so $49,920 and the rest is overtime. 

I got an official job offer today, they offered $60,000 with 'up to' 5% bounus per year and I told them my number was $65,000. They held from at $60,000 and I offered to spilt the difference(against good advice) at $62,500.

The CEO/President pulled me into what would be my direct managers office and said 'this isn't emotional, it's numbers' and stated I made a lot of money from working overtime and that I couldn't always count on that and that it might be reduced next year and going forward as the end of the year is kind of slow.

First, I don't think my ask of $2500 more per year than their offer was unreasonable, it's $50 more per week. They will spend more than that recruiting, on boarding and training a completely new person in my opinion. Second, isn't it supposed to be a negotiation? The fact that they wouldn't budge from their first and Initial actual offer really kind of irked me and made me kind of put off from taking the position now anyway. Weirdly and surprisingly, my plant manager/operations manager said I should go back to my original ask on Monday at $65,000 and tell them take it or leave it. I'd be happy at that amount. I don't think I'm going to do that since I have already told them I would accept $62,500 and I believe your word means the most. Stand by what you say if you want to have any integrity. Yes, I fucked myself on that one but will live with it.

Any advice? Should I just tell them I'm not at all interested anymore or would it be dumb to go back and ask for $65,000 now?

I feel like if they pursued me after I withdrew my application and told them no a further two to three times, they must want me pretty bad, right? Also, I've always worked in manufacturing and have been hourly my whole career and this would be my first time working on the office. I think I'm just going to be straight up and tell them that their unwillingness to negotiate at all left a sour taste in my mouth and I'm no longer interested unless it is at my initial ask. And would be fine staying in my current position even if that means making a little less because of supposed less overtime availability.",Bystronicman08,3,0.5699999928474426,60,1725654905,2024-09-06 20:35:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fapaw9/company_not_willing_to_budge_on_salary_what_do_i/,9,2024
1faoy1j,Was I rude in this interaction?,"After interviewing for an internship role at a company they gave me an offer, and just said I needed to get some preliminary stuff out of the way. One of those things was a drug test.

I went in, filled out the paperwork, and was told to come on back and pee in a cup. 

Before peeing, the doctor asked me to empty my
pockets and place my things on a cabinet sitting outside the bathroom. 

I wasn’t sure how long my stuff was going to be sitting there, and I wanted to be safe, so I asked to double check if my stuff (phone, wallet, keys) was going to be put somewhere secure. My exact words essentially were after she asked me to empty my pockets: “Gotcha. This gonna be put somewhere secure?” With a pretty neutral and inquisitive tone.

Immediately the doctor seemed taken aback and asked with an annoyed expression, still smiling, if I wanted my stuff to be put somewhere secure. I apologized, smiled, and said I wanted to be safe. She then said there were no other patients in the clinic at the time and I could grab my stuff as soon as I came out of the bathroom.

I’m still thinking about the interaction and am wondering if I sounded like an asshole? Anytime I’m asked to empty my pockets I usually double check where my stuff is being kept.

I hope I didn’t come across rude cause I hope to work at this place for a while and don’t wanna get on anyone’s bad side.

1faotoq,Should I move jobs 1.5 years after post-grad? Need advice,"Hello all, I need some advice. Sorry for the long post.

For my university program, I was obligated to take 4 full-time internships. I successfully completed them and at the last one, I was given a full-time offer and I happily accepted at 62k/year, 7% bonus, decent insurance. This is cost accounting in industry.

Fastforward to today, I have now been at the company for 1.5 years (4 months as an intern, 1year 1 month as a financial analyst). Originally, I really loved the job as my initial manager was great and was a great mentor for me. He would answer any call or text I sent him almost ASAP. And he never left me without training before assigning me work.

Around 1 year into my time at the company, I changed teams (I was sortve heavily persuaded to do this) as they needed to fill a position and I had most of the necessary skills + they were offering a slight raise to 70k. However, I realized that leaving my former manager was a bad idea as he was the biggest reason I really liked my position and the work. My new managers (I have 2 managers essentially as I'm split between 2 plant managers) are much less accommodating and rigid. They are often late 5-10 minutes to our meetings and are not great teachers. They teach fast, quick, rushed and expect great results. However, they are nice enough people.

It's now been 3-4 months with the new team and now I'm accustomed to the work (much heavier than my former position) but believe I made the wrong choice. I am not too happy about the move.

One thing to note is, when they advertised the new role to me, it was a ""promotion"" for a title to intermediate, but when I got my title change, I remained a junior. I did not like that, I mentioned it to them and they said it was a misunderstanding and was told I was in a great position for my experience level.

After that discussion with them, I instantly went on LinkedIn and applied to only two positions, not expecting anything from it as everyone says they applied to 100+ positions and got nothing back.

Well to my surprise, I got two interviews. I was delighted as I felt frustrated at the time with company. I proceed to do my interviews (one was a senior FA, the other was a regular FA). Both wanted to schedule a second interview. I complete the second stage and both offer me a job.

1st job: Regular FA, different industry, 85k base, 10% bonus, 20 mins longer commute, good benefits

2nd job: Senior role, 95k base, 7% bonus, shorter commute by 10 minutes. However, I feel very unprepared for the job as i'd be the only senior of the entire plant (its quite small to be fair, but is a big company). I am scared to get fired.

I learned ALOT during my time through my previous manager, and I do not want to lose the connection I had with him as he still helps me out in my new team if I reach out (as my new bosses are usually way too busy). I am constantly praised at my current work, but am not happy with how they treated me outside my original manager.

What do you guys think I should do?",SlipperySlope-,1,1.0,0,1725653682,2024-09-06 20:14:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1faotoq/should_i_move_jobs_15_years_after_postgrad_need/,9,2024

1fanhi1,Forced to take vaccine,"Hey, 21F

I know this isn’t career related but it’s school related. I’m in a nursing program and one of the requirements is to get 3 shots of vaccine. And I’d have to do them all within a month or less. I have thyroid disease and I’ve had arrhythmia in the past and here n there because my thyroid messes up my whole body. So I already have an overwhelming load of anxiety. I’m frightened to take the vaccine because I had someone in my family with hashimotos develop rlly bad issues after the vaccine and don’t feel the same since. It’s making me stressed. I don’t believe that anyone should be forced to take the vaccine. Especially considering how long ago it was. If it was back in Covid prime I would understand. I tried speaking to my doctor about adverse affects and he said “yeah I’m not sure, I can’t do anything as we don’t do any Covid shots here at the clinic” so I can’t even get exempt. I emailed the school board so I’m waiting for their reply to see if there’s a way to work around it 

My parents don’t want me to take it either so I guess if I have no choice I’d just drop out. I really wanted to complete this program.

1fanabq,Knowing when to say yes and when to push back. ,"Just sharing some general advice. 

First off, if you're hourly, don't ever work off the clock. If salary, in general, don't do it. Don't set up the expectation that you check emails outside of ""hours"". 

However, I am of the opinion, that it is ok to help out with something that's not part of your job. With that being said, know how to push back. Companies will exploit you, intentionally or unintentionally.

If someone wants you to do something, figure out if it is a 1x thing or something that you would end up being given as a regular thing. 1x? May earn you brownie points. Anything more, ""I don't have the time to take this on."" Ask where it is in your priorities. Ask what is being removed from your plate. Always act like you are busy as hell. 

Here is an example that happened to me. I work in sales. I'm a territory manager. I live in my territory, remote from the office. I got a call from my bosses boss. Company uses a vendor that is being difficult to work with. I was asked to go pay them a visit as they weren't returning calls/emails. This was potentially going to cost the company a $1 million + account. However, nothing to do with my business. (Global company). 

So, at this point, I said sure. I have a company car and was doing the 1.5 hr (each way) drive during work hours. This may not directly help me in the immediate but this is something I can keep in my back pocket for future use. 

Now fast forward a week. Situation didn't get fixed. Asked me to go visit again. I said, ""I can't on X day but possibly next day. I have things to do"". This was the unintentionally trying to exploit me. The person asking the 2nd time was not ""management"". End of that day, i emailed asking if they still needed me to do it. The situation ended up getting resolved. So I earned more credit for offering even though I pushed back on the inital ask.",Embarrassed_Flan_869,1,0.6000000238418579,0,1725649833,2024-09-06 19:10:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fanabq/knowing_when_to_say_yes_and_when_to_push_back/,9,2024

Some argue that quitting right after a reward shows a lack of loyalty and may hurt your reputation in the industry. On the other hand, others feel that employees should prioritize their career growth and personal needs, as bonuses and raises are part of compensation for work already done, not an obligation to stay longer.

1fam9d8,When you are asked to pivot a little too often,"Lately I'm very frustrated in my job because it seems like on a monthly basis we are facing some need to ""pivot"" or change course or look at options. 

First it was cost savings and then it was headcount and then it's slow down the project and then it's let's use this platform and the next week that platform isn't enough and it's another platform. Now most of our senior leadership team has changed/turned over and the new people have different needs/requests. 

I'm a senior director and I've had over 35 years of work so I'm used to shifts and changes etc but this is chaos. There are too many requests to shift and not enough direction, know what I mean? Where are we going? Why? What is going on? I don't think they even know. 

And then the problem is I have a team that works for me and I don't know how to explain all this to them other than ""we've been asked to look at option B"" and yet again they are asked to stop and start and then stop again and restart. 

Any advice would be helpful. 

*P.S. I am only a few years away from retirement so I'm not looking to leave or change careers. I want to bank as much salary as I can and keep contributing to that pension. So looking for another employer is just not what I want. When I stop I'm stopping and retiring.*

1fam0tk,Stressing about a job I interviewed for,"Hey guys,

This might be long but hoping for some advice.

I have my BA in Business Administration and my MBA that I graduated with back in 2010.  

I have had a rough go at finding jobs that would help me grow at both professionally and financially.

I am currently in a customer service role making about 60ishK in the telecommunications field.  I kind of gave up for quite awhile because I just felt like it was useless.  I have really bad anxiety so I struggle really bad with interviews.  I feel like even when I try to prepare, the rapid fire questions just get to me and I kind of blank so it messes up my chances.

I had applied for a claims position a few months ago.  The interview went very well because it was a bit more conversational.  I didnt get it because someone else had the actual claims position.  But the recruiter really liked me and wanted to work with me to help me get another position.  I applied and had the interview but it was rapid fire questions and I blew it and then the recruiter said that she didnt want to talk anymore because they need someone to be quick on their feet for the job.  

The issue is that I can but I get super nervous during interviews but I am perfectly capable of doing my job.

Anyways, I applied for another company.  This is more of my field so I do have the experience.  The interviews that I had were a lot more conversational and I did well.  Unfortunately I didnt get the position but they recommended for me a different position.  I have been in pretty good contact with the recruiter.  I had a great interview with the manager over that position.  I sent the recruiter an email to forward on to her Thanking her for the interview.  He responded and said he would reach back out for 2nd interview.  A week went by and I hadnt heard yet so I reached out to him.  He ended up emailing me back to and we set up an interview with the director.  

I just had my interview with the director yesterday.  It was very informal.  We talked about the position.  After I ended up emailing the recruiter to have him Thank the director but he never got back to me yesterday with a response and still havent heard today.  

I also emailed the actual hiring manager.  I guess I am not 100% if that was her actual email address because I dont know if her name is short for something else but havent received any response from her either.

I know this all probably makes me look crazy but I am kind of desperate to get a different job and as stated before I always struggle with interviews.   My dad recently died and my current job is extremely stressful and doesn't work well for my family since my dad is gone.  So I am full of emotions tbh on top of already suffering from extreme anxiety.

I know at this point I probably shouldnt make anymore attempts with contact but I am super worried that I messed up by bugging or what is really going on.  The wait is hard and I am full of panic because I just don't have any other job prospects.  

Be easy on me, I know I probably sound like a crazy person.  I promise I am not.  I just really want someone to give me a shot and the stress from my dad dying and the existing stress in my life has me over the top at this point.  

Any advice",knmc87,5,0.7799999713897705,2,1725646607,2024-09-06 18:16:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fam0tk/stressing_about_a_job_i_interviewed_for/,9,2024

1faku9g,Self marketing ,"Afternoon all, I am having a hard time coming to a decision regarding whether or not to stay in my industry. 

I've recently relocated back to my home town which is a decade or so behind the curve on their open-mindedness in many factors, but I'm specifically here to talk about the culinary market.

I've had the title of chef for about 7 years now and have worked in some very reputable places in my rural state and am very proud of myself for getting to where I am. That said, the food experience here is still focused on fast-casual with a number of ""finer"" places I can count on one hand and still have room to cont.

Now that I'm back home, in that same state, there is 0 opportunity for lateral movements. I'm not too proud to sling pans at a place that's decent and for people I have common enough ground with to move forward.

However I am worried that this move would be a detriment to my resume in the long run.

I've also thought about trying to do some self promotion and ""marketing"" to hopefully catch an eye or two.

So, I can't hold out forever just waiting for something to fall into my lap. Do I try to get in at ground level at one of the ""finer"" places, or bet on myself and try to see if there is any opportunity that isn't necessarily advertised via indeed?

1fakf87,"What do multinational corporations from Australia, USA, or the UK look for in a candidate’s portfolio/resume?","I’ve worked in small businesses for around 5 years in my career path and now I’m working in what can be considered a large corporation. It’s a government organisation. 

Naturally with bigger companies you have a team, which means your task is more focused in one area compared to being a single-member team in small companies. Smaller companies usually have more lax procedures and in my experience so far, one’s portfolio gets built faster. In my current company, even though my role is more focused in one area, there are lengthy procedures and policies to adhere to, which means processes are much longer and it takes a longer time to build my portfolio. 

The other thing about the organisation I’m in at the moment is that there’s no need for us to drive sales or any sort of registration. Most of what we do leans heavily to what the senior management wants to see. 

I’ve always dreamed of working in a multinational or overseas organisation and have yet to have the opportunity to break in. Currently, I feel like my career progression has slowed down tremendously due to the lengthy processes. I’ve been in my current role for 5 months so far, and if I were working in a small business, I’d have made positive changes by now. Coupled with the lack of need for success metrics that most other corporations would want to see, I had thoughts about leaving for another corporation because I’m afraid of what impact this could cause to my career progression. 

However, I was advised by someone close to me that it’d be worth to stay put for at least 2 years before thinking about moving on as the bigger companies I have my eye on in Australia, USA or the UK would more likely shortlist a candidate who has had experience working in large corporations, “especially if it’s a government organisation”. Other than successful teamwork, perhaps it also showcases that the candidate is able to follow strict policies and adhere to the company’s procedures. 

Can anyone advise if this is true? Would I have a higher chance of eventually working for an Australian, American or British company if I stay put and keep my skills relevant through courses/workshops, or should I start looking for my next venture soon?

1fak4xi,"Large out of pocket expenses, slow reimbursements","My job requires me to go to conferences. 

I really don't mind, but my current company requires us to pay for everything out of pocket then go through an extremely slow reimbursement process. Previous to this all my companies have had corporate credit cards.

Last time I was out several thousand dollars for a few months.

I'm being asked if I will go to a conference on short notice and I really don't have a few thousand dollars to loan these assholes for the next few months.

The entry fees alone for these conferences can be $2,000-4,000 at a time, plus airfare and hotel expenses in major downtown areas ($2,500 for that alone last time).

They don't even reimburse for the interest charges we rack up while they mess around with a 20-step reimbursement process that requires approvals from 8 different people all the way to to the CEO, and which starts completely over if one dumb person can't figure out how to open a PDF or even has a question. And once the same reimbursement comes through everyone's email for the second or third time, each person can take up to a week to click and approve it EVERY TIME.

They also don't reimburse until after the event, even though we often have to make arrangements months in advance! So we can be out the money for very long periods of time.

I don't know what to say and I need to go to promote a high profile product launch but I'm really unhappy about this. I didn't know until after I had started that they don't even have corporate credit cards.

I've been thinking about going to HR but I have no idea how to make that jump.

1faim2g,Career Alternatives for Engineer,"Hi all. Looking for input and suggestions on alternate career paths for a Mechanical Engineer. I graduated 4 years ago with my degree (25 years old now), and have found myself largely unhappy with both jobs I have held since then. My job I worked for 2 years as a sales engineer. Second job (coming up on 2 years as well) I am a systems engineer at an automotive supplier. Things I have disliked about my jobs:
1. Large amount of time in front of a computer with minimal social interaction. My eyes and wrist hurt daily from being at a computer all day. 
2. The stress (especially in my current position) of always having new problems to solve, without the experience to do such. Lots of demands coming from many different angles, especially being customer facing.
3. The sometimes long work hours (50-60), especially when I go to work not having a set time when I know I'll be done. 
4. I feel that no matter how many hours I put in, I am perpetually behind on my work as there is always something software with that is wrong or broken. 

Overall, my ideal career would be something where I can put in my 40 hours and leave and not think about work once I leave. Even better if it doesn't require living near a major city, and has good time off. The money has been good, but I value my time and mental freedom outside of work far more (even when I'm not at work I am stressed about work). I would much rather make less money and have more time. With all of this said, here are some career paths I have considered, with pros/cons.

High School Teacher
Pros: Summers off to travel, ""easy"", done at 3pm every day. Potential to live in rural area
Cons: Low starting salary, have to deal with kids (lol)

Electrician
Pros: Get to work with my hands, rewarding, job is done once you leave the site.
Cons: Potentially hard on body, potentially long hours, not as much vacation time?

HVAC Technician 
Similar to Electrician, possibly harder on body

Any other options are encouraged, I'm curious what people have to say. ",lowend_torq,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1725638044,2024-09-06 15:54:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1faim2g/career_alternatives_for_engineer/,9,2024

In interviews I get asked about the two short term roles (one filed for insolvency and we all got made redundant, the other my boss sexually harassed me which ended going to an employment tribunal which I won) 

I managed to secure my most recent job and it hasn't been the nicest. Manager can be quite nasty but I've stuck in out for almost 2 years, once I hit the 2 year mark I'd love to start applying elsewhere.

When employers ask me why my CV has so many gaps and why I've had two short term roles I don't know what to say. Sometimes I'm honest and straight up but it always makes things a bit awkward, or I tell them I was caring for a family member (not entirely untrue as I was a part time carer for a family member with stage 4 cancer for a while but this was more recent than my job gaps)

Between creepy bosses, unexpected redundancy and mental health declines I seem to have quite bad luck but I've got my shit together now. Can any help advise what to do? Should I take certain bits out of my CV? I've kept in my very first role as it's a really established company.

Content & Social Exec at small agency - Sep 2021-Nov 2021 (Company shut down and made almost everyone redundant, business has now closed) 

Senior Content Exec at very large well known company - Dec 2021-Sep 2022 - Managers kept quitting, then the team had a mass exodus where everyone quit and I didn't want to be the last rat on a sinking ship (which in hindsight was a bad idea I should of stayed)

SEO/Content Specialist - Oct 2022-Present - (Almost at the two year mark, haven't enjoyed it since I began, the company is not managed well and my boss often berates me but I've preserved as my CV looked so bad)

My main concerns are the two jobs that lasted 3 months and the 1 year gap. I'm really stable and (job-aside) happy now but my CV doesn't reflect that. I also did some UX freelancing in 2021 which I could add in?

1fag4t1,Any guidance for someone lacking experience?,"
I completed a dual degree program at my university and graduated with a degree in economics in 2020 and again with a degree in math in 2021. I made the decision to act as a daytime caregiver for my father since then, so I have no work experience at all (outside of a yearlong stint doing overnights at a nearby convenience store.) I also worked as a economics research assistant for 1.5 years in school. 

Circumstances now allow me to enter the workforce, but I am a little lost in determining what I should pursue. Much of the coursework I did focused on quantitative analysis and statistics, and an entry level position that would allow me to further develop those skills would be ideal. I am worried that the gap since my graduation makes me a poor candidate even for entry level roles. I have spent some time going over material I learned in undergrad(econometrics mostly and I have started playing around with Python) but not much else. 

I would appreciate any advice on what kinds of roles I should look into or what kinds of things I can focus on for self-study. I’m also considering returning to school for an MS in applied math or statistics, but I worry that would just result in me being in the same position after graduation due to my lack of job experience. I would really appreciate any input because I feel stuck and lost at the moment.

1fafcwo,Is this Supply Chain Professional Aiming too High?,"Hi,
 
I am a 29 year old supply chain professional, who is aspiring to become a Director of Supply Chain, or Become a Supply Chain/ Procurement/ Purchasing Manager in the near future. Am I shooting too high?
 
I started my career in manufacturing, jumping around a few different companies/ industries from the time I graduated high school until I turned 20. I landed at a manufacturing organization, where I quickly was promoted from a technician to lead technician, then into the manufacturing manager of my department in less than a year. This position oversaw manufacturing, planning, and supply of this department, and I spent the next 6 years working for this organization. In my time with the company, I developed a passion for supply chain, and 3 years ago decided to take on the position of buyer/planner at a larger organization which paid more money, and allowed me to focus more so on my passion.
 
About 2 months after starting at this company, our Director of Supply Chain announced his retirement, at which point myself, another internal candidate a few external candidates interviewed for the position. Ultimately, I was picked over for my current boss (an external candidate), but the President, VP, and CFO all said to me that it was really close, the only thing I really lacked was the education and “years of experience”  in supply chain whereas my now boss had a bachelors and another 10+ years of experience. A month or two went by and I was promoted into strategic sourcing and have spent the last 2.5 years here. Two years ago, I decided to pursue my bachelor’s degree and have already graduated.
 
It is widely discussed that I will be the next Director of Supply Chain with this company between the VP, my Director, and other Directors and myself. The problem is, I don’t know if that would be in 2 years or 20 years. My boss has aspirations of moving up in the organization, and while I do like them, I don’t see it. I also don’t know if I see them moving on anytime soon considering they believe they can take that next step when our VP retires in 5 years (give or take).
 
I feel I am ready now. I am driven, motivated, and miss leading and managing, and really love supply chain and would love to combine the two. Over the past few months I’ve applied and interviewed for some other positions as a Purchasing Manager or similar. While I have been invited to interview with some organizations sometimes, once, twice, and at one organization, even three times,  I have yet to receive an offer for one of these positions, with the exception of one smaller company that offered me significantly less than my current salary. (which I could not even consider).
 
My question is, am I aiming too high? Are these positions that I am applying for too competitive for someone with my experience? Is there something else I could be doing to get me over the hump without simply waiting to gain “years of experience”?",CommissionHour5629,1,0.6700000166893005,4,1725629760,2024-09-06 13:36:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fafcwo/is_this_supply_chain_professional_aiming_too_high/,9,2024

I'm still in the process of sharpening my skills, so I wouldn't say I’m fully confident in my expertise yet. Being approached with job offers is also fairly new to me.

Occasionally, I do receive interview invitations from HR or recruiters on LinkedIn. If the roles align with my education and experience, I’m open to trying an interview. However, I recently received an offer that feels a bit outside my area of expertise. It’s for a business manager position, which involves client relations and sales—areas where I have no experience. While I meet the language requirements, I'm not fluent in all of them, and I don't yet have a driver's license, which is necessary for client visits.

1fabx8v,How do I answer interview question of why am I seeking to leave my current position?,"I have worked at a big corporation for about 3 years now. I work in IT. I never really got along with most of my coworkers. They are mostly older men and I am a woman in my late 20s. But over time I did find a small group of coworkers whose company I really enjoy. 

However lately, lots of things have happened that made me want to leave the company and I have started the interview process with several companies. The question I am afraid of (and already got asked) is why I want to leave my current company. 

The absolute truth is that the jokes my coworkers tell  on hourly basis are disgustingly sexist. And I swear I don't say that lightly. Recently we've had some reorganisation happen and I ended up working with a team that is notoriously difficult to work with. These people are absolutely toxic. It is not uncommon to hear swearwords aimed at other members at meetings, recently there was a physical altercation. Also, a potential SA had been reported to our HR and the alleged victim told me they said there is nothing they can do as it's ""her word against his"". This is just a small list of things that have been happening lately and I have to leave, for my own sanity at this point.

But I am afraid that if at an interview I would just vaugely outline the situation and say ""I just don't get along with my coworkers"" I might be percieved as problematic, not fitting in or even difficult to work with. On the other hand, I work for a very well known corporation and I am afraid of possible legal reprecussions if it somehow got back to them that I am talking about leaving because of an alleged sexual assult and physical altercation I have witnessed. 

So... what can I say? Do I just make up a generic answer along the lines of ""I find myself looking for new opportunities as I feel my knowledge is stagnating"" or something like that? I just feel like telling the truth wouldn't be in my best interest.",testBunny93,16,0.7799999713897705,43,1725618889,2024-09-06 10:34:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fabx8v/how_do_i_answer_interview_question_of_why_am_i/,9,2024
1fabns0,im reallyyy struggling to find a part time job ,"I am a freshly 18yo girl and since i finished school i wanted to get a part time job. My current situation is that i live with my mom and sister, so our only bread winner is my mother. Since i'm an adult now i wanted to have my own money so i dont have to rely on her. With no experience and with limited availability because i'm starting university in a month my options are extremely limited. Naturally, i sent an application at mcdonalds because what else is an 18yo supposed to do?

After my interview today I am extremely disappointed to find out that i am required to remove all of my piercings and trim my nails in order to get the job. I dont have a problem with trimming my nails since i was always keep them relatively short but the piercing bit bothers me. I have a piercing on each of my nostrils, a septum (which i dont mind flipping over so its not visible) and your standard earlobe piercings. I fear that by removing my piercings 4 times a week my skin will get irritated, the jewelry wil get damaged and i'll have to keep repurchasing them and the holes could even close (ive had my nostrils for about 3 years or more i think so that could be unlikely). 

The main reason i'm in shambles is because my friends arent supportive of my decision to start working. They insist that i wont be able to handle studying for my classes and working and that i'll have no free time and miss out on events. I understand what theyre saying and i do agree that it'll be very tiring, especially if i have to do night shifts and then go to my classes in the morning. I also have to rely on transportation to go to work, which takes about 30-40 minutes unless its late and my only option is the night bus which is always full of people and passes by every hour or so.

My education is very important to me because I live in greece so in order to get enrolled in the university i'm in i had to study my ass off throughout high school (which is 3 years) and nearly ace all my exams. However i feel like they dont understandwhy i want to work as much as i do. They are all in way better financial states than me and live with both their parents. For example, my oldest friend is 20, she has a car that her parents paid for and has never worked a day in her life because her parents support her financially. My main goal is to raise enough money to afford a drivers license since my mother said i'll have to pay for that myself (i find that reasonablee since shes buying me a car and i'm very grateful for that). Though, money has always been an issue in our lives so id feel more secure having my own income. I'm writing this to rant, receive advice, i dont know i dont care. Im in a very bad state of mind and kinda want to disappear. Maybe i'm just overreacting and its not as big of a deal as im making it out to be.

1faacgk,"Applied for PwC Associate Position, Seeking Guidance for Career Growth","Hello fellow Redditors,

A couple of months ago, I applied to PwC Middle East in Dubai for an Associate position. As of today, which is a couple of months after applying, I have not received any update; hence, I am still hopeful while opening my mind to other opportunities and advice on how to make future applications stronger.

Currently, I am an accountant with over 3.5 years of work experience in the field of financial reporting, bookkeeping, preparation of tax returns, support for audits, and management of accounts in various sectors. I have been working while studying towards my ACCA qualification; it's a balancing act, but I'm determined to grow in my accounting career.

I will really appreciate it if any of you that have successfully landed a job in PwC or any other leading firm share your experience with me. How was your application different? Are there any other companies in the UAE, Dubai, I should focus on? Any tips or advice would be highly welcomed!

1faaacl,Is my startup toxic or am-i being unreasonable ? And when to know how to leave ?,"Hello everyone !

Just for some backstory : i'm in an internship for one year now, and been working in just one other company before that, so i don't know at all if i'm being unreasonable when wanting to quit, i just need a few advice and rough love if you have some in your pockets.

  
It's been one year i work as an intern in IT/web dev in a little startup of 25 people, in remote.

For the pros :

-> The people are really nice and understanding; the after-work activities feel like hanging out with friends, which I love.

-> Remote work is great—when I have less work, I can finish the day earlier, and when things get busy, I work a bit more than usual.

->My work is appreciated, and people are respectful. They often thank me for what I do.

-> I'm also worried sick in this economy i cannot find another job

For the cons :

  
The management isn't great, and there are frequent mishaps. Recently, I've had to work on different tasks on different days. For example, Monday is task 1, Tuesday is task 2, then Wednesday back to task 1. It’s chaotic, and I lose a lot of time switching between tasks.Sorry just a bit of a rant

-> The workload is heavy. People schedule random meetings and assign urgent tasks, and meanwhile, my manager still expects the development of a feature by the next day. During these times, I often have to work overtime.

-> There's a lack of training. I’m expected to learn new things really quickly because features are due within a week. Most of the time, my code is god awful and ugly, which I’m not proud of, but it’s impossible to teach myself a new language in two weeks.

-> My boss is a nightmare. She randomly assigns tasks throughout my week and expects me to handle everything IT-related. ""My phone isn’t working, fix it."" ""You need to manage all the company’s equipment."" She’ll give me a random task and assume I know how to do it because ""I know computers."" No, I cannot hack your password to retrieve it, madam.",Rude-Cardiologist720,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1725611865,2024-09-06 08:37:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1faaacl/is_my_startup_toxic_or_ami_being_unreasonable_and/,9,2024

We,be worked together 5 years and I’ve been at the company for 10 years (so longer than him but he’s always been a superior to me). I just found it so interesting why I only feel comfortable pushing back aggressively to him only and not anyone else. And we are totally fine afterwards each time like nothing happened.

1fa7zn3,Is it unprofessional to ask for my job offer back after rescinding acceptance for another offer? How should I approach this situation?,"Hi everyone,

I'm in a tough spot and could use some advice. I recently graduated and was juggling two job offers. The first offer, which I initially accepted, was for a lateral recruitment assistant position at a law firm in NYC. It came with great benefits and a strong team, but I was concerned about being too niche in recruiting.

The second offer, which came in later, was for an HR assistant role at another major law firm. This position felt more comfortable since I have experience in HR, and it offered a chance to work across various HR functions, providing broader exposure. The commute was also better, but the pay and benefits didn't match the first offer.

Feeling it was a better fit, I rushed into rescinding my acceptance from the first job and accepted the second. However, I'm now having second thoughts. The culture and benefits at the first job are very appealing, and pushing myself out of my comfort zone might be the right move.

Would it be unreasonable to approach the first company and ask if they would consider taking me back? I only rescinded my acceptance today. I'm worried about how this might look, but I genuinely feel the first option might be the better long-term fit. Has anyone here been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?

1fa5loo,work two jobs instead?,"i know this might seem like a no brainer but i feel like it may too good to be true and i gotta be overlooking something.

i work a job that is very low stress mentally and emotionally but im outside 7 hours a day (9 hour work day) whether its 90 or 10 degrees outside. 
i also have a 1.5 hour commute to and from so three hours total commute daily.
making my total time out of the house everyday 12 hours. i consistently work 40 hour weeks but with commute factored in it’s more like 55 hours. 
i make $20.

after some thought i don’t mind working 55 hours a week, but i do mind how little im making. 
other than working 55-60 hours a week what downside would i run into if i decided to leave my job now and pick up a morning shift job (8-3, 35 hours a week) and a night shift job (4-9, 20 hours a week) with shorter commutes,i have a couple possible jobs i could line up that are 15-20 minutes from my house so my total commute time daily would be 30-40 a day.

so it’s around the same time working/out of the house but i’d be able to make nearly double what im making now for the same amount of effort. 

again, other than working myself to death which i already feel like im doing is there anything im overlooking before i put anymore thought into this or attempt to follow through.

I made the decision to act as a daytime caregiver for my father since then, so I have no work experience at all (outside of a yearlong stint doing overnights at a nearby convenience store.) I also worked as a economics research assistant for 1.5 years in school. 

Circumstances now allow me to enter the workforce, but I am a little lost in determining what I should pursue. Much of the coursework I did focused on quantitative analysis and statistics, and an entry level position that would allow me to further develop those skills would be ideal. I am worried that the gap since my graduation makes me a poor candidate even for entry level roles. I have spent some time going over material I learned in undergrad(econometrics mostly and I have started playing around with Python) but not much else. 

I would appreciate any advice on what kinds of roles I should look into or what kinds of things I can focus on for self-study. I’m also considering returning to school for an MS in applied math or statistics, but I worry that would just result in me being in the same position after graduation due to my lack of job experience.

A bit of background. I am a first-year college student in the honors program. I have classes twice a week, from early morning to early afternoon (7:30-11:45). I was looking for a job where I could work about 30 hours a week, have minimal hours on Saturday, and have off on Sundays. I also have 2 other jobs in the evenings after 4 pm twice a week on the same days I have classes.

I recently got a job at a coffee shop, when I was interviewed I said I needed to work 30 hours a week at 15 dollars an hour. They said they would be able to accommodate that and my school schedule. I decided to take the job, but I am only making 9 dollars an hour plus tips. The minimum wage in my state is $14.35.

This job requires me to take orders, make coffee, run food, help package food, do the cold brews, bag coffees, and have tableside service. But, all of us are being watched by a ring camera.

I started working 3 days a week. My boss said I may be scheduled on some other days if we need 2 people working, but I won’t find out until the day before. I’m only working 15 hours a week. When I brought that up to my boss, they said that my hours were incompatible with the business and they didn’t want to schedule me on slow days since they have to pay more people. The schedules do not come out until the week of, and they are up to flexibility. I was scheduled to work on Labor Day, starting at 8:30 am and they tried to change my schedule to 10:30 am an hour before I was supposed to start my shift. I also asked if I should change my college schedule for next semester and was asked if I could do night school even though I work 2 other jobs in the evenings. I was told that my schedule was difficult to work with. The conversation ended with my boss saying we could discuss my college schedule next month, but I need to choose my classes at the end of the month.

I am also making under minimum wage with tips.

I don’t know what to do since I know I can find other jobs making more money. I don’t know if I should quit right now and figure it out after my classes are selected for the next semester, or if I should work through the rest of the month before finding new jobs",Ok_Information_1160,1,1.0,0,1725588864,2024-09-06 02:14:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1fa44pw/what_should_i_do/,9,2024

I didn't know this before working at this company but something about south asian culture breeds lots of psychopaths and just terrible humans in general. the south asian higher ups at my company are all psychopaths and treat the employees horribly if your not a south asian like them. Like I have experienced and witnessed many labor violations which I could technically report, but there would no point because like I said the company has a south asian owner who won't do much about it. 

The president did switch to an American  and hr is also American employees but I don't know how much they could affect it if the owner is south asian and favors the south asians. my direct supervisor and the other managers make working here unbearable even though the job itself isn't that bad. I want to just quit without another job lined up. I only took this job as a bridge job since I'm studying to switch into another field that I actually like, and was planning to leave once I was done studying, but I don't think I can wait anymore and feel like I need to leave asap to avoid further mental deterioration and dreading even thinking about work or going to work.( I've been working here for about two years). I can't even relax on days off because I'm so stressed just thinking about work. 

Another thing is, a new policy was implemented where you have to bring a note if you take off for some part of the day and aren't using vacation. So if I had to do interviews, I'm not sure how I can take off time for work if a note is needed. I don't have any vacation or sick days left until it renews at my yearly hire date, so taking off for them is not an option until my vacation renews. I had to use all of them when I got really sick and had to go the hospital for two weeks. People are saying the job market is not that good right now and to not quit without another job but what if your job is unbearable and causing you mental decline and chronic stress.

1fa3jbz,Work being done is vastly different than job I was hired for,"Burner account because coworkers (and leadership) knows my reddit UN and a little vague as well due to that.

I was hired over a year ago to be a system administrator within an organization that has under 500 employees that handles IT and business processes. After a few positions were eliminated about 6 months into my tenure I also took on administration of another SaaS system including completing the highest certification level possible for that system within 3 months of taking it over.   My systems and work done has driven huge increases in productivity, regulatory compliance and reporting to senior/executive levels enterprise wide. I loved going to work every day and was a bit of a workaholic (50 hours a week and loved it because I was getting shit done). Because of the below, I now have to convince myself to put in 40 hours and even then it's a slog and I *hate* it.

Over the past \~6 months I've been reorganized into a different leadership set but my job description (JD) and title has not changed.  My current leadership has little knowledge or interest in the tools my JD discusses as they have no background in anything like what I have.   Almost 90% of my work is now transitioned out of my apps and I'm supposed to be learning the systems the other guys use to ""cross train"" for them.  I have no interest in this type of work, I'm getting no time for training from them (because they dont have time; we're down almost 33% headcount in the last year), leadership has no apparent investment in my career/position and there is no relief in sight.  I've brought my concerns to my direct manager who has told me to consider that I'm not getting assigned any work in my wheelhouse a testament to the quality of work.  

What are my options, considering the amount of ""out of class"" work I am doing and have leadership that doesn't have any interest in what benefits it can continue to offer?  My JD does NOT include an ""other duties as assigned"" clause, I dont have a ""contract"" keeping me there, work for an at will employer in an at will state and am not in a union.

However, I did an internship with the state on my last semester at school and I really enjoyed it! I worked as a juvenile probation officer and although it can be kind of hard, I liked the team and is not that bad. I finished the internship, graduated uni and life moved on. Recently, one of my coworkers from that internship texted me saying that a position was open and I should definitely apply. So I did it and was selected for an interview and got the job.

He is self employed. Anyways, these are the benefits. There is also opportunity to get bonuses if we have a good year but is nothing guaranteed. However there is a very good chance of getting it (~10-20k total). This other job is a state job like I said, pays $58k minimum, health insurance for me and my husband, plus the benefits of working for the govt. the pay is way better, I will enjoy the work, I know the team, supervisor, manager and the work environment. But I feel like I need an unbiased opinion. Am I doing the good thing in changing jobs? What if is not the right thing? Will I be distancing myself from law school for not working with attorneys? Everybody says that working as a paralegal is the best job before you go to law school. I am a little bit lost. I like my current job as a paralegal.

I filled out what was basically a “what I’ve done” to show that I’ve been doing Level 3 work as a Level 2.

She sent it to another manager for feedback. Again, nothing but praise, except for one catch. Because I’ve only been in the role for 6 months, it’s too early.

Despite doing the work. Despite her telling me and her boss that I’m a high performer with high potential. I now have to wait another year. I’m already underpaid, and after discussing pay with coworkers, wildly undervalued as a team.

1fa21wa,Need advice on career choice,"Currently, I actually have a BA in Anthropology which was honestly not a great choice career-wise although I don't completely regret it since it did give me a bigger worldview and perspective. But, the job options are slim to none. 

Now, I am sitting with four options. 

1. continue with my chosen route and get an MA to PhD, and maybe add something in business or international relations by studying in another country since the US doesn't have any affordable degree programs. (Don't talk loans. I do not want loans, and would only take out loans if I'm guaranteed a high-paying job right out the bat). That would get me a Professor job... and really that's all that's available. 

2. Scrap the idea of going into the arts while I still can and veer into a profitable degree program, doing another Bachelor's degree in something like biochemistry, nuclear chemistry or pharmacy. 

3. Veer into my other passion of Astrophysics. 

4. Attempt law or medical school. 

  
Oh and I forgot to add that my University tricked me with my Anthropology BA is actually an interdisciplinary studies degree. I was told otherwise and that it hadn't been updated. I also discovered most courses for the Anthropology electives didn't exist, in fact, all of them didn't exist and you had to make it up as you go along. I had a terrible advisor.

I am a PhD student looking for a part-time job, and I was recently offered a great stress-free position at a great company (unrelated to my field, but a great way to pay my bills in the mean-time for the next few years). It really fits with my busy school schedule, but, that being said, I was offered an hourly rate lower than I expected. 

  
I am part time, so I know not to ask for anything crazy, but with my years of experience and qualifications (i.e: being fluently bilingual, having years of prior experience, etc.) I was wondering if it was worth it to ask for a 50 cent bump on the offer. I know its not much, but it would make a nice little bump and, again, I'm not inexperienced in any regard.

I have found out that my teammate will be on maternity leave in 6 mos. Her position is the one I have been gunning for. And logically, I would be the best choice given that I am in the  same business unit but nothing is promised and politics obviously gets in the way. I am applying for jobs for about 5 mos now and Im offered a job that ticks all the boxes but with a small raise. Money isnt everything but it doesnt feel right for me.

Im a little burnout from work trying to make a good case for myself which is my choice but it doesnt help me think objectively about my current situation.

Now, Im faced with 3 options

1.) Accept the new job (currently negotiating salary but slim chance), gain experience, and move forward from there. 

2.) Reject the job offer and keep on looking.

3.) Discuss my path with my boss and hope I will get considered in 6 mos time.

I'm in an interview process with an American company for a SwE role. I'm not from the US.

When I applied, I introduced my expected salary in the application form.

I then went through 3 interviews after interviewing with the recruiter, and I was supposed to go to the last phase this week/next week.

Recruiter and I met yesterday and she told me they didn't see my salary expectations and that their budget was 20% below my salary expectations. They seemed genuine and honest about it. I said it's OK, but I was fuming. 

While I would consider the 20% cut to my expectations only to join them, I asked if they could improve their offer a little (I said a value around -15%).

The recruiter said she would go back to the Hiring Manager and provide feedback next week.

Now i'm here thinking they may go with another candidate.
Also, why next week? This doesn't seem like something that needs much discussing.

I’ve been contracting at a place for a little over 4 years now. About a year and a half ago, I asked if there was ever a possibility of getting hired full-time. I was flat-out told no, they weren’t hiring ANYONE, even though my supervisor wished he could say otherwise. This was disappointing but unsurprising. I started job hunting more aggressively to be able to leave this contractor (my main source of income for the past 2 years) but have been unsuccessful. I’ve been taking night courses and furthering my skill set, but my industry (animation) is in a rough spot right now.Flash forward to May 2024. My supervisor asked me out of the blue if I would still be interested in full-time employment. I immediately said yes, and we started talking about salary expectations. He told me he would get back to me ASAP to discuss further.

Four months later, I’m still waiting to hear if this position has even been approved yet by upper management. He told me I would have an answer by “late August/early September” but we’re nearing the end of that. I don't want to keep contracting here anymore since in the past year and a half, this has become a worse and worse place to freelance. Accounts Payable have been asinine (they didn’t process my invoices for months THREE SEPARATE TIMES THIS YEAR), management has become unresponsive, and my department head seems like he has to beg and plead for crumbs. I am afraid to leave, though, because I don’t want to be unemployed in this economy or job landscape.

Does anyone have any advice? Should I tell him if I don’t get offered this job I am leaving? My husband and I are at a total loss.

I hate corporate bullshit and standard interview question and selling a company. I’m also the boss/hiring manager.

I let the candidate interview me. Usually lasts about 20 minutes. They can ask me literally anything about the job. I then lead them around the office and let them know they can speak with any of my employees for any length of time so they can make sure we’re the right fit for them and vice versa.

I always explain to the candidates (when they are invariably confused about being allowed to talk as long and to whomever they want without me anywhere around) that had precious employers done this, it would have saved me a lot of time and miserable days at jobs. 

During their wandering, I go back to my office and shut the door and just let them know it was a pleasure meeting with them and they’re free to go when done and I will follow up with yes or no.

I also then get feedback from my employees on what they thought—after all, they have to work on a close basis with them, I just have to manage them.

1f9v768,Would It Be Terrible to Job Hop After Only 2 Months?,"Hi all,

I’m currently in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice. I recently started a new job as a **Systems Administrator Level 3** about two months ago, but I’m already considering a switch due to some red flags I’ve encountered. Here’s my situation:

**Current Job:** I'm earning **$115,000** per year, with the option to work remotely. While the remote flexibility is great for work-life balance and saving on commuting costs, I’ve noticed some issues:

* I recently learned that the person I replaced quit due to frustrations with the current trainer, who I still need to work with regularly.
* Communication is spotty, and there is a lack of clear expectations. For instance, while I am allowed to work remotely, it's not clear when or how often. Additionally, for tasks that need to be done on-site, I’m often informed last-minute.

**New Job Offer:** I’ve received an offer for an on-site position as a **Virtualization and Windows System Engineer** with a **$130,000** salary, a **3% sign-on bonus**, and **annual profit sharing**. The job is located in Richardson, Texas, which has a higher cost of living than my current location. The role requires daily commuting, but it comes with better benefits overall. However, it doesn't offer remote work, which would mean a significant change in my work-life balance.

**My Concerns:**

* I've only been at my current job for two months, and I’m worried about how it might look on my resume if I leave so soon.
* The new job offers a higher salary and better benefits, but I’m not sure if it’s worth giving up the remote flexibility I currently have.
* I'm also close to finishing my Master’s degree in IT Management, but there is no clear indication from my current employer whether this will result in a salary increase or not.

Given these circumstances, would it be a terrible idea to leave my current job after only two months? Has anyone here made a similar move, and how did it impact your career? I’d love to hear any advice or insights you might have!

Thanks in advance!",natboy96,16,0.8999999761581421,27,1725564764,2024-09-05 19:32:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f9v768/would_it_be_terrible_to_job_hop_after_only_2/,9,2024
1f9v60n,Should I transition into UX/UI Design with a Background in Industrial Design for more earning potential ,"

Hello, Reddit community!
I’m Maeve, and I’m currently working as an Industrial Designer. I graduated from Virginia Tech’s ID program in 2022. I have been working for a company that makes custom acoustical product for corporate interiors focusing on mainly product design in AutoCAD and product visualization using Fusion 360 and KeyShot. I also did 2.5 years worth on internship doing 2D texturing in illustrator and some basic modeling in Maya for a gov. contractor making VR sims for the Navy. I’m now considering a career pivot into UX/UI design because the earning potential and opportunity for fully remote work that I see in the market currently just is not that great. I feel like I basically have two options… build on my current skill set and become a master at rendering— go the architectural rendering route or gaming route or break into UX/UI with a small foundation from ID school. Would love to hear your thoughts and advice on the best path forward.

Background:

	•	Current Role: Industrial Designer with experience in product visualization and rendering.
	•	Skills: Proficient in AutoCAD Fusion 360 and KeyShot; have a solid portfolio of product designs.
	•	Interests: Keen on exploring UX/UI design due to a growing interest in user experience and interface design.

Current Challenges:

	1.	Experience Requirements: Many entry-level UX/UI positions require 1-2 years of digital design experience. Given my background, how can I best position myself for these roles?

	2.	Education Options: I’ve looked into various educational paths, including bootcamps and certifications. What’s the best way to gain relevant skills and make a compelling case for potential employers? Do I need to do this or could I just self learn figma and make a new portfolio…

	3.	Free Templates and Portfolios: Is it acceptable to start a project with a free online template if I significantly customize it? How should I present this in my portfolio?

	4.	Remote Work: I’m also interested in roles that offer remote work and flexibility, especially since I enjoy traveling. Which field—UX/UI design or product visualization —offers better opportunities for remote work?

Specific Questions:

	1.	Portfolio Building: If I learn tools like Figma and Adobe XD, would creating portfolio projects from online prompts be sufficient, or should I invest in a bootcamp or certification?

	2.	Job Market Trends: Based on current trends, would it be more beneficial to focus on product visualization or pivot to UX/UI design? How do the earning potentials and remote work opportunities compare?

	3.	Learning Path: Given my current skill set and the fact that I struggled with asynchronous learning in the Google cert program (never finished), would a bootcamp with hands-on instruction be a better fit?
What I’m Looking For:

	•	**Advice on building a strong UX/UI portfolio and gaining relevant experience.
	•	**Suggestions for affordable and reputable bootcamps or certification programs.
	•	**Insights into the job market for both UX/UI design and product visualization/remdering, especially regarding remote work opportunities.

Aiming to make 100k at some point. 

Keep going down the Industrial Design/3D path I’m on or make the UX/Ui switch now while I’m young?? 

Thanks in advance for your help and insights! I’m excited about this potential career transition and eager to learn from your experiences and recommendations.

1f9stu5,some serious regrets and job searching now,"Hello I'm in my early 30s. I feel like I've made lots of mistakes in my career.

A couple years ago, I left a company i was with after 5 years. I thought it was time for me to move on and felt that weren't viable growth opportunities and the culture was a bit lacking. I left voluntarily. My reputation there was good. 

I joined another company after that from a friend's referral and did not like the work either. I left within the year.

I decided to take some personal time off and back on the job market again and it's really tough. I am having panic attacks and sleep disturbances in the middle of the night. 

In hindsight, quitting those two jobs was a really bad decision. I wanted the temporary relief of not having to deal with those work responsibilities but now i'm suffering the consequence of I don't know, pay cut, mental health issues and stress from job-searching.

I asked my initial company and former boss if I could go back but since I left voluntarily, I am afraid they might not respond to me or they might just say no to me coming back. I'm also afraid the company might be upset at me for leaving.

I'm interviewing with companies much lower salary than my former jobs as the job search is going pretty long.

1f9scld,How to approach meeting with previous Senior Manager?,"Hey all -

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this.
In summer 2022 | did an internship at a Big 4 Firm. I really liked the team and I was actually interested in the work. The team also liked me and were asking on the last few days how I would feel about returning and l, like an idiot, said I wanted to explore other opportunities more related to Finance since I was doing my comm/finance degree. Looking back I should've tried to get a return offer but still explore other opportunities after.

I recently graduated and I am currently in a contract position but saw that my old team is hiring for an Analyst. I reached out to and old partner from a different team that liked me and he set me up with the current Senior Manager of the team (the previous senior manager has gone to a different firm). I have also recently applied to the position with a referral from my old coworker on the team. I'm not sure how to structure the meeting. Should I treat it like an interview or just a casual conversation.

I was thinking of opening like an interview by introducing myself and what I have been doing since that summer and then start to express my interest throughout the conversation. My goal is to get return offer by the end of the conversation and skip the main interview processes.

Thank you in advance!!

Some extra notes:
• Current job is similar to my internship field (internship was way more technical).
• I reached out to my old senior manager Jan 2024 but they were already in transition to the new firm so they didn't reply.
• I still keep in contact with some old coworkers that are on the team.
• A few months ago I did an interview for the same position and same firm but for a different country.",HiddenGem131,1,1.0,0,1725557736,2024-09-05 17:35:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f9scld/how_to_approach_meeting_with_previous_senior/,9,2024
1f9s4bg,"Made a mistake post grad, how should I approach? ","
Hi! Ive found myself in a silly situation. 
I recently just graduated with my master's in late June, and started a new job two weeks later. I've been here since, and realized I've made a mistake.

Things that were promised when I signed onto the job no longer are on the table i.e. them paying for my professional cerifications that I need, saying I could go to the conference that I am a speaker at but then saying oh no funding and we can't grant the time off bc we'll be short staffed bc senior staff is actually going instead, promising big projects that are my specialization that I got my master's and under grad degree in but either giving them to someone else, or just saying I probably won't get any for like a year to a year and a half in. I'm essentially just a intern/permit person at this point in time despite being an engineer and technical writer. 

On top of that, I'm commuting an hr and a half there and back everyday because was supposed to be hybrid (three office, two home) actually is fully in office for the first six months then they can deny you for it at all. Lastly, I wasn't made aware I was on probation for the first 6 months too 😕 

Anyways, obviously it's not a good fit and I made a mistake by taking the job. Now my question is, I'm going to start applying because the commute is killing me (13 hr days with the commute) and I just feel like I'm wasting my time; how should I frame this on my resume? I'd leave it off but then I'd have a three month gap, and I don't know which looks worse. My mentor in the industry said to leave it and it's all about how you frame it. Bc I did get a lot of great raw experience, that is immensely beneficial. I'm not ever going to do this specific job again, but my industry values the type of experience I got. Its not all a loss. 

Should I leave it on the resume? And how best to frame it i guess when interviews occur? I feel so dumb, but its all still new and I know better now. And lastly, do you think having it on my resume is going to shoot me in the foot? I am slightly worried about finding another job. I have tons of other job experience in both my industries, and lots of costumer service. My other jobs as well I was at for like 1 and a half to 4 years, minus the like two one and a half year internships. Any advice would be welcome for this silly situation I've found myself in. Thanks!

1f9rwdh,Asking for Percentage of Product?,"Hi All

I'm currently looking at an offer for a position where I'd be brought in to be the sole expert and employee developing a product. They have a shakey prototype and they would be fully relying on me to get it up to industry standards. It's also the first line of product that would allow many other products to follow and allow them to gain a footing in the market and expand. They are desperate and they would be relying heavily on me for their future.

My question is, would it reasonable to ask for a percentage of the profit from the product in my initial contract?

My idea was to ask for 2%, and only have it start once we actually get the product to a certain industry benchmark (80% efficiency in this case). It would give me a huge incentive and motivation to take ownership of the product. They are looking for someone to take full ownership of it.

I appreciate any insight and any kind of changes you would do so I can get this right.

1f9rksw,I Was Told To Travel for a Meeting Happening Less Than 4 Weeks From Now,"Basically the title. 

My boss just let me know that our team needs to travel to a different state in less than 4 weeks for a meeting with our parent companies sales director to explain our processes, etc. 

My time is often disregarded by this company and this is not part of my job title.  

For additional context in my contract I am expected to travel 2-3 times a year for actual sales conferences (where I actually make $$). Surprise surprise I typically travel 5-6 times a year. I'm already making significant sacrifices for them that I'm not required to do. 

I have received one raise and promotion, but, to be honest, I'm not even going to hit my OTE until my 3 year mark.  This is mostly due to the package size of our product not being sold at the volume or duration (agreement length) that my bosses believed would occur.  

This means I basically lose out on 7-8k a year that I feel comfortable asking for as a raise *soon*.  Traveling for something that doesn't pay me feels like insult to injury.  

I'd also need to get a dog sitter (my partner is out of town) who I pay in cash, and getting that reimbursed sounds tricky.  My reimbursements sometimes take 3-4 weeks to come back to me.  It's all extremely unprofessional. 

Anyways, I don't feel like my time should be wasted this way, it doesn't really seem like my time matters to my boss, let alone my well being . . . LOL, that's a plus of course. 

I do like my job, which is the other issue, where their isn't flexibility with this, there is on a weekly basis and I WFH the rest of the time I'm not traveling. 

I'm extremely tempted to just say ""Poor planning on your part does not necessitate an emergency on mine"".  The worst thing that can happen is I get fired and receive unemployment.

1f9rjcm,Seeking Advice: Should I stick it out or leave?,"I (18y/o) have been job searching for months after feeling guilty for not contributing to my household when my mom's job was at risk due to “soft-firing” attempts. Due to struggles with social situations and missing social cues, which caused me frustration and panic, I focused on cleaning and janitorial positions. I’ve had some experience in janitorial jobs and highlighted those skills on my resume.

After 5 months of applying for cleaning and janitorial jobs, I landed an interview at a gym for a cleaning position. During the interview, we barely discussed my experience, but I didn’t mind because I was eager to learn. Then she asked if I would also be willing to work in the kids club section, saying, “You wouldn’t have to do much; it’s just watching a couple of kids” and “We barely get a lot of kids.”. She shared a story of having to let someone go because they weren’t paying attention, and the kids got into a fight, saying how people don't like to work. I thought, “A couple of six-year-olds, I can handle that.”. So, I said “okay” and mentioned that I babysat a couple of times before. I wish I had clarified that it was only one kid at a time, but the interview was moving so fast and I didn’t want to seem hesitant.

Fast forward to my first day, which was also my onboarding (that's probably usual, tbh, but I don’t have much job experience, so I’m giving all the details). She said on the phone that she was going to show me the kid's section first but didn’t mention anything about a dress code, so I dressed in my usual fit comfy pants to clean in because I thought it was going to be some kind of cross-training thing, not a full-on childcare gig. The training I received was just how to check kids in and out. That’s it. I was given the number for the front desk using this team app, but no guidance on childcare or emergency procedures.

The day was normal (or as normal as it could be). They’re children, so I expected a bit of chaos. Four kids came in and started playing, but quickly turned on each other for no reason. I tried to intervene and solve their non-issues, but separation just ended up working best. The TV was supposed to be a distraction, but it only had 4 channels, and the only ones the kids could watch had expired. Leaving us with the Old Ladies Shoppers Network and Fox News, which, in my unprofessional opinion, I didn’t think was suitable for kids due to graphic content. So, I kept the TV off. Two more kids came in, leaving me with six. And then there was an issue with the team app, so during the small issue I had with checking in, I couldn’t call the front desk. It got solved quickly, so I’m not going to hone in, but this kind of freaked me out because I don’t think I should leave the kids alone unless someone's dying. It just seemed like common sense to keep the kids within eye view. I also realize the parents don’t take accurate pictures of their kids (ceiling fan pics, etc. ) So I have to memorize their faces. And to top it off, parents' pictures barely match their own, making it harder to identify them. Some parents even say things like, “Oh, this other person is picking them up later, not me.” Luckily, I didn't have to face my fears because another person who came with that parent stayed in the childcare room to relax.



As the kids started leaving one by one, I thought to myself, “Eh, that wasn’t bad.” No one cried, and I only had to break up one wrestling match. I was relieved. Still. I wanted to do cleaning, so I started thinking of talking to my boss tomorrow about the original position I interviewed for.



The next day, I realized I was deeper than I thought. The team app still wasn't working for me, and I couldn't get a chance to talk to my boss because she was busy and I was trying to sign in. Then, the kids started arriving. At first, it was okay—the first kid was nice, and the second kid was nice but then started being mean to another girl. More kids arrived, and I was overwhelmed. I thought I'd have minimal kids, but 6 seemed like a lot!



The boys started being mean to each other, hitting and pushing. I was stressed. And then a mom came in with a baby and her son. I DIDN'T KNOW WE TOOK CARE OF BABIES! Babies scare me a bit, and I felt unprepared. The baby was adorable, but he didn't like to be put down at all. As I was trying to navigate the chaos of the kids running around, the baby started crying. I'm trying to soothe him, but he keeps crying. I'm holding this heavy baby, and he only drank half of his bottle. The kids start copying the crying, and I'm struggling to distinguish between real and fake tears. One boy is fake crying, but then switches to real crying—I'm confused!



And to make matters worse, kids start fake-breaking limbs, which I know is classic child stuff, but it's still stressful. I'm feeling overwhelmed and unsure if I can continue in this role.



After the baby left, I finally got a break from holding him. But then, chaos erupted. 5-6 kids started throwing and hitting each other, and I tried to intervene, saying, 'No, stop throwing.' When that didn't work, I started taking away blocks, but they threw them at me, hitting me. I remained calm, picking up the blocks and putting them in a bag, but two kids tried to tackle me and yelled, 'Hit the teacher in her glasses' (I'M NOT EVEN A TEACHER!!!). They started throwing blocks at my eyes, and other kids complained about getting hit. I focused on removing the blocks and protecting myself and the kids from getting hurt.



After the block-throwing incident, I managed to put all the blocks away, and the kids lost interest in beating me up. But then they started stealing toys that two kids brought from home. The play area is full of toys, but these kids were told, “My dad said no one can play with my toys.” I get it. Okay, you want to give your kids toys from home, but why give your kids toys if you don't want them to share? But not my kid, not my rules, so I start getting their toys back. Some parts of this job are rewarding, like seeing the kids happy, but the challenges are overwhelming. What crosses the line for me is caring for babies. Babies confuse and scare me.



I'm feeling overwhelmed, frustrated, and concerned about the children's safety. I thought I could handle this job, but it's getting out of control. I can't call parents 24/7, and it's only been 2 days! I can't even talk to my boss today!!! I'm wondering if I'm the asshole for feeling this way and wanting to quit this role and asking if I could only do a cleaning one. If I can even do that. Finding this job also took so long to do and I can’t even apply quit. I'm not equipped to handle this, and I don't want to risk my well-being and, most importantly, the children's. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic.

However, I’m currently unsure which industry to focus on. I have two internship opportunities ahead of me:

1. **Big Pharma**: A role in consumer insights and analytics. While it’s a great opportunity, there’s no guarantee of a full-time contract after the 6-month internship.

2. **Fast-Growing IT Consulting**: A role that also includes the chance to work on Gen AI projects. This company offers a full-time contract after the internship, which is appealing.

1f9qym3,Colleague turned micro-manager,"Hi everyone! 

I'm in a bit of a situation here. I've been working for this company for a bit over two years. A few months ago, my colleague was promoted to Program Manager. Previous to this, we were ""work friends"" in that we are closest in age and had great respect for each other's work. She is now my manager and things have changed quite a bit and not for the best.

She lives to work. She has an attention to detail that all of us would envy. Unfortunately, when you take these two characteristics and leave them unchecked, you get a manager who fully expects the rest of the team to also work 10-12 hour days and will correct the smallest of ""issues"" with no regard for the larger picture. She also seems to get a bit lost in the weeds and will take over a project or a project call in the guise of ""helping.""

Last week, I had a project just go south. I am the technical lead and ended up having to work three days in a row from 7 am - 8 or 9 at night. It was insanity. I ended up pretty sick and am now dealing with pneumonia and shingles as a result. I'm not happy. 

Yesterday, knowing how sick I was, she still had me join a customer call even though I had almost no voice. She was on the call as well, so she could hear me and knew how I felt. I had actually ""called out"" that day but agreed to join this call after everything that had happened the week before.

This morning, I messaged her to let her know that I had pneumonia and needed to be on bed rest the remainder of the week. 

""I had that last fall. I ended up just working from bed.""

I told her I wasn't doing that. 

She then told me they needed a list of all the deliverables I would need support with. I honestly am so sick, I can barely see the computer screen (ap9ologies for my typos that I know are happening but cant see to fix).

I eneded up signing out of Teams and Slack after letting people know I would be OOO until Monday. 

I honestly am so burnt out I don't want to go back at all, but a paycheck is a paycheck I guess. I'm not sure what to do. There are a lot of younger people on my team that wouldn't be able to say no. I didn't feel good about it, but I really didn't have a choice tbh. I physically don't' have it in me to focus on technical work. 

Should I bring this up to her boss (my former manager)?

1f9o1cg,Disconnect between direct and indirect leadership ,"I’ve been at my current company for about 2 years and over the last 3 months I’ve been asked to take on additional work. This is exactly what I’ve been asking for as I’m pretty aggressive about moving up in the organization and this will get me some exposure to upper leadership (bosses boss, bosses bosses boss, etc etc)

Well for the first couple months my output was highly praised by my indirect managers (VP/SVP), I was being recognized for the high quality of my work but also the sophistication and creative ways I was looking to solve client business questions. I know some of this can be lip service but it was still nice to know that my work is top notch.

More recently however my direct manager has been wanting to review my decks before going to leadership, which is fine cause I do tend to have the occasional silly mistake. However a few days ago I presented the deck that contained many of their recommendations and leadership basically picked it apart. The issue being that the data didn’t really tell a compelling story and often times contradicted the core findings. I had addressed this during the build but was more or less told to include it.

This is also not the first time this has happened as the client has also given us similar commentary on work they delivered. 

 In general, I enjoy working for my manager but for whatever reason recently it feels like they’re meddling in work that they should let be. Unfortunately I feel like this is potentially impacting my future prospects.

How can i nicely tell them to “not screw this up”, and just leave well enough alone?

Who am I?

I'm a student currently working on my MSc in linguistics. I've been working on pivoting into a more data science focused carreer by attending face to face DA/DS courses, getting online certifications and building some small projects. Both my BA and MSc programs involve foundational skills like R, Python, statistics and some linguistics related data analysis tools so I wouldn't count myself as someone trying to break in to the field from scratch. I'm also planning to secure a small research internship position as part of my studies where I will hopefully gain experience in working with DS tools and methodologies.
I've spent the past 3 months applying to approx. 100 working student positions in the data field. I have scored 2 interviews so far without success

What is my problem/question?

I'm a recent arrival in Germany with limited German language skills and no professional experience. This leads me to believe I'm viewed as a risky hire and generally difficult to work with because of language.

Soon, I'm going to have to start working in an unrelated unqualified job in order to finance the rest of my stay in Germany. 

Is there a way for me to find a job where I can get at least some experience or should I just bite the bullet and focus on finding an unrelated job?

1f9msws,Will My Lack of GCSEs Hold Me Back in Software Development?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve always been passionate about programming, starting at a young age. However, school just didn’t click for me, and my GCSEs reflect that. I didn’t really get into gear until I went to college, where I finally found my stride in courses related to programming and development. It turns out, when you enjoy what you’re studying, it makes a huge difference! I ended up earning distinctions in both Games Design/Development and Information Technology, which gave me the equivalent of 3 A-levels despite my poor GCSEs.

These distinctions allowed me to secure a spot at university studying computer science, where I’m now in my final year, predicted to graduate with a first (1:1). I’ve consistently been at the top of my class and feel confident about my skills and knowledge in software development specifically.

However, as I start applying for graduate schemes, I’ve noticed that many of them ask for GCSE results or their equivalent, alongside A-levels (or equivalent). This has me worried. Will my poor GCSEs impact my opportunities, even though I’m on track to earn a degree in computer science competently? Will employers overlook my lack of GCSEs given my strong college performance and university achievements, or is this something that could hold me back in the tech industry?

I’d love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or has insight into how much weight employers really put on GCSEs when hiring for tech roles. Thanks in advance!

1f9kv77,Career Advice Needed: Internship at Bayer or BearingPoint?,"Hello everyone,

I recently completed my MSc in Economics last April from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, and I’m currently looking for a role that will help shape my long-term career. To be honest, I’m feeling a bit lost.

During my studies, I did a 6+6 month internship in a back office role at a major bank, but I’m now looking to shift focus and develop more valuable hard skills, especially in Data Analytics. Ideally, I’d like to gain expertise in this area and build a skillset that will be marketable in the future.

Right now, I have two internship opportunities:

1. **Bayer Pharmaceuticals** – Consumer Insights and Analytics. This is a 6-month internship, but HR has mentioned that securing a full-time position afterward is unlikely due to budget constrains.
2. **BearingPoint** – Data, Analytics & AI. This internship would transition into a full-time role upon completion.

The pay is substantially lower at Bayer (although BP's still quite low as for internships in Italy).

Both industries interest me a lot. At Bayer, I’d gain experience in Pharma (a field I’d love to work in full-time), while at BearingPoint, I’d learn data analysis and programming, which could be useful for transitioning to other industries like Tech in the future. Additionally, I have some international study experience and am open to relocating abroad afterwards.

Given this background, I’d appreciate any advice or recommendations. I’m concerned about choosing Bayer and having to restart my job search after 6 months if it doesn’t convert to full-time. On the other hand, I’m worried that BearingPoint might teach me a narrower skillset, making it harder to switch industries later.

Which option do you think would be the best investment for my career, both in terms of growth and future opportunities?

Thanks so much for your help!

1f9kieo,Got the manager job at a non profit org that I really wanted and now I want to excel at it,"First time manager at a prestigious non profit and I want to be good at it

Hi, as the title suggests, I (F28) amgoing to start a new role as a manager at a non profit education development organization. The unique thing about my role is that I’ll be a manager for a new office and team. The organization I’m joining has recently expanded to my city and I’ll sort of be responsible to building a lot of systems here for the team and ensuring our programs are running smoothly, offering support to all the teams and taking the lead of strategising and doing outreach efforts to help the organization grow. 

I am relatively young for the role. I have been a manager at another similar organization before but that was a very small grassroots team and everyone was doing everything. This is considerably bigger as there will be multiple teams in the office with people who are experts in their areas of work. 

I’m really passionate about this work and want to excel. However, I do feel I don’t have enough experience to go on. The recruitment process was rigorous and I was happy succeeded. 

One of my main responsibilities is to establish a team culture and foster an environment that supports everyone’s work to ensure we meet our targets. I report to the senior leadership in another city so I won’t have access to direct or immediate guidance all the time. 

My aspiration is to create an environment that feels supportive, encouraging and motivating. I want to be an empathetic leader and create an exemplary team dynamic. Any advice from other managers or people who have worked in similar situations to help me prepare in this month before I join? Or any tips for creating that office environment that I’m aiming for. I’ve had bad and toxic managers that have really made life difficult for me in the past so I really don’t want to become like them. Thanks!

I’m feeling really lost and could use some advice.

1f9jiyr,Do i chose medicine or engineering,"So i start a levels within the next week (UK) and my end goal is to work in the united states doing either job. The problem is I basically have to chose which career path to go down within the next week because I cant change my a levels for long after. 

My current chosen A levels are bio chem and math obviously for medicine. However the reason I am reconsidering medicine is because to work in america you also need to do the USMLE exam to be able to practice in it which is a very long lasting exam. Its not that I dont want to do it because its long lasting but I dont want to fail the first step or not get a comp score on step 2 and then be stuck in the UK to work. 

My other option is to change my A levels to physics chemistry and math to study engineering somewhere in the uk. I havent seen any type of 'entrance exam' to enter the united states with an engineering degree (if there is pls tell me) but it would obviously be harder to get employment from the uk as an engineer. 

Another option is to study engineering in united states from A levels here. I have seen that universities in america dont put as much weight as to what a levels you do but what ECs, what other parts of your application look like and just showing interest in engineering so maybe i keep biology a level? I do want to do medicine and specialise in psychiatry because I am heavily interested in the work field (and i like money) but I also do like to problem solve and the other aspects of an engineer. 

Like i said im more inclined to pick biology because then it still leaves the opportunity to do engineering in american universities but if that is wrong please can you tell me. 

I also need to pick quickly because i need to plan what projects, work experience and everything else im going to do

If anyone has experience of anything like this or is working in a medical-related field or engineer please could you give insight. Any advice would help (ive been stressed over the last week). I dont know whether this is even the right place to post this so if it isnt im sorry",TraditionalLow5090,3,0.8100000023841858,22,1725533778,2024-09-05 10:56:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f9jiyr/do_i_chose_medicine_or_engineering/,9,2024

1f9i0jk,My degree and my work experience don't match - will this reflect negatively on my CV?,"I'm at the point where I want to branch out to another job but my CV is totally scattered and I'm not sure what to do or realistically what roles to go for. My job makes good money but there isn't much progression and the environment is so toxic it affects my mental health.

I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering and all my work experiences/internships up this job have been in engineering or engineering/adjacent fields. I had a full-time job in software upon leaving uni and hated it, so I left after about 3 months. I then spent a period wondering what to do until a family member helped me out with a job in digital content creation (sort of like visual effects, lot of photoshop etc). 

It's been 2 years now and I feel for my career progression I have to leave. We've also had many incidents with employees and management having full on screaming matches. I've kept my nose clean in this but the stress that anything I opine on will devolve into this has been hard. I also get a lot of gossip from management talking negatively about their employees, so I really want no further part in this.

These last 2 years make my CV a bit... scatterbrained. As a positive, because it's full time and long-term, it demonstrates I'm able to stick with a company. But I really don't know where to go from here jobs-wise, and what kinds of jobs will look favourably upon the experience I have, which is half engineer, half programmer, half creative. It feels a bit like jack of all trades master of none. Ideally I'd want to be an architect, which is what I should've done in uni, but it takes 7 years to qualify in the UK so I'd expect to be broke till im 30. But something like that in terms of balance of client interaction, problem-solving, and creativity would be nice. Mainly I just want to be able to interact with people again because I'm in a department of 1 and no one in the office talks to each other cos everyone's been in a feud.

1f9dwxs,Feel very stuck in my career.,"I have been working for Enterprise since i graduated last year. Been with them for a year and 2 months. I was promoted to MA as soon as possible, which was in May, and have accomplished a lot since being there.

The next step in the process is to become assistant manager. I had a spot open up in my area, my branch manager said I wasn’t ready but I shot for it anyway. Did not make him very happy.

My area manager allowed me to interview, he told me I gave him the best interview of the four, but I was ultimately not chosen. My assistant manager also shot for that store as the branch manager, so losing two people at the same time would have been hard. And he’s the area manager of both my store and that one I applied for. No big deal.

That left my assistant managers spot to be open. They straight up told me they don’t want me shooting for it. They wanted someone with experience as an assistant to run it. I work at a very large branch.

They’ve now told me I’m ready, I’m the next one up to be promoted, but i have no idea what will open up next. I’ve started taken interviews with outside sales/account executive roles, but I’ve been rejected almost everytime.

1f9dw55,Being strung along for a promotion but cannot leave - What should I do?,"I’ve received an informal notice that my promotion is delayed yet again til early next year, while I’ve pursued this process for 6+ months. Unsupportive management, troublesome office politics, and rigid corporate structure seem to be the main drivers of this delay, but I’m in the middle of a green card process with my company and would not be able to leave until this is complete (and out of good faith), about 2 years from now. What can I do to improve this situation?

Some context for my case:
- Last year, a mass layoff happened, reducing our core team by half, leaving just basically myself and another teammate to take care of the work.
- Current manager “inherited” me when my previous manager was affected by the layoff. She has not been very effective and was creating a lot more bottlenecks within internal processes, but I can talk about this another day. 
- A few months later, due to the straining workload, my only other teammate quit. The team became just me and my manager, so I was doing 3x the normal workload. Having been here for 5 years, I also became the person with most institutional knowledge in my broader team, as my manager and most of current management joined later after a leadership shift. 
- At this point, it was March, and I proposed a title change and additional comp. This was also around the time annual reviews were done, so I was hoping I would be included. Manager and her manager (who reports directly to the CEO) said they were supportive but promotions were not being considered at this time, and we would have to push for summer. However, I immediately learned that this was untrue because several promotions in adjacent teams were announced right after annual reviews wrapped up.
- After a few more months of me doing triple the work and overhauling a huge migration (that touched all parts of the department and was fully recognized by leadership), they re-filled the spot with a higher-ranked position. My manager also went on a month-long vacation and left me to tend to the team. For me, this meant additional work, onboarding a new team member, and taking care of all managerial tasks on behalf of my manager. I checked in with my skip about the summer promotion cycle and then was told he was behind it but by this time it would be an off-cycle push, aiming for fall.
- My manager came back from vacation and my petition for green card was filed. This meant I wouldn’t be able to leave my company until the petition is done, as that would be synonymous with leaving my sponsor and giving up on the process. I checked in once again for the fall process, and was now told I would only be considered for 2025.

I felt like the goal posts kept being moved, and since they are fully aware I would not choose to leave, empty promises were thrown out to keep me working. I would appreciate any advice of how I can better push for this and make sure I can get my promotion as soon as possible.

1f9c7w8,Ready to leave the bar industry? ,"I have searched the sub and can't seem to find anything quite relevant as what I'm seeking!

I'm 37f and have been in a restaurant/bar for about 20 years. I have a college degree in dietetics but am not interested in pursuing anything with it (finished my degree about 10 years ago). I have been an event manager and GM type in 3 different breweries for about 9 or so years. 

With my current job, I need to bartend (dependent on tips) to make enough money to afford to pay bills/rent and i live by myself. At my current job, i am a the (co) taproom manager and event manager. I get paid a higher hourly plus tips when behind the bar and admin hours when i need to respond to emails, do scheduling and such. The taproom just recently opened in a pretty saturated brewery market, so its a little slow. I don't really go out (1x/week) but my bf sometimes pays, however, we split things pretty evenly. My paychecks truly go to paying bills (no 401k, barely any savings, etc). 

I have been recognizing that my attitude towards customer service just kinda sucks. I feel burned out and don't want to really do this anymore. I like being an event manager and love working/planning/hosting events but really dislike being behind the bar. I think I need a break from the management aspect of it and the jobs hiring for catering are simple bartending jobs. 

I'm not interested in a sales position (especially since the craft beer industry is in a recession) so I guess I'm wondering:
1. How do I switch into event management/planning? 

2. What's a logical switch in careers with the skills I have? 

I will probably post this and then go to sleep so I'll answer in the AM. And yes, I do need therapy, no I can't afford it so something like that is not an option right now.

1f9c0w5,Tech Job Change Advice,"I currently work at a medium sized, publicly traded cybersecurity company as a data engineer on an AI/ML centric team. I have been at the company for about 2.5 years and the whole time I’ve been here they’ve been doing relatively poorly. The company is a bit of a mess and they are losing customers pretty often. I’ve been talking with my manager about getting promoted to the next level for around a year and he keeps telling me I’m doing everything I need to be doing, but the money just isn’t there and the promotion isn’t going to happen. I decided around December of last year that I want to start to make the move from engineering to product management. I think I would fit better as a PM and I find the work more interesting than development. I told my manager this and he has been giving me some tasks that are in the PM realm, but it seems like there isn’t going to be much of an opportunity for me to move into the PM org at my current company. I just received a job offer from a small regional bank in my area for an associate PM/ product owner role. The pay is slightly higher than my current salary and it seems like the team really liked me and wants me to come work with them. The job would be working as the primary PM for their new data platform that they’re building out. This would be mostly pipeline and data storage work. The benefits are okay, but nothing great, not better or worse than my current company except for when it comes to PTO. I currently have unlimited PTO and this job would be 15 days. I have taken about 24 days already this year and anticipate I’ll take at least 3 more. I am going to have to negotiate the PTO because I couldn’t move from this to only having 15, but let’s say I could get them to 20, I could probably make that work. Finally, the new job is fully remote but there is an office I could go into if I wanted. My current job is hybrid and requires that we come into the office 3x per week, tracks our days in the office and at the end of the year they prorate our bonus based on attendance. I feel like there are pros to staying and pros to leaving and I would love some advice on what to do. My biggest fear is leaving a tech company in the AI/ML space for a small regional bank doing basic pipeline work and having that be a detriment to my career. On the other hand, I want to make this move to product management and I’m not very happy in my current job, so maybe it would be worth taking the leap. What do you think?

1f9bigr,Sales VS Business Development ,"I am 26M working as a senior sales executive in a property developer. I make a decent salary + Comission. However, there is no job security with my current role. If I don’t close a customer in the next 2 months, I would be laid off. 

I am offered a role as a business development executive in a marketing agency with a slightly higher salary increase + some commission as well. In this company, there are sales executives, so my role would be to search for potential opportunities/leads and pass them on to the sales staff. 

I have never been in a business development role before and I was thinking to try my hand at it. Plus, the marketing agency is very near to my house, it would be very convenient. Something on my mind is if this business development role is a step down from my current role and that possibly the workload would be more demanding. I don’t know how people view sales vs business development. Which is better? 

For some context, I have a bachelors in International business management and a masters in marketing. I have been in my current company for about 7 months. Previously, I was only in marketing roles. I would like to try something new (but somewhat related) while I’m still relatively young. Hence why, I went for the sales role I’m in now.

1f9bdc9,Engineering Career Advice Needed,"I'm an Aerospace Engineering Student, graduating in 2026. I need some advice on how to move forward to get to my goals. I apologize if this is too generic and vague, as I'm just very confused. So, I'd appreciate responses from both HR people and Engineers. To keep things in perspective, the very end goal is to make a good amount of money and have financial stability.  
  
For the engineers in the industry, I can't figure out what role I would want to have. I have done 3 internships yet, one was a generic manufacturing position (just keep the production line running type of thing, not very technical I'd say), a research internship at the Uni, and a support engineering Intern for different engineering software (CAD, FEA, PLM, etc). While all of them were enjoyable, none of them were interesting enough for me to choose them as a career path. This was my background, and now to the actual question part.   
I'm interested in being either structures, controls, or systems engineer. I have had experience with using FEA software like Abaqus and Femap, and am very comfortable with them, partly due to classes and my support engineering internship. As for controls, I'm a team lead of an attitude determination control subsystem for a CubeSat club and am taking some control classes this semester.  Both roles are very interesting to me, but I can't decide what route to finalize and put effort into. It does not help that both are very different from one another. So my question is what is it I'll be working on if I choose one or the other, I don't have any industry experience with either, so just wanted to know about it.   
The other role I was curious about is Systems Engineering. I am taking a class on it, but it's not helping me understand what it actually is about. But I did find that Lockheed pays 170k for new grads to do something called MBSE, no idea what that is, and how to get into it. If some of the engineers in one of these 3 roles can clarify some of these queries for me, I would greatly appreciate it!!!

For the HR people out there hiring engineers, I'm not sure how hard you look at people who are trying to pivot in their careers. In the paragraph above I described that I'm interested in multiple positions, but not sure where I really want to end up. So, was wondering if I were to try one first and see if I like it or not, and if not then I'd move to a completely different role. I know this might actually be more common than I think, but I guess I'm just asking for pointers on what a person who is trying to Pivot needs to do to be successful.

1f9ax27,What should I do hereon? ,"I'm 24F, previously a freelance photographer. I've been working since 2019, except during the lockdown, which puts me at approximately 4 years of experience at this point. I've given my everything to this career. Everyone tells me my skills are exceptional. Even got the same feedback from a bunch of clients. But I've had issues in terms of client retention and client conversion. In March 2024, I took a break and came back to my hometown to think my trajectory through. I wanted to shift focus from concerts to fashion. It took more time than I expected. Meanwhile my parents started pressuring me for master's and I broke. They had me enroll in a tier 4 B school. And I hate myself for doing so. I know my capabilities a lot better than this. But I don't want to give up on my dream.
I know for sure that if I drop out right now, I can get 80% of my fees back. A part of me wants to prepare for a better B school. Another part of me is fighting for my passion.  I also have a cat that I don't want to let go of. I have thought about moving abroad but if that means letting go of my cat, I'm absolutely not doing that. 
Last 3 years of my life have been a living hell for me, my parents filed for a divorce and for the next two years I was emotionally responsible for my parents and my sister, I was in a toxic relationship with a diagnosed narcissist, I lost my dog and I had to drop out of a master's programme. I'm honestly exhausted and burnt out, broke and single. I have no hopes for my future. My cat has been the only good thing in my life right now. 
Do you think withdrawing right now to prepare for entrances would be a better idea? Because in that case I'll start my master's by the age of 25. Is that too late? Is it worth letting go of my dream?

Anyways, I plan on going to school for finance and business, and I’ve finally gotten myself committed enough to actually follow though. My plan was so go to CC for two years to get my associates in finance > bachelors in finance and my masters in business. I didn’t do great in highschool averaging a 3.3gpa, and I slept through the ACT because I just thought it was a test that didn’t mean anything. My parents make about 70k/y so hopefully I get some kind of student aid lol. My questions are: What should I do if I want to minimize the amount of student loans I’ll have to take? Am I doomed and should I just go to trade school and give up? When should I apply for school? What are good ways to get finance experience before/during college?

I have been working as an afterschool program coach for about 4 weeks now and I still find it stressful since I don’t know how the day is going to go. I don’t have really have any experience working with kids. I’ve noticed that everyday is so unsure because sometimes I’m assigned to work with first grade, 2nd and so on. It’s hard to memorize the kids name or get to know them more if the job is not consistent. I do not work alone sometimes I have another coach but we both struggle sometimes for the kids to respect us and get them to do the activities etc. At this school I have been at it’s chaotic it’s like there is a one kid hitting another at least once a week. I also feel insecure because I do not have a “coach”voice because my voice is very soft and it’s very hard for me to raise my voice unless I’m really angry or something. My background is in psychology, I’m planning to get my masters in family therapy so I’m just using this summer or school job as experience possibly or just for some money. It’s not really something I was interested in. It’s close by where I live. I just have feeling that this job is not something I see myself doing long term or that I will last. I tell myself I’m just staying until they fire me or something because I don’t think I’m the type of person for this job or also because the schedule sometimes does not fit me since I have Monday-Friday and I need to do other things. I don’t like the management aspect in that we have to ask for a key to bathroom each time we need to go because apparently we aren’t allowed to use the kids restrooms. Also, when I ask for a question or to request a day or time to leave early they take like a week to respond since there is no in person office or they rarely show up. Thoughts? Should I quit?

1f997n0,Move to new job with higher pay but some uncertainty?,"Currently work fully remote as a motion designer at a small ad company and generally enjoy the work even though it's client based, but recently got spooked by an out of nowhere round of layoffs of coworkers. Ironically my yearly review was a week after and I got glowing reviews from my design lead and his boss. 

Worked at this company for 3 years, and since I was hired the company has not really grown at all and has actually shed some people due to quits and retirement (outside of the layoff).

Since I got spooked and now feel uncertain in my current job, I started applying elsewhere. Ended up interviewing with a company where I would be a 'senior' designer and the pay is 25% more than I currently make. The company is much larger (700 employees throughout US) but the work is honestly more boring creatively. Furthermore, during the interview the interviewer mentioned that the creative team was 'downsized' previously and they are now 'rebuilding it' and when I asked about the creative team, he said despite 'senior' in the job description there are no 'juniors' or direct reports currently. 

That left me feeling a little uneasy since I got the impression I'd be the only person in my roll (no other motion designers) and when I am already feeling uncertain in my current roll, that uneasiness is not making me think this is a more stable position.

Despite my misgivings the interview went well and he said to expect to hear back in a couple days.

So...If offered the roll should I take it, or keep looking? ",artbystorms,2,1.0,0,1725496199,2024-09-05 00:29:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f997n0/move_to_new_job_with_higher_pay_but_some/,9,2024

Switched into an entry level marketing role and quit that after 5 months of feeling anxious sitting all day in an office. I quit the marketing job with no job lined up.

I ended up working for myself doing junk removal and doing part time work as a door to door canvasser. It's been enough to pay the bills but not consistent. I also thought I would love working for myself but tbh I don't really care. A job is a job and at some point they suck. I just want something that will give me a good living. 

The door to door job is temporary and I need a job in a couple months. I've been considering going back into marketing or going back to school to be an xray tech.

I'm stuck in analysis paralysis as I just think every decision I make will be the wrong one longterm and I will be stuck in a low paying job with no upward mobility forever (less than 60k).

This has been a pattern in my life when I feel stuck. I end up having an internal exstistential crisis and quit to do something else. Took me forever to finish college because I quit to try to be a YouTuber. 

Any input would be helpful. What career do you think would be most beneficial for my future? Marketing, xray tech, or something else? Are my concerns valid? Or should I just settle into something for the sake of gaining a higher salary based on experience. Also how do you hold down a job when the newness fades off?

1f98db2,Career Advice - Big Tech Senior Manager vs. Director at Nordstrom,"I’m currently a senior manager of product management at a big tech company, where I’ve been for 7 years with a strong track record and compensation package. However, there’s no clear path to promotion in the next 2 years, and the work-life balance could be better.   

I’ve been offered a director role at Nordstrom, which comes with a 20% lower total compensation but a 20% increase in base salary and a stricter return-to-office policy. Although the director title at Nordstrom might not directly compare to those in big tech, I’m hoping it will help me advance to a senior director or VP role in the future, either within Nordstrom or elsewhere. The Nordstrom role might offer a better long-term work-life balance, but I expect more work hours during the ramp-up period. I have concerns about job security due to the company’s financial situation. The work itself is equally appealing in both roles.

1f97su2,Need advice on whether to pursue new opportunity or stay in current role,"Hello,

I'm deciding between staying in my current role, and accepting a new opportunity. The work is virtually identical:

  
Current Job:

$85K/year

2 days in office, 3 days remote

\~30 min drive to work

Full vested pension if I stay until 6/30/2025 (i'm at 80% right now)

6 weeks PTO/year

Current manager looking to leave company (i would be the #1 candidate to assume the role)

Poor culture, management, and senior leaders. Office is outdated and depressing.

  
New job opportunity:

\~93K/year

5 days in office

\~20 min drive to work

Hired into management role

Culture seems to be a better fit for me based on what i've heard of the company. Formerly worked with many people at the company. Office is posh and in a high end part of my city.

  
Any advice is appreciated!

1f97a5j,Is it worth trying to negotiate during an internal promotion,"Hi! Okay, so I got a promotion from Director to Senior Director. It's been a CRAZY year at my job (B2B consulting company with 125 full-time employees and 200ish contractors). In fact, we just had layoffs (around 10% of staff) about three months ago. 

That being said, I've been at the job for 2 years. Last year I got an ""equity raise"" in order to level the internal salary field (basically I took it as I was being underpaid 13k the first year and for some reason, probably legal, myself and a chunk of my coworkers were made whole). 

Anyway, I'm still not at the midpoint of my current salary band with 12 years of experience, including 2 years of full-time consulting. The offer I received for this senior director role is a 19% increase from my director salary but still 10 thousand below the midpoint of the range. We bring in new hires at 95-105% of the midpoint.

Should I negotiate for the midpoint or be reasonable as 19% is a nice internal raise? I'm torn because I assume all offers are never their ""best"" offer and also, I'm getting promoted after layoffs and I truly like the job. Also the internal climate is very political.

The second job is a student support specialist at the university I attend.

1f96gx2,Written Offer Lower than Expected - Should I Try to Negotiate or Move On? ,"Hey everyone! Like a lot of other people, I’ve been searching for a better job for over a year. 

I’ve been in my current role over 2 years and see no growth in the near future. I have been turned down for 3 different roles in the last 2 months and feel very, very demotivated. My company is in constant flux and I don’t feel challenged or valued anymore. This is my first role where I didn’t get promoted within a year of joining the company. 

I interviewed for a role with a small company that has experienced a lot of growth and is continuing tomorrow grow. Two roles were open - one posted as ‘starting $52,000’ and one posted ‘$58,000-70,000.’ I interviewed with the CEO and stated I would be interested in either role. He asked my salary expectations and I said 63,000-65,000. 

I was called back for a second ‘interview’ of shadowing the employee whose duties I would be taking over for two hours. I asked great questions, took notes, and offered feedback. In speaking with the CEO afterwards, he mentioned he believed I had a lot to offer the company, and that I would hear back this week. 

He emailed me today stating that I could expect an offer letter shortly. Great, I thought. My not-for-profit salary is borderline insulting, and the salary I asked for would be life-changing money. The offer came, and it’s $52,000 for the role posted as ‘starting $52,000. During the interview I got no indication that my asking salary was unreasonable and I’m pretty disappointed. The offer letter states that after a 60-day probationary period I will get a performance and compensation assessment. 

A few points: 
- this job is fully onsite, while I’m hybrid now. I will be spending more on gas/wear and tear on my car
- my currently unlimited and my schedule is very flexible (I can leave in the middle of the day for an appt and no one bats an eye). The prospective company will offer me 6 holidays and cumulative PTO 
- my current company pays my insurance premiums and the prospective company does not sponsor insurance for employees
- the offered salary is just under $300/week more than I am making now. My base salary is low enough that I work 2 part time jobs on the side to make ends meet. My flexible schedule allows me to do this - the prospective role wouldn’t allow me the free time. I am so, so tired of struggling. 
- my current company is consolidating roles and cutting positions, whereas this new company has been doubling their business the last four years (transport logistics company)

Is it worth it to try to negotiate closer to what I asked for? I have experience in the role and a lot of experience in operations. Or am I going to end up getting the first offer I’ve gotten in over a year pulled?

1f94qgb,At what point will my degree become worthless? I'm not sure what to do.,"I graduated college with my Bachelor's in Computer Science in December of 2023. It's now September of 2024, and I've kind of lost hope at this point. This whole process of trying to land an interview (let alone a job) is so demoralizing and has left me feeling worthless. If it's any indication of how much I've given up, I only applied to two jobs in my field last month. My main issue is at the moment is that I have no relevant internship or work experience to put down. I just don't know what to put down on a resume for anything other than software development. I can't figure out how to apply for jobs like ""Quality Assurance"" or ""Software Analyst"" that I hear people throwing around because I have nothing.

I'm sitting at 9 months after graduation with an overall poor work history. I am trying to figure out what I should do with my life. Should I just throw away the past 6 years I've spent earning my degree and work a low-wage retail or fast food job the rest of my life? At what point is this entirely out of my control? That is, how long can I go after graduation without obtaining a relevant job before I'm just automatically rejected due to the gap?

In terms of other jobs, I've only had two jobs before and haven't had one in 4+ years while I was in school. Given my current employment gap and the fact these were only retail and food-service jobs, I can't figure out how to apply for an office job or something where I could leverage the fact that I have a degree. I even had a recent job interview for a $10/hour cashier position, and the guy said I wouldn't be able to do the job given my lack of experience.

At this point, I'm considering enlisting into the military as a last resort. If I'm being honest, I really don't want to do that but I feel that I don't really have a choice. It seems preferable to working a part-time job in retail or fast food where I'm incapable of supporting myself. People have also told me that I could be competitive as an officer candidate given my degree type and GPA (4.0), but I honestly don't know. I'm sure the military doesn't make exceptions about a lack of life and work experience.

What should I be doing at this point? Pretend I don't have a degree and work a low-wage, part-time job indefinitely? Join the military to become fully independent?

1f93blo,Fired From Job By Surprise,"So, I was at a company for a little over a year. Every one-on-one I had with my manager were good reviews. The only feedback I received was to pay more attention to the small details because there was a project I misaligned some items on...

This job was tough and I knew I would have to grow into it. But one day I had an honest conversation with my manager telling them that I was struggling and needed better training. (My initial training for this job was very poor btw. I was sent to another team to train for 6 months then came back to my team and still never received adequate training on MY team's processes). During this meeting my manager said everything needed to ease my mind and assure me that I was doing FINE. And that I was still learning and would get the hang of it and to keep my head up! But she also told me that if i wanted to quit, she would support that decision.... weird. I told her I did not want to quit. I just wanted more support to do the best at THIS job.

Fast forward 3 weeks and she hits me with a P.I.P. with 45 days to complete it. After telling me I was doing fine and had nothing to worry about. And instead of helping curate better training, she just gives me a P.I.P. So I bust my ass to hit all the goals of this PIP. But 20 days into the 45 day deadline, she just decides to fire me anyways, saying that from her assessment I was never going to reach the goal. Again - weird. Because all of our monthly checkins I had positive feedback. 

I've already signed the severance agreement. I got two weeks which is standard. But I'm still so, so angry. Everything about this situation was just so wrong, and dirty.

For anyone who has managed employees before, what response from an employee would make you happiest/most reassured after you gave them feedback and/or criticism on their work?

Often times when a boss comes to me with feedback I will immediately get defensive and go into cover my ass mode. 

Hell most of the time it isn’t fully my fault and I was just a cog in the machine that failed, but I don’t necessarily think trying to argue my case in these situations is always helpful.

1f92v71,How to know if I’m just not fit for my job,"Hello everyone, I recently graduated with a Software Engineering degree but I’m a bad coder tbh. So I got a chance to work as a QA Engineer and at the time I thought it was the best fitting for me as in that I wouldn’t have to code or anything. 

I have been working at this job for the last 4 months but have been making mistakes and can’t seem to keep up with deadlines. I’m starting to think I’m unfit for this job. But that also means that I wouldn’t be fit for almost any job in IT. So I have been wondering if my incompetence is because of being just 4 months in or by that time I would already have to be skilled enough to do my job alone without asking for help or making dumb mistakes? So that means I’m just not fit for this career.

1f92an4,Pay Disparity For Same Scientist Contract Position ,"I (25F) recently started a contractor position at a biotech company under one agency and referred my friend (24M) to a position on my team but through a different staffing agency. I had started 3 months ago and was able to negotiate my initial offer from $100k up to $110k annually. He was recently offered $124k without negotiation.

I am happy for him that he got the offer but this makes me wonder why I was offered so much lower from the start. I had even set a higher salary expectation and was told that “the company is on a really tight budget” so the $10k increase I got through negotiation seemed good at the time.

I understand that agencies are different, but it makes me feel like my agency can definitely pay me more than they had mentioned. Would it be worth reaching out to my agency to see if there is anything they can do to increase my salary/rate? Would this jeopardize my current contract?

1f918jb,"I hate parts of my job and really like some of them, what do I do?","I’ve (33 f) been at my current job for 5 years now and I have started to feel unbelievably bored with some parts of it. Some parts of it is extremely repetitive and I have to deal with tons of rude people. However there are parts of the job that I can control myself, start my own projects, work with my own things and I absolutely love that. I also help my boss from time to time with things that are more difficult and where I feel like I actually get to learn new skills. I also got to take part of a leadership program however it hasn’t really lead to anything (it was a year long and finished in June)

This is my third job since I graduated and it’s the best one yet. I have a hard time imagining this particular type of work to be any better anywhere else but I also feel like I’m stuck. 

I’m very torn between looking for new jobs more towards leadership roles or if I should stay and hope that things change (there might be a change coming next year it’s being discussed right now). I’m also considering if I should “settle” be happy with what I know I have and maybe “search for a meaning” (that sounds so dramatic) elsewhere outside of work. 

Some background info that might be important: I have no family/kids and I don’t want to have it in the future either. I have a history of mental illness (depression/anxiety) but I consider myself recovered since at least 5 years back (this also makes me question leaving this job since it has made me feel so much better) 
I realize I might be in way too deep in work and tbh unless one of my favorite bands tour I’m very caught up in work and I want to be the best (probably an anxiety thing)

I have talked to my boss about this and she understood and told me that I can take time to work on other projects and she sends me some of the more “advanced” tasks when she gets them so I really have nothing to complain about right? But at the same time, I feel like I’m a nobody and especially now since I went through the leadership program I feel like I’m expected to do something more. 

Idk if this makes sense but if anyone has any advice I’d be happy to hear it.

1f90b4x,Should I ask for equity in the startup I work in?,"Hi everyone! I wanted to share my current situation and ask for your advice: do you think I should push for equity in the startup I'm part of? Also, how much equity can an employee typically aim for in a situation like mine, and what strategies should I use to make the request?  
  
Background:  
I'm 28 years old, and about two years ago, I finished a PhD in IT. Shortly after, my supervisor decided to launch a startup, bringing in both me and a former PhD colleague. We were given the responsibility to manage the two main business units of the company. We are based in Italy. Currently, we're primarily doing consulting to generate revenue while also developing internal products in the background.  
  
Over the past 18 months, we've grown without any external funding and now have four full-time employees. Each of us plays a critical role in the company—if even one person were to leave, it would cause significant issues.  
  
Financial Situation:  
I currently earn a gross salary of €37k (slightly over the italian average - poor Italy...-), along with meal vouchers, but there's no bonus structure or discussed growth plan. While I know I could earn much more elsewhere (I've received other offers), I've somewhat accepted this reduced salary because the work environment is stimulating and there are opportunities, albeit sometimes unclear ones.  
  
However, there's an internal policy prohibiting employees from sharing their salaries, which I find questionable. Despite being the first key hires, we have no access to the company's financials.  
  
Currently, the equity breakdown is as follows:  
  
60% to the supervisor who founded the startup,  
20% to someone we've never met but who apparently helped with the paperwork during the initial stages,  
20% to a woman who handles the finances.  
All three partners have other jobs and are rarely present. The supervisor's main contribution is leveraging his network to bring in clients—we manage to secure work with multinational corporations and local businesses without a dedicated marketing team, thanks to his connections. However, everything else, including technical work, management, and operations, is entirely on us.  
  
The Question:  
Considering that my colleague, the other two employees, and I have built all the company’s processes from scratch, written the projects, managed clients, and built the company’s reputation, do you think we deserve some equity? In essence, the four of us are running everything—from the website to event organization, from grant applications to client management, to project development and strategic decisions on which business lines to pursue—since the partners don’t have the time or expertise to handle these tasks.  
  
On the one hand, we have stable jobs with decent pay. On the other hand, I feel like I’m working for someone who isn’t fully aware of what’s going on inside the company, the challenges we face, and how we’re solving them.  
  
Is it normal for a successful startup to keep everything from its employees? How would you recommend approaching the subject of equity?

I wanted to share a little victory I recently achieved that might help anyone looking to save a bit more. Like many of you, I was spending a good chunk of change on daily coffee runs. I knew it added up, but I didn’t realize how much until I took a closer look. 😬

So, I challenged myself: instead of buying coffee every day, I’d make it at home and put that $5 into a savings account. At first, it seemed like a small amount, but it quickly became a habit. Fast forward six months, and I’ve managed to save over $1,000! 🎉

This might not seem like a lot, but knowing I have that cushion for emergencies has made such a difference. If you’re like me and struggle to save, try starting with something small like this. It’s amazing how quickly it adds up when you’re consistent!

During this time I was part of a big project within the company, and I got lots of exposure to senior management and stakeholders in different countries. I made friends with the project manager and helped where I could, she put in a good word with her manager for me.  

I am travelling to the HQ next week, and this manager offered to take me for coffee and lunch. I am hoping we will discuss the potential of me moving countries to work on his team.

I received a job offer today for a senior risk position paying 15k more than I earn now. This role would be in the country I am currently living in. It offers more work from home and a shorter commute for me. However, my close circle of friends has moved all over Europe. I find that I am not doing anything or meeting anyone on weekends unless I travel to see my long-distance partner. 

The issue is, the reason I joined this international company in the first place was to move abroad, where the HQ is. My partner happens to be from the same country as the HQ.

I mentioned matching my salary at the interview and was meet with slight resistance. I also mentioned increasing my PTO to match my current situation if I can't get the salary.

Should I mention this in the offer letter as part of negotiations? Although I hate the commute, I don't want to be on the losing end of this. The new job does seem pretty relaxing also but the company is smaller and less know.

1f8x4lc,Team getting moved under a known incompetent brown nose manager,"Tldr: my team will longer be managed directly by the Sr VP, the plan is to move us under his trusted Sr manager. Everyone hates the Sr manager. It's not a confirmed plan just yet. What do I do? Do I be honest to the VP of how I feel about the situation or is my only option to suck it up and spam my resume? 


Hi, my manager who is a VP, fired my previous manager due to lack of loyalty. He filled his place and was managing us directly. He really loves working with my team and got both of us promotions. Year later he got promoted to Sr VP. I thought since the beginning this was a terrible idea (to manage us directly) because it takes so much of his time, not because we require time from him but because he's a lowkey micromanager but it works since we're in product and he's steering the ship to his liking. And this observation only got worse when he got promoted. He's overall very competent.

Well, now he's moving us under a Sr manager whom he trusts and is friends with outside of work. He somewhat mentors him in his career and directly manages him. This sr manager manages a team of 5 project managers, whom all do subpar work. 

I've worked with this sr manager a couple times and I absolutely hate him professionally, in a casual setting he is fine but not someone I would want to talk to and this is me saying this as someone who doesn't feel negative feeling towards anyone! Rarely do I despise another human. Well he is one of them lol

Whats interesting is that the vp told my partner (we're a team of two) during a one on one about this switch, to which my partner pushed back bc she feels the same way lol, and the vp just brushed off the feedback. This manager also has gotten bad feedback from other teams and individuals. But my VP is blinded by all of these red flags for some reason. I think the Sr manager manipulates the vp and has him in his pocket where he can do no wrong he infomously cost us 10 million over 3 years because he never followed up on the success of his project -- we are now dismantling his installations, he got promoted after that debacle (now he manages project managers imagine how efficient and careful they are?) 

During my one on one we ran out of time talking about projects so the vp didn't mention the switch up, not sure if my partner pushing back was enough? But we left off with scheduling a roadmaping session for next year in two weeks in person, if he brings the Sr manager to the meeting we are cooked lol

What are my options? Shut up stay and spam the resume? Be honest with the VP when they bring it up?

The thing is we'd rather be with another Sr manager the VP manages but they're directly involved with data and business strategy whereas the shit Sr manager does any kind of project management. My team does product management and we pull our own data so we're very technical and the other data/strat sr manager is a little bit more competent (but not by much lol but at least I would enjoy working for him more)",Raisin_Alive,0,0.5,2,1725465937,2024-09-04 16:05:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8x4lc/team_getting_moved_under_a_known_incompetent/,9,2024
1f8wnn2,I think I'm ready to leave education.,"After 8 years, I think I'm ready to leave education

Hello, all. I’m at a point where I think I’m ready to leave teaching and I’m not sure how to proceed with where I am at in my life.

I am a 30 M and I have taught 5th-12th Grade Band for two different public school districts. I have a Bachelor’s in Music Education and I’m a final project and Master’s Defense away from earning my Master’s in Music Education. I got into this career because music and being in band was a huge passion of mine that provided me with great social and performance opportunities. That being said, after 8 years, I’m ready to be done. I don’t feel as passionate about music education anymore, and the constant uphill battle of advocating for myself and my program, as well as the lack of support to do so many of the things it takes to run a successful music program has taken a huge toll on my mental health and I’m ready to walk away.

I’m at a loss for what to do. The pay is actually not the problem, right now I make above the cost of living for my area and make more than most entry level jobs in and around my city. This is important because we recently purchased a house and pay a mortgage set to the budget we have, and I am the main source of income between my wife and I. The idea of going back to school or getting certifications isn’t off the table, but it is something I’m really worried about doing because of where we are at financially and the fact I may have to continue teaching while earning these degrees. It was also our goal to start a family soon.

I am confident in who I am as a leader and a worker and can maybe see myself entering the corporate world, but I don’t know where to begin. I really don’t want to continue in education. I don’t want to write curriculum and I don’t want to pursue school administration, I want to be done. What are some first steps I can take? Are there counselors or therapists that specialize in career advice about what steps I should take to begin figuring this out?",Any-Breadfruit-9679,1,1.0,1,1725464796,2024-09-04 15:46:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8wnn2/i_think_im_ready_to_leave_education/,9,2024
1f8wjks,Weird behavior from boss,"Hello everyone! 

Background: I work on the digital team at medium sized nonprofit. I report directly to our companies Digital Director and work on a team with our graphic designer. I was hired 3 months prior to our graphic designer and have been with my current company a little over a year.

Recently, we got lunch and both realized upon being hired our team director told us both that senior leadership essentially doesn’t want to speak with those below the director position, so both of our interactions with senior management has been limited. 

Simultaneously, we have realized that our team director has been taking credit for our work. At first I expected this since apart of our job is to make him look good. But the extent of the credit being taken that we both realized is the reason for this post. Our director makes my coworker and I look clueless to senior management and like things wouldn’t be getting done if it wasn’t for him. While positioning himself between us and other directors/leadership for any kind of communication to take place.

Meanwhile neither of us could think of a single thing he’s done or contributed over the past year that has made any kind of impact at all. Past 3pm he will hide in the restroom until 5pm? I’m not sure how this behavior is tolerated or how to navigate it so would appreciate any advice!

To be clear I am not proud of dropping out and I have been heavily weighing the idea of continuing my education as a ""Mature Student"" in college. I dont see that  the lack of diplomas have set me back in my careers, its typically something I keep to myself if not directly asked. 

I've gotten really lucky with my resume, I've worked in many different industrys such as managment, healthcare and sales. Sales is the position that's stuck. I currently sell vehicles, I love my job and make roughly 70k annually (which isnt to bad for a 22yo drop out imo). The thing is, I dont see alot of financial growth past what I am already making in this industry. I want to continue with sales as either a Mortgage agent or Realestate rep. Those both require some schooling and I'd either need highschool or equivelent (college degree).

1f8tm7i,I am lost and need a goal ,"Hi there! I write this as a 24 year old that has been working in warehousing since I graduated high school, I’ve had a lot of issues with my mental health and getting out of my comfort zone, I have had multiple opportunities for employment over the last couple of months but have had some issues with commitment which has really made me feel shit. I’m now tired of feeling stuck and want to try and address my issues and get healthy. Currently I work only two days of the week so have plenty of time to learn. In the meantime I’m trying to have a goal  for employment, something to keep me sane otherwise I feel lost and depressed. I know I want to work and achieve something once my health gets in order. My biggest issues holding me back is that I always seem to struggle more than the average person at learning stuff and developing a skill, it really brings me down and stops me from attempting a lot of trades even though I would love to have something under my belt, I also struggle with anxiety of driving to unknown places so a lot of work with driving around is hard. I also seem to never be able to stick to something while studying and lose motivation. I know I need to overcome these issues, but I really feel I need a goal to work towards as I’m feeling so lost and sick of just working a dead end job. I honestly have interest in anything that is a skill ( even though I struggle learning things) I’m also interested in geopolitics ( doesn’t seem like it’s a clear goal for jobs as it’s niche) and I don’t wanna study for 4 years and end up lost without a job, I was also considering military but I have a mental health history which might stop me from being accepted.  I am not good at maths but was open to computer programming as I can learn it at home and would feel good to have as a skill.  So far the jobs that interest me are trades, geopolitics, military/defence, programming but I’ve given reasons that stop me from pursuing all… honestly I’m open to any job that makes me feel like I’m good at something or I have worth. Sorry if this sounds like the most ridiculous post ever, I do have some issues and just want any assistance or words from a stranger that could maybe relate or have advice.

I accepted another SFA offer for a bigger company that has $21B in annual revenue in the medical equipment and tech manufacturing space. For context, I have over 4.5 years of experience and my current job is the longest I have been at any company. I live in a MCOL. The only reason I am stuck with fully taking the new role is I really love my current job. I love my team. I’ve been searching since February and now I got an offer that’s desirable, I feel stuck. However, I get stressed about the layoffs that has been happening. My managers assured us we will not be affected. Then the new CEO ruined the culture so I started resenting it. After giving my 2 weeks notice, they were very adamant to keep me - wanting to offer me whatever I want. Maybe not the salary but perhaps WFH more. I'm scared of change as I have been job hopping so much for the past 4.5 years. Here is the breakdown:

Current company:

-$83k annual salary/supposed to get 3.5% increase this past June but new CEO took that out/No annual bonus

-Growth and development is very slow with average tenure employees in the company 10-20 years. However, Senior Director will be retiring in two years so my current manager will be taking his place then I'll be promoted in to a Finance Manager

-Work life balance is astronomically great - amazing team and caring managers BUT when new CEO came in, we switched from 1x in office to 3x - ruined the culture so now it's a very hostile work environment.

-Multiple rounds of layoffs - direct managers I have worked with was laid off and closed mutliple warehouses.

-Commute is 10 mins away.

New job offer:

-$92k annual salary/3.5% merit increase in March and 10-15% annual bonus both eligible- recruiter said team has received 30-40% bonus last year. Negotiated for higher salary or sign on bonus but to no avail.

-Growth and development is very apparent as they are constantly growing - role opened due to growth.

-Work life balance seemed to be very good as well. Employee tenure averaged from 10-15 years. Team seems really nice - I like the energy a lot.

-Had done constant acquisitions in the past couple years and been very successful

-Commute is 40 mins away with a lot of flexibility to WFH - 2-3x a week in the office depending on workload - many times it's 1x a week or no office work at all.",Zealousideal-Cow6626,1,1.0,0,1725456271,2024-09-04 13:24:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8t995/advise_on_what_offer_to_take/,9,2024

1f8qc4c,Career options to maximise earnings with a Business (IO) Psychology master's and 10 years consulting experience?,"I've been working as a Business (IO) Psychologist (consultant) for around 10 years in the UK (North West), but my salary has never been enough to afford a decent lifestyle - even after a promotion and some job hopping I'm stuck under £35k and renting in a house share. As I'm entering my 30s I feel like I need to make a change if I'm ever going to build the life I want.

I have a Psychology undergrad degree and Business (Occupational / IO) Psychology master's degree from a respectable (but not 'top tier') London university - along with all the usual psychometric qualifications (hogan, 16pf, mbti, etc) and a coaching certification.

While I enjoy what I do (consulting on leadership assessment/development projects with multinational businesses), it hasn't been the high paid career I was promised it would be when I was at uni. My earnings have likely been limited by my location, but until recently I had commitments with elderly relatives that required me to remain close to my home town, which I'm glad I was able to do. 

I ideally want to relocate to London (as I enjoyed living there as a student and it should provide greater opportunities for high pay), but when I look on LinkedIn for similar roles to mine, salaries are in the £28-35k range, so I don't think I'd even be able to afford a house share in London on that.

So I'm looking for advice on well paid roles in literally any industry that I could pivot to using my existing qualifications and/or experience? It can be linked to what I do now, or something completely unrelated (e.g. a corporate role) - as long as it's well paid, or at least something where I'm not starting again at the bottom of the ladder; I don't want to feel like the last 10 years were for nothing and I can instead use them as leverage.

As a side note - I pick new concepts up quickly so am not afraid of a complete career change, and I'm good with technology and considered a computer science degree before following this career path.

Any suggestions would be really appreciated, so if you know of anything even slightly relevant, please let me know. Thanks!",Changemycareer,1,1.0,0,1725447567,2024-09-04 10:59:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8qc4c/career_options_to_maximise_earnings_with_a/,9,2024

Hello, my name is Oreo. I’m a 23 year old female born on March 14. Currently I’m feeling down at the fact that I feel as if I’m lost in life rn. I watched Dream Academy on Netflix and I ended envying the girls who had a chance to do that program to get training for two years to be in a girl group. Honestly I think I have so much potential but I’m not in a good place rn. 

I’ve grown up over weight my entire life and I’ve had so many turning events that it left me depressed and resorted to binge eating. I also have Pcos in which didn’t help my cravings. I’m currently 290 standing at 5’3. I’m trying to get into the gym but I have things to worry about like work to make money to move out and get a chance to have to room. To start training in dancing. Moral of my story is, my dream is to Dance and Sing — Create, become an Artist but  where do I start? Where do I go to ? I wish I could just go to a program. Like how it is when I was playing softball. I had my parents to help me find coaches better opportunities on great teams? I went to college for a year but then I stopped it because it wasn’t what I was passionate about. I wasn’t motivated enough in that sport… I’m motivated enough in dance. I feel the most confident in my flexibility and my ability to pin point moves when I can. Honestly. I haven’t found the time. I have a partner that I take care of and I’m nervous to tell anyone including my family that I want to do big changes. Getting into dance and music… feels like it’s a BIG change for them. Although I haven’t discussed it… I don’t feel like I have the resources enough to tell them how I’m gonna accomplish my dreams…

If anyone can advise me or tell me what they think I could do in my situation? ",Oreo-Astro,0,0.5,0,1725446844,2024-09-04 10:47:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8q56g/career_guidance_i_need_your_help_where_do_i_start/,9,2024
1f8ps6b,Worth it? ,"Hi all

Just looking for some perspective. I’ve been working for a small local company as an advisor earning around 100k per year for 7 years. I have a good reputation and have a great relationship with my clients in a smaller industry. I do like my job but I’ve started to find it a little repetitive after 7 years, I’d like to increase my wage and there’s no where to move within the company. 

I’ve been offered a job for a multinational corporation for around 120k working in the same industry but to a wider range of clients. The issue is, I’m worried I’ll upset my clients in the same industry, it’s a bad time in the year to leave and I genuinely care about helping them. My position is technical and niche so it will take them a while to replace me. Would you think this is a good move in the long run? I want to remain in the industry long term

For reference I'm a European guy with no Engineering or CS degree, who's trying a career change.



I'm interested in electronics, networks and telecommunications, and programming, but I don’t have a clear goal in mind.



* The embedded company is a small SME that creates industrial products, but it has several branches across Europe. The financial offer is appealing, and with the training included, it’s a very interesting opportunity. The work is on-site, of course.
* On the other hand, the field service technician company is large and expanding, within the pharmaceutical sector. I would have to travel to clients, mostly in the German Speaking Europe, and there’s an opportunity to advance my career and eventually work as a senior technician or manager at the new locations in Germany over time, if I play my cards right and am lucky.



That said, I’m evaluating the offers from different perspectives.



1.Economic: Earnings prospects in the short and long term.



2.Sustainability: Constant traveling or working in another region far from home can be tough in the long run. Ideally, I’d like to know about in office or remote working options



3.Job satisfaction: Simply put, which one aligns with my interests.

1f8ny12,"Early career is going well, but I might end up stuck in QA","I'm a recent college grad working as a QA engineer (not software QA) for small-med sized defense industry firm. I have a background in manufacturing engineering, which is what I want to be doing in the future. 

For now, the move to QA has been fantastic. I have a couple really cool projects designing cool systems and bringing some powerful new tech in to automate inspections. I have full autonomy over my projects and I'm the only contributor. 

However, lately I've been having to pause work on those projects because my boss wants to transition me towards Supplier Quality Engineering, which is way off of where I want to be. That feels like a lateral move in the wrong direction. I have experience doing all of the SQE duties as we've been short a few people for a while and I never mind doing it, but I know I will start to resent my job if I find myself only working with suppliers. 

I don't want my engineering skills to atrophy. I miss building janky prototypes and designing gizmos.

I've been working there for 8 months (+1.5yr as an intern) and am having my mid year review soon. I don't think I'm going to say anything, but I can't help feeling like if I don't do anything about it I'm going to be miserable doing SQE work for years.

1f8ne4d,Need advice. Manager is slimy,"I have tried to talk about career development with my manager for 1 year and a half since I started my role. She would always postpone it or not talk about it. I am looking to relocate from the U.K. to the US and everyone in my team knows that.

I told my manager that I scheduled a meeting with the Senior VP of the entire team to talk to her about my career goals to relocate to the US.

The senior VP is from the US and is the nicest and most supportive leader I have come across.

My direct leader immediately scheduled development chats in the calendar and made me postpone my meeting with the Senior VP to this month.

My direct leader never cared about development until I went to the higher up, but it's now too late. I already made a decision to start looking for US roles and she has never been close to my career goals in the past despite me trying to reiterate what I'm looking for.

My direct leader has had 4 complaints from previous direct reports and they all quit the team because of her. I have a 25 page report of her doing horribly toxic things throughout my time in the role. She doesn't have good relationships with co-workers and is not liked by the majority. She is also fully virtual so she is not even in the office.

I suspect that on these conversations, she will try to put me in a box and manipulate me into waiting for another year until I start applying. How can I remain strong and reiterate what I want - relocation in a US role that aligns with my transferable skills.

1f8mz1u,"28M - Feeling lost and confused on the path forward, any advice?","28M here from India, feeling lost and confused on how I should take my career and life forward.

A little background: I have a Bachelors degree in electrical engineering and a MBA from Tier 2 University in India. After MBA got into IT sales (April 2020), although I learned a lot in that role, the pay was so bad that I was not able to meet my basic expenses living in a tier 1 city, so I switched jobs after 1.5yrs and got into SDR (Sales Development Rep) role for a product based IT company in another Tier 1 city but it was a remote role. Things went down hill when I decided to switch from the Second company after 7 months (Reason for switch: lot of internal politics and my team was sidelined) then I joined another US based product company which had a really good brand value and again joined them as an SDR, although I was not performing my best(went through a bad breakup which affected me mentally) I was just hitting the average numbers but by Feb 2023, the entire sales function based in India were laid off and a team of around 45 people got impacted and I was part of it too. By this time I got too drained and decided to switch from Sales and hunted for Customer Success roles, since I didn't have the CS experience I was not getting shortlisted but even then one startup offered me the role but I had to take a pay cut of almost half the CTC I was taking in the last company and even then I went ahead with it since profile change was my utmost priority. I joined this startup and in my second week they again put me into Sales role and I was the only sales guy there and again I resigned and went back to being an SDR at another company, by this time I was completely exhausted by being in Sales and wanted a change desperately. I tried networking with other departments in this company and things started looking postive and were going along with the flow, but then after 6 months into this role, my team was again laid off which was December 2023. 

After this I completely made up my mind and decided to do a second masters specialising in Supply chain and logistics or project management (My MBA specialisation was in Operations so I thought of exploring more of the operations side) from Germany, and I was preparing for German universities and parallely learnt German language. But then due to entry requirements my profile did not match the university's criterias and I didn't get through admission. So right now I am again back to ground zero and kind of clueless and confused as to what to do.

Some options that I've considered:

 1. Apply for a Master's program in Ireland but then on researching - the current scenario is really bad in Ireland and there are very less universities for January Intake.
 
 2. Start a small eatery brand in my hometown - have some ideas but then I am really worried since I don't have a background and food industry is somewhat brutal

3. Tried applying for Sales Operations and other sales support roles, but then my applications are not even getting shortlisted ( I believe it has to do with the frequent job switches and the career break and also not enough direct experience) 

4. Take up any course that offers job assistance but I am not sure what course to take up and since there's a plethora of people taking up IT courses, it'll be kind of tough for me to break into IT on the tech side.

This is where I am right now and kind of clueless as you can see, so I request the people in this community to give me some solid advice and help me find a path forward. 

Tl;DR:  Faced setbacks in IT sales roles, including low pay, layoffs, and unsuccessful attempts to switch careers. After failing to get into a Master's program in Germany, I'm now considering options like studying in Ireland, starting a food business, or taking a job-related course, but I'm uncertain about the next steps.

1f8mwd8,Thinking about telling my boss I'm looking for a new job - does this make sense in my situation?,"I [38m] work in a corporate marketing manager role and have had a successful 10 year career in marketing working my way up despite a fairly late start. I live in Australia where the job market is decent and there are available roles offering what I'd be looking for.

I've been with my current employer for ~3 years, and while it was going great for a while with promotions and growth opportunity, we were acquired by a large competitor in the last year and my outlook is no longer as positive. My previous boss and the CMO (both champions of mine) were let go and replaced with inadequate leadership. The work has increased substantially without additional support, and raises across the board were below average this year.

Most importantly, the future growth opportunities I had in my role are now unclear. I don't know what the companies plans are for marketing down the line, whether they are looking to expand my own role/team, or what really lies ahead in the next 1-5 years if I stay in this position. The previous company clearly valued marketing and my role, but now it feels like they don't. All new marketing hires (including candidates I was bringing on board to work underneath me) have been paused indefinite. These changes aren't a reflection of the work I've done or how they value me personally, because I've only ever exceeded my targets and received praise plus I've been awarded the maximum available bonuses and merit increase. The issue is that everyone in the marketing department around the globe is now stretched thin with more work, lack of necessary resources and no new hires or additional support.

All that combined with a number of other nuanced grievances I don't need to get into has me looking for a new job the last couple months. The problem is that I don't have enough time to be really focusing on the job search, working with headhunters, writing applications and going on multi-round interviews. I went to four rounds of interviews with another company this past week only to find out I didn't get the job, and it was almost impossible to fit them in my schedule.

**Here's where my question comes in. If I tell my boss that I'm interviewing for other roles, I figure one of three things can happen:**

1) She will understand how serious I was about my previously voiced frustrations and consider doing something to get me to stay like a promotion, raise, new hires, etc. I think this is very unlikely and I don't even know if she has the option to do any of these things if she wanted to.

2) The company will fire me and I receive the 2+ month's severance I'm entitled to in Australia. That will give me a solid 2 month cushion to focus full time on finding my next job. My previous boss and the CMO who were both let go earlier in the year would still be happy to provide references for me as well.

3) **I honestly think this is most likely**: She will be disappointed but say there isn't much else she can do to improve my situation right now since they really don't have any more budget for new hires, salary increases or anything else. The company really does need me around for the next 3 months at least to work on the numerous projects I'm managing, so she wouldn't want to fire me either. There have been two resignations in the marketing department recently and they don't want to lose another person. Basically she would say, ""I hear you, thanks for letting me know."" and everything would continue as it is.

The way I look at it, with these three possibilities I don't see a major downside. A lot of people may say I'm taking a huge risk if they let me go and I can't find another job in 2 months, but honestly I'm at the point where I would even take a step down to get into a role that is less stressful than this one. I've been miserable for months and I don't see it getting better any time soon. I was laid off during COVID and managed to make it work, so I'm familiar with being out of work when the job market is competitive in this industry. The number of jobs I'm seeing advertised make me feel like getting laid off with two months to figure out the next steps wouldn't be the worst thing.

Am I crazy for thinking this is a good idea??

**TL;DR:** I'm thinking of letting my boss know I'm currently interviewing with other companies. The worst case scenario is she fires me, which would leave me with two month's severance (+ unused paid leave) to focus all my time on a job search. This may seem too risky, but the job market in my industry seems pretty good right now and I could use the extra time to focus on finding the right role. To be clear, I'm in Australia - severance and leave may be handled differently in other countries.",wdfx2ue,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1725433179,2024-09-04 06:59:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8mwd8/thinking_about_telling_my_boss_im_looking_for_a/,9,2024

1f8mgdn,How do I pick the lesser of two evils?,"This could be an extremely long post and I really need feedback so for sake of simplicity, I’m going to try and condense it -

My job has been absolute hell this past year. I was approached about another opportunity and jumped at the chance to take it, but the situation has evolved and I’m being given a counter offer by my work. I’ve learned new information as well since the process started and I’m now feeling so torn about what to do. I have already accepted the job offer for job B. The role is new to the company and I’m supposed to start there in a week and a half. While I know it’s not in good form, this is my life, and at this point I’m thinking of calling job B up and express to them that I really do want to work for them, I am excited about the opportunity, but that my current job (job A) has provided me with an offers that really hits on things which are very important to me, and I’d like to see if there is anything they can do for me so I can work there with comparable comp/benefits package. The problem is, even if they were to say yes and match it, the pros and cons of each option still leave a lot to weigh, and so I’m hoping to get some thoughts on what to do:

JOB A (my current job) - I don’t trust anyone in upper management here. There have been things said about my not bringing value to the company, not being capable of doing my job etc. by people at the top. I have so much anxiety about job security because all of the things that have been said, stuff that has happened. The company is doing really well financially. The counter offer I’ve been given is 15% above my current pay, promotion in title, a clause to provide a severance in case of termination (this was a nonstarter for me after everything that’s happened here), a lot of flexibility, and most importantly, if my husband and I decide to have a second child they have promised me (it will be in writing) that I can take 6 months of leave. It’s not paid, but when I had my first child I requested this and was denied. I could only get 3 months. I was told they didn’t want to set a precedent. I don’t care that it’s not paid, I just don’t want to miss out on that time. I will never get it back. I also will receive expanded bonus benefits. Despite having very little trust in upper management, I basically sat down with my current boss leading up to this counter offer and laid everything out on the table, and he shed light on some of the things that had happened to try and make me feel better. The thing is, I’m not sure if I can trust him, so I don’t know if I believe him, but logically thinking through what he told me, some of it makes sense.

JOB B - the company is smaller and has a history of volatile financial performance which is a bit concerning if I’m being honest. Both the CEO and CFO seem very honest and down to earth. I get the sense that they are very moral and genuine and coming from my current work environment, that’s truly a breath of fresh air. The offer salary is lateral to what I’m making right now. The title is increased and there are some responsibilities I don’t currently handle, that I will be taking on there. I’m kicking myself now for not attempting to negotiate my salary upwards, but I guess I felt comfortable getting what I’ve already been getting, and they are a smaller company. The kicker is that one of my coworkers recently just got recruited there too. I was always wary of him but after some recent events I don’t trust him at all either. He will be in a position equal to mine and we will work alongside each other but are work isn’t really intertwined. He is always trying to get ahead and can be pretty malicious in the process. I wouldn’t put it past him to throw me under the bus if he felt like I was gaining more power and influence than he was. 

Given these two options, what would you do?",Alive-Zucchini-4803,0,0.5,1,1725431244,2024-09-04 06:27:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8mgdn/how_do_i_pick_the_lesser_of_two_evils/,9,2024

1f8kw2z,Would it be bad to quit my internship?,"I’m a senior in high school doing an internship through a program at my school. It’s for a local, small company, and it’s extremely boring. The company seems pretty disorganized in terms of what they have the intern doing. So far I’ve just done grunt work that takes maybe an hour and I just sit there for the rest since there’s nothing else for me to do. The lady who’s supposed to “train” me for the “important” stuff speaks really fast and isn’t very good at explaining, and I honestly think she doesn’t really know what to do most of the time, so I’m pretty confused.  

I’m considering quitting and switching out of the class; I already dread going. It’s not in a field I’m interested in, so I don’t think I’ll make any connection or whatever, and I already have a part time job, so I don’t really need the minimum wage they’re paying me. The only downside I quitting is that the teacher of the class likes me, so I might ruin the relationship there. But I’m graduating this year so would it really be that big of a deal? It lasts the whole year and I just cannot see myself doing it for that long.

1f8k9vq,Has anyone had a bad performance review at work?,"*\*\*Apologies for the long post ahead\*\**  
  
I work in Change Management for Finance at a multinational company. I’ve been in my current role for almost a year. When I started in this team, my boss (let’s call her ""Monica""- who is in a very senior position), assigned me tasks that weren’t very challenging, such as improving the look and feel of PowerPoint presentations. This continued for 6 months, despite me asking for more challenging work and expressing my frustration.  
*\*\* To add context: I started to accumulate frustration as I transitioned to this team because I wasn’t doing much in my previous role. Projects were often assigned to more senior staff, due to their requirements. After a year of limited work, I felt rusty as I wasn’t doing much, and didn't have the chance to get more experience and showcase my skills for a potential promotion. So, working on make PPT prettier in this new team was making me even more frustrated\*\*\**

Let's go back to my current rule. Some things happened:

* I had a small conflict with one of my team members on a shared project. This person - who has more seniority than me - didn't want me to share responsibilities with her and exposure. Her point of view is that my responsibility was only to improve the look and feel of a training presentation, despite that wasn't the original plan. She told me she was in charge of providing support to this project, and that I should follow her orders since she had more experience and seniority (despite that she is not my boss). I discussed this with my boss - Monica -, asking her if she could help me to resolve the situation. It seemed that after that things were ok.

* I asked Monica about a timeline for promotion, so I could focus my efforts, but she said it was ""not appropriate"" to ask.

* I also had communication issues with Monica. She would often read my messages or emails but respond after my work shift, the next day, or sometimes not at all. While I understand her higher position comes with demands and busy agendas, I told her that I'd appreciate some response. I had to even share my screen on MS Teams (requested by her) to show her that she ignored my messages, and she denied it all of it.

* I expressed her my need for guidance and someone being more present. After several conversations, I asked if my colleague, (let's call her Christina),"" whom I got along with, could become my direct supervisor. Bothof them agreed, so Christina became my direct supervisor, and Monica remained my manager.

Working with Christina became challenging. She is also aiming for a promotion and I noticed a change in her, becoming more strict, often pointing out minor issues. Despite my efforts to be proactive and come up with ideas, her feedback is mainly focused on small things (for example the way how I write emails, that I should think “outside the box”, starting to share my screen with a file we review every week on the team’s call, or removing highlights from internal documents). I receive some positive feedback but from time to time.

The most difficult part was my **annual performance review**, where both my manager and direct supervisor gave me **mostly negative feedback**. While I understand everyone has areas they can improve on, and I’m no different, this was way beyond that. They tend to point out the negative constantly and not mention much about the positive things that I did.

During the performance review call, Monica (my manager) told me that I had challenging attitudes with my peers. And Christina (my supervisor) said that my overall work is ok, but I should be more open to feedback, and proactive. They documented all this plus some more details (like the examples about emails, removing highlights, which I mentioned above) on the performance tool.

I feel like no matter what I do, it’s never enough for them. This is my first bad review in over five years with the company. I’m considering transitioning to another team now that I’ve been here for a year (internal transfers are allowed after one year).  
  
However, I’m unsure if this is the best move since I’ll need feedback from both of them for the internal transfer (as HR ask for references), and I’m concerned about what they might say.

Any advice on how to navigate this? I'm quite lost and I'd appreciate any suggestion.  
Thank you!

1f8jg9j,Manager asked me to lunch...,"I might be overthinking this, but I’ve just started my career, and navigating corporate life is still new to me. My full-time summer internship transitioned into a very part-time role until I graduate in December. Since my workload has been sporadic, I’ve mostly been working from home. Although I’ve received positive feedback from my boss, I still struggle with self-doubt and anxiety.

Today, my boss asked if I was coming into the office tomorrow. I told them I wasn’t planning to, as I usually come in only when I know I have enough work—this has never been an issue before. They then mentioned wanting to take me to lunch next week if I’m in the office but also offered to meet me in my neighborhood.

I feel like if this were something serious, it would involve a Teams meeting with HR. I really like my manager; they’ve been a great mentor, and I’ve never had this kind of support before, so I’m naturally a bit doubtful. What do you think this could be about?

Hello, my name is Oreo. I’m a 23 year old female born on March 14. Currently I’m feeling down at the fact that I feel as if I’m lost in life rn. I watched Dream Academy on Netflix and I ended envying the girls who had a chance to do that program to get training for two years to be in a girl group. Honestly I think I have so much potential but I’m not in a good place rn. 

I’ve grown up over weight my entire life and I’ve had so many turning events that it left me depressed and resorted to binge eating. I also have Pcos in which didn’t help my cravings. I’m currently 290 standing at 5’3. I’m trying to get into the gym but I have things to worry about like work to make money to move out and get a chance to have to room. To start training in dancing. Moral of my story is, my dream is to Dance and Sing — Create, become an Artist but  where do I start? Where do I go to ? I wish I could just go to a program. Like how it is when I was playing softball. I had my parents to help me find coaches better opportunities on great teams? I went to college for a year but then I stopped it because it wasn’t what I was passionate about. I wasn’t motivated enough in that sport… I’m motivated enough in dance. I feel the most confident in my flexibility and my ability to pin point moves when I can. Honestly. I haven’t found the time. I have a partner that I take care of and I’m nervous to tell anyone including my family that I want to do big changes. Getting into dance and music… feels like it’s a BIG change for them. Although I haven’t discussed it… I don’t feel like I have the resources enough to tell them how I’m gonna accomplish my dreams…

It’s unfortunate that everyone here and everyone I’ve talked to lately has either 1. hated their job, or 2. are unable to find employment. All that being said, I’m struggling pretty hard right now, as my current role is sending my mental state straight down the drain.

I have a BS in Psychology, a poor move on my end in retrospect with how broad that degree is without providing any actual benefit, and an MS in Educational Psychology. My MS basically is a poor way of saying that I do instructional design, or learning and development. That’s the field I really want to be in, but unfortunately I have been so completely unable to find work. I work as an entry level education coordinator and struggle to pay the bills. Directly before this, I worked abroad as an English teacher, so nobody really turns my way with that experience either.

I do also have experience working in a higher ed department as an operations team lead, which I thought would be a positive experience to bring to the table too, but no cigar as of yet.

1f8huka,Just turned 30 and I am wondering if I should switch entirely from IT to Dental?,"As the title says, I recently turned 30 years old last month, my ex-fiance of 7 years ended our relationship this week due to me not having anymore passion and inspiration in life - she is an orthodontist residency student, so I was there from the very beginning for her throughout dental school and 2/3 of the ortho program.

I have a good paying job of $90k per year doing basic desk side support in the midwest for a huge firm, it is from 8-5PM Monday to Friday everyday in the office, so no WFH. The job really has no areas of skill growth, it is just show up and help people with their computers without having any sort of growth since we are not allowed to touch any system management software.

Have been working on getting my undergrad for years and spending money on it when I should have been done with it a long time ago, but I am still 53% of the way there for it. ($14K in student loan debt since I failing to complete the courses due to my ADHD - finally getting some medication for it, but do not know how it will works)

I am currently enrolled at WGU under the Cloud Computing program, but I am realizing how much I do not like IT. There is no passion for me there because I am pretty much a glorified customer service rep that needs to be at the whim of others, which has been my entire ""career"" at this point.

I do have a plan to try to knock out my undergrad as soon as possible before the start of summer 2025, but again, it might not be for something I am completely too interested in - haven't really gotten to the meat of the cloud content, so this opinion might change. However, I am wondering if I should just switch my entire career path to something healthcare related since I enjoy serving people in actual time of need.

I know this sounds crazy, but I was legitimately looking up the process to do a post-bacc (After I get my Bachelors) and trying to get into medical/dental school, since I was with someone that did that process, I learned a couple of things that are related to the field and how they maneuver. Big issue with this is that I will need to put myself in 400-500k in debt along with probably spending 7 years minimum studying full time trying to be done with just medical/dental school.

IT in general is really volatile with everyone getting laid off so I need to make sure I find something that can weather the storm, especially since I do not have a passion for it, I have a passion for tech, but not the support side of things anymore.",Apollo802,3,1.0,10,1725415629,2024-09-04 02:07:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f8huka/just_turned_30_and_i_am_wondering_if_i_should/,9,2024

1f8d8xg,I'm an idiot. What can I do at this point?,"For context, I (20F) graduated from high school in May 2022 and got a full-ride scholarship to a community college for any associate's degree. Initially, I chose Computer Science because I deluded myself into thinking I could handle all the math and coding, but I freaked out before I could even get to those upper-level classes. Then, I switched to cybersecurity, but I recently switched out of that too because the classes were getting too hard for me, and I had no actual interest in IT. I was just looking up answers to assignments and quizzes on Quizlet. I'm not a good student at all, and I don't know what I really want in life.

Now, I have so many credits from different things that I just chose to do an AA in General Studies. I know for a fact that I can't get any actual jobs outside customer service or admin assistant with just that degree. To make matters worse, I told my parents that I just wanted to get a full-time job anywhere and find an apartment on my own. There aren't any jobs in my area (Dallas/DFW) that pay well enough for me to live on my own with just an AA, so that was a ***huge*** mistake.

I really need help.  UK Job market is so tough rn…

I’m a 2:1 recent graduate in Business and want to start a career in business analysis to then get into Project Management whilst gaining the relevant qualifications like CAPM and Agile Practitioner etc
I have no experience at all and have only done a social media internship where I created content for the university’s graduate school social media platforms 
I keep applying for roles where they’ll train me in both business analysis and project management such as BMS Performance and Pareto, did a question application with BMS but yet to hear if my application is advancing but they are so difficult to get a hold of (tried phone, email etc) and as for Pareto, still not heard back but did phone them too and should hear back soon.

I’m using search terms like entry level analyst on so many sites like TotalJobs, Glassdoor, CV library, reed, LinkedIn but sometimes as they’re terrible, and I either get rejected or don’t hear back and I really need a job immediately. Even if I did get into social media field, it’s gonna be SO hard to then get into the fields I want to be in (business analyst and project management).

I just need advice on which other search terms to use and what else positions will allow me to get into these fields near Manchester?

I have tried applying for jobs like project coordinator but no luck

And waiting for 2025 grad schemes is too far away as it starts a year later, which I can’t, I need a job similar now.

I’d appreciate any advice and suggestions!

I started a job at a research institute 6 months ago with a 2-hour one-way commute (1 hour if I drive, but I don't have a license yet, I should get it in 4 to 5 months). Initially, my boss allowed flexible/compressed hours and one day of home office (unofficial talk before I signed) . Recently, due to project delays (due to equipment availability), he revoked these flexibilities, requiring me to be in the office every day. This change is really tough as my family is expecting a second child soon. I'm also angry for his little understanding of my life, and I'm not willing to put all my energy anymore there.

I feel undervalued despite my efforts and am considering quitting at the end of the year. Although we have savings for years, I'm anxious about finding another job due to language barriers in my country. With the commute and the kid at home, I haveno energy to look seriously for jobs at the moment. Any advice on what to do?

Well now the supply of the others is running out due to job seeking elsewhere and trying to move out of the department, they have asked me to take on training of others and to be the lead of my division with no financial incentive. I asked when presented division org shift if there will be any financial incentive and was greeted with a quick no but.. “will take consideration during year reviews for a bump”. This year I got ME same as last year while taking on more tasks not necessary with a 2% decrease in hourly raise in comparison to when I first signed on. Interns are valued more for foundational ladder climbs than my division of peers. I have seen my peers be “yes men” to these request and clearly not incentivized to do so resulting in cynical morale, demotivation and burnout. This all leads to the question, why should I invest my foundational career growth time in others talent when I am not being invested in by my management.

1f8aryh,Why am I always left out of important meetings or learning opportunities despite being told how valuable I am to the team?,"It seems that, no matter where I go and no matter what I do, I am always purposefully left out of important meetings and learning opportunities despite being told how valuable I am to the team. This happened a few years ago during my first official marketing job. My boss paid for all of my colleagues to attend a six week social media training course, but when I asked if I could attend as well, I was told no without a reason. One of my senior colleagues took me under my wing and told me later after we had both left the company, “That was a dumb decision by our CMO. You were actually running our socials and should have attended the sessions with us.”

Now in my current position, another senior colleague has taken me under her wing and told me about and encouraged me to attend an all day meeting at the office next week that our department is holding to discuss how we can improve our marketing efforts as a whole group. All the editors and marketers are coming together…except me. I asked my boss (not my manager, long story, but she’s the one who hired me and acts more like a manager) if I could attend, and she didn’t seem to expect that I would ask. She fumbled through many excuses, like, “I would hate to waste your time when you could be doing other things” and “I’ll check the schedule and let you know if you’d be needed.” Then a few days later, she told me that there would be no need for my presence, since they won’t be discussing social media. She likes to claim that’s what I’m here for but I don’t want to just be social media support. I am a generalist marketer and I would like to grow skills outside social media, especially marketing strategy which is the purpose of this all day event.

I’m feeling very bummed and worthless because despite both bosses from these companies telling me how valuable I am, no one I ever work for ever seems to care about my professional growth.

1f8abn2,Interviewing while starting a new job?,"Hey y'all, recent grad here. I finally got an offer for a job, it's basically a stop gap role to make money and get my foot in the door. A couple days before I got the offer though another company got back to me for an interview for a role I actually want and far better pay but a much longer commute. Long story short I still accepted A's offer after interviewing with B because A needed an answer ASAP and an offer I have is better than one I might get but also scheduled a second interview with B because that role is just so much better.

However, if the second interview goes well and there's a third round of interviews for B I'd be just starting my job at A. My first week looks super structured so I can't just come in early/stay late and I feel like calling in would both be a bad look and screw me over if B didn't extend an offer and I had to stay at A.

  
So I have two questions. 

One, do I tell B I'm starting a new job? I didn't mention the offer during the first interview because I kind of forgot it'd be relevant since it's not the role I really want. I don't want them to think I'm a flight risk, it's just that literally everything but the commute is better about their role than the one I accepted. I'm also not sure how else I'd explain my suddenly extremely limited schedule (""I can only interview during this time that may or may not be a lunch break"") without mentioning I'm working.

Two, how do I interview while working full time? I've never had to do it before and again at least for the first week my schedule looks super structured so I'm not sure how I can squeeze in an interview during business hours if my interviewer can't interview while I'm on my lunch break.

However from a career point of view my second half of my 20's were a struggle. I've been dealing with bipolar and some degree of adhd for 4-5 years now, possibly longer. It has no doubt affected my work history and ability to stay employed along with maintaining a strong work ethic. I had a job I somewhat enjoyed in software sales / customer success a few years ago but around 2021 I experienced some degree of a manic/psychotic episode. So I left the work force and went to a hospital for residential care to work on my mental health/medication/suicidal struggles.

Enough of that...I'm at a point now where I'm stable with medicine for the most part and I have an amazing support network of whom I'm forever grateful for. Friends/family/therapist and psychiatry. After the hospital I was unemployed then had a part time retail job for several months and for the past 11 months now I've been working a full time job! I feel accomplished however I am longing to upgrade.

I only make $44,000 a year pre-tax so I am struggling with my bills. I work for a grounds department in a municipality and I have no desire to continue with it. The mentalities here, are not the best.

I REALLY love cars / mechanical components. \[I had a job for a year around age 24/25 as a CAD/manufacturing tech in a machine shop that made bearings - it was ok besides hours and being stuck at a desk\]. I have quite a bit of experience working on cars and I have a 4 year degree in technology/business management (focused on manufacturing).

I'm applying for new jobs/new industries but it's been a long time since I've had any recent/relatable experience however. So I'm struggling with making my resume standout. I have been researching career avenues lately and ""mechanical product manager roles"" (or product associate entry roles) sound really cool. Along with technical engineer sales type roles. In terms of pay these career paths seem to do quite well and it wouldn't require me to be on a manufacturing floor either. I believe these roles would have the ability to offer some remote work which is what I would love to have.

Operations sound really cool as well, like overseeing an automobile or mechanical component for the automobile be built from start to finish. However the ability to work remote is still a huge priority in my eyes. I've considered going back to school for a mechanical engineering degree but at my age / current living situation it seems daunting. I'm looking to pursue alternate career paths to ideally make more money and be part of a better company. I was thinking of obtaining a product manager certification right now or some type of CAD certification. Anybody have thoughts on this idea to help my resume get noticed?

Just looking for opinions on new avenues to take and continuing a better path! Ideally doubling my salary would be incredible , which I'm sure a lot of you can relate too.

1f89gkk,Working hybrid has decreased my motivation & productivity.,"I'm not sure what to do at this point. I work for a company that is hybrid 2 days and remote the other 3 days of the week. We are a small company, and my entire team is too far away from the office to come in. I might be more motivated to actively want to come in if my team were here, but it is just me. Of the two days that we're in, it seems like only 2-3 of us are in at a time and are often in our own little worlds.

When I am home, I am able to get all of my work completed for the day in about 4 hours. In the office, I have a difficult time focusing in on my work and often get distracted by my manager. It feels like I am just counting down the hours until I can get home to then get all of my tasks truly completed for the day.

I've expressed how I am more productive at home, and have explained that with my ADHD I have certain methods I do at home to ensure I am 100% locked into the work and tasks at hand to my manager. Even after those talks, they still want me to come in to show face/collaborate with others that come into the office.

I like my job, and overall really like the company, but seriously am struggling with this hybrid component. This is very much my ""first world problem"" -- any advice on how to spark joy in coming into the office/getting a handle on distractions so I can get my work done?

1f89a9k,"Dropped out of dental school, don't know what to with my life and career, any advice?","Two years ago I dropped out of dental school, largely due to my anxiety related to learning about certain mental and physical diseases. In dental school you learn in depth about those topics and as a dentist you're working with those topics in different ways, so I had a lot of doubt about dentistry and ultimately dropped out.

Since then I worked a year in sales which I didn't really like but did pay well. I now work another corporate job since that company shut down but I get paid pennies.

I’m now 26, still living with my mom and just feel like a bum honestly. I want to earn more money and move out asap. I just don't know what career to pick and stick with. Sales pays good but is flakey, and high stress with quotas.
I've considered teaching since I have a biology degree and enjoy science, but the pay is low and I always hear bad things about teaching.
I've also considered IT, and a few other careers. A part of me is considering just going back to dental school since I think dentistry would be fairly enjoyable, it's stable, pay is great, and I would be able to support my mom and a family.

I just want a career with good pay, where I don't have to worry about being fired at any moment and that I really see myself doing long term & don't absolutely hate. I'm stuck and just want to pick a career and stick with it. I just don't know what career is right for me and where to go from here.

However, it did put me in touch with the upper management at the clinic who ""appreciated my efforts"". I reached out to one of the managers I was working closely with and asked if there were any ways I could be more involved in the finance/business aspect of clinical trials. To my surprise, they put me in direct contact with the business operations team and I'll be joining them in their meetings for a month before deciding if I'm a good fit for the team on a long-term basis and if there's any projects that I can work on for them. Although these business meetings that I'm supposed to join in are next month, I was wondering if anyone has any advice for negotiating a raise based on two different scenarios: I keep my current assistant position and be involved in the business team OR I completely pivot to a position in the business team only. The only reason why I want to potentially keep my current position is because I really enjoy working with the doctors (and vice versa seemingly) plus I would want to see if I could somehow stack my pay somehow.

Experience-wise I have 2 university degrees both in education, 5 years of supply teaching, and have a few years of project management experience on top of 5 years in crew management with the same company. I also had started & ran my own construction company for a few years before I had my first kid and wanted better work/life balance.

I know i don't want to teach but feel unprepared to jump to a bigger construction company as a PM. My current plan is to learn the skills/programs necessary for a data analytics job (i enjoy tech and the analyzing aspects) with hopes to become a program manager in the tech field but unsure. 

Should I pursue construction further or continue the data route? Or is there a third option of career I'm missing? Would love your thoughts or a mentor's insight.

As part of my course we were given the option to complete a yearlong placement after 2nd year and then return to college for final year.

I was seeing counsellors and doctors at this time. Anyways, I did not pass the 6 months probationary review which led to my dismissal in early February.

1f87cua,When do you keep pushing and when do you quit?,"I want to preface this post by saying that I know I am one of the luckiest people by having a job in the current job market especially at a well-known company with relatively good pay.

It's been a month and a few days since I started this job and ever since starting, my mental and physical health have only been deteriorating badly day by day. It's gotten to a point where I'm unable to sleep or eat and I have thrown up from stress more times in the last month than I threw up in the entirety of the last 2 years. I feel miserable and it's affecting my family too to see me slowly going down the road to insanity.

When I first started, my manager said ""I have very high expectations."" and hearing that had me putting so much pressure on my self to be perfect and to do very well. I am in my team's Reporting department and I'm the only one who does my kind of job in the team. All the reports that all the different people on the team have done, are being dumped on me now and it's making me feel extremely stressed thinking of how I can manage all that. 

I have already spoken to my manager about how there is so much load currently but she does not see it as so. She says it's my job to take all these reports and to be responsible for them and there's no such thing as ""too much work"" because this is what is expected of an employee at my workplace. She mentioned that I have not seen pressure yet. 

Everyone tells me that it's really hard right now because it's the beginning and I'm still working on building the system that helps me create the reports I need to do. Everyone says they've been through this and that it will get better. I do believe them in this regard but in this current moment, I am suffering so much. I dread going to work everyday and even just thinking about it stresses me out. I live everyday just waiting for the weekend to come so I don't have to go to work and so I can have one day of rest. 

The only good thing about this job is the people I am surrounded with who have become good friends to me and the fact that I am employed after 6 months of unemployment spent aimlessly.

I am lucky in that I live with my family so there is not too much pressure on me to earn money. I'm mainly doing this job for myself.

1f8656q,Should I take a $35k paycut for better work/life balance?,"In 2022 I left a job making about $67K per year after working for that organization for almost 5 years. I enjoyed the company I was working for but felt stagnant after a while, it was a very small organization and there wasn't a whole lot of room for growth. For context I work in Learning and Development for the Financial Services industry. I took on a similar role at another company for a significant pay increase. I currently make close to $100K per year if you include bonuses. 

With that said I have been miserable for the past 2+ years at this organization. My boss is a micromanager. The entire company runs on a ""lean and mean"" business model so I often times work long hours and overtime and my work to life balance is not what it used to be. I don't do anything after work anymore and I even struggle to find the energy to visit with family and friends on weekends because I'm so exhausted. I stopped working out because I can't seem to find the time, energy, or motivation. My social life has completely tanked. Even basic tasks like cleaning my house and running errands are struggles now. Also there's just a negative vibe in the office, I can't quite explain it better than that. They're hesitant to praise you for anything but make one mistake and the entire organization knows about it. Speaking up about things can land you in hot water fast. I honestly dread coming to work everyday and have anxiety attacks every Sunday night about going back to work on Monday.

Needless to say I had been looking for another job for over a year now but the market has been tough. I barely get any callbacks and the few interviews I did go on lead to nothing. Recently things changed and I was offered a position outside of financial services in the non-profit sector. It is a similar role to my current one but the pay they're offering me is only $65K per year. This new job is also entirely WFH which was something I was specifically looking for. I also have been wanting to leave financial services and try a new industry. But mainly I just want a better work to life balance and I think this position will offer me that.

My hesitation is it is a hefty paycut....around $35K and that concerns me. I was surviving with around that same income before so I know I can do it again but I will say that I have been able to save more money with my current job which has been the only silver lining of an otherwise unhappy situation. Am I being foolish to consider taking such a large paycut? I do want to retire someday and possibly buy a home.

1f85mvr,Do I switch careers? What do I do? I can’t find a job. ,"I really need support / guidance please. I’m a 24F, graduated college in fall 2022. I had a great internship right after graduation which I was offered full time, couldn’t take as I needed to go back home for medical reasons and honestly, I hated the job too so it wasn’t hard for me to decide, other than the company being major and looking great on my resume. since leaving that internship, it took me an entire year to find a full time job and it was in a role I actually liked, it was quite perfect for me as that’s what I did in college and currently do as a side hustle. 

However, I was misled with how the company represented itself and where I would be placed, so long story short I was put into a section of the big and known company where almost no one spoke English, even though I was not fluent in said language they spoke and also didn’t get trained properly by any means so I had no idea what was going on half the time with the language barrier and severe lack of training and micromanaging. I tried my hardest to push through, but I was getting so mistreated and none of us could communicate anyways, so I left after 4 months. (My degree was in film / media / communications) and the jobs I’ve been getting previously were social media and marketing based. 

 Now I’m one again jobless, trying to apply to as many jobs each day as I can, but I’m having the hardest time securing job interviews. I’m considering if I need to swap careers even though I don’t want to, (to UX/UI- my friend couldn’t get a job so she did a boot camp on that and now has a great job making tons of money) since I’m not making any money and have so much free time anyway. 

Or I’m Also considering to go to grad school for marketing, since my under grad degree was more film based and I do love school and academics. My family supports any decision I make, but they keep putting their opinions on what I should do next, and it’s making my thought process more confusing. I want to decide by the end of the year because I don’t want to rely on my family support for majority of my finances. What should I do? 

My family tells me you can’t always get the dream job or job with the degree you graduated with. But Im wondering if I’d be so miserable doing something I hate too. I’m very open to the ux/ui route, but I initially thought after my internship that I was set on getting a marketing degree just because I had the time- my family ended up shooting that idea down though. 

I believe I can be very successful but I’m in such a rut right now… bummed for sure.

1f85brj,Which undergraduate degree will give me the best ROI and quicker path to employment: Engineering or Health Care Professionals?,"Hi everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I’m currently weighing my options between pursuing a degree in engineering or a healthcare field, as both seem to offer strong returns on investment (ROI) based on my research.

**Engineering** (e.g., Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Civil) appears to offer high starting salaries and diverse job opportunities.

On the other hand, I’m also considering healthcare degrees such as Nursing, Radiologic Technology, Respiratory Therapy, and Clinical Laboratory Science. These programs typically offer quicker entry into the workforce and good job stability, with Nursing in particular being a viable option for immediate employment and a solid salary.

Given that I want to start working and earning as soon as possible, which path would you recommend? Are there specific programs or fields within healthcare that stand out for quick employment and good ROI?

Thanks in advance for your insights!

1f84yf0,"New hire is a racist scumbag, but I don't know how to get rid of him","I’m honestly stunned. I've never encountered someone so openly racist before. This guy just started three weeks ago, and already people have been hinting that he’s got a ""difficult"" personality. But I didn’t expect to find him making blatantly racist jokes to one of our senior tech leads—who, by the way, is not White—right in the middle of the lunchroom. In front of everyone.

And it gets worse. Apparently, he’s been doing this for a while now, and I’m just finding out. The fact that he’s comfortable doing this to a senior colleague, only three weeks in, makes me think he’s only going to get worse. Firing him seems like a no-brainer at this point. But my dilemma is: should I explain that he’s being let go for unprofessional and unacceptable behavior, or just stick to a vague ""you’re not a fit for our company culture"" line?

I’ve been using Reclip to capture some workplace conversations for training purposes, and I happened to have some of his comments recorded. Listening back, it's even worse than I initially realized. The audacity of this guy, making derogatory comments so openly, is mind-blowing. It's hard to believe this is happening in 2024.

Now, I’m leaning towards letting him know exactly why he’s being fired—to make it clear that this behavior won’t be tolerated. But is it even worth the effort? Will he learn anything, or is it just a waste of my energy?

1f84y1z,"What should I do? Cannot find work in my field, running out of options…","So I don’t even know how to start this so let’s begin at the beginning. 35 years old recently let go from my job. Was working as a Crew Chief/Site Supervisor for a water restoration company. In my area there are basically 2 big companies(think Servpro or Paul Davis,) a few smaller locally owned, and then many self owned owner/operators. 

Basically I started working in 2019 as a tech at big company 1. Got experience left and became crew chief for BC#2. Worked there for 3 years, went back to Company 1 with promises of being a site supervisor and project manager, but things fell flat, management changed and they fired me to get the new managers team in place. 

Now pretty much I can’t go back to Company 2. And there aren’t any medium sized companies hiring for my position in my area, I would need to either lie and say I have more experience and try to get a job doing something similar(like estimator, which I have little experience doing) or go back as a tech with a serious pay cut. or drive 3 hours a day when I’m not sure my car can reliably handle that commute.

I’ve filled out countless applications but have only gotten a couple of interviews and not really finding anything directly transferable to look for. 

I also have around 8 years management experience in the service industry but that’s now 6 years back, most of my old network are either out, working elsewhere or not in contact.

# 1. Using Google Advanced Search

I use Google’s advanced search to find job listings that might not be on the main job boards. Here's a step-by-step guide:

* **Step 1:** Go to Google and enter the following search query:Example: `""Sales Manager"" + site:[url]/* + ""USA""`""\[job title\]"" + site:[url]/\* + ""\[country\]""
* **Step 2:** Add date filters to find the most recent listings by including terms like ""Aug"" + ""2024"":""Sales Manager"" + site:[url]/\* + ""USA"" + ""Aug"" + ""2024""
* **Step 3:** Use variations of this search across other job boards (listed below) to uncover hidden opportunities.

This method helps me find jobs that others might miss.

# 2. LinkedIn Screening

After finding a job listing, I go on LinkedIn to identify the hiring manager or team members. Here’s how:

* **Step 1:** Search for the company and filter by location and department.
* **Step 2:** Look for recent posts or activities related to the job. Engage with their content by liking or commenting.
* **Step 3:** Send a connection request with a personalized message:Hi \[Name\],  I came across your profile while researching \[Company\]. I noticed your post about \[relevant topic\] and found it insightful. I'm very interested in the \[Position\] role at \[Company\] and would love to connect and learn more about your team. Thanks, \[Your Name\]

# 3. Getting email addresses

I use tools like HunterIO or KasprIO to guess email addresses. Here’s my process:

* **Step 1**: Use the tools to generate possible email formats.
* **Step 2**: Verify emails using services like NeverBounce if available.
* **Step 3**: If verification isn’t possible, send anyway with a personalized touch.

# 4. Crafting Personalized Cold Emails

I send out cold emails that are custom-tailored. Here’s a template that usually works for me:

    Hey [name], I’m [Your Name], a [Job Title] currently at [Company]. I was excited to see your team is hiring for [Position] and wanted to reach out directly. I’ve attached my resume for your review. I’m particularly interested in [specific project or aspect of the position you're vying for], and I believe my experience in [relevant skill/experience] could add value to your team. Here’s a quick overview of my work: [Link to Portfolio/Project] 
    Is it okay if I drop my resume to see if I can get it forwarded to the right person via you? I'd love to apply ^^
    
    [Your Name]
    [Your Website/Portfolio/GitHub]

# 5. Engaging Follow-Ups

I follow up with a friendly nudge a week later to keep the conversation going:

    Hi [name], Hope you’re doing well! Just checking to see if you had a chance to look at my resume. No worries if it’s not the right time or I'm not the right fit. Just let me know with a quick ""Not hiring right now!"" and I won’t bother you again ^^
    
    Thanks,
    [Your Name]

# 6. Doing it at Scale

For each iteration of my resume, I use a specialized resume builder (rezi.ai works well but, for ppl on a budget consider using resumeAI.app - it's super effective at rewriting your cv's bullet-points) to help me find the right keywords. This ensures 1/ that I can pass the ATS, and 2/ have my hiring manager resonate with the content of my resume. These small tweaks will for sure lend you more interview calls than when you apply a vanilla version of your resume.

# 7. Networking in niche circles

I also tap into niche communities and forums related to my industry (since I'm in tech it's either Blind or FishBowl).

1f81bsl,When do you risk a guarantee for something more?,"At the tail end of last year, I moved from Central IL to Chicagoland after being offered a role at a company I worked at previously. And the job was everything that I expected and knew it to be—tiresome, unaligned with my career passions, and left much to be deserved—but, there were few compromises outside of the job itself. It was fairly well-paid and allowed me to live in a place that I had longed to for a number of years. 

In July, I reassigned from my position and after about six weeks on the job market, I secured a new role that required I move to Columbus, OH to start at the end of this month. Admittedly, I'm having a hard time committing to the job because I'm not ready to move Columbus. 

I don't know if I should simply commit and hope for the best or recant and refocus my efforts to see if I can land a job here.

1f7zv2e,Has anyone interviewed for a role three separate times?,"I've been applying for a specific role for a specific team at a healthcare organization since March. Ideal company, pay, benefits, and role.

I applied in March and was quickly setup for interview the hiring manager. I had reached out to the HM on LinkedIn who then expressed enthusiasm. Recruiter was excited for me. The interview process ended abruptly as an internal transfer was identified for the role. The recruiter added me on LI and I checked in with them monthly on any opportunities to join the team.

The recruiter notified me of an opening in June and applied for the role. I did not get to the final interview, as internal hires were identified for the role since the posting was unofficially for a level 2 version as the role would manage the most valuable client for the company. No go for me.

I'm currently attempting this for the third time. Recruiter reached out and said the hiring manager told them I have ""high potential"" for the role, and the hiring manager reached out on LinkedIn to wish me luck.

I have everything they're looking for in terms of qualification, and I'm hoping they look externally (aka me) for the role, but I'm really scared of being burned for this third round.

1f7zdcn,Should I Stay in My 8-5 Office Job or Return to Bedside Nursing,"Hi! I’m in my early 20s with a little over a year of nursing experience. Right after graduation, I worked in a high-acuity setting where I wasn’t well-supported. I was also on night shift, which didn’t suit me and made me physically ill.

I left that job for the first opportunity I could find, which brought me to the health department. I enjoy the work, but we are severely short-staffed. This role should have 2-3 people, but it’s just me, and they’ve been trying to fill the other position(s) for two years. The pay is low (but covers everything), my commute is an hour round trip, and I work five days a week. I’ve been here for about six months. While I don’t mind the job itself, there are some significant issues. For instance, we don’t have a provider on-site, so I often feel like I’m working outside of my scope. I also find myself constantly thinking about work, even during my time off.

I worry that staying at the health department will limit my long-term opportunities since most non-bedside positions require 2-5 years of acute care experience.

Recently, I was offered a job at a local hospital with a much shorter commute (15 minutes round trip), and the pay looks good. After shadowing for a bit, it seems like a good fit if I decide to take it. The downsides are the typical challenges of bedside nursing, but the upside is more time off and being able to disconnect from work.

I feel like I know what the right move is, but I’m nervous. Whatever I choose, whether staying or going, I want to commit to it for at least 1-2 years for my resume.

If it’s worth anything, I do not have kids, I have a cat, and a long term partner who supports me either way.",Own_Neck7256,2,1.0,2,1725368567,2024-09-03 13:02:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f7zdcn/should_i_stay_in_my_85_office_job_or_return_to/,9,2024
1f7z1hy,Advice needed - offered more money to stay in old job ,"I’d benefit from some advice as I don’t know what to do - I’ve been offered a new job that was less money than what I currently make (by about £1,300 per year) but because it’s in my hometown I’d save enough money on travel costs every month to actually make me better off financially, as I’d be walking to work instead of taking a £14 train every day to the city. I’m about £200 a month in travel right now in my current job. 

When I handed in my notice, my manager went into retention mode and immediately asked what they can do to make me reconsider. The money thing was the first thing I said, and when I mentioned the savings, they offered to increase my salary so that I’d be getting £200 a month more, basically making my travel costs free.

I don’t know if I should tell my new job that this has happened, would it make me seem like I was looking for leverage to get more money out of the company? There wasn’t a salary range on the job advert, it was a set amount, so I’ll assume what you see is what you get - but I know companies always have more to give than what they let on.

Tbh the money thing is only one of a few reasons I’m looking for a new job, but this has put me at a crossroads.

1f7xjy6,Should I study a masters of information studies or masters of teaching? ,"Hey I’m in a pickle and wanted to ask you for some advice. 

I am thinking of a career change to one of the below (I’ve had assisting jobs in both industries). It’s a later career change and hoping for it to work well with a young family. 

• Master of information studies (librarianship) 

• Master of Teaching (Primary and Secondary) with a focus on languages

Can anyone advise the pros and cons of working in each industry? The holidays seem so alluring in teaching, along with teaching a language, perhaps easier marking? 

The libraries seem to have perks too in terms of daily work. I like to keep really busy and find hands on tasks really satisfying. Not just books. The whole idea that libraries offer a safe haven for communities as best possible is a value of mine. 

I have a major vision sometimes of helping to curate or even run so programs at libraries. I know it would have its limits with what you can actually run in each library. 

I wonder tthe opportunities for pay rises too, which industry is better? And can these studies transfer into other jobs, not just teaching and librarianship? 

Do they both offer opportunities to travel and work overseas? I would love to do some type of work stint in Europe or Japan. 

It’s hard to know as I value the below and want to align it to best suit me. 

Security
Creativity
Flexibility
Aesthetic beautiful spaces 
Learning 
Working autonomously and within a team 
Opportunity for growth
Opportunity for travel 

Later career changes seem so daunting as I want something secure now, unlike in my 20’s where I didn’t care as much. I’d like to make good money, however I don’t think it’s ever been at the top of my value system. 

I wonder if there is even perfect jobs out there, whether few get lucky with that?

My parents want me to take care of my business as they feel kind of stressed about it sometimes and I will be the helping hand. But just out of trying to complete a project to getting dragged in to this. I'M STUCK. I really have no idea what to do in this situation and I'm feeling very depressed day by day. The sense of not doing anything in my life myself is eating me alive. I really am losing all the good years of my life to something I dont want to do. I've been also suggesting my parents to lease out the property with a good rental income but their intention is to run it ourselfs. I'm also suggesting them that I once leased it will help clear the debt, also I will also have time to complete my further education. Please suggest a path.

1f7qcdr,Do I find a new job?,"I’ve been working at Petsmart for a little over a year now. While I love the work, and the dogs,management seems to be a total disaster. I don’t get the schedule I asked for, and I do not get along with the second in command AT ALL, to the point where our shifts together are quite miserable. I’m also getting very tired of corporate pushing things like sales metrics we can’t really control. Incidents happen where I think about walking out at least once every few months and I’m tired of my manager snapping at me. For the most part, I love everyone else I work with, they’re great! The discount is very useful too. 

I was thinking of going to Target— they seem  decent enough, everyone appears happy to work there and enjoying their jobs but I’d probably be dealing with the same amount of corpo bullshit. 

I was also offered a dispensary job by a friend, which seems willing to accommodate my scheduling. While I would greatly enjoy the work, I fear coming off as disingenuous because I’ve personally quit weed. Nothing against it, I’m just going to EMT school and am seeking a future job in the field so I need to be clean. Though it is slower paced, it seems like a good fit as I excel in customer service and have decent enough knowledge on the subject.  the work culture seems wonderful as well, like a place I’d really like to be at. 

Do I stay with my current job, or explore other options? I suppose I could always come back, if I wanted to try something else.   I wouldn’t be leaving on bad terms whatsoever, and aside from the one unsavory manager, everyone likes having me around. I’m not really sure what to think right now.

1f7piao,I created an AI interview coach to help with career advancement (Looking for feedback!),"Hello r/careeradvice community!

As someone who's navigated the tricky waters of career changes (from bootcamp grad to software engineer), I understand the challenges we all face when trying to advance our careers. That's why I wanted to share a tool I've developed that might help many of you: [Acedit](https://acedit.ai), an AI-powered interview coach.

**Why I created Acedit:**  
After watching my brother struggle with STAR method responses in interviews, I realised there was a gap in interview preparation tools. So, I spent the last 8 months building Acedit to bridge that gap.

**What Acedit does:**

* Provides real-time, personalised prompting during online interviews
* Helps craft tailored responses based on job descriptions
* Assists in generating targeted cover letters
* Creates practice questions from actual job listings

**How it can help your career:**

1. **Confidence Boost:** Get supportive prompts during high-pressure moments
2. **Tailored Preparation:** Practice with questions specific to your target roles
3. **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from each interview experience
4. **Time-Saving:** Streamline your job application process

**The best part?** There's a substantial free tier because I believe career development tools should be accessible to everyone.

**I'd love your input:**

1. What's your biggest challenge when preparing for interviews?
2. Are there any features you wish existed in interview prep tools?
3. If you give Acedit a try, I'd be incredibly grateful for your feedback!

**A personal note:**  
Developing Acedit has been a journey in itself - from late-night coding sessions to diving deep into AI. It's taught me a lot about perseverance and the importance of continuous learning in our careers.

I'm here to answer any questions about Acedit, share experiences about career transitions, or discuss interview strategies. Remember, career development is a journey we're all on together, and tools like Acedit are here to make that journey a bit easier.

Wishing you all success in your career endeavours!",Defiant_Scratch2775,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1725332177,2024-09-03 02:56:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f7piao/i_created_an_ai_interview_coach_to_help_with/,9,2024
1f7pbhj,Should I Quit My Job,"I 20(f) have graduated recently from college with a bachelors in Legal Studies. Before the job I have now I only have worked in the food industry (fast food and a restaurant). The job I have now is a legal assistant full time job. This is my first “adult job” and I got very lucky getting it through a connection of a friend. The atmosphere is nice and honestly a great law firm to start off with as my first legal job. However I feel my mental health declining. 

When I first got this job the biggest push that made me go for it was because I have a close friend who is doing amazing in her school life and it made me feel like “what the hell am I even doing”. So I got a job that not only pays decently but also has to do with my degree. I thought that I finally did it and felt accomplished. But now I feel like I’m spiraling because I don’t think I actually want this job anymore. The people are great however my boss (the attorney that I’m the assistant for) kinda makes me feel like shit Everytime I come in. 

I’ve been here for 3 months now. And I cry the night before and sometimes the morning of before I have to go into work because she’s going to tell me what I’m doing is so wrong. She knows I’m still learning and that this is my first job. And I try not to take the way she teaches me too personally but once she’s done talking to me I just wanna crumple up and cry a little. I know they she’s gonna be more direct and blunt and I always try to take everything with a grain of salt. But it’s really hard to do that sometimes. 

I know I’m not gonna be perfect at this job whatsoever. But when she tells me to do something one way today then next weeks she’ll contradict herself and ask me why I did it that easy. As if I’m an idiot for thinking that was correct and I feel as though I can ‘t say “well that’s what you told me to do.” The biggest issue I have with her that drives me insane is how much she’ll contradict herself when telling me to do something. Like she’s told me that she wants me to organize a file in a way that makes sense to me. But then will look through it and ask me why the file is a mess and organized so badly. 

Also as a legal assistant I have to do “billable hours” meaning the work I do needs to be billable towards a certain client because that’s how law firms make their money. And this is where I’m thankful for her, she’s more patient than other attorneys would be regarding those hours but she’ll also go thought them and ask “well why did that take you so long” and I genuinely would think idk it just did. I’m like double and triple checking my work all of the time which is probably why I took so long. Her goal of for me to get to 5 billable hours a day but I’m barely getting 3 1/2 and I don’t even know why. So that’s also a major stresser, when she comes in and asks me about my billable stuff. 


Anyways long story short. I like this job in general compared to the food jobs I’ve had and atmosphere however it’s become so god damn draining every day to go in just to get grilled about my work. I feel awful and like I shouldnt even be there most of the time. But idk what the hell I would do if I were to quit this job. I know I sound like I’m bitching about such a stupid thing but I’m genuinely so tired of feeling so inadequate every day.

1f7pa8t,"Need higher pay, considering changing industries","Hello! I'm a compliance analyst for a mortgage company and have been with the company for over 4 years.

Now I've received a raise but I'm still making quite a bit under what I was making before the rate hikes. I'm thinking the mortgage industry is very up and down and this stuff could happen again in the future.

1f7orix,Should I quit my first job after just 9 months?,"Hello,

I graduated early with honors from college (December 2023) with a degree in Psych. I got a job offer for what I thought would be a fantastic job a day later and accepted. I have had four part time jobs through highschool and college. The last one I stayed at for a little over two years. 

Unfortunately, I had a bad feeling about the place right away and have been crying every day before and after work because it is very intense. My boss is an extreme micromanager in my opinion and says things I find to be extremely unhelpful. 

My family and boyfriend really want me to quit because of some of the things that have been said to me but I want to stick it out for at least a year for my resume. It would be really a bummer As to 

My brother and I are staring an IT consulting business which is what I feel I really want to do but I feel it is risky to start out as he currently has a FT job in software development so he would only be around to assist on the weekends. We have a lot of interest and do this part time right now.

Do you think I should stick it out in this job and continue applying for similar positions or should I take a risk in starting a family business that may fail?

I also think I am in a good place in life to do dumb things like quit my day job because I pay pretty cheap rent to my mom and can be added back to her health insurance if need be.

1f7ocnt,"Dad died today, starting a new job tomorrow. Any advice please.","I’m pretty numb right now, so I apologize if this post comes off in a cold/callous light.


I flew out to CA to see my dad this weekend, as we were all aware that his health was dwindling (though we had hoped he’d be around for a few more months). It was a nice weekend, my brothers and I sang him a belated/in-person happy birthday, and we all spent time with him. I flew back to my current home state today in order to be home in time to start my new job tomorrow. As soon as I landed, I turned my phone on to have missed calls/messages saying that he passed.


Essentially I’m starting a job that I worked very hard to get (in fact, I was rejected the first time I applied a year ago). The job involves 2 weeks of heavy-duty and structured training, not only for me, but for the handful of other new hires that are starting tomorrow as well— ie there’s zero flexibility in adjusting the training dates.


To get to the point— what should I say to my new Supervisor? I have no idea on when the funeral will be, and I’m aware of the fact that I’m essentially still a stranger to my boss. Ultimately I won’t let a job get in between me and my family, but I know I’m in a delicate mindset right now, and want to navigate this so ideally everyone gets what they want.

1f7ntny,How do I change careers at 30 y/o with only niche-sounding prior jobs? ,"
I would love advice if anyone has some on making a career pivot to a new industry, and how to start over when no longer a post grad youth type?

Background: I (30F) worked for 8ish years in television production in NYC, which was the dream 100%, but severe post-covid health problems meant that I was down for the count as of 2021 until this year. The good news is that after about 3 years of recovery, I can now pick things up off the floor without passing out! The bad news is that I cannot physically sustain 12-16 hour days carrying heavy gear around, or standing on set all day. Even editing is difficult for me now because it's still usually a 10-12 hour day, and there are precious few jobs in post anyhow right now. I also could not physically keep up with a couple attempted food service or retail jobs. And of course, the government doesn't think I'm disabled enough to warrant financial assistance, so no luck there either. 

So now that I have to look outside my previously chosen industry, how do I find people to help me in my search for a desk job with reasonable hours, if my entire network is basically a bunch of camera operators who only know each other? You don't meet many people outside of your crew when working 16 hours a day, 5 days a week... I don't even have many non work related contacts in life elsewhere because I don't have reliable family support, and many of my friends and acquaintances were lost during the worst of my health problems because I was unable to go to social events or even really do a good job keeping in consistent touch, unfortunately. 

I just really don't know how to to get noticed without a personal referral, and the AI gatekeepers probably pass me over because of past titles like ""assistant camera"" or ""casting editor"" when I apply online. I have a ton of transferable skills, but I feel like I would need to explain to a Real Human Person (TM) how my work history can relate, because I am clearly not winning any ideal keyword competitions on paper alone (My resumes list my broadly applicable skills directly in the skills section and also within bullets beneath each job title. But no one reads the bullets under a super random job title, I assume). 

How do I build a new network from scratch? Internship postings request exclusively students or recent grads, and I have not yet seen an entry level position asking for less than 2 years related experience. How do I get a foot in the door without the newly post grad leg up?

--

Also, truly thank you for your time to anyone reading this! I don't often articulate how difficult this life change has been for me in any aspect of life, both because I don't want to admit its probable permanence at this point, and because I don't want to complain constantly to the 3 people who still talk to me and drive them away, too. Your acknowledgment of my predicament is helpful even if there's no good advice to be had because it's nice to feel heard.

It seems that my boss is moving to a higher role, and there's a strong possibility that they will offer his position to me. The team consists of 12 individuals, including myself.

Although my job title is one of the highest among my peers, I am the least experienced in the group and likely the youngest (I'm in my early 40s). Most of the team members have been working in this area/company for over 10 years and have much more knowledge than I do in this particular field.

I believe my boss is considering me as his replacement mainly due to my previous management experience at another company, as well as my PhD (which I believe is largely irrelevant and glorified).

Currently, no one in the group looks to me for guidance or seeks my opinion when we encounter technical difficulties. I genuinely believe they will have little to no respect for me if I become their boss.

1f7kekv,Managers behavior,"Hello. There’s so much I can write here over 3 years but I’ll try and summarize. When I first started working with my current manager she quickly was friendly with me. Calling me her rockstar, her sunshine, her smile her love (not romantically of course). We are both women I’m in my 20s she’s in her 50s. We work from home mainly. I always did these side tasks for her faxing, scanning, fixing things for her on the side. I was a support person so fine. Then last year I got promoted and shortly after we had more personal email exchanges. It came to light that I had depression and she told me how she used to and still struggles at times. She encouraged me to talk to someone. I found a therapist, and she was there for me every week with that. I’ll be honest I am very lonely and told her I don’t have many people in my life. I’ll admit I had a bit of an obsession with her. She had told me via email that me and her had a connection, it was meant to be, that she felt it. So on and so forth. I felt safe with her because she seemed to care. She gave me external validation and made me feel special. I never told her that but she assumed she made me feel special. Fast forward a year later to now. Three months ago I came out as gay at work sort of because I joined this Pride group. She was supportive of that which helped. Two months ago we had a deep personal convo over text. She shared confidential things about her kids with me and was crying. This was 10:30pm on a Sunday.

1f7jrgd,Should I tell my boss I’m leaving before formally handing in my resignation?,"I'm planning on handing in my resignation within the next two weeks however, my boss has just asked if I would like to attend a formal event with her on behalf of the company with tickets costs around $350.

Should I let my boss know that I'm planning on formally resigning before doing so? I plan on telling her that I simply wanted to be transparent and if she wants to take that conversation as my formal resignation she can, otherwise I will have a letter sent within the next two weeks.

1f7jg9y,Advice on Career Development as a young person ,"I live in Australia - 18m who is currently working full-time as a Contractor Manager on 80k salary (this will be important later). I recently started a Bachelor of medical engineering until I realised that the study load was going to be too much to work full time and study as it would take at least 4-6 years, and I would end up on the same salary as I am now. 

Last night I had paused my studies and requested to discontinue my bachelor's. My thought process behind this was that next semester I could do a degree that was more focused at what I am doing now (Business management), as the study load would not be as heavy, and I feel I could manage more classes. I have completed a cert IV in Leadership and management - even though they don't equate, I have a gist of whats to come 

  
I do really enjoy being invested in the field of engineering, but I feel as if I want it to be more of a thing I do in my spare time, which does not justify a four-year degree 

I am looking for advice to whether or not I made the right choice and any recommendations for what degrees are hot right now and/or if you think I made the wrong choice I am open to that feedback

The thing that that my boss might be mad about is that I would stay late, less than an hour late each day, to keep working. I’m salaried so I didn’t think it would be an issue. I also feel like I do my job more slowly. Maybe slower than they would like. It is a new job and I’m still learning.

1f7hf09,My workload is unmanageable - how long would you give your employer to offer a solution?,"Hi all - 

Two and a half months ago I started a new job. The first month went by just fine - trainings, getting to know people, you know the drill. People at work are quite nice, but since the very beginning I started seeing some red flags, like they would complain about the amount of work they're doing, having to work overtime at least 2-3 days a week, they all seemed very stressed out, etc. 

Fast forward to about three weeks ago when they basically gave me all 15 projects that I'm supposed to manage almost at the same time (for context, my role is Project Manager). The workload is unmanageable. At least for me I think it is, considering I'm still new to the role and industry. Last week I had so much anxiety just from seeing all my unread emails and all the tasks that are piling up. I CAN'T keep up. I haven't been able to sleep properly and it's just giving me major anxiety. And what stresses me most is that everyone in the team just kind of accepted their fate with the insane workload we are given and working extra hours and so on? Someone told me they worked until 11pm on Sunday and another person told me they have worked overtime every Friday since joining this company (Fridays we are supposed to finish around 2-3pm)... It's one thing to work a couple extra hours one day if something urgent came up, but having to work overtime on a regular basis just to keep up with your workload...??

Anyways, on Friday I spoke with my supervisor (who is leaving the company for personal reasons in two weeks so I'm not even sure if she will be able to help much) and told her my workload was unmanageable and that I needed her help to lessen this, or tasks were simply not going to get done. She's very nice and told me it's good that I brought it up, and that she would try and restructure the project assignments. But I don't even know who she's going to assign them to, since everyone is overworked and have no bandwidth whatsoever. So I don't have much hope. 

I guess the points where I need your advise are:

- Now that I've informed my supervisor of the situation, how much time do you think I should give them to find a solution / offer alternatives? In other words, how much time is a fair amount of time to give them to prove themselves before I quit? (Because I'm afraid that's what will probably happen if I see no end to this). 

- If I end up quitting, would you keep this 3-month-old job on LinkedIn? In one hand, 3 months is not enough to brag about a job on your CV, but at the same time, I don't have that much experience. This is only my second job. And from what I've heard, one is more likely to get hired if you are already employed. Is it worth keeping? What can I say in interviews if they ask me why I'm quitting my new job after only 3 months?

Thanks for your insights!

TLDR: Workload at the new job I've been at for almost 3 months is unmanageable. I communicated this to my supervisor. How much time should I give her to offer alternatives / solutions?

1f7h5dt,"Rejected from a position, applying to another ","I recently applied for a company that I was interested in and got to the third round. They seemed to really like me and was impressed with my qualifications- it was mostly a really positive experience. During the interview process they alluded that I might be overqualified for the role, but I assured them I was still interested for numerous reasons. I ultimately didn’t end up getting it. They said they found someone who better aligned with what they were looking for and it was a tough decision due to my skills, etc. 

The next day I looked at the same companies website and I noticed another new open position that would be one “rank” above what I originally applied for and it was what we talked about and it was something they asked if I would be ready for in the interview process. My question is, would I be naive to apply again? I can’t help but wonder why they didn’t mention they did have this position open or coming down the pipeline in the first place. 

I really want to work there and I’m tempted to apply but I’m not sure if it would be silly of me. It seems like they may have already considered me for that role without explicitly saying it based on our conversations, and perhaps they ultimately didn’t see me as a good fit.

1f7gs8e,Am I making a mistake by declined a job in a horrible job market? ,"Am I making a mistake by withdrawing from a job in a very bad job market? 

Context: I am a 26yr old (F) process engineer in the chemical/biotech industry in Canada. I currently have a job but have been wanting to switch for a bit. 

I recently received an invitation to interview on LinkedIn with a startup from the CEO. The company is doing really cool work and the role seemed very relevant to what I do. 

This is where it gets a lil strange: The CEO messages me (on Thursday evening past 6pm) and sets up an interview on the Monday of a long weekend. I oblige thinking they didn’t realize it was the long weekend and it worked out better for me because I would not have to take time off from work. She emails me saying I will have to make a presentation talking about my relevant work experience which is totally fine. After a few hours, she messages me back on LinkedIn at 8pm on the same day asking if we can prepone the interview to the next day (Friday afternoon) as she was travelling. I was excited about the opportunity so I didn’t think much about it and I agreed. 

The first interview round went well but it was very one sided. It was a 40min interview round where I presented my relevant skills and they asked me several behavioural questions. At the 40 min mark, they did not ask me if I had any questions, did not actually tell me anything about my role or its responsibilities and they also did not provide a budget or salary range for this role on the job posting. They just said that they would keep me posted. 

Later, I sent them an email thanking them for the interview and that I was looking forward to a positive outcome. Around 12am Saturday, I receive an email saying I am selected to move forward to the second round and that I need to make another presentation. She gave me a few days and timings that the interview could happen. I send a reply the next day saying that one day next week at 9/930am would work best for me because I work in-person everyday. 

Her reply the next day is: see you on “day of the week” at 10am in-person. Hope this works. It felt very one sided and inconsiderate even though I specifically mentioned that I work in-person everyday. She also sent an invitation even before I had a chance to say yes/no. 

The weekend emails at inappropriate times and  no consideration for the other party seemed really weird to me and I didn’t think it would be smart of me to be a part of that work culture. And so, I sent out a withdrawal from interview email (saying I have pursuing a different opportunity). She was nice in her email response and wished me well but reached out on linkedin again on monday of the long weekend asking if we can chat about a collaboration. 

The role  is very relevant to me and would help advance my career further but the CEO does not seem to know boundaries. Am I making a mistake in withdrawing from the process? 

How do I tell her nicely that I do not want to work with her? Or should I get on a call to hear about this opportunity? 

TL,DR: Am I making a mistake by withdrawing from a job interview that is very relevant to me because the CEO keeps emailing me at inappropriate times?

1f7g51k,Is it necessary to get a Security+ CE if I ultimately want to be a Software Developer (In The DoD)?,"I'm currently unemployed and looking for a job in tech. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Graphic Design and graduated a coding bootcamp two years ago, where I learned full-stack web development. My journey with programming has been inconsistent due to personal challenges and life circumstances, but I genuinely enjoy coding and am working to get back into it. Right now, I'm refreshing my skills using FreeCodeCamp and other resources because my goal is to become a software developer.

Although I haven't yet had the opportunity to break into the industry, I’m eager to do so. It’s been three years since I graduated from college, and during that time, I haven't had a permanent full-time job. All the jobs I've held have been minimum wage and unrelated to tech.

I'm writing this because I'm debating whether or not I should complete the CompTIA Security+ certification. I’m not really interested in cybersecurity or IT, and I actually find the field kind of boring. The main reason I’m considering it is because my parents are encouraging me to pursue it. They know a lot of people in that field, and I live in the DC area, where most tech jobs are related to the Department of Defense (DoD).

I understand that many DoD-related tech positions require at least a Security+ certification (IAT Level 2) for a company to sponsor a secret clearance. My plan was to get Security+ to land a help desk job and then transition into software development. However, studying for Security+ has been a struggle for me—I find it boring and tedious, with a lot of memorization and video-watching.

I'm looking for advice. Are there any developers here who have Security+ and can share their experience?",curious_10000,1,1.0,1,1725306739,2024-09-02 19:52:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f7g51k/is_it_necessary_to_get_a_security_ce_if_i/,9,2024

1f7f1jv,Advice on Breaking into Sales in Chicago with a foreign Political Science Degree? ,"Hey all, I'm living in Chicago now and looking to break into a career in sales. I have a political science degree from one of the best universities in South America, but I'm not interested in pursuing anything related to that field. (I know a liberal arts degree isn't the best degree to get a job, but I've heard that in sales they don’t care much about what you studied.) Also, I realize that my university might not be well-known here in the U.S. I’m fluent in both Spanish and English. Also, I don't have a car, so I'm curious if that could be an obstacle in getting started.


I have dual citizenship, so work permits and all that aren't an issue. I grew up in a bilingual home, speaking both English and Spanish natively.

1f7eavc,What should I do? Background below ,"Long story short, I work for a Fortune 500 Tech company. I took an internal “promotion” last August with the promise of getting my title and OTE straighten out during annual review by my manager and Sr. Director (Feb 2024). Well, that came around and was given a laughable amount of an increase. We’re talking around $1800 more to my OTE, with a chuck of stock (vesting is a multi year process from every award). When I asked about the promises made earlier, I was told that due to the economic impact of the business performance the prior year, they were unable to get anything approved by HR or Finance and would have to continue to wait until Q2. 

Q2 came and still nothing, except this time we had a re-org which has been great for my sanity. I brought all this up with my new director, which I believe has my best interest at heart, as my new director has actually been a mentor of mine since I’ve been at the company. I’ve been in the mid market segment for the last year and someone on our team covering Enterprise left, so I took that opportunity to ask my director for his blessing to apply and fill that role. Both him and VP have approved, yet we’re still stuck with “HR won’t let me backfill the role.” This I know to be true, as he has 2 open enterprise roles, that HR refuses to let him fill. 

Is our team being slowly pushed out? I’ve started applying to other jobs since the beginning of summer, but if you work in tech you know how long and brutal the process can be. 

I guess I’m looking for advice on what you would do in my situation? Obviously, I’ve been stonewalled for the last year and I’m over it and need to look out for myself and my family. However, the company I work for has some of the best work life balance I could ask for and my current director is by far the best “boss” I’ve had.

1f7dxd9,Would you go from WFH to full in office for a $30k salary increase?,"Hello, I was looking for some insight, or if anyone else has had a similar experience.

I currently have a WFH job that pays $30 an hour, it's guaranteed 40 hours a week, Health, Dental, Vision. This job is a 2 year contract position that will hopefully hire on full time once the contract is up.

Cons:

* It does not have matching 401k
* PTO is not great
* Not great job security

I just got an offer from a company I use to work at for $90k, fully benefits, good PTO, 5% matching 401k.

Cons:

* Full time in office
* Schedule isn't consistent, it's based off of 2 month rotations, that you will be either working, weekdays, weekends, or nights.

I don't mind the work I am doing for either company. But I had a really hard time being full time in office, it's a full time desk job and honestly just had a really difficult time doing that every day.

For reference, I am 30, I have a decent amount saved, I am financially stable, which is making weighing my decision of not needing to take the higher pay if I won't be happier.

Any insight would be appreciated! Thank you.

1f7bwxo,Advice? Stick or leave job,"Throwaway account.

Hi folks, looking for a steer on whether to stick with my current job or try another...

I am in my late 20's and currently at a pretty good point in my career. I started a new job in political affairs in February this year with an NGO however and the role hasn't been exactly what I thought it would be. I worry that I might be deskilling in this job as due to the orgs structure my role is heavily underutilised and quite restricted in what I'm able to do. They're also under resourcing our team and there's broader issues at play higher up in the org in regards to the direction of our team. It's not a *horrible* job but very frustrating and demoralising.

There has been another job come up in the public sector which aligns a bit more with what I'm thinking for my career long term. It is slightly lower paid but still a solid salary. However, me and my partner are planning on going travelling in around 1 year's time for 2ish years so I'm a bit concerned at how two short term employment stints will look on my CV when we come back and return to job hunting post-travelling.

All of this is speculative as I haven't even applied to this role so may not even get an interview! But I'm keen to hear other's views. So my options are:

A) Grin and bear the current job for a year, potentially deskill a bit over the year but have more money to go travelling and less sporadic employment lengths.

B) Prioritise career development and align myself more with longer term career goals in trying out for this other job however have less money to go travelling with and shorter term employment lengths on my CV.

1f7bmpj,Had to take 2 days of short notice and my supervisor made a big deal out of it,"This is the first time something like this happens to me in 2 years of working in finance.

When I first applied for this job and they called me for the interview, I had to take a test and passed with flying colors, was also told I was their top candidate. I had already told them, however, that I had planned and paid for a trip before applying for this job. They were very understanding and everything went alright. 

Fast forward a month, I finished the trip but my plane got delayed and I was called on short notice for documentation regarding my stay in the country I am currently working in. This is where everything went downhill.

I contacted my supervisor and explained the situation amidst all of the stress of a delayed plane (1 day delay due to overbooking) and residency permit stuff. She told me to not write this in the ""work chat"" but send an official email. I agreed and did not only that, but also asked for these two days to not be paid as I realized it was something extremely short notice and it was my problem. I also sent them official documentation regarding the call for the residency permit. Everything was okay on friday, they responded and told me they had received the information, or so I thought.

Today, I received an official email from my supervisor regarding yet again this situation and how it is ""impolite"" to do things on a short notice and that it impacts the team's workload in an extremely negative way. Mind you, it is just me who is away from work. 

This is not the first time something like this happens, since before my leave a coworker left three documents on my desk when working hours were over and I got criticized for not notifying my supervisor about the ""unfinished work"", all of this while I was on leave which technically is not okay because if I'm on leave according to the country's regulations, is not okay to contact the employee about work-related stuff except if it is an emergency. 

How should I reply to this email? What do you think is the best approach?

1f7bdpo,Transitioning to a More Technical Data Role with a Master's Degree,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some advice on positioning myself for a transition into more technical data roles, like a data analyst, data engineer, or IT business analyst.

A bit about me: my degree is in HR with a focus in Information Management, and I’m about 2 years into my career working at a Fortune 500 tech company. Since I started in a compensation business support role, I feel that I’ve built a strong reputation within HR and HR-adjacent IT teams at my company as someone with technical skills. I'm one of the few in my department who can write in SQL and R, and I’m frequently consulted to help create dashboards in Spotfire (similar to Tableau or PowerBI). I’m currently working as a Compensation Analyst which is considered one of the most technical roles that’s still within the umbrella of HR, but I’ve been trying to pivot into an actual Data Analyst/Data Engineering role whether in my company or outside.

I’m currently enrolled in an online Master’s of Information Science program from a smaller state school. While it’s fully covered by my employer, the coursework isn’t as challenging as I expected (I’m just 3 classes in). A perk of this program is that I can be done by this time next year at the pace I’ve been going however I’m concerned this degree might not significantly boost my qualifications or make me competitive for more technical roles. I *think* I’ve built enough credibility and made enough connections to be considered for some of these roles even without a degree within my company but I don’t want to be tied to just working here.

Would it be better to stick with this program because it’s manageable and funded, or should I consider switching to a more rigorous online data science program from a more respected university even if it means more preparation and pre-requisites, higher costs, and a longer time commitment? My goal isn't necessarily to become a data scientist but to be well-qualified for technical roles that involve strong data and analytical skills.

Any advice, especially from those who’ve made similar transitions, would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!",AmphibianOk7953,1,1.0,3,1725295353,2024-09-02 16:42:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f7bdpo/transitioning_to_a_more_technical_data_role_with/,9,2024

They SHOULD come to me with any query's that they are unable to handle themselves., but they are completely ignoring me. They speak with other engineers via teams than speak to me. 

Just to note, our desks a facing each other, it would just be a case of looking over our monitors to speak.

I've brought this up with my manager and advised that I will be going to HR if they cannot do something to resolve the conflict. We have an internal escalation process, so I cant just skip direct to HR. I also was asked during this persons probation (that was extended) for some feedback. I offered honest feedback in regards to their technical ability and customer relations. Both of which at the time needed improvement and still do. 

I feel as though all my feedback and actions to have something done are just falling on deaf ears. My manager seems to have a soft-spot of this engineer as they have stuck their own neck out when it came to helping this person relocate (Our company does not offer a relocation package) but somehow my manager was able to provide funding for hotels for 3 months while they sourced some place to live.

1f79ytk,Am I being managed out/quiet fired?,"A couple months ago, my company did a reorg. We are a relatively small tech company (about 100 people). I’m a manager, and my customer-facing team was cut down to 2 people. In addition to my team, my boss, and my boss’s boss (c-suite) were laid off. I now report to the only other manager in my department. 


I was offered a severance package or to keep my job - same title and pay but being a “player coach”.  For those unfamiliar, I am still a full-time manager of the 2 people I have left, but I am also doing the work of these employees now in addition (managing accounts). I opted to keep my job for secure income while looking for something else. We all know how the job market is in tech right now…


Ever since the layoffs, everything I do has been scrutinized and nit-picked by the CEO. We are talking about things like my heart not being in my work, using my cell phone (which is allowed and to my knowledge nobody has been reprimanded for), and working from home more frequently (I asked my boss if I could do this, they said it was fine, and then a couple weeks later I am in trouble for not coming in enough). I feel like I’m the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong now. If I was in charge of the department, sure. But I’m not. I’m a frontline manager.


My new boss has not had a formal 1:1 with me since they took control of the department, and when we do chat it’s mostly negative feedback that’s been delayed by weeks. I see a pretty clear communication breakdown, but if my superiors are unwilling to fix it, or are intentionally causing it, then what’s there to fix?  


I’ve worked at this company for about 5 years and have only received excellent performance reviews from both superiors and my employees. I have managed this team for the majority of my tenure.

I love this new department as I came from a call center in the previous department. This new one is more laid back, no excessive time watching/keeping, no micromanaging, not a lot of meetings, and most of all no dealing with customers on the phone…just all projects and I'm learning a great deal. It is such a nice change and has lessened my stress and anxiety, which I desperately needed.

The problem is the previous department now has a full time permanent position available and before my contract ended, the management assured me they would let me know when an opening is available. Well they did and I got several of teams messages with everyone wanting me to come back. However, I really don't think I want to, but at the same time, l would be a fool not to take a permanent job with benefits, I guess, right?

My last mind was to not apply, as my current contract I have many months left on it and in the interim, my plan was to get certification in another field I have experience in and then look for permanent work in that field Yet, we know how life is and things don’t always go planned. So I applied (again feeling pressured and that I would look ungrateful), interviewed and now have an offer, a good one a few dollars more per hour than I'm making now.

Even so, I still have not accepted the offer and today would be the last day to do so. I dread having to go back. It's not necessarily horrible and toxic but not anything I want to go back to.

I was at a 3 week vacation and I came back pretty much relaxed, I've been in the industry for almost 10 years and I rarely go on such long vacation. First day of work started today and I did the regular stuff. Reading mails, Teams conversations. Once I started doing technical things - I felt stressed. I realised its the same stress that I have during normal day of work.

I could literally feel the difference of how I behave. I start sweating a little bit, I started biting my nails, ripping out my hair, going to toilet often. I cannot really tell why its stressing me, but could be because I am having hard time understanding and learning new stuff. Everytime I learn something new it takes me ages to understand something. It could be one of the reasons.

My workplace is not the problem here. There is not hard time pressure from my manager. But I just have difficulties with making my brain work, solve the problems and learn things quickly. The reason why I am considered to be good at my job is because I put a lot of effort in the past to grab the basic knowledge, understand the problems and how things work.

1f787yv,Oportunities after msc microbiology in India? ,"So i recently completed my graduation in ZBC and have been preparing for the SSC exam for some months. However, as it's a government job with high competition, I'm now considering pursuing an MSc in microbiology as it at least provides some placement opportunities in pvt pharmaceutical and food technology companies etc, which is what I've heard from my seniors. And, like microbiology can offer some job security  compared to solely preparing for SSC. 
But i spent half an hour researching the situation of life sciences in India and found that it's not particularly good and promising here as it seems if someone wants to persue it solely. So my questions are;

1) Can I prepare for government exams like SSC while studying my masters in microbiology simultaneously, since the college I’ve selected has a 70% attendance requirement, but regular leaves can be taken after making a good name in the department( that's what the professor there suggested) ?


2)if preparing for both simultaneously is not possible, then should I pursue a masters in microbiology or should I continue my SSC preparation with full focus at home by taking a gap year? Would that be advantageous or disadvantageous?

As a girl in India, becoming independent as soon as possible is my priority. I don't want to make any wrong decision this time. Feel free to suggest!

","21 M in Toronto

Basically I currently work doing customer service (tickets and the phone sometimes), but at first i was doing all that plus walk ins by myself so i got overwhelmed and applied for other jobs,

I also didn’t like the tone that everyone would use if you you made a mistake eg. “why are we doing this”, “i don’t wanna see this again”, especially cuz i have anxiety and autism so stuff like that sticks with me a lot, and it’s a pretty small company, but i also was doing a lot more than i should and getting paid less than i would at walmart

So I applied for other jobs and got a interview as a team lead at a games place kind of like a new age arcade, i went for my interview and came back to work the next day and they gave me a raise

i can’t decide which one to choose

Pros and cons of current

* regular monday - friday 9-5
* 20 a hour
* possibly room for going up?? (it’s my third raise in less than year from 17)

cons

* not a lot of management, hr or resources for employees
* it’s a small company so you’ll be doing a lot of things that aren’t your job
* getting yelled at by customers then getting yelled at by coworkers

the new job could be more or less stressful, i’ll be starting at 19.55 so there’s a chance there’s a higher top pay, and i would probably like it more plus id be a manager instead of just a rep, the downside is i might have to work weekends and nights and i would start a bit lower paid

The other good thing about switching is the morning should would be an actual morning shift, my regular shift is 9-6, meaning I get home around 7 and still have to wake up around 8, where as id prefer a job that starts around 8 and ends earlier, which the new place has but then again id have to work other shifts sometimes too.",WolfofBayStreetTO,2,1.0,0,1725287021,2024-09-02 14:23:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f7803s/how_to_know_what_job_would_be_a_better_fit/,9,2024
1f77yh6,Is it time to leave?,"I joined my current workplace when two others had left to pursue their postgraduate degree. I was taken under the wings of the current manager, given that his most experienced staff were not available, and he did not get on too well with the others. 

I had many opportunities to develop, for which I am very grateful. My manager is not the easiest to work with but I had set my mind to come to work, do my job, and leave. I handled the work of the two staff who were studying, without any training. I delivered, and even went above and beyond, even if the stress was significant at times.

Both staff are now back with a promotion. They have taken all of their previous responsibilities back, and even the additional ones I had acquired in their absence. One of them in particular seems to be very resentful. I believe it could be because she believes the opportunity I had gotten in her absence should have been hers.

I now find myself going to the office everyday with barely anything to do, no skills being developed and my abilities going to waste. The manager ignores me most of the time. The tasks I am given to complete is micromanaged by the recently promoted employees.

I have explained that I do not have anything to do and i believe that the communication is really bad. But it seems that I am being treated unfairly because I have expressed my opinion. It seems that I am being ‘punished’ in a way.

1f74xcx,Advice for reneging on an offer?,"[California] I started looking for opportunities outside of my current job a couple months ago. I was interviewing for options A (consulting firm) and B (small early-stage start up) when option C (large non-faang tech) appeared through a recruiter message. I was a highly competitive candidate for C but the work didn’t seem that interesting - I kept pursuing C as a hedge for A and B. 

Option A fell apart. I got an offer for B and signed an offer letter (not an employment contract) and got a start date set up for 9/12. Considering the state of the job market, I assumed this was NOT a done deal until I got my first paycheck from B so I continued interviewing with C. I received an offer from C that was extraordinarily generous. The more I learned about C, the more the job/comp/benefits aligned with my personal goals and became my preferred option. 

I signed an offer for C to start on 9/26 (2 weeks after B), again with the reasoning that neither of these offer letters were guarantees of employment. My final day with my current employer is this Friday 9/6. 

I think that letting B know of my new decision ASAP is the best option in terms of damaging the relationships there less, although that bridge would still be burned since it’s reneging on an offer at the end of the day. However, I’m thinking of starting to work for B as if C doesn’t exist since I still need to clear all of their onboarding background checks (shouldn’t be an issue as I did one for B, but who knows) and the offer could be rescinded at any moment. If C becomes a reality, I’d essentially walk away from B with no notice and scorch all of those bridges. If C falls apart, I’d still have B to fall back on.

Hey I was wondering if I can get another opinion/advice on my situation:
- Entered college majoring in real estate bc my parents own a real estate company and I thought I would work with them
- Spent first two years taking generic business classes and doing random extracurriculars that weren't career related
- Interned with my parents but was given very brainless operational tasks w/o much responsibility and no pay. Interned at a similar company and quit shortly after. Got my real estate license but never used it. Worked at a brokerage company doing sales calls but was not good at it and unfulfilled.
- Junior year joined an entrepreneurship club that I became super involved in and rose to be president. Enjoyed the work and the people and the events I arranged. Joined a VC club briefly and switched my major to finance so I could graduate, get a degree that's actually usefil, fit the VC and Real Estate Finance space because those were taught in my classes.
- Got a legit internship in real estate finance summer of my junior year. Felt behind bc my excel skills were subpar, felt out of place culturally/socially being a woman and minority, realized I pursued real estate bc of my parents and didn't have a true interest
- fell into a deep depression, saw a career counselor, realized that I aligned with tech/computer science/entrepreneurship space the most bc of my CIS minor, the friends I made in the entrepreneurship club, and the results in the career exams, and recent interest in AI.
- graduated in finance and enrolled in a CS bootcamp but didn't do much work bc of the stress of graduating and fell behind and was demotivated to keep up bc it was online.
- joined a tech entrepreneurship centered fellowship to get placed at a startup job. Loved the people in the fellowship but fellowship suddenly shut down due to funding issues

Now I'm at a crossroads and don't know where to go:
Current plans: get an operations/program manager role at an AI or socially driven company in a major metro and save up for a masters bc parents won't pay. Dad says I should get a masters in data science right away in India since it's cheap but they require a bachelor's in CS.

tldr; employer promised me a different title, wage, and weekly hours. I ended up getting not even 25% of what was promised. i want to quit, and have backup jobs all ready to go. is it reasonable to leave not even a month into employment?

I applied to this company several times before and never got a call back. last year i managed to get an interview but wasn't hired. this year they opened up a to go area and were looking for full OR part time employees. never once did they say 'we only have one full time position available'

I applied for the full time expeditor position, which comes with a minimum pay of 18/hr.

I got the job. had a follow up interview with the to go manager, where she already had the employment offer ready. I barely looked over it bc honestly i was desperate for work and as long as i made 16/hr i was ok.

16 an hour was all i was offered. alright, fine, I'll just put down 8hr shifts 6 days a week to make up for the loss in wages and to pay rent. the manager walks me around to give me the tour, during which he says to one of the produce ladies that im the HEAD EXPEDITOR. explicitly states this.

i find out a week before training is over that not only am i not the head expeditor, not only am i NOT full time, but im barely even PART time. they scheduled me one day in two weeks for four fucking hours yall. four hours total in the span of two weeks. for 16 an hour. they want me to live off 64 fucking dollars for two weeks.

and then they tried to turn it on me and act like I was stupid for misunderstanding when i went in the same day to ask about the changes and how different my expectations had been. literally everyone in this company treats me like im the biggest idiot on the planet just because im repeating the same things i was promised and told by my manager.

I immediately got my job with my previous employer back, and i have two companies willing to take me that would pay $5 more per hour, with actual full time positions.

In recent years, I’ve developed a strong passion for technology, particularly artificial intelligence and machine learning. I taught myself programming and earned the Computer Science certificate from Harvard’s CS50 course. Currently, I’m studying to earn a certificate in Python and AI, also from Harvard, and in the future, I plan to get a Project Management certificate on Coursera offered by Google.

The reason I’m taking these courses is that I want to find a job that allows me to express more creativity while also offering salary growth. I’m aware that my current banking contract is one of the best in Italy, but I would like to explore opportunities where economic growth can be more dynamic and linked to the new skills I’m developing.

I’m considering moving towards project management, possibly in a role that combines my background as a private banker with technical and programming skills. I’m wondering if there are similar roles or if there are companies looking for profiles like mine that blend financial and tech expertise.

I believe my cross-functional skills could be valuable in several areas. As a private banker, I’ve developed a strong ability to analyze financial data, manage risk, and understand client needs. These skills could be very valuable in a project management role, especially if it’s related to developing financial products or fintech solutions. Additionally, my experience in building and maintaining trusted client relationships could be an important asset for roles focused on tech consulting or client management in the tech sector.

In addition to my current job, I am also trying to create small tech projects with the hope of finding a niche that could potentially lead to a significant increase in income. My mind is always active, and I’m constantly looking for new entrepreneurial ideas. I enjoy exploring and testing new opportunities that could combine my skills in banking and technology, potentially finding an innovative path that allows me to merge these two passions.

I am open to change, but I would prefer not to take a pay cut. I’m looking for a transition that could lead to advancement in terms of both responsibilities and compensation.

I would also love to receive suggestions on resources or educational paths that could facilitate this transition. If anyone has experience or knows of platforms, courses, or professional networks that could help make the switch from a banking career to one more focused on technology and project management, I would greatly appreciate any advice!

1f72g17,Torn between choosing between two job offers. Please help!,"I graduate by the end of the year and have two different job offers. I'm very stuck on which one to choose. Please help me out, everyone!

Job A is a part time, face-to-face customer service role in a big a big 4 bank in Australia. It pays a little more, but it is a very stressful role where you deal with disgruntled customers all day. I often struggle with social anxiety and often get flustered in tough customer service scenarios. I have heard from a friend that works there that the KPIs are also very intense. The workplace seems very high-strung and I definitely struggle with that and I honestly see myself as a person with pretty thin skin that might not be able to handle the constructive feedback and pressure. I know that if I do take on this role, I'll have to do plenty of internal work with myself to develop tougher skin. However, there is a chance for me to branch out to other roles in the company if I do well enough. I'm hoping to do something that isn't customer facing, such as HR. That is, if I can survive the 6 month probation period without getting eaten alive. It would also be a great company to put in my resume. The travel time is also around 30 minutes public transport. 

  
Job B is a full time, over-the-phone customer service role in a much smaller company. It also includes data entry and some administration. The travel time is one hour, to the other side of the city. The manager and staff all seem extremely friendly and welcoming, with the interview mainly just spent cracking jokes with each other. The job seems much more forgiving and chill and just easier on my mental health. I enjoy that I won't have to be facing customers all day. However, the salary is only 55k AUD a year which is nearly not enough to move out of my parents house, which is my number one goal. I fear that I'll be stuck in that role with no way of increasing my salary.

1f724dh,Looking for Feedback on My New App for PM Job Aspirants! 🚀 Could You Help?,"Hey everyone!

I’ve recently launched a new web app called CaseMaster: Guesstimate Challenge, and I’m super excited to share it with this community! 🎉 The app is designed to help aspiring product managers practice problem-solving and guesstimate questions, which are crucial for PM interviews.

Link- https://guesstimate-game-zeta.vercel.app/


Why I Built This:
As a product manager myself, I noticed there weren’t many engaging ways to practice these types of questions. So, I decided to create a fun, game-like experience to make learning more interactive and less intimidating.

How It Works:
The app presents various guesstimate scenarios that you might encounter in a PM interview. It’s all about thinking on your feet and developing a structured approach to solving problems. Perfect for sharpening your skills or preparing for that big interview!

I’d Love Your Feedback:
I’m looking for honest feedback to improve the app. Here are a few questions to get you started:

	1.	First Impressions: What do you think of the app’s design and usability? Is it intuitive?
	2.	Content Quality: Do the questions and scenarios feel relevant and challenging?
	3.	User Experience: How’s the overall flow? Any bugs or features you’d like to see?
	4.	Anything Else: Open floor for any other thoughts or suggestions!

Feel free to dive in and share your thoughts! You can also DM me if you’d prefer a private chat. Your insights will be invaluable in shaping the next steps for this project.

Thank you so much for taking the time to help out! 🙏

1f722ik,I feel like a number and invisible at my new job with a big corporation,"I feel like a dead person that hasn't realized and is not aware they no longer exist in this earth, I just feel invisible. 

Is this how jobs at big corporates are? I work at a regional corporate office of about 5,000 people of whom all are strangers and everyone just sits wherever and a lot of people don't show to work or only show up for like an hour and leave home. 

My last job was a small office of about 25 people and I just miss that feeling of being visible and alive. We all knew each other, etc. I'm by no means a chatty or social person at all, but I feel I'm slowly dying.

  
1. Are all large corporates like this and do I need to look for a smaller place? or is this more like a covid thing and I should get used to it, or maybe that 1 job was just unique and I should adapt?

Anybody ever felt this way?

Doesn't help that the company has also been laying off thousands and it just adds to the insecurity by feeling that no one even knows me to say, don't lay this person off, if I ever appear on a layoff list.

1f71zrr,Struggling to find my path. What my career should be ? ,"Hello everyone,

I’m a 27-year-old female living in Europe. English is not my first language, so please bear with me. I didn’t attend university or college; instead, I started working as a clerk at a gambling shop at 18, earning minimum wage. I never really knew what I wanted to do as a career. Over time, I learned the job I’m currently doing, which led to a better salary, but it’s still the lowest compared to all my friends who went to university.

 Regrets and Reflections

Now, I find myself regretting not pursuing studies when I was younger, though I never had a clear passion for anything back then. I’m trying to find a job I would truly enjoy, but it has become such a source of stress that I struggle to sleep at night.

 Past Interests

When I was 18, I wanted to become a singer. I was very passionate about singing and even attended music school for a year. However, when I tried to turn it into a career, I started to dislike it. The responsibilities, like having to learn certain songs, took all the fun out of it, so I stopped. I realized I wanted to sing just for fun, not as a job.

A few years later, I developed a great love for baking. I spent all my free time baking for my family and friends. I decided to make it my profession, so I went to culinary school. I was extremely good at it and very passionate, but I soon realized I hated the idea of being a professional baker the way they were teaching us. I wanted to bake for fun, not as a career, so I dropped out.

Current Situation

Since then, I’ve struggled to take myself seriously when it comes to deciding on a career path. I’ve continued working at the same shop where I started. I do enjoy this job; it’s comfortable, I’m good at it, and I feel confident every day. However, there’s no room for growth, and the salary is too low for me to achieve personal goals like buying a house or becoming financially independent.

I still live with my parents, which might sound ridiculous to some, but in my country, it’s very common given the economic situation. I contribute to the household expenses and work 50 hours a week.

 Influences and Envy

My boyfriend is a programmer, and I’ve never seen anyone love their job as much as he does. He works fully remotely, with no stress or anxiety, and he gets good pay. One Sunday night, as we were getting ready for bed, he told me, “It’s crazy, but I can’t wait for tomorrow morning to start this development process—I love my job so much.” I envy that feeling.

Fears and Concerns

I do like my job now, but it’s not my passion. It’s just a job that doesn’t cause me anxiety, and I don’t dread going in every morning. However, I’m really scared about what might happen if I put effort into something, like studying for four years, and end up hating it. I’m also afraid of studying something and not succeeding financially.

 Interests and Career Thoughts

I have many interests. I love intuitive eating and everything related to well-being and health. I’ve considered studying nutrition or psychology, but I don’t have the funds for tuition, and I’m afraid of failing and wasting both time and money.

I’ve also thought about studying programming like my boyfriend, especially since there’s a public school for it in my country, which wouldn’t cost much. I know it’s a profession that would provide a good income, but I’m unsure if I’d enjoy it, as I have no real experience with programming—only basic knowledge.

Another option I’ve considered is health coaching, but I’m unsure how successful I would be in that field. Additionally, working as a clerk and dealing with difficult customers is starting to wear on me, so I know I can’t do this for many more years. I’ve also thought about becoming a secretary at a doctor’s office.


Dreams and Desires

Ideally, I’d love to work remotely, and even better, as a freelancer, so I could make my own schedule and travel. I haven’t had many opportunities to travel in my life, and I really want to change that.

In general, I want to enjoy life—I’m not a career-driven person. I don’t want to live to work; I want to work to live. However, I’m starting to feel the void financially, and I know I need to establish a career. But I’ve realized that turning a hobby into a career doesn’t work for me.

Conclusion

So, I’m at a crossroads and could really use some advice. What would you suggest I do?w",Alive-Cranberry3613,1,1.0,2,1725266977,2024-09-02 08:49:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f71zrr/struggling_to_find_my_path_what_my_career_should/,9,2024

1f70881,Any advice? I feel like I wasted 5 years of my life... spent the last 9 months job hunting.,"I’m reaching out because I need to vent and am hoping for some guidance or encouragement.

I earned my BAS in Cybersecurity last December. Since then, I’ve applied tirelessly for both in-person and remote jobs, but I haven’t had any success. I haven’t even received a denial email. When I follow up by phone, either no one is available to speak with me or I’m left to leave messages that never get returned. For the two or three entry-level Help Desk or Tech Support roles I have heard back on, I’m overlooked due to a lack of experience with MSPs or specific platforms.

A bit of background: my work history has been entirely in restaurant management and kitchens. While I was attending school, I was a stay-at-home dad and took on teaching responsibilities during the pandemic for two kids.

Leaving the restaurant industry was a major reason for pursuing this degree, and I’m trying hard to avoid returning to it. Without too many unnecessary details, I battled alcoholism for around 10 years and am approaching that milestone in sobriety. At this point however, I’m at my wits’ end, and this ongoing struggle is impacting my mental health. I didn’t receive detailed training in coding, hacking, or scripting, and I feel like the degree hasn’t prepared me as employers expect. I feel like I wasted 5 more years of my life.... I'm even contemplating just going to 2 years of law school now that I'm this far.

If anyone has advice, guidance, or encouragement, or would be willing to review my resume and offer pointers, I would greatly appreciate it. At the very least, this has provided me a small break from the endless cycle of applications, cover letters, assessments, and one-way recorded interviews.

I have a History degree… yay!

I have no permanent house and can move anywhere in the US although I have been based in NW FL.

The problem is that I don’t know what to do with myself. I put all my eggs in one basket, career wise, and it has been a complete failure due to injury. Military related. 3 serious injuries stopped 3 separate attempts at a pipeline course, most recently this year. I really WAS in that kind of shape, not just for my age. - currently my knees are not working well.

Now I’m getting out with no benefits, no retirement, and nothing anyone cares about on a resume. I did some cool stuff but boarding ships near Somalia during GWOT or having gone to Dive School won’t help me earn a real living.

I thought about moving to a college town and getting a JD. I now feel like I would waste all my savings if I attended law school. Three years from now I would be broke while competing for jobs with Harvard grads 20 years younger than me. A Master’s in History would just be silly to pay for.

My knees are shot for the most part now, so many trades are out of the question.

I’m not great with computers but I never really tried outside of the basics.

I could bartend/ serve while working my way up somewhere but I’m really over that as I have served a lot. I don’t want it as a career.

I’m kind of clueless right now. I’m about 3 weeks away from general homelessness and unemployment.

Any constructive advice is appreciated. I’m open to trying new things and new places.
Thank you.

1f6zv8w,when should I quit my job,"Hi! I’ve been currently working at my job for almost 3 years and have been applying to positions on and off for over a year now with little to no luck. I recently decided to start applying again and have been interviewing for this really good opportunity. However— mid way through interviewing for this position, there was another opening in my current company for a different role that I was recommended for and was interested in. I’ve done 2 interviews for that role at the moment and the last piece of that recruitment process is a case study due Tuesday. The new company’s HR let me know on Thursday that I was selected for the role and they were getting my offer letter approved. HR was going on vacation Friday so they let me know I should expect it on Tuesday. 

My plan was to quit on Tuesday once I got the offer letter than speak with the hiring manager for the new role at my current company after to let them know I’m withdrawing. But my only concern is what if I don’t get the offer letter on Tuesday when the case study is due (I don’t plan on doing it haha)

1f6yvgv,Should I ignore red flags in the interview to take a job after layoffs?,"**Background:** I spent my first 7 years of my career in a very niche field of mechanical engineering. While I liked the fact that it was equal parts hands-on and desk work, I felt it was very limited in terms of mobility (both vertically within the company and job-hopping without having to move very far). So I started a masters degree (2 semesters to go) in a more generalized field of engineering and managed to land a related job at a defense contractor.

I found that I didn't like being completely hands-off but figured I was still new and would learn enough that the job would eventually become interesting, or at least use those skills to pivot to another field within the defense industry.  Well, last month I got laid off after only 6 months. 

**The situation:**  I have a secret clearance that came through just before the layoff. I have a fairly generous unemployment from my previous state, and I have a solid emergency fund, so I'm not desperate, but it hurts to see the possibility of having to build up that savings again. I'd like to stay in the area, but we'll see as I become more desperate.  I put out about 100 applications gotten a few screening calls and 5 actual interviews. One of which I got an offer in the field I tried to pivot out of in DC, just outside the range I'd be able to comfortably commute everyday (60 miles).

**The interview:** The initial interview with the hiring manager made him seem like someone I wouldn't want to work with. It's a technical position but he didn't have a technical background, When I offhandedly mentioned that I assumed there would be another, technical stage of the interview with the engineering team he interjected that, no, he was the hiring manager and there would be no meeting the team. Fair enough, I guess, defense contracting is allergic to overhead so I can understand that.  When I asked what percentage of the job was hands-on vs desk work, he said he didn't know. He also bragged that the engineers worked ""AT LEAST 40 hours a week"". I mention that I was laid off and he asks if it was due to my performance. There were a few other things he said that I won't go into here, but I just got the vibe that I wouldn't like working for him.

A recruiter no-showed to their follow-up call and after eventually CCing the manager, he called and told me that the recruiter had been laid off and that I'd be receiving an offer. When the offer of $120k came in, I gave a counter offer of $140k, and asked if I could meet with someone to get a better understanding of the job details. She put me on with the hiring manager again.

This time he says that its 100% desk work, mostly acquisitions. And when I ask about layoffs, he says that the company doesn't lay people off (maybe I imagined the layoff explanation of the recruiter? it was early in the morning) and asks why I would ask that. He conveys his annoyance that I originally had my price range at $120k (I didn't, I told him the lower number I was making in my previous job) and then changed it to $140k and talks about how much work it is for HR to go through approvals. I say its commensurate with what I was making adjusted for the cost of living in DC, I bring up the commute, he says his is longer. Eventually we settle on $130k, I have until Tuesday to decide.

**The Question:**   
Should I ignore the red flags and take the job? Maybe I'm mistaken? Apparently he oversees a few hundred people so maybe I won't even interact with him much. Maybe he retires soon?

Location-wise, my long-term plan was to move somewhere in central Maryland or outside Philadelphia so I could buy a house and not worry about employment in case of layoffs. I could afford that with this salary, but short-term I'd need to break my lease or face a hellish commute. 

**TLDR:** Job sounds like it might be boring and wouldn't teach immediately-transferrable skills and I really don't like the vibe of the hiring manager but haven't met anyone else. I'm second-guessing if maybe I misread things. Should I take the job anyway just to keep pushing toward my life goals?

1f6yq7d,Career advancement,"I work at a rapidly growing company with a large ownership/investment group. All of these owners have to have some type of role in the company and some have been pushed out if they haven’t done exactly what the majority owner wants. It’s a fairly toxic environment overall(just some insight on the type of people I work for).

As far as things go for myself. I worked my way up to what’s considered a senior management position here. I make the top pay that the company pays any of its other managers(around 100K/year, which is decent salary where I live as it’s a low cost of living). 

I have some challenges that I have to live with in my career that are self inflicted. I don’t have any college or university education. I also have some serious criminal offences(drug trafficking and firearm charges) from a decade ago. 

More than advice I think I just want people to weigh in, have I peaked? Im only 32 and I’m hoping I’m not all I can be already. I’m not sure that I actually have any options to try to get into a better situation be it work environment or any significant pay increase. I’m proud of where I’ve gotten considering I where I’ve been. I’m eager to continue learning and advancing though. I just don’t know if I have a path now to continue moving up.

1f6xxsm,Lost in Life. What to Do?,"I work at a family-owned company. More than 2.5 years na rin ako dito, going 3 na rin til the end of this year. Yung first half ng first year ko sa trabaho, gusto ko na talaga mag-resign. Pero di ako pinayagan, tapusin ko daw muna yung project. Since hindi naman tayo from a well-off family and I have to provide at student pa ang kapatid ko that time, I decided to continue kahit na jusko breakdown pagkagising sa umaga bago pumasok tapos breakdown ulit pagkauwi minsan sa byahe pa (di ko na kaya pigilan talaga luha ko haha) grabe ang stress ko sa way ng management, considering na mag-isa na lang rin akong office staff dahil nauna na magresign yung dati kong kasama. Di na rin kinaya pero ang difference namin, medyo well-off sya haha. Sobrang iritable ako during work hours and ang dalas ko magkasakit. I isolated my self kasi hindi ko na rin talaga kaya makipag-socialize, sobrang bilis ko ma-drain kahit around my friends. Palagi akong nagkakalagnat and palaging nagsusuka or masakit ang tyan ganon.

Around August last last year, I tried applying for other jobs and fortunately pasado naman. The first one is sa BPO non-voice (which is very thankful ako since may pagka-bingi ako, and introvert ako huhu) kaso ayun nga. Pipirma na lang ng J.O. tapos umatras ako kasi inoverthink ko ng masydo yung process. I planned for an immediate resignation sa current company pero dahil natatakot ako sa mga sasabihin nila and baka di ulit ako payagan umalis, I declined the offer. Magdamag ako di nakatulog and iniyakan ko talaga kung tutuloy ba ako or hindi kasi I really don't know what to do.

Then this year lang around March, a friend told me na may hiring sa malapit lang sa amin. Graphic Designer. Interested talaga ako, and I came to the interview the next day. Tanggap na ako and for requirements na lang pero sinabi ko rin naman sa HR filing pa lang ako for resignation sa company ko. Ang ending ganon ulit. Anxiety rushed thru me and again, I turned down my application. Nanghinayang ako syempre, kasi bukod sa sobrang ikli ng travel time eh mas mataas ang sahod ko sana doon.

One thing that's always holding me back is yung fear ko na nga sa work environment. I know na hindi iyon maiiwasan, pero sorry talagaaa sobrang traumatized na po ako 😭 I thought of resigning muna din sana para hindi ko ioverthink ang process then tsaka na lang ako maghahanap ng aapplyan kaso I can't afford naman na matengga since breadwinner din ako. Wala akong naipon kasi yung sahod ko (12k/mo), kulang pa sa bills, loan payments, at bigas. Wala naman akong luho, yung halagang 100 nga pag-iisipan ko pang mabuti kung worth it ba bilhin kahit kailangan ko naman talaga.

Gusto ko na talaga mag-resign, pero I really don't know where to start, where to go, and what to do after. If you'd ask kung saan pa ako interested na work or profession I'd say na I don't have anything in mind, kasi ultimo mga bagay na gusto ko gawin before, wala na. I don't have the fire to do it like before. I feel paralyzed. Please. Any advice? I've been mentally unstable for the past years so I hope I made sense kahit alam ko na sobrang scatterbrained ko na.

1f6wti0,Started a new job and I hate it. I have 3 ideas… which one should I go for?,"I’m currently in a predicament. I recently (less than a month) started a new job and I absolutely hate it. 

For background, I have been in sales for 8.5 years and have made over $100k, 6/8 years. 

I started working at a startup (2 years old) fintech sales company last week and it is absolutely horrible. The hours are excessive and the leads are dry. I understand cutthroat sales but man, these coworkers of mine are absolute dickheads. “Warm leads” are greater than 1 year old, and it is really just cold calling. (I don’t mind CC, I did it for over 2 years) but the leads are nothing like they hyped up during the interviews… 

I left the previous company (financial sales) because they relied on real time intake forms and 75% of the sales floor are not making commission, (I was making commission, just not enough). The company itself ran well for a long time (7 years), but they definitely made wrong decisions this year and it is holding them back hard. The job felt like a large spread out family. Everyone was easy get along with. 

Here’s the real dilemma, job 1 has longer hours than the previous job by 13 hours a week or 52 hours more per month and the salary difference is $5k/year. 

I have a lot less time to myself during the day; I would understand this switch if I made a significant amount more (at least $15k), but an extra $416 a month for 52 more hours of work just is not worth it to me whatsoever. 

So I find myself asking. What the fuck do I do. Here’s what I came up with. 

1 - ask my previous employer to take me back, but in a different position, with a higher salary. I was a sales rep, but I would like to me a sort of business intelligence analyst / more admin position. I have the credentials to do so. 

2 - ask my previous employer to take me back, but with a higher base salary, I would push for $12k more but am expecting them to counter with $5k, but I won’t take anything less than an $8k raise. Old coworkers of mine have stated that upper management has brought my name up to them and explicitly stating they’d take me back in a heartbeat. 

3 - go to a competitor of my previous employer, since they have better lead flow, but way worse hours. I have certain hobbies that I wouldn’t be able to do at all in this position and I don’t want to make work my life. But the pay would be better. 

4 - stay where I am and figure it out. Young and a (hopefully) fast growing company with equity and quick (6-12 mo) but significant commission raise. 

What the fuck should I do? 😂

Any advice would help! If there are any  more questions I’ll do my best to answer them in comments. ",Far-Requirement-3285,3,1.0,3,1725247164,2024-09-02 03:19:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f6wti0/started_a_new_job_and_i_hate_it_i_have_3_ideas/,9,2024

I have a lot of experience in graphic design and I do a bit of web tagging. I have also messed around in Linux terminal some as well. I have wanted to make this move for a long time but what I am trying to figure out is if it is best to just go the certificate route to learn what I need to learn, a boot camp, a bachelor's degree... I also wanted to know if a master's degree would be better than all of these and what kind of skills I would need as a foundation to be looked at for a masters program.

1f6v6go,Wanting to switch career paths,"Hello everyone! I hope you all are doing well! 

I'm 38 years old and am in the insurance industry. I am looking for a change in career. Ideally, I was looking in to Finance/accounting but have also been eye-ing book keeping. 

I know that school/getting a degree will be a must no matter which route I go. I feel like book keeping might be the better route to start. 

Is there a good but cheaper school that I could do their certification? Do most employers also want experience(and certifications) when they are looking to hire someone? 

I also thought about medical coding and billing but that might be too far out of my zone as the medical terminology might be a challenge for me. 

Thank you in advance for your responses/advice! 

Have a great night!😊

1f6uzbi,F23 Stuck in a Dead-End Job—Should I Quit for a Master's or Keep Grinding?,"Hey, I really need some advice here. I’m 23, graduated in 2023 from a third-tier college in Computer Science. Honestly, we barely even went to college because of the whole corona thing, and then boom—campus placements hit us. I just grabbed the first job I was offered to get out of the house. It started as a paid internship with a measly 9k stipend in a new city, but then I got a full-time offer from the same company. The starting CTC was 24k, with around 19k in-hand. Fast forward a year, I recently got an increment, but it was super disappointing—now it’s 33k CTC, and in-hand is around 27k.

I’m a backend developer (Dot Net) with experience in SSMS (SQL), and I also dabble in Figma for page designs. Plus, I handle some Angular stuff and have worked with Microsoft Azure and AWS. Basically, I’m doing everything from backend to a bit of front-end and cloud—so, yeah, a full-stack developer.

I have an important client interview coming up in November for the project I’m shadowing right now. They want skills in DotNet, React (which I only know the basics of, but I’ve done Angular, so it shouldn’t be too hard), AWS, and SQL.

The job itself is okay. The hours are pretty chill, 10:30 to 7:30 (realistically, more like 11:30 to 7:30), and my manager is nice—no micromanaging or toxic vibes, and I get WFH when I need it. It’s a regular job with its pros and cons.

But here’s the kicker—I feel like I’m busting my ass for peanuts. The pay scale is fixed, and it feels like no matter how hard I work, I’m stuck. Meanwhile, there’s this other girl/boys on Power BI or something, barely doing anything, and we’re getting paid the same. So yeah, I’m kinda salty about that.

So, what do you all think I should do? Should I keep slogging at this company, or is it time to switch? I’m also thinking about doing a master’s—either here in India or abroad. Would it even make a difference? Which field should I go for? I’m lost and could use some solid advice.please please guild me .

A master’s from a good private college could open up better career opportunities and help me build some legit connections. But the thing is, I don’t have much financial backing from my family. Plus, my partner is just starting his career, so I’m supporting him financially too. I can scrape together about 3 lakhs for a master’s—is that even enough?

I was married in June but didn't change my last name on Indeed since I was in the middle of some interviews then, but my official, hand-designed resume has my new last name, and so does my LinkedIn. 

When I'm asked about goals in the next 5 years, I specifically ONLY talk about career goals and don't say anything about starting a family -- I'm not an idiot, I know it's *technically* illegal to discriminate on the kids thing but people still do.

But if I'm asked what brought me from out of state 6 years ago it's natural to say I moved here for my now-husband (""and hey, it worked out, ha ha!""). I interviewed to do communications in the industry he works in and mentioned how interested I've become in that industry through him. I have an anecdote that when watching football with my husband, I analyze every TV ad and tune out the game when he does the opposite (to show that I'm ""always on"" so to speak).

I've just been thinking about that it's **federally illegal** to ask if I have a husband or spouse. So am I giving them any info against me by mentioning it for them?

1f6txed,"People don't quit jobs, they quit managers","Tldr: 8 years at the same company, 2 promotions,  but now the manager and lack of opportunities are ruining my motivation and outlook... I want to move to Australia, but it seems like the IT market is quite different, in addition to requiring sponsorship so its feeling a bit scary! 

Looking for thoughts, advice, suggestions regarding IT jobs, moving US>AUS... moral support wont be turned down either 🥹 

Addition notes:
My manager has required me to spend 90% of the past two and a half years in one specific software that is not super widely used... I am routinely told ""it won't be like this forever""... but it is only getting worse. I know the skillset can be applied to similar software, but most employers prefer a well rounded candidate.

I was on a team of 5 and 1 person left, the position still hasn't been posted... this means im primary on-call 25% of the time and secondary on-call 25% of the time... its a salary position, so even when work is required during off hours its not paid and we dont flex the time. 
- to add on to this, 1 person on the team of now 4 just flat out skips doing multiple defined on-call activities requiring the rest of us to pick up the pieces. In discussing this with the team lead, it was suggested that I ask my coworker why they don't do the work... if I have to do the team lead's job, I'm not sure why they're  not part of the on-call rotation? 

Im typically an excited employee and person, I have stayed despite being underpaid because I was fond of the environment, team, and employer until about a year ago, now I am feeling broken down and needing a new job, which is not a fun combination.

As far as the relocation part, I am in Aus now visiting and do have a place to live if I find sponsorship from an employer, but I'm not able to seek that while I'm here on this visit as I dont have the correct visa.

I do not smoke weed, I do not drink nor do I do any type of drugs. This is the first time I’ve used a CBD product in 8 months. 

The MRO texted me to call the office to discuss the results. I called him and he said that I “tested positive for marijuana” I told him no, it’s CBD and I described the events listed above. He said he was going to send the results over to my employer and they’ll call me Tuesday. 

My question is - 1) I feel like my life is over. I’m coming off a divorce and this job is a huge win for me… now I might be back at square one. 2) Should I reach out to my branch manager and explain to him the situation as early as I can Tuesday morning? (They’re closed for Labor Day). Should I wait for them to contact me? Do you think they might allow me to retest or do you think they’ll rescind their offer? I’m in Georgia, so it’s an at will state. 

I just want to do what’s best for my career and for my daughter. ",Jham93,0,0.5,2,1725228761,2024-09-01 22:12:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f6qp3n/cbd_drug_test_career_advice/,9,2024

1f6panv,Thoughts on navigating career/graduation fears ,"Hello,

I am a CS major and have a new grad job in Austin at a non big tech company (making low 6 figs), and I was wondering since Austin has a lot of big tech offices such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc, will it be fairly doable for me to after a year or so of experience move into higher roles in those types of companies without having to uproot and move? I really don't want to stagnate.

Also, I saw another post about this but although I am super grateful for my job, I somehow don't feel super excited to graduate and start working. It feels unfathomable to me that my whole life will be such repetition of 9-5, come home, sleep, repeat forever. Up till now its been school which is more fun. Seems like after a while, espeically if I'm unable to make really close friends like I did in college, I'll stop having things to look forward to.

Speaking on the last point, that is another reason I sometimes consider switching to medicine, so that I have a more defined path even if it is school to a stable career. (I know this sounds stupid and I am trying my best to get rid of these intrustive thoughts). In addition to the fact that I am pretty good at studying and memorizinf stuff and making impact could be cool. If anyone can convince me I am being dumb constantly second guessing my current career, I would greatly, greatly, appreciate. Or convince me I should drop and switch. 

Any thoughts on any of the above appreciated :)

1f6m35f,Forced to book annual leave after being attacked. ,"Writing on behalf of my friend, 29 [M] in the UK. He started a new role earlier in august, so it's been less than a month. Last weekend he was attacked while on a night out in central london and may be needing surgery, it's not clear yet. He ended up passed out on the ground, and couldn't speak for a while. He has some fractures and though he is up and walking about, there is some very obvious and clear trauma. The police have opened a report too and medical professionals have been clear that this was physical assault.
The day after we took him to A&E, he called his office and asked for 2 days off. He has very obvious and disturbing injuries on his face that can't be ignored.
Given the gravity of his injuries, trauma etc, I was surprised when he was told that because he is on probation for 6 months, he will need to book his sick days as annual leave. Is this common practice?
I find this bizarre, I work in HR myself and feel that these are clearly exceptional circumstances that would warrant annual leave.

I had narrowed down my options to Marketing(as the internships and whatever little experience i have is in this field) and Business Analytics(as I am fond of mathematics and computer science). 

Out of the options available to me, I had never considered finance. Whenever someone asked me, I always just said ""nah its not for me"". But after talking to a lot of people(family, friends and acquaintances), it's been pointed out several times that I have actually never even tried anything in finance. I just have basic knowledge of whatever we've been taught so far.

So I've been feeling like maybe I should just try learning something, to see if I'm interested or good at it. But I have no idea where or how to start.

Although people do shift career paths all the time, I want to figure out my niche/interest so that I can plan accordingly for placements and higher studies(which is a whole other thing im worried out about)
Does anyone have any advice on this?

1f6jl74,Software Development career,"Background: 

I have a Masters degree in Mathematics from a reasonably prestigious (top ten) UK university. Since I graduated, I have been working a job in an unrelated field. I enjoy the work greatly and would like, if possible, to continue with this job. I typically have a lot of free time as the hours are not hugely intensive- I will usually have finished my days work by 3pm, and rarely work weekends.

I have enrolled on Harvards CS50 course and have been working my way through it in my spare time. It’s fun. I have seen that there’s other courses that look like they offer progression and, if you completed all of the CS free online courses offered by Harvard, it looks like you could come close to completing the equivalent of a computer science degree, albeit without formal recognition.

My plan:

I am going to finish CS50 and continue to study other courses once finished. At the same time, I would like to start to build a portfolio. I would like to be in a position to land a remote, part time (with flexible working hours) development job. I don’t know exactly what I’ll want to do within that but I imagine I’ll be able to pin it down a bit more as I study; anyway I’m very open to trying out things and seeing if it works out- I don’t think I’ll be too fussy.

Questions:

What is the best way to build a strong portfolio? Should I just pick projects which interest me and try to make them work? Or is it better to find real ‘clients’ and offer to work at a large discount/for free?

Is it realistic that a masters degree in maths, a handful of online courses and a relatively small portfolio could be enough to land an entry level job? Anything else I need?

Do the kinds of jobs I am looking for actually exist? ie a remote, part time, entry level software development job. People on online forums seem to think so but I have found it difficult to actually find any on job hunting sites- plenty of remote and part time roles but entry level roles are typically neither. Where do I find these roles people are talking about?

Is 12-18 months a realistic timeframe for this? 15-20 hours a week.",greenbeanmachine1,1,1.0,0,1725210709,2024-09-01 17:11:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f6jl74/software_development_career/,9,2024

I’ve worked for this company for almost 4 years and at first it was a blessing. Got to move to a different city (on my own dime but anything was better than pandemic NJ), and I’ve worked my ass off for them. Sacrificed hours or days of vacation, always worked that extra mile for clients, took over a bunch of extra work like training and presenting at conferences, etc. 

Salary hasn’t been great but I got to be promoted basically every year so yay I guess. 

For the last year I’ve been feeling completely drained and depressed from this role. I feel I’m surrounded by immature people that don’t care about the job and now I don’t either anymore. I’ve been working from home the whole time and the thought of opening that damn laptop to answer my clients with a billion questions and problems they mostly cause, on top of keeping high productivity numbers, makes me sick to the point I’d literally hide from it in another room. 

Point is: I’m very much done with it and I’d like to move onto slower/calmer jobs. I don’t know exactly what yet but if I could be laid off I’d have the chance to take a moment to change my past 10 years of doing work that only my makes me suffer.

Is there a way I could address this privately to HR? I’m sure I’m not the first one, but since I’m one of the ones with most tenure and high productivity I thought I could perhaps kindly ask this favor so I don’t have to quit and not receive unemployment.

I’ve bounced around a lot during my career, rarely working for longer than a year at any given place. 

ATM, I work inhouse as a senior designer for a midsized merchandizing company (200-300 employees). I’m very happy with my position, but I have a feeling that I’m never going to be able to break 6 figures here. 

The work culture is stellar and I like my colleagues a lot but we’re all being paid below market rates. 

For now, this job is stable, and I’m able to maintain a very good work life balance. Wondering whether I should leverage this as an opportunity to up-skill and transition into an adjacent position (UX/UI/concept art/AI consulting/arc-vis/industrial design/AI/front-end development/sales/marketing/VR/XR etc.) with higher earning potential (either within my current company or with another company). 

I’ve got an extremely wide set of foundational skills, and I’m confident I could build those out in almost any direction. I just don’t know where to start. 

If anyone has any advice, it’d be very appreciated. 

In summary? I’m looking for a position/field: 
- where 8y experience as an ad/branding designer/art director would be valuable
- with a starting salary of at least 60k with growth opportunities exceeding 100k. 
- with a relatively decent work life balance and moderate stress levels. 
- WFH would be a plus. 

Thanks. I submit myself to the masses for evaluation. ✨ Have at it.

1f6hdkl,To job hop or not to job hop?,"Making this post on a throwaway account since I’m not about to dox myself haha.

Wanted advice about a job I’m being interviewed for and how far along the interview process I should go? I’m really unsure about leaving my current job.

For reference,

* I work for a company that does manufacturing
* I have a degree in engineering and higher education beyond that. I do not have an engineering license.
* I live in Canada
* I live in a city with a relatively low cost of living
* My starting salary was 65k and over a couple of years it’s gone up to 70k (no bonus package). 
* Despite the low cost of living, I still think I’m being underpaid given my credentials
* Lately I’ve felt bored by my job and there aren’t very good signs that I can progress much, either in terms of job title or salary.
* I just had a semi-annual review and was given nothing but good feedback. I made sure to emphasize that I am highly motivated by my salary and the possibility to advance my career, but I’m not sure if this was taken seriously.
* Despite all this, I really enjoy the people I work with and I’m quite comfortable at my current job. The benefits are good (vacation days, RSP, health coverage) and our company campus comes with a lot of perks (gym, infinite free coffee, catering) and my commute is very short (less than 15 mins each way).
* In addition to this, where I currently am, I am about a day’s drive from family so they’re pretty close.

Now for info about the other position: 

I’m interviewing for a job at a much larger company that is located across the country, which would require me to relocate.

The main duties of the job are not exactly a subject I have a ton of experience with, but because of my credentials, I am being treated as a top candidate. My second interview is in the next two weeks so I will get the chance to assess whether it’s a job I really want to go for.

I know there’s a lot more to a job than just salary, but it does matter to me. If I had to guess, this job might offer me up to a 30% raise from where I’m currently sitting due to the industry.

In addition to all this, it would give me the chance to dip my toes into something more technical than what my current role offers which is very appealing to me.

However, the thought of moving across the country to a city I’m unfamiliar with is daunting. I’m single with no kids, so the move would be manageable, but it’s still intimidating. I’ve relocated before, and it was tough. This move would also mean being far from family—so far that I would need to fly to see them.

I would like some advice, how would you handle this situation?

* If I’m invited for an in-person interview, should I go even if I’m unsure about taking the job? How can I keep this trip discreet from my current employer?
* Relocation is a major concern for me—are there any advantages I might be overlooking?

Thanks for any advice you can provide!

1f6gze9,What career to pursue?,"So im feeling a little lost right now. I recently graduated with my BS and im currently applying for PA schools. However, my science gpa is too low for most school, so im taking science classes at cc to boost it up. Based on that knowledge it will be unlikely that i get in this round and will have to wait until next year to apply again. The reason for the title is that i love music. Music has been my whole life since elementary school and over the last 3 years I’ve been learning how to produce, which i enjoy a lot. The reason im pursuing PA is because 1. my parents r basically forcing me and 2. the pay. I know these are not good reasons but i do enjoy the medical field to an extent and i would like the funds to help pursue my music passion. So back to the title, im wondering if there are other careers in the medical field that are not super competitive and that still pay a good amount. Ive heard radiology and xray tech are good but what i enjoy PA is that you can specialize in different things so idk if that applies to those careers too. I would love to go back to school to be a composer but i want to be debt free before i even consider that.

1f6gw71,"I was accused of something I didn’t do, and it’s serious…","The other day I showed up to what I thought was a team meeting with hr. When I arrived, it quickly became apparent that it was just me, my boss, and head of hr. The hr rep preceded to define “harassment” and “sexual harassment” for 5-10 minutes u til I stopped them and said “I know what those things are. Why am I here?” 

I never received a straight answer and (of course) never found out who filed the complaint. It was basically an hour and a half of doublespeak. In the state I live, a new law passed earlier this year, lowering the bar for filing official claims. If a person simply feels uncomfortable or “harassed” it’s regarded as equivalent to actual harassment. I was never warned by any coworker or management before this event about specific behavior that is unwanted. If I were informed, I would absolutely respect that boundary and accommodate my coworker’s preferences. Nope, straight to the head of HR!

I’m happily married and have always been an ally for all humans, regardless of any identifiers they might have. I’m a case worker now but have lived and worked in foreign countries with the poorest and most desperate humans. I’ve dedicated my life to save human life and preserve their dignity. This accusation is shocking, to say the least. 

So, I was accused of sexual harassment and harassment for an unknown reason and now I have a mark on my company record. They also encourage me to change/improve my behavior, but that’s impossible if it can’t be defined. 🤷🏽‍♂️ This is bizarre and I don’t know what to do.

1f6gv3i,I finished a UX design related degree a year ago and I don’t know what to do anymore?,"
Hi I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask but I was wondering if anyone had suggestions on other fields I could pivot too rather than just UX design? I’m a bit anxious and stressed because I’m nearly 25 and can’t start my career and my parents keep pushing me to get a job already and I’m applying for anything, I’m just a casual educator right now which took me months to find. My mum said I should go back to uni and study something else but then I may be in the same situation and more debt.

It’s not my resume or portfolio that’s the problem it’s the lack of entry level jobs and no one’s hiring in my city due to layoffs. I live in the second biggest country in Australia. I’ve had it reviewed by like 10 people here and took on all their feedback, I’ve asked for resume feedback as well and refined that and asked my dad since he was a director of a company. I’ve had a mentor since march and he says there’s jobs when there isn’t any.

Within my degree I had high grades and also had things like web design, data visualisation, product design, UI design, programming (JavaScript) service design. I also contributed to PhD research for VR related work. 

The other day I applied for 5 jobs and one job was posted 3 months ago, there are no jobs going in my city, I feel like I wasted 3 years and I don’t want to go back to study and wasted my 20s studying I just want to start my career but feels impossible. 

I did make it to a final interview out of over 1000 people and made it to the final 5 then they laid off 3,000 workers and said I have great experience but I should do an internship, it was a grad program they had a mentor system as well why do I need an internship before an entry level job.

I’m doing freelancing, I’ve tried cold emailing, networking it’s been over a year the markets really bad. I want to give up I feel so lost I don’t know what to do anymore.

https://www.sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/uc/bachelor-of-design-interaction-design.html

This is my degree if anyone’s wondering 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask just a bit stressed because I’m nearly 25 and can’t get my first job to start my career, is this career even worth it with the layoffs anymore. 

At this rate I’m applying to anything, looking at LinkedIn there’s barely any jobs. It’s been over a year what do I do.

Sorry for the long post and rant I’m just lost and I don’t know what other field I’d want to be in, I’m also applying to graphic design. My mum says I should work in healthcare because the jobs are there but I don’t really want to

I can’t get interviews when there are no jobs I can’t get anything I’m just stuck and times passing and I’m getting older I hate this what other fields can I do with my degree/skills? I don’t want to study again but the market is saturated and bad 

My parents want to kick me out and get my shit together because I’m not getting a job but I’m trying they know the markets bad, my brothers company went from 50 people to 16 in consulting I graduated at a bad time in my country with mass layoffs and cost of living in a saturated market due to boot camps too. 

So nearly 25 and anxious because I can’t find a job and I feel like it’ll be like this forever but I’m actively trying I’m just not getting anywhere due to lack of hiring. My mum said when will the market get better and she has a point 

So spent 3 years getting a degree building and refining a portfolio now no jobs to apply for and wasted 3 years of my life that I’ll never get back leading to regret and anxiety as well as stress  sorry if I sound whiny my brothers have careers and friends while I’m stagnant still living at home  I want to move out and start my life what can I do

What career can I do without going back to study and getting more debt. Am I screwed?

1f6g388,Don't Let Age Hold You Back: Pursue Your Passion at Any Stage!,"I've been seeing lots of posts about people worried about being a certain age when returning to school and I'm here to say: STOP WORRYING!

I try to encourage everyone who posts these by explaining my story but it's a lot! The keys to going back to school later in life are understanding your passions, interests, and the logistics of returning. Age shouldn't be a concern. 

Make sure you're able to support yourself and make sure that you know what you want to do. Reach out for help, be proactive, be disciplined, stay in your lane, be present, be communicative, be friendly! There's so much work involved in going back to school that having hang-ups about your age will bring you down. 

I went back to school at 34 -- being older meant I had the maturity to succeed. There was no way I was going to fail at this age -- I did all the things I needed to pass and I moved on to the next term. I was also the oldest in my internship program! Seriously, I could have been everyone's dad -- but who cares! My internship was incredibly cool and the skills I learned were so valuable. Nobody else in my program had the same experience as I did and had I let my insecurities stop me, I would continue to be stuck. I now see a future for myself and it's all because I showed up and did the work with no hang-ups.

Utilize your resources, reach out to college, speak to advisors, and research careers that align with your passions and interests. Do not let your age hang you up -- you must learn to power through your insecurities and listen to your gut! You have the world at your fingertips -- use those resources to find opportunities for you. Dont try to over-extend yourself either! I went from wanting to be an architect to being scared it was too much for me -- to realize I could be an architectural drafter/designer and skip all those extra years in college and all that state licensing.  

Also, please consider the trades. Lots of apprentice work for union jobs! On the job training that leads to a well-paying career! See what's available in your area!

There might be something out the for you but you'll never know until you look! Good luck to all and please, dont let your age hold you back. Put on those blinders and get to work!

1f6dhcw,In Progress HR Professional: Is Operations a good idea? ,"Hello! Malaysian F24 here, graduated in end 2022, with 1+ years of work experience in recruitment.

For context, I completed a compulsory internship with one of the largest FMCGs in the world, and was offered a 1 year contract as an Associate. Both roles were in Regional Shared Service Sourcing/Talent Acquisition.

Upon completion of the 1 year contract, I looked for a full time job with the following goals in mind
1. Exposure to end-to-end recruitment experience 
2. Not in a Shared Service environment

I attended some interviews, and had 2 offers on hand
1. From a competitor FMCG: HR Executive - Operations). The role manages backend data requests, in a Shared Service environment.
2. From a Big4: Campus Recruiter. This role manages fresh grad/intern recruitment, mass hiring.

I ended up going with the Big 4 offer, because it meets the 2 goals/criteria mentioned above. 

Upon entering the firm, I was assigned the following portfolio
1. +~300 headcount per year, mass hiring, time sensitive
2. Single handedly manage the entire portfolio, across all business units
3. Role also includes project management, campus events and career fairs

Role wise, I think it allows plenty of room for growth/learning. But 4 months into the role, and I feel extremely drained, mentally and emotionally. I work 10-12 hours a day, sometimes on weekends. Apart from the recruitment work, there is also a whole bunch of admin work that takes up a lot of my time. These are the kinds of tasks I end up doing at night, because I need to be calling candidates, screening and reviewing CVs by day. 

I realised mass hiring isn't my thing (It could also just be that this particular portfolio assigned to me was too heavy. The portfolio was supposed to be managed by 2 recruiters, but now it's just me). As a recruiter myself, I know how bad things can look on your CV, if you choose to hop roles after 4 months. 

I thought of looking out, when a friend from one of the FMCGs reached out saying there's a role in Operations. Better pay, better culture, but in Operations.

My Concerns;
1. I've always wanted to ultimately move into a more strategic role, and Talent Acquisition/Recruitment felt like a good foundation to begin.
2. I never saw myself in an ops role (I think I'm too good for ops lol)
3. BUT i thought mass hiring was something I could try, and turns out I don't quite like the idea of churning CVs, without quality. 

Question;
1. Should I keep an open mind and give the ops role a shot? 
2. If my long term career goal is to go into Business Partnering, will a role in ops reduce my chances of doing so?
3. If ops isn't the way to go, what other branch of HR can I look into, that is more strategic?

At this point I feel like I just want to get out of this role, and would want to grab anything available, but I also want to think twice about my next steps.

1f6cr3u,Director Data Science Europe -> next role? ,"Hello everyone! I'm in my early 30s and am the Director of Data Science at an American Fortune 100 (manufacturing) company in Belgium. I lead a team of 10 (Senior) Data Scientists across Europe specializing in building and operationalizing algorithms in a specific business domain (think Media, Manufacturing, Retail, etc.). 

While I've been very lucky to be in the right place at the right time to get to my current role, I have the impression I have reached the ceiling in terms of growth in responsibilities. Put differently, there are not that many VP of Data Science or similar roles in my company/area/industry where you have a chance to lead a team of, say, 50-100 Data Scientists. Therefore, I'm looking for additional perspective on some of the alternative options I have been considering. 

1. Switch to a more tech-focused company where Data Science is the core business (SaaS? CTO at a scale-up?). 
2. Look for another Fortune 100-type of company where there is an EU HQ near my area with more roles available adjacent to Data Science and continue climbing the ladder. 
3. Pivot to consulting, e.g. MBB, Big 4 or a boutique firm (might be a long way to partner, but no ceiling on making partner in Belgium). 
4. Set up my own SaaS/Consulting shop in my niche. 
5. Take a year off to do an (e)MBA, try to get into LBS/Insead and pivot to an alternative domain/industry. 
6. Count my blessings and grind it out for a few more years. :-)

For additional background, I earn around 150K (base + bonus) in my current role and have a STEM PhD. I worked for a start-up SaaS/Consultancy company before joining my current company, where I have been for 5 years. My wife has her own medical practice which generates 300K in turnover. Net, financially we are very fortunate, though because of the medical practice and we plan on having kids soon, we have limited flexibility in terms of location in the short term. 

As for career objectives, I'm looking for a high-impact role in the broader Data & Analytics space, where I have a chance to continuously increase in scope, team size, and responsibilities, ... I enjoy being customer-facing and feeling that the ""sky is the limit"".

Last year I decided to reconvert and pass exams to become a pâtissière/Baker with a main goal of having my own small business, I needed the base level diploma (called a CAP) in order to do this and I decided the best approach was via apprenticeship (so I'd leave with diploma + work exp + connections, and also have a decent salary while doing the course, I make about 1700e/month) I was lucky enough to be accepted by my n1 choice in bakery and last month passed my exams with flying colours. Now I'm at an impass.


Initially I had decided to stay on in my bakery for another year to complete a second diploma (a specialisation in catering, including normal cooking, which would give me a diploma to work with sweets and savory and an extra year experience) however I'm having a lot of issues at work, for a start, I work around 55h a week, my legal limit is supposed to be 48h and I'm also being shorted on pay slightly. 


The main issue is the workplace environment, the reason I work so many hours is because basically everyone else quit, my boss is a nightmare, she's convinced I'm completely incompetent and has a level of micromanaging I've never seen before (I get betlittled, humiliated, yells at etc over things like putting a spoon I'm using on the right of me rather than Infront of me) it's been like this for the whole year, I frequently cry over work and have anxiety every day because I don't know if she'll be in a good mood or not, there is also 0 professional organisation there. The attitude improved a lot over the last couple months which is why I decided to stay (before that I had been counting down the days until my contract was over) but it's rapidly backsliding to how it used to be and I do not think I can handle that for another year. There is a potential that we will get two new workers within the next 3 weeks, if it works out well with them it will solve 70% of my issues (I won't be working in close quarters with my boss, the hours will be less, and normally I'll have 2 days off instead of 1) but I need to make a decision on what I'm doing before I can know what the new people are like, so here are my options: 


1) sign a temporary 3 month contract, do not do the extra specialisation diploma, leave in November and look for a new job (I had a Google and I am finding job offers where I fit the bill and am qualified enough to fill them) 


2) blindly trust that the new employees will be permanent and capable, sign my 2nd year apprenticeship contract and follow through on the specialist diploma, and hope it works out well


I was very concerned about option 1 because I haven't had another boss, I worried it could be even worse in other places but 2 of the coworkers who left reassured me that they've never worked anywhere this bad so even if I end up in what's generally considered a nightmare environment, it'd probably feel like a holiday


I was deadset on option 1, so I told my boss that's the plan, she sent 45mins trying to talk me out of leaving and I told her I'd think about it, two days later was when the new people applied and got the job offers


So what would you do? Stay or go? Or a secret 3rd option I haven't considered?",lucy-kathe,1,1.0,0,1725187230,2024-09-01 10:40:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f6bhic/trying_to_decide_if_i_should_leave_my_job_and_i/,9,2024

1f6aofd,"Job is destroying my health, help me rationally evaluate the risks of quitting outright.","Apologies: This is long. But I’ll try my best to format it reasonably:  
  
My job stress is destroying me and I need to get out. Help me see through the tunnel vision my anxiety is creating so that I can separate the true risks of various options from internalized fear mongering. If you want to just jump to the options scroll past the next 3 paragraphs.   
  
Work situation: Mid-40sF PM in an IT company that's undergone several rounds of layoffs, previously worked at this company in the US and now work at a branch of this company in NZ. A high-performing IC up until this year when my manager left and I was voluntold to take over (I'd managed once before at this company and hated it, but it was impressed upon me that I’d be laid off if I didn’t do this — oh, how I should have taken them up on that). Without getting into details, the situation is crappy because the team I inherited had loads of performance problems, it’s too distributed, and the company has become increasingly demanding. I have been sick to my stomach, literally vomiting at least twice a week, and getting no sleep for months now due to the stress. I am single, childfree, renting alone with no friends in NZ, and with no remaining family as well, so with the crazy hours I work and travel I have to do, I literally have no life and no time to build one. I come home at 7:30 and watch two hours of TV and go to sleep so I can wake up at 5am for early calls and start all over again. My blood pressure has gone up by 10pts and I’ve been needing to take CBD + painkillers to rest. I heard a friend back in the US was getting a dog and I broke down crying because I really want one but can see no future in which I have time for it. 

Why have I stayed? The pay is good, but perhaps the biggest reason is because I want to move back to the US, and this company has always felt like my only real connecting thread back to the US job market (the Oceania scene is…sorely lacking). I was hoping this role would open up an internal transfer opportunity, but I’ve been told they are not doing that right now. My manager himself is a good person and a strong reference I also want to keep, as he has a fair amount of influence in the current company + outside. 

But, I want to just bloody quit. I just want a rest instead of moving from job to job without a break, as I’ve been doing for the past 27 years. I had already wanted to do this when I was back with my LTR partner, until he broke up with me a few days before I was going to ask him about doing it. That was 4 years ago, and I just kept pushing on through my general jadedness. I also am almost 100% certain people management is not from me. I’m an IC leader, not a people manager. I feel I am an illustration of the Peter Principle.  
  
So…here I am, sort of knowing in my gut I need to leave this job, but my mind is spinning and making up reasons why all the options seem bad, essentially keeping me trapped. Can you kind folks please weigh in to affirm or refute any of these? 

**Option 1: Quit without a job lined up.** This one fills me with excitement; maybe I can use it to find a new calling or use this time to sell my personal artwork or build a personal brand. I have enough savings for 1-2 years at my current lifestyle. But why haven’t I pulled the rip cord? Well, my big concerns with this option are (a) that future employers will look down on this and so I might be locked out of the tech industry for a long time/forever, esp. because of my age; (b) quitting with my team in its current state will burn a bridge with influential leaders/reports at my current company; (c) that I rent an apartment, and if my LL decides not to renew my lease or if I want to move, not having a salary will make it impossible for me to secure a new unit; (d) I can’t get a dog if I have no steady income and just generally the COL is getting to me; (e) I am completely alone in NZ and not having a job with even further isolate me (and I’ll lose private healthcare benefits) and sever my connections to the US. I really would love people to weigh in on the reality of (a).  
  
**Option 2: Quiet quit.** My concerns with this option are (a) that it can damage my reputation in the eyes of reports and leaders which then can impact future job opportunities (tech is a small world in terms of who knows who) and (b) I feel that if my team is struggling, I must also have to struggle alongside them. Given the team is distributed, I don’t believe there’s a way I can support their performance management with a quiet-quitting schedule. I don’t think it would be very long until it had a damaging effect on my performance. 

**Option 3: Ask to step back to IC on the same team (and then look for a job).** I feel that this will just come with the stigma that I couldn’t hack it, especially given my age when it seems very expected that you be in management. It would make for a very uncomfortable relationship with my peers who were my reports who were performance managed by me. I also don’t think this is a likely option anyways, given the state of the team when I inherited it, I can’t imagine my manager would find a willing candidate to take over. 

**Option 3: Try to find another internal IC role:** Internal role transfers here are just as much work as applying externally. But I also worry that this option will be impossible/difficult because if my team is poor performing when I leave that will reflect poorly on me, internally people will share more info. 

**Option 4: Find a new job while in current job:** There is absolutely, hands down, no way I can get the time to prepare portfolio materials + interview without also quiet quitting my current position. My headspace is, also, not right — I have gotten bitter about the whole industry because of this job and I don’t want to just roll that over into a new place. I honestly need to get my head clear. And a week's vacation has not been enough. 

**Option 4b: Find a new job in a step-down industry while in current job:** Don’t bother, I’ll just be called “overqualified.” I am hearing this all over rn. 

**Option 4c: Find a new job while in current job but ask for a start date \[n\] months in advance:** OK, someone suggested this to me but, honestly, does anyone truly think this is an option in today’s market? Because I don’t. No company is going to wait 6 months to fill a role when they can hire a desperate laid off person in a day, right? Plus it comes with 

**Option 5: Hang on and give the current role your best until** ***maybe*** **they do another round of layoffs in the new year.** I would, so much, love to be laid off right now. It sounds sick that this is what goes through my head. That said: I honestly, truly, do not know if I’d be targeted AND with the level of stress I am going through, I worry I might even have a heart attack or something before even then…  
  
Any thoughts? Can you tell this has been running through my head every night for the past 8 months…?

1f69vbm,I've fallen out of life for a few years and don't know where to start in my case in IT again. What I need to do?,"Hi. I'm lost and don't know where to start again. I'm from Ukraine and that's why the last few years have been pretty hard. Because of this, everything I started once - I abandoned. I had a severe depression and I simply forgot about my life, forgot about learning and eventually sent some of my knowledge to the trash.

I have knowledge of basic Python syntax, OOP principles, I have micro-badly-pet projects that I did for myself and to simplify my life (autoregistration combiners for 4 different services with bypassing bot activity detection; scripts for data processing; various parsers; checkers; bots and some other things). I have superficial knowledge of html, css (I made simple one-page sites; copied other sites; made a site-panel for working with a database; tried to make PWA and some other things). I have a minimal understanding of php and js (I usually collected the things I need with the help of Google and Ai assistant, so the knowledge is quite superficial). I've also been involved in server, hosting and site administration in general (raising servers, configuring them to work properly, setting up hosting and sites). I worked a little with Google Cloud (mostly with VM) and Google Analytics. 

Question: where should I start my recovery? I am not good at math, biology and physics, but I really like these sciences and would like to try my hand at something that could be related to that and programming... it's not hard for me to understand heavy topics like the same math and I am willing to learn it, but I don't understand my next step and what direction to go after so many years of falling out of life

I am currently thinking about engineering: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering... Car mechanic comes to mind. But the thing is that I haven't decided on anything so I thought seeing a lot of options (fields and jobs) would clear up my mind.


Some things to consider and things to make it easier for you:
I wouldn't like a desk job.
Not interested in medical field (only jobs which sound ok to me in there are physiotherapist and psychologist).
Not interested in Education field.


Any other questions?

1f671te,How do I deal with my boss who makes me hate my job?,"This is going to be long, so I'm sorry.

I (25F) work as the accounting assistant for one of the local school districts.

It's a small school district, so the only people that work in the admin building are the superintendent (40F), the business manager (50M), the superintendent's assistant (60F), and me. 

We'll call the superintendent Nicole.

Nicole just became the Superintendent this past December after the previous one left for a different district. Prior to becoming the superintendent, she was the high school principal. About a month after Nicole became the superintendent, the woman that worked as the accounting assistant for a very long time decided to ""move on to other things"". Then they hired a new accounting assistant, but that girl quit after a few months. From there, they used a staffing agency to hire a temp to fill the role until they found someone.

That someone ended up being me. The business manager is my direct boss, but Nicole is my boss as well since she is my boss's boss. They had the temp stay for 2 weeks after I started to train me, but she didn't really know anything since she wasn't trained very well, so I didn't get much actual training. The work for my role was also extremely behind because the temp had a hard time keeping up. None of this was explained to me during my interview.

So I started my job with no proper training and with a workload that was extremely behind, but I have been able to use my knowledge/experience from my previous job to figure most of it out on my own (asking my boss is useless because he is new too and only started a month before me).

Nicole is genuinely one of the most unpleasant and rude people I've ever dealt with. She's nice to everyone else, but for some reason not to me. I'm a good worker, I'm respectful, I follow the rules, etc. And I've never had a problem where it's common for people to dislike me. I get along with people well. But this woman has me feeling like I have to walk on eggshells everyday.

From my very first day to now, any time I just try to make small talk with her or if I have to ask her a question or basically speak to her at all, she seems extremely annoyed. One time in my first few weeks I accidentally made a mistake on something and she sent me an extremely rude email that made me feel like shit. Then a few weeks ago the business manager came into my office and told me that going forward I should dress a little nicer. I was genuinely confused because the dress code is business casual and I always make sure I follow the code, so I said ""am I breaking the dress code?"" and he said ""Well no, but Nicole likes when people over do it with their outfits and dress nicer than the dress code, so she just wanted me to have a talk with you"".

Now the most recent thing. It's Labor Day weekend here in America, so school districts were closed yesterday (Friday) and are closed on Monday. In the state I live in, everyone goes up north to their cabin for Labor Day weekend, and I'm one of those people. Yesterday morning me, my boyfriend, and his family left for their cabin, which is 4 hours away. A few hours after I got there, I received an extremely rude text from Nicole (that she also put the business manager in) about how I didn't do payroll for the custodians on Tuesday and now none of them were paid and how she made it extremely clear that payroll cannot ever be messed up since the temp always messed it up. 

I replied and told her that I *did* do payroll on Tuesday, so I'm not sure why the custodians didn't receive their pay. She then replied by telling me that I need to call the company of the software we use to do payroll and get it figured out. We are closed for the holiday weekend, I was never informed of being expected to do work on weekends or holidays (and it wasn't in my contract), I am 4 hours away on vacation, and don't have access to my work computer to login, so I didn't respond. 

Then a few hours later, the business manager texted and asked me to come into the office tomorrow (which now today) to get checks sent out since the software didn't send payment out. I replied and told them how I'm up north for the weekend so I'm 4 hours away. Neither of them replied after that. 

I want to find a new job, but I live in a very rural area so finding a job that pays at least decent isn't easy. I'm gonna start job hunting and applying to places, but I'm the meantime, how can I handle dealing with Nicole? She makes me hate working there and makes me feel so shitty about myself.",Impossible_Sun4965,1,1.0,0,1725168400,2024-09-01 05:26:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1f671te/how_do_i_deal_with_my_boss_who_makes_me_hate_my/,9,2024

New established company. Everyone is working there roughly the same amount of time. So say the person hired the longest is there 5 months.

A joke was made and the two people involved (employee & team lead) found it funny and had no issues with each other as they are on friendly terms and get the banter. Someone else in the room was listening to what was said and complained to a manager but added things onto the joke to make it seem worse than it was. The team lead was called into the office and forced to apologise even though the employee it was said to found the joke equally funny and was wondering why the team lead was apologising.
