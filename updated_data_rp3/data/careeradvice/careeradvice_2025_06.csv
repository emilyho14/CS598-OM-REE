1lomqc7,What do I do in this situation?,I interviewed with a company on Friday and received an offer letter today on Monday. The only thing is there is another company i’m interviewing with that I’m more interested in but they want 3 rounds of interviews. Company A that I interviewed with Friday wants an answer by Thursday. I told company A I’m still interviewing with another company and they seemed fine with that but want an answer by Thursday… I told company B I received an offer letter from a different company but I’m REALLY interested in this position and want to pursue this and they said they could try and “ expedite” the interview process? I just don’t know what to do in this situation because I really want the Company B job but don’t want to tell company A no and then not get the company B job and be shit out of luck with no job . I also don’t want to tell company A yes then if company B gives me an offer just up and leave once I started. Any advice? ,DifficultOccasion663,0,0.5,1,1751326331,2025-06-30 23:32:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lomqc7/what_do_i_do_in_this_situation/,6,2025
1lomj5l,Entry-Level Job Offer — Not Sure If I Should Take It or Wait for Something Else?,"Hi everyone, I’m a recent college grad with a degree in Supply Chain Management, and I was recently offered a Logistics Coordinator position. On the surface, it sounded like a good opportunity, but now I’m feeling unsure, and I could use some outside perspective.

Here’s the situation:

•	The role is described as a “startup position,” meaning there isn’t someone currently in the job, no established process, and I’d be responsible for getting things up and running. They said there wouldn’t be a trainer or mentor, I’d basically be figuring things out on my own and reaching out to other locations if needed.
	
•	The interview process felt a bit intense for an entry-level job. I had several rounds with 5 managers in each round, and during a follow-up call, the manager said some people on the team questioned whether I was “intense” enough for the role. He said he needed to be more convinced I was the right fit, which threw me off a bit.
	
•	I verbally accepted the offer, but the official offer letter hasn’t come yet, even though they said they’d send it by a certain time. I haven’t followed up yet, mostly because I’m still thinking everything through.
	
•	The manager seems experienced, but also kind of no-nonsense, and I’m not sure how much support I’d actually get in a role like this.

I don’t mind being challenged and I’m definitely motivated to learn, but since I’m just starting out and don’t have direct logistics experience yet, I’m a little nervous about being dropped into something with no real structure or training.

So I’m wondering:
Is this the kind of opportunity that could help me grow fast, or is it more likely to set me up for frustration or burnout? Would it be a bad move to turn it down and wait for a more guided, traditional entry-level role, even if that means being unemployed a bit longer?

I’d really appreciate any advice or insight from others who’ve been in similar situations. Thanks in advance!

1lolxbf,Should I escalate promotion request or wait? Allegedly budget won't allow any changes until next fiscal year (1 year from now).,"I've been in my current role for about a year and genuinely love it. It's great WLB, good team, and work I find meaningful. However, I'm facing a frustrating situation and could use some outside perspective.

**Background:**

* I took this job one year ago and admittedly didn't negotiate salary (I'm still very annoyed at myself for doing this).
* I'm likely overqualified for the position and have significantly expanded beyond the original job description
* My boss agrees I'm performing well above my level - I just got perfect scores across my entire performance review
* During the performance review I provided a written justification for my promotion and my boss said he ""fully supports"" it

**The Issue:** After my performance review, I followed up about the promotion timeline. My boss's response was basically:

* He's 100% on board and thinks I deserve it
* BUT there's no budget for promotions this fiscal year (which literally just started).
* The earliest opportunity would be during budget planning for FY 26-27 (so potentially another full year from now, when I'm already being told I'm performing beyond my current role).
* Boss mentioned I could reach out to his manager or HR director if I wanted to discuss further

**My Dilemma:** Waiting over a year for recognition when I'm clearly performing above my current level feels ridiculous, especially with perfect performance scores. But I also really like my job, team, and WLB.

The boss explicitly said I could escalate to his manager or HR, which makes me think he might even expect me to. But I'm torn between:

1. Escalating and potentially creating tension, especially when I don't have another offer in hand and don't intend to use that as leverage. 
2. Waiting it out and risking continued undervaluation

**Questions/Comments:**

* Is it worth escalating this? WWYD?
* How common is it for companies to have such rigid budget cycles that high performers can't get promoted outside of specific windows?
* Am I being unreasonable expecting faster movement, or is a year+ wait actually normal?
* I have no desire to look for another role and don't plan to do this.

Any advice from people who've been in similar situations would be really helpful. Thanks!",lifealive5,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1751324174,2025-06-30 22:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lolxbf/should_i_escalate_promotion_request_or_wait/,6,2025

1lolnag,Does anyone else struggle with non-confrontational bosses?,"I’ve been in my current role for three years now, and for the most part, I feel really comfortable with my two direct managers. But lately, I’ve been struggling with their lack of directness and clear communication, especially as I’ve taken on new responsibilities.

When I ask clarifying questions or try to get direction on how to approach a task, I’m often met with no response. Sometimes, I know it’s just because they’re busy, which I completely understand. But other times, it is because they expect me to just figure it out and send it off (confirmed by one of my managers). They’ve mentioned (briefly and in passing) that they want me to work more independently and improve my problem-solving skills.

At the same time, they’ve also told me I should be running things by them more often, since I’m still early in my career and don’t have a lot of experience. That contradiction can be really confusing-I’m being told to take more ownership, but also to check in more frequently. And when I do check in, I often don’t get a response either way.

I’ve asked several times what I can be doing to build more independence or confidence in their eyes, but the answer is always super vague like “you’re doing great!”. Until, out of the blue, I’m told again that I need to be more independent.

It’s been tough to find the right balance between taking initiative and not overstepping. Has anyone else dealt with something like this, or found ways to better navigate a situation like this?",Substantial-Bat-628,1,1.0,0,1751323442,2025-06-30 22:44:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lolnag/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_nonconfrontational/,6,2025
1lolkpe,Is it 'worth-it' to move to this company after 10 years? Got a so-so offer,"**Background**

* **Current job:** Director-level marketer at a profitable, fast-growing, PE-backed company.
   * Ten years tenure, strong comp, historically safe.
   * Recent PE pressure → re-org → my role shifted to an area outside my core expertise. I can do the work, but it’s not my ideal career path.
* **New opportunity:** Local company (40-year history) that’s stagnated for \~8 years and has had several layoffs.
   * Pivoting to a **direct-to-consumer (D2C)** model; I’d own that transformation.
   * Originally recruited for a **VP of Marketing** role—perfect match for my skills.

**The Offer**

|Item|What I Expected|What I Received|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Title**|VP, Digital Marketing|Sr. Director|
|**Base**|Competitive bump|Matches current salary (net ↓ once you factor risk)|
|**Sign-on Bonus**|Make me whole|**but**Matches bonus I’d forfeit,   heavy clawbacks|
|**Negotiation**|Room to discuss|“No” on title, comp, and clawback concerns|

**My Concerns / Red Flags**

1. Title downgrade suggests reduced scope or internal support.
2. Total comp is a double-digit cut when risk-adjusted.
3. Aggressive clawbacks on sign-on and guaranteed bonus.
4. Company has a recent layoff history and is only now cash-positive.
5. Leadership’s unwillingness to negotiate feels like a cultural cue.

**Why I’m Still Tempted**

* D2C pivot is exactly the strategic challenge I want next.
* Chance to build a function from scratch and earn meaningful impact.
* Short commute and local network.

**Ask**

If you were in my shoes, would you:

1. Accept despite the pay cut and title change for the long-term upside?
2. Push back one last time (and risk the offer expiring)?
3. Walk away and stay in my stable role (or keep looking)?

Any firsthand stories about taking (or passing on) similar turnaround roles would be hugely helpful. Thanks in advance!",Leadme67,1,1.0,4,1751323256,2025-06-30 22:40:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lolkpe/is_it_worthit_to_move_to_this_company_after_10/,6,2025

1lojmlo,What to do with my life,"I (27F) seem to change careers every couple of years. I WANT something that a) pays decently b) is sustainable for years, and c) won't require me to break my (already-small) bank going back to school to be qualified.

Here's a general history:


2014-2018: cheese factory, production department
Pros: spending money as a teenager
Reason for leaving: moved out of the country (into the U.S.)

2019-2021: life enrichment assistant at a nursing home
Pros: relationships with seniors, creativity at work, a lot of day-to-day variety but with semi-consistent hours
Reason for leaving: burn-out post-covid (at one point I watched 16 people die in a week; it got to be too much)

2021-2022 school year: junior high/high school teacher at a small Christian school
Pros: not much. I enjoyed learning and teaching itself but had no idea how to run a classroom.
Reason for leaving: the church turned out to be a cult of sorts and they asked way too much from me as an uncertified homeschooled kid who'd never taught before. Plus the school closed down.

2022-2024 school year: junior high history teacher/5th grade teacher at a slightly larger Christian school
Pros: smaller class sizes, a LOT of freedom for creativity in the classroom
Reason for leaving: pay too low to afford my bills, lack of stability (new grade level & curriculum every year), no benefits

2024-present: ophthalmic assistant
Pros: a lot of flexibility/time off. Decent benefits.
I'm making the most per hour BUT haven't worked my full 40 hours the entire time I've been there. It's essentially no better than the school. Plus the drama is insane (I say this as a person who worked with middle schoolers.)

I love writing. I love creativity. I love one-on-one relationship-building. BUT. I need a job that'll pay my bills. Anyone have any recommendations?

Ideally I wouldn’t have to work with the public, or at least limited contact with them. I wouldn’t mind an office job like admin but then I realise how little experience I have with that. I can’t really do an internship/ apprenticeship as I can just about afford rent and other bills with my current job as a full time nursing home carer.

1lojgrv,Unable to pick one? Which one is the smarter move,"Hey everyone, I’m at a bit of a career crossroads and could really use some honest advice.

I currently work as a Manager in Risk Advisory at a Big 6 firm (have around 7 years of experience) and I’ve got two solid offers but and I’m confused about what to choose.

Option 1 is a Manager role at EY in Risk Advisory (IA + SOX). It comes with a 30% hike, good bonuses (25%), and 15–20% annual increments. The team culture, leadership, and work-life balance seem positive from what I’ve heard. Plus, growth is faster, and I could reach Senior Manager in 2–3 years plus also on-site opportunities.

Option 2 is an IA role at an Investment Bank, with a 55% salary hike upfront. But the growth is slower (promotions in 5+ years), bonuses/increments are lower (5-10 %) and I’ve heard the work can get repetitive. That said, work-life balance is much better, and after years of intense hours, that’s really appealing.

EY seems exciting and promising long-term, getting to Manager EY was a dream but the bank role is tempting for the immediate money and better lifestyle.

If anyone’s been in a similar spot or has insights, I’d love your take on maybe I might be missing something.. Long-term growth in Big 4 vs IB internal audit.. Whether higher pay is worth it if growth and excitement slow down.. I just cannot pick one or even know what I want

I'm just not sure what i'm supposed to do now, it feels like any skilled/decent paying job requires 2-4 years of schooling which isn't cheap, and even the path I thought about (business/accounting) seems to have its own troubles with finding entry level work. I don't want to do the college dance again and come out at the end in the same spot i am now but at nearly 30yo instead.

I would do the military/law enforcement route but my medical history would prevent that from happening.

What sucks even more is that this is a job I fought for months to get when I was laid off in early 2024 - now that I have said job, I am way worse off mentally then I was during my job search. I am crying during my work days and I have panic attacks before, during, and after every meeting (does not help I have around 5 meetings a day minimum). 

  
What has been really pushing me over the edge is the passive-aggressiveness from my team members and borderline bullying. I am a quiet, reserved person and I think this has rubbed all of my team members the wrong way since they are all extremely social/outgoing. I am being called out in meetings and berated in front of team members when things happen out of my control. I feel like I am constantly belittled and talked down to because I have a hard time speaking up and when I do, people talk over me. Sometimes I have nothing to add because now I have zero desire to move up or even do well in this job anymore. I have zero interest in my work and I find it hard to even pretend to my coworkers.

2nd interview - June 10: meet the ceo. Seems like a decent guy. Kind of intense/wanna be wolf of Wall Street type. Conversation went well. I’m fully licensed for the business their in and they invite me for a 3rd interview

3rd interview - June 17: He offers me a position. We go over comp and expectations. He is very motivated to get me in. He says an offer letter will be sent (no unfortunately I did not ask more details as far as how it will be sent/when). I was just very excited to be offered that if slipped my mind. We end the meeting agreeing to meet back in person “2 weeks from then” which is tomorrow….

Currently I have not seen an offer letter. I emailed him and asked what was going on/for him to call me. He said he would call. No call. 

I call his office, assistant both times says he is in a meeting and he’ll call back. No call back. I emailed him back, no email response. What could’ve possibly happened from the point of a handshake agreement to now? 

Also my biggest question… do I show up for our originally scheduled meeting tomorrow?

She spent a year studying in Japan as a transfer student, and for the past year, she’s been working as an assistant at the city mayor’s office.

She’s also translated one book and written two of her own, all published with some success. She’s very artistic and paints beautifully too.

So as you can see, she’s quite a versatile person.
She doesn’t want to become a teacher or go further into academic philology. She’s very patriotic and wants to make a real impact on society.

Honestly, I can see her becoming a policymaker.
But what other long-term career paths could make sense for someone like her? And what to do to support that?

1loh7jl,"What do I do!? Leave a stable job for a riskier opportunity with career growth, or stay?","Hey all, I'm in a tough predicament at the moment.

I have been blessed with a job offer that would increase my salary and pay from 350k per year to 475k per year. This new job offer is an offer to be a leader at an organization building out an AI product (fortune 500 company). It's an extremely risky career jump, and there are probably 50% odds of failure here. Though if I succeed for even just a year, the value it will provide to my resume will be HUGE for future job prospects.

  
I currently work at a financial company making a very comfortable pay. But the career growth here is stagnant, but the stress is non-existent. I've amassed enough of an emergency fund to cover my families life expenses for almost 3 years at this point, so I should theoretically have enough of a net to take a risk like this. Though given my Wife is a stay at home mom and we have 2 children, this sort of ""bet on myself"" is terrifying.

Has anyone made this sort of risk/bet on themselves? I know I'm in a very lucky situation either way. I'm just torn on whats the right path to take here.

1lofbai,"Last year my coworkers all got the same % raise and I didn't, should I bring it up if it happens again?","Purposely vague so my coworkers won't find this obvs. I work in Chicago at a large marketing firm. Last year, we all got raises and mine was 4% less than my other coworkers. It is still a great raise for the industry, but it has me worried about my performance or how I am valued at the company. I had my yearly evaluation that year, and received all great feedback and was told that I had no points to improve upon. I am definitely not complaining about the raise I received, but I am just worried about the implications of getting less than the other coworkers at my same experience level. I have more experience than some of my coworkers, but less than others. I was the only one to get the lower raise. 

My supervisor isn't the most approachable and I am kind of afraid to bring it up to her. Raises are coming again soon this year, and I again had no issues come up in my performance evaluation. Should I bring it up if it happens again? Or assume it has something to do with evening out all of our salaries? Some other important background info is that I had transferred from Michigan with a higher salary. Though Chicago is arguably more expensive than where I transferred from, I know I was making more than a few other coworkers. Granted I have more experience, but I could see the difference in raises as a way to balance out our salaries? But then I think maybe not since other coworkers making more than me also got that high raise. (we all speak pretty candidly about our salaries/raises)

ANYWAY if it happens again should I ball up and ask about it? Or should I just leave it and be grateful to be getting a raise that is higher than standard. Thanks!!

1lof2zt,"I feel completely useless at work, and I don’t know if the good pay is worth it.","I was hired for one role, but partway through my (very limited) training, they pulled me out and stuck me in a different position. Now I mostly just scan papers and answer phones. I don’t get emails. No one gives me tasks or checks in. I sit at a tiny desk next to the copy machine while everyone else around me seems busy and important. I feel invisible.

I heard through office gossip that they thought I wasn’t picking things up fast enough but how could I? My training was only half days, and some days the person training me wasn’t even there. No one ever spoke to me about it, just quietly moved me out.

It’s hard to care when there’s so much obvious nepotism family members of managers have jobs here, and someone just showed up one day without even having an interview. Another employee comes in late every day, and no one bats an eye. Meanwhile, I sit here trying not to take up space, trying not to be a problem.

I want to help. I want to do more. But I also don’t want to lose this job. The pay and benefits are great. It’s stable. And part of me feels like maybe I should just be grateful to have a job at all. But at the same time, it’s really getting to me. I go home feeling small. Like a joke. Like I’m wasting my life sitting at a desk, doing nothing, while everyone else works around me.

I’ve made mistakes in the past burnout at another job led to poor performance, and I was fired. I’m scared that somehow that reputation followed me here. But I’m different now. I *want* to do better. I just don’t know how to prove myself when no one’s even looking.

* Mechanical Engineer 1, also 5 YOE
* Mechanical Engineer 1, 1 YOE
* Mechanical Engineer 1, 2 YOE
* Mechanical Engineering Manager, 7 YOE

Our company had a massive layoff last week (25%). The only ones remaining are Me, the 1 YOE and the 2 YOE level 1s. Our company has level 1, level 2, level 3 and senior. I started my job here at level 1 and was promoted through all the ranks.

My manager announced that the 2 remaining engineers will report directly to the director of engineering now, and that there will be no manager for the mechanical department in the near future.

I was told that I personally will report to the operations manager.

I am very worried for the remaining 2 mechanical engineers, as the director is not a very ""technical"" person, but the job is heavy design and R&D based. These are things that I have many years of experience with but the director will not be able to offer any real guidance on.

I have no idea why they did not ask me if I wanted to take a leadership position for the 2 remaining ME's. They have both expressed privately to me how upset they are at this decision, and I am concerned they are going to leave if they don't have a professional mentor to help them. Should I suggest this?

The newer position is located in the city so public transit is an option.

The whole reason I’m even considering leaving is because the newer job is centered more in my preferred career field (Electrical Engineering) and I feel I will learn A LOT here. I’m currently an industrial maintenance technician working on CNC machines and at the new company I’d be a controls technician so I’d specially specifically on PLCs and the electrical aspect of the machines.

I'm looking for sincere guidance from those with experience in public sector careers—especially in environmental compliance, public health, or water resources. I’ve spent the last several years building a career I believed in. I worked my way up through multiple government positions, including as an Environmental Science Specialist and later as an Environmental Compliance Supervisor for a city agency. I’ve earned an MPH, pursued professional certifications (like CAPM and wastewater operator licenses), and remained dedicated to public service and environmental protection.

However, I was recently released during the probationary period from a city position. It was a painful experience—one that left me questioning my career path, my worth, and the value of everything I’ve built. Despite my qualifications, it feels like this one misstep has overshadowed years of positive impact, promotions, and dedication.

Since then, I’ve applied for dozens of roles—many of which I’m qualified for—but haven’t landed anything yet. I wonder if this probationary release is hurting my chances, or if I need to radically rethink my path.

Here are some things I’m currently grappling with:

* Is it possible to rebound into a public sector role after a probationary release? Have others here done it?
* Should I keep applying to government jobs, or pivot into private sector or nonprofit work?
* How do I talk about this career setback in interviews or applications without tanking my chances?
* Are there lesser-known environmental or public health career paths worth exploring with my background?

Hi all, I'm seeking advice on how to get through my internship. I am under a contract by my university to complete this 6 month internship in order to get my degree, and my internship is a stipend pay, giving me $400 per month.

I'm in a small company that has a hybrid schedule. Monday - Fridays are online. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday are in person. For the first month I had a manager who would guide the interns on what tasks to do, then they got fired. They were replaced by a new person who doesn't exactly guide the new interns, other people in the team would guide the interns since that manager got fired. At first adjusting was rough as I had to take more independence with my tasks. However I could go online as many of my tasks were online. Now that has changed and my new managers want me in person Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday which I have no problem with but the thing is my managers sometimes aren't there when the interns (me) are in office which makes things harder as I communicate with them using Slack. And I am receiving tasks that's the other interns role which is why I am supposed to be present in person, especially on days when they aren't here. I hate going to my internship in person I feel like this company is so disorganized when it comes to their interns, amd I hate the fact that I have to do the other interns tasks too that's the only reason I'm in office. I don't know how normal this is and yeah maybe I should just deal with it for 3 more months because maybe this is what the workforce looks like in real life, but I hate going to work Tuesday.

1lobvmj,Should I transition from software development to construction?,"I am considering switching careers from Software Developer to doing construction or perhaps being an electrician.

I'm 30 years old, no debt other than a mortgage (payment about $1,500 / month). I make about $90k / year working for a local government. I used to work remotely, but after four years started to feel that it [kinda sucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/qqlhoo/unpopular_opinion_working_from_home_sucks/). The area I live in is rural and more blue collar, and I don't want to leave, so going somewhere else to get a better paying on-site job is simply not what I'm looking for.

The other thing is that I have struggled with IBS since my mid-20s. I'm sure, exacerbated because of four years of WFH, 6 years of desk work, a global pandemic, etc. My IBS has actually gotten better since not doing WFH and having a routine of strength training, but it still affects quality of life. With regard to IBS, I could do better at sleep hygiene, but 90% of the time I get at least 7 hours of sleep.

I'm considering a career switch because a) I like working outside, b) I like working with my body, and c) I feel that the two preceding factors could improve my IBS, and thus my overall quality of life, and d) software engineering / development [kinda sucks](https://youtu.be/58PeQZsZYYg?si=luHTIa7lqGid8SpD).

On that last point, let me clarify that I do like coding and I didn't get into this field all or even mostly for the money (obviously, I could push myself to make a lot more in tech). But, it has been slowly sucking my soul to be at a desk for 5+ years now and engaging in the tedium of day to day software development activities, not to mention my mind slowly ossifying from the constant churn of information and change... I could go on... also, yes, I have a treadmill, standing desk, all the works, I've invested thousands of dollars into an ergonomic setup.

I get that the grass is always greener on the other side. All the posts I see about this sort of thing are people in the trades saying ""don't do it man, I'd kill for your salary / benefits / flexibility / etc."" I've actually worked in construction before, and I do know what it is like to have your knees totally shot (I did tile for a while) or to feel completely exhausted from a long day of back breaking / stressful work (digging footings or doing drywall or painting a house until 2 AM to make sure it gets done on time) but I honestly feel the physical component of a manual job (with its pros and cons) is preferable to the continual mental drain I find in a desk / white collar job. I'd hope that with a career change like this, I could transition to a management role in 10 or so years and thus limit the physically taxing aspects of being a laborer as I get older.

I'm curious to see what others think.",cdr98,1,1.0,0,1751300522,2025-06-30 16:22:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lobvmj/should_i_transition_from_software_development_to/,6,2025
1lobo6q,How to deal with an Umbridge,"My company got a new CEO last year, and the changes have been trickling down the organization. Our LOB merged with another one last fall and the new EVP is classic bad management. At the beginning of the year, we got a new SVP, who I barely know. She has had other priorities, and conflict of interest restrictions, and knows little about the structure of our team. The last 8 months have been pretty bad, but we had a good VP who buffered a lot of the chaos. About 6 weeks ago though he was let go. Probably for advocating for his staff. 

There are 3 Directors in our department, myself, ""Susan"" and ""Jeremy"". Susan is the best co-worker a person could want. Jeremy makes everything difficult and we have had a lot of friction over the years.

When our VP was was let go, we were in the middle of a couple projects that were not going well. The SVP brought in a consultant to act as ""support' for those projects. Let's call her Dolores. She talked a lot about how she wanted to help, tried to make a lot of peppy small talk but just handled things however she wanted. I don't know if our SVP told her she could do whatever she wanted, or if she just made that decision. Dolores decided Jeremy was her go-to person, which Jeremy took advantage of. They worked around my team, re-invented the process, didn't communicate to us at all.  This is after years of Jeremy consistently preaching about the importance of sticking to our roles/process and the importance of ""over-communication"". When I asked him about it, he claimed he was just doing what he was asked. This lead to duplicated activities, my team not knowing their roles, and his team being over-worked since they were doing both teams jobs. Susan's team was also entirely cut out in favor of more consultants that were brought into the project that Dolores had worked with previously.

Near the end of the process, I had a call with both Dolores and Jeremy about the end of the process where I outlined my concerns. I was caught off guard by how blatantly dismissive and passive-aggressive Dolores was, basically saying she didn't see how my team contributed any value. Expect obviously we do because Jeremy's team was doing our job. But that project wrapped up and we didn't hear from her for a few weeks.

This morning we got an email that Dolores will be brought in for interim leadership support and we have a call tomorrow with all of us. My question is how to approach the call tomorrow, and general tips on how to handle this personality type? My initial thought is to just ask for clarification on what our approach will be, suggesting that since we have a strong process, that we stick to it and that any changes are agreed to and communicated clearly. But I am not sure if there is a better way. I am really good at my job, but am not inclined to play these types of ""positioning"" games that now seem to be the norm, especially with someone who has clearly decided I'm not valuable, so open to suggestions to protect my team, and honestly, Jeremy's too.

1lobc18,Potential Career Pivots for a disillusioned/bored Biology B.S.,"Hi all,

I graduated with a B.S. degree in ecology/evolutionary biology in 2023 and I am currently located in the United States.  I didn't really think about my choice of major as much as I should have, since while I find the area interesting, I don't want to work in the careers involved.  My first job out of school was working as a standardized test grader seasonally, then after a lot of applying I was able to find work as a research tech in an academic lab studying immunology, so not quite my original field of study.  However, I don't enjoy this at all. I find microbiology conceptually pretty boring, and on top of that, I just don't enjoy the day-to-day work.  In fact, I had a better time grading tests.  (Learning how to apply a rubric and assessing each individual response was satisfying, and I enjoyed the part of the job that involved discussing how to grade certain responses.  It often felt like ""citing precedent"" from certain examples given by the test makers and I enjoyed having to use that sort of reasoning.)  I've come to realize I work best with tasks with clear goals/endpoints and opportunities to do some creative planning.  I find the process of research very nebulous and I never really feel satisfied completing my work.  Meanwhile, I am very excited to assist in moving the lab to a new location!  Our current lab space is disorganized, so I have a variety of plans for how we can keep better track of everything once we're starting in the new space.  Planning where everything will go and thinking about how to store boxes of supplies to fit the smallest area both are very enjoyable to me.  I also enjoy the process of making sure the lab is up to date with supplies and keeping our drawers stocked up with what we need.  Really, I like most parts of my job that aren't actually ""Doing Science"" - I hate the wet lab work and analysis, but I love designing powerpoints. I don't enjoy working in academia, and as I live in the U.S., it's not really a good time to pursue jobs in it regardless, even if I wanted to.  I hope I don't sound like I'm only interested in, like, basic lab management tasks - I think more open-ended planning is also very compelling, and I've been curious about journalism or photography.  My main issue here is that I am ignorant about what possibilities are in front of me given my previous education and experience, and I'm wondering if anyone was ever in a similar boat? I'm open to a lot of suggestions, as I feel like I could be happy with a variety of different jobs, I just need to know what's out there.",porygonsnooze,1,1.0,2,1751299267,2025-06-30 16:01:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lobc18/potential_career_pivots_for_a_disillusionedbored/,6,2025
1lob05d,"Lost in my IT career path — feeling stuck, unmotivated, and unsure what to do next","Hey everyone,

I don’t usually post stuff like this, but I’ve reached a point where I just need to talk to someone who gets it. Maybe someone who’s been through the same thing or is going through it right now.

I graduated with a degree in Information Technology about 2 years ago. Ever since then, I’ve been trying to find my way into the field — applying to jobs here and there, getting motivated for a while, and then getting discouraged again.

A few times, I’ve landed interviews. Some even felt like they went really well… but I still didn’t get the job. And after every rejection, it just chips away at my confidence. I start feeling like I’m not good enough, not prepared enough, and eventually, I stop applying for months. Then the cycle starts all over again.

When I look at job listings now, I feel overwhelmed — everything seems to require experience I don’t have. It’s like this weird loop: You need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about doing a Master’s in Cybersecurity. I’m passionate about the field and I feel like it might give me a clean slate. But it’s a big commitment — two more years, lots of money, and no guarantee that it’ll fix the problem. On the flip side, I’ve thought about certifications, or even finding a mentor, but those paths also have their challenges (especially financially, and with the fear of failing expensive exams).

I’m at that stage where I just feel stuck. Like I’m watching my peers move forward while I’m frozen in place. And it hurts, honestly.

If anyone has been through this — or even part of it — how did you push through? Did you go for a Master’s? Did certifications help you land your first job? How did you deal with the constant self-doubt and fear?

Any advice, support, or even just a kind word would really mean a lot right now. I’m trying to keep my head up, but it’s been tough.

Thanks for reading this far. Truly.

1loaks4,"I think my manager has mistreated me, how do I air my grievances?","I have an upcoming end of year interview with my manager and I have two major grievances to air. I’m supposed to have a catch-up meeting with him every two weeks but that hasn’t happened for months, so I feel like if I don’t stand up for myself now I won’t get the chance.

The first thing I want to address is my hiring process and position within the company (let’s say Company X). I was hired a year ago after the manager contacted me directly once he saw on LinkedIn that I was applying for positions in one of the cities Company X operates. I had previously worked for Company X, so he got in touch to ask if I would like to come back to a more senior role. 
I interviewed, met with the CEO, and was given a contract by HR. HR had massively delayed the contract, so when I received it there was pressure to sign. 
The contract was labelled for the role I previously had at Company X, not the new senior role I was offered. When I asked HR about it, they told me (not in writing, over Zoom) that that was just a technicality because the first few months would be training me for the senior role. I, stupidly, signed the contract, and I have never been given that senior role my manager offered me. When I’ve asked him about it, he’s told me that he’s put me forward for a promotion but HR are reluctant to give promotions.

The second thing I want to address is that a month ago, I received a text from my manager at 9:30pm at night to tell me that the next morning at 7am (my usual start time), I would be working as a kind of sit-in consultant for another company in our building (Company Y) for the rest of the week, and I would do it one week each month going forward. This is as unusual as it sounds, it is not something anyone on our team does or has done for about a decade. This is a company we work with (among hundreds of others) and provide material for, and it’s a company with a terrible reputation. They are not a company I would apply for a job with. 
I was told that senior executives had messed up the contract with Company Y, and now owed them hours of exclusive work, and I was to fulfil that work. I did as I was told, and everyone at Company Y was confused as to why I was there in the morning. My manager came by my new desk in this new office at about midday (I had been working for 5 hours) and was all cheery about it. When I asked if we could have a meeting to discuss what the hell was going on, he eventually agreed. 
That meeting was very strange, with him just explaining the messed up contract and never acknowledging that I was essentially being offered as a human sacrifice because the higher-ups didn’t know what they were doing. When I suggested that it was poor practice to tell me that a quarter of my job was changing at 9:30pm via text when I start at 7am he became insolent and told me that I should be grateful he didn’t text me at 7am.

I think this was incredibly unprofessional, and it’s created a hostile atmosphere in the office. My three other colleagues were all told that they had to do this sit-in consultant work at Company Y separately, so none of us have had the chance to push back against it as a group. They hate it as much as I do.

How can I address all of this in my meeting with him? I don’t want to sound like a tantrum-throwing child but I think I’m being mistreated.",Hopeful-Tooth67,1,1.0,0,1751297531,2025-06-30 15:32:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1loaks4/i_think_my_manager_has_mistreated_me_how_do_i_air/,6,2025

We are coming up on 12 months in September and the company knows I am back and could return to the office if I wanted to, even before the 18 months is up.

1loa53s,Career Advice on going back to school for Accounting,"I currently have a degree in Professional Studies- yes a worthless degree. It was supposed to be something in English (yeah also not very lucrative) but I wasn’t able to complete the final two classes because of time constraints that my university refused to work with. So they made me switch my major.


I really didn’t want to join a career in medicine or law or anything because the work hours would’ve been too much and I coach figure skating on the side. That’s my first love and I need a job that lets me punch in and punch out on time (like my current one) so that I can be at the rink. I’m at the rink five days a week from about 5-8pm.


The thing is that I’m really smart, and I don’t mean to sound like a snob or brat, but I’m smart. AP classes in high school, high ACT, and straight As through HS and college. And right now I work at a health insurance company pretty much processing claims and managing a provider database for only 40k a year but two of my coworkers and even my supervisor asked me if I’m going to resume my education and that I should, or apply for a higher position that is more challenging for me. Because my job is super easy for me but the people in my department find it difficult. I know I could do another degree, I’m smart enough. 



So I am thinking of going back to school for accounting or something in finance.



In high school and college, I always found mathematics fun and easy and I was really good with numbers but more so calculous and trigonometry. Accounting was not my strong suit but perhaps I just didn’t try hard enough.


It is my hope that an accounting or finance job in an office would be similar to the one I have now in terms of hours spare for maybe tax season. 


I am just looking for advice on if there are decent universities where I can obtain an ONLINE accounting degree without totally breaking my bank account and without it taking four years. I am fine with more loans just not a lot. I’m already in about 45k in debt from my useless degree but my mom thinks it is worth it to go back to school for a better job that’ll make me double what I make now.


Online is the only option. I cannot and will not move, nor quit my current jobs. 


Any advice or college recommendations appreciated. ",jiminjimintoes,1,1.0,1,1751296511,2025-06-30 15:15:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1loa53s/career_advice_on_going_back_to_school_for/,6,2025

I accept that I couldn’t wrap up work, but I would have appreciated a warning or clearer communication about performance expectations instead of just jumping to the PIP. 
He also mentioned that “I’m in his doghouse” and have to login early than usual to earn his trust back and should work on all projects that others usually avoid. I felt so bad and awful listening to this! 
  
Was I supposed to guess things would go this far, considering I had a very good relationship with my manager?

Is it unreasonable for me to feel like this could’ve been handled better?

1lo7fv5,"Promotion tease, team layoffs, and no clear answers","Hope everyone’s having a good start to their week. I’m feeling a mix of frustration, stress, confusion, and maybe even a little burnout with what’s been happening at my job.

For months now, my manager has been sharing training material with me that’s clearly for management roles. No regular 1:1s though. Then I noticed a change in my job title being processed (not completed), and naturally, I assumed I was being considered for a promotion. I wasn’t told anything directly, but everything pointed in that direction. I was hopeful, even excited.

Fast forward to now, and it turns out the big secret and silence across the team wasn’t about promotions, it was because half of the team is being laid off. I’m not on that list, thankfully. But also… there’s no promotion. Nothing. Radio silence from my manager.

I feel completely blindsided. It honestly feels like I was misled or strung along to stay motivated while they figured out who they were letting go. My manager’s manager even reached out recently, but only to ask vague questions about how I was doing and my personal life, it felt fake and performative. I didn’t share much because I didn’t trust it.

So now I’m sitting here wondering… what the hell just happened? Was I ever actually being considered for a promotion, or was that just a tactic to keep me around during chaos?",pinkmor,1,1.0,2,1751289870,2025-06-30 13:24:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lo7fv5/promotion_tease_team_layoffs_and_no_clear_answers/,6,2025
1lo7fk0,I don't know if I'm ready to my first job (HR) . Personal experiences or advices?,"
Hi everyone!

I'm a guy from Spain (will move to Poland quite soon) currently finishing my Master’s degree in Human Resources Management. I studied Psychology and have some additional training in tools like Power BI, a bit of AI applied to HR, and Cegid, though I’d say my knowledge in these areas is still quite basic.

So far, I’ve done internships in two companies, the most well-known being IKEA, where I’m currently interning.

I’m writing this because, even after a couple of weeks at IKEA (and more time in my previous internship, which mainly involved CV screening and conducting interviews), I still feel like I don’t know enough to step into a “real” HR job. Here, I’ve been doing onboarding tasks, contract processes, and other activities that are clearly HR-related, but the truth is that I don’t fully understand them. I feel like I’m just following instructions without really grasping the bigger picture behind what I’m doing.

As I get closer to entering the job market and taking on real responsibilities, I’m honestly a bit worried. I’ve been exposed to many tasks, but haven’t gone in-depth into any of them, and I’m afraid I won’t be fully prepared when I land my first job.

So, I wanted to ask: Is this feeling normal?
If you’ve been through a similar phase, I’d really appreciate it if you could share your experience or give me any advice. It would mean a lot.

Thanks in advance!

1lo6eln,Graduate Auditor in Sydney - Seeking Advice on Dealing with New Management and Navigating the Corporate Life,"Hi everyone,

I’m new to Sydney and just started my career as a graduate auditor after moving over from New Zealand. So far, I’ve really loved my company—the culture is great, my original team was supportive, and I was excited about growing here.

But recently, things have changed.

A merger took place, and a firm has been integrated into ours. Unfortunately, the partner and director from that firm have brought in a very different and toxic style of management. They abuse their power towards us graduates they just don’t acknowledge us in the room and have strict rules, including banning working from home, which was previously encouraged by previous manager/partner work from home can allow up to 2 days per week. 

Before the merger, I was working under a great manager who supported and mentored me, but now that manager is leaving, and I’ve been reallocated to this new team led by the people from the merged firm.

As a graduate, I’m feeling quite powerless and unsure of what to do.
A little side note I have talked to my manager about my concerns and he has mentioned this is not the first time that the issue was brought up.

I’d really appreciate any advice from others working in Sydney or in similar roles:

- How do you protect your wellbeing in this kind of environment?
- Is this power dynamic common in corporate Sydney?
- What can I do as a grad without risking burning bridges or looking unprofessional?

I want to stay and grow here because I think my firm has a lot of potential to grow in the future but I’m also not sure how to navigate the situation as the power shift feels uncomfortable and unfair.

1lo5hh5,Informational Interviews are more powerful for your job search than a job interview.,"**Stop chasing job interviews. Start having informational interviews.**

If you're applying non-stop and hearing nothing, the problem isn't you — it's the process.

❌ Cold applications feel productive but go nowhere.  
✅ Informational interviews open real doors.

Instead of competing with 500 applicants, talk to someone already doing the job you want.  
Learn how they got there.  
What skills actually matter.  
And how you can follow a smarter path.

I just published a practical guide on how to do exactly that:

🔹 How to find the right people  
🔹 What to say when you reach out  
🔹 What questions lead to real insight  
🔹 How to turn one conversation into mentorship  
🔹 And how to use what you learn to land the *right* job

1lo5cf2,What shoul I do?,"
Hi everyone,
I’m 21 years old and I finished two years of med school in Saudi Arabia. Although I’m good at it, I honestly dislike most of the material and I don’t want to become a doctor just for the profession itself. The main reasons I’m considering staying are job security, stable income, and possibly using the medical degree later to build a healthcare-related business.

On the other hand, I’m thinking about switching now to Industrial Engineering. It’s more math-heavy, which I enjoy, and it feels more flexible — giving me space to explore business, tech, content creation, or paths that fit my personality better. 

How do you balance passion vs. security? Would love to hear your experiences or advice.

If you were in my shoes, would you stay in medicine for financial security and switch later — or make the leap now into something broader like IE (engineering + business) for the sake of flexibility and exploration?

Truth is, I’m not okay with it, but I felt pressured to agree just to not ruin my chances. This is probably the only interview I’ve even gotten so far, so I didn’t want to seem picky or entitled.

1lo4q5a,Career Advice - Should I quit my job with no backup plan?,"Hi, I got placed last August, and I was one of the first few to get placed in my college. I majored in Computer Science and have a 8.8+ CGPA. In our placement prep course, we were taught to not be picky and say yes to everything we're asked in the interview, which in hindsight, was obviously bad advice for a student, and was only good for the college rep.

Since it was one of the first few companies, I wasn't entirely serious and just wanted to experience the rounds and interview. Me and many others chose the role of 'Application Engineer' in the form assuming that it was something like a software engineer, but I was wrong. I got through to the interview, where I was asked if I was ok with a role that didn't have much coding and if i was ok with shifts. I was still not giving the interview with the intention of securing the job, I just wanted to experience a tech interview. I assumed not much coding would mean a role like a 'Solutions Architect' or something and said I had no problem.

Long story short, I somehow got through even though I didn't answer well on most questions, and I tried telling my placement in-charge that I wasn't keen on the role, but they didn't care, we were asked to sign our offer letters as soon as the results were announced. I should've been more assertive. I regret that now. Also, in my college, once you get an offer you aren't allowed to sit for any other companies after that.

Cut to the present, I've been interning since Jan in this company, and my role is a glorified support role. We just have to monitor things, automate things like file transfer and troubleshoot issues (or mostly escalate them to other teams). My timings are 11:30 AM to 8:30 PM, but on the 3 days I physically have to go to the office, cause of travel i'm out at 10 AM and back by 10 PM.

I've been unhappy with my role and don't feel any sense of purpose. It's also annoying to always have to be in front of your screen in case an issue pops up, and not have a fixed lunch time (the team is kinda understaffed so if others are on break someone has to be there manning the station). I started to be envious of the other interns in analyst/developer roles cause at least their roles were related to our degree.

After the 2 month mark I was really sad about it all and I was contemplating leaving right then. My manager was also being really passive-aggressive and condescending which was bothering me, but since there weren't many fresher job openings at the time I thought I'd just push myself and finish the internship. I even asked my manager for some web dev projects for our team and i've been working on them on the side, so that my time here wouldn't be entirely pointless from my career trajectory's point of view. I really regretted not putting my foot down and rejecting the job offer when i could. If i had, I could've gotten a better role since so many companies were coming in.

My internship ends in a month and I'm dreading the uncertainty that'll follow once I leave and reject the full time offer. I feel like staying is not an option since I have little to no free time and I have to catch up with DSA from scratch so it'll take time. Also, i'll be asked to work the night shift or morning shift in the upcoming months if i do stay. Ik the job market is awful rn, but it's not like I'd be in a bad place financially or anything. Even though the package offered is really good for a fresher what's the point if my heart's not in it.

1lo4fjq,Advice for an italian Law graduate in crisis who wants to change career path?,"Hello everyone, I graduated in Law with a master's degree in 2022, I tried to do legal practice a couple of times and in both cases I gave up. I worked as a financial consultant for two years, but beyond the benefits of working for a parastatal company, it was an annihilating job. In fact, it led me to resign because it was governed by coldness, unscrupulousness, capitalism, profit, inhumanity.

Today I have lost my compass a bit, the only thing I know for sure is that I am looking for a job that gives me satisfaction, recognition, that allows me to help others or in any case to improve their life/condition in some way. However, I believe that this is a tension present in most jobs, so it is not of much help to me.

I recently discovered an interest in producing artisanal, quality ice cream, but I don't see any particular opportunities, given the enormous amount of money needed to open something on my own (which I don't have). I don't think I'd like working for an ice cream shop as an employee any more than I'd like working as a clerk in any other business, given that my passion lies mainly in the production, creation of the recipe, and choice of quality ingredients on my part (which I wouldn't have, but would limit myself to making cones and cups).

I'll end (and apologize for the length) by pointing out a huge difficulty in resuming my studies after university (for reasons I won't explain). Which makes everything more difficult, considering that with my educational background, there is hardly a career path that is free or almost free from heavy studying.

In light of all of the above, I kindly ask you if you have any advice or experience to share with me that could help me get out of this block. I am literally open to everything, from moving to Switzerland to do entry-level jobs, to enrolling in a master's degree in human resources management (with all the reservations about studying), to starting the path to becoming a teacher (extremely hard to become one in Italy).

* Friendly environment, and I see potential for growth

Each job offers something different — stability, money, or passion. I’m just not sure which trade-off is worth it in the long run.

**What would you do if you were in my situation?**  
Would love to hear your honest advice. Thanks in advance!

1lo317y,Completely disengaged from my job. How do I cope?,"I've not really used reddit before so I hope this actually ends up in the right place. I am so completely done with my job. I'm disengaged, passive, bored, out of touch, and I have grown to basically hate what I do and the environment I have to do it in. My job is like a repetitive merry-go-round, I do the EXACT same thing the EXACT same way Monday to Friday with little to no variation in what I do. (I write property listings for a holiday company in the UK). I understand most jobs are basically a set of tasks you do all week but this job just gives you 1 task then dials the repetitiveness up to 100. Even when I worked in retail there was SOME variation, tills, stocking, unpacking an order but the variation here is zero. 

Another thing is that my whole department are kind of a bunch of softies, no one can handle the lightest joke. I make a lot of jokes, I do tone them down at work, but if I don't laugh I'll cry. Here's a prime example, I once referred to myself as ""feeling extra Tory"" because I got a sparkling water with my meal deal. This got a couple of laughing reactions in the group chat but then I get a private message from my manager saying we can't say things like that... HOW IS THAT NOT RIDICULOUS!?

Team meetings, we have 2 a week in our team with us 5 Content Writers and our manager. They're like being in a primary school. ""What's your score out of 10 today?"", ""Give a shout out to someone else for their work"". I'm sure this is well intended but it's like being drowned in sugar. I'm also a grown man, I just want to keep my head down and crack on. We also get asked ""what can you work on this week"", but I'm so done i just keep recycling things and I truly don't think anyone cares. 

I am looking for a new job but it's brutal, looking for a full-time job is a full-time job. I'm getting desperate though, I'd take anything to leave. I'm just wondering what others would do? And if anyone understands even part of what I've said then maybe you have some ways of coping? I don't want to sound pathetic or ungrateful, I remember how pleased I was when I got this job but I'd never done anything like this or worked in an office and the whole thing has just worn me right down.

I am no stranger to the occasional long day or strange hours, but I feel this place is wearing me down. A few months ago, I was told that I needed to meet with the crane operators at 3:00am every morning. I am the resident crane expert on site, so it made sense, but I did not expect it to alter my mental state so much.

I just feel so depressed and exhausted recently. When I spoke to my supervisor about the effect this shift was having on me, I was told very plainly, that I’ll need to do this shift at least until the end of 2025.

1lo2dyy,25M - Got stuck in medical billing - Need advice?,"Hey everyone,
I’m a 25-year-old from Chennai and have been working in the medical billing (patient registration) process for the past 4 years. I joined during the COVID lockdown when I needed a job, and things moved quickly—I got comfortable and settled into the role.

I currently work night shifts from home and earn around ₹43k per month. I’ve been feeling stuck. The work is repetitive, and I don’t see many growth or high-paying opportunities in this field—especially in India or maybe just I'm not aware of them.

A bit more context:

I’m in a contractor role, so I don’t have pay slips from employer 

I completed an MBA (distance education) while working



Now I’m at a crossroads and would love some honest input:

1. Is it worth staying and growing in medical billing? Are there any specialized roles or certifications that could improve my career?


2. Has anyone here transitioned from this background into something like the IT field or analytics that’s more fulfilling or better paying?


3. What’s the long-term future of medical billing careers in India?


4. If I switch, how do I manage the lack of official documents (like payslips) for my work experience?



Any real advice or shared experience would mean a lot. I’m open to all kinds of suggestions—even the uncomfortable truths.

1lo220t,Managing time at work,"I'm relatively new to the workforce and I'm wondering if what I'm doing is right. Essentially I'm assigned tasks to work on, each of these tasks is supposed to take given number of hours. More often than not, I finish them much faster - e.g. 16 hour task in 8 hours, 2 hour task in half an hour, etc. What I've been doing so far is just taking the time that is left to do some trainings (related to the field I'm working in, but not really to my actual job) or sometimes just chill out a bit. Sometimes I feel like I'm cheating, since I'm not doing work stuff on my work time.

So my question is, should I signal to my manager that I'm able to take on more work, or is what I'm doing acceptable?

For some more context - I work remotely in IT, I'm planning to stay here for 1-2 more years before changing jobs because I feel like at this point I need more experience to land a new role given current market conditions. I am highly unlikely to earn a promotion throughout this time as so far all such things have been very slow to happen and I got one just 2 months ago after 2 years spent here.",ComprehensiveWay7547,1,1.0,0,1751271385,2025-06-30 08:16:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lo220t/managing_time_at_work/,6,2025
1lo1vo1,"Tough choice between 2 seemingly good options, am I overthinking it?","Hello all,

I would like to preface this by saying that I know that I am in a great position thankfully, but I am quite indecisive and have been torn between 2 job options in different directions that seem equally as good in their own way, so I wanted to get people's thoughts here especially if you've been in a similar situation before. 

**My situation:** recently graduated with my MSME, only experience prior to that was working at a small startup in biotech which was a lot of work but a great learning opportunity and very fulfilling. I recently landed a temporary contract role few months post grad at one of the top semiconductor fab equipment companies in the US (based in CA), been working there for a few months with a good chance of getting converted to permanent in a year or so. Work is interesting but not exactly exciting for me personally, manager is great, learning new tools, etc. Benefits not so good obviously since it's a contract position, but not a deal breaker. Work hours can also be excessive sometimes.

Now the issue is I also received a full-time offer from one of the automotive OEMs in Michigan with great benefits, about the same salary but the significantly lower COL and benefits will likely allow me to save \~25% more, and a definitely more interesting industry to me personally. Con is the role is more on the quality side vs engineering development but with opportunity of switching after a year, and the company seems to be undergoing a negative culture shift according to current/former employees. 

My plan is not to stay too long at either place, ultimately I do know that I'd like to be working on a hardware startup long term, but looking to learn as much as I can while building on the side. Taking the new offer would also mean that I would be moving away from the Bay Area which I do enjoy being in as an aspiring entrepreneur. Should I just accept the new position with better benefits and pay or not risk leaving my current place which is already good enough?

I was coached about this on May and thought it was all good but received an NTE and the date of violation was on May which I was already coached. I was served an NTE before that but it was unlawful so they withdrew it.

I don't want to think it's a personal attack but a lot of things are happening that leads to these being a personal attack of someone from a higher rank who doesn't like me. We are an extended site so we have a person who acts like a lead and never got any warning or coach from him, instead from my  on my LOB. But that person was the one who reported it to the mainsite. He has a family working on the main site with a higher rank and that family has nothing to do with our LOB at all but he's the one pushing for an NTE.

1lo1di1,Did I mess up my offer ?,"Hello, 

I am a fresh Aerospace graduate and just started working as a Guest relations employee at this company. I just got a call from a long interview process with an Aerospace company and the HR asked few quick questions regarding my “job offer”. 

One main question that I feel I messed up a lot was, what is my expected salary as an entry level engineer. From excitement, I told them I would work for free,as a joke since I really want to work in my field, but then I blurted out a number thats was ok in a sense however, after thinking I realized once the call ended I should’ve offered a bit more. 

I felt like I was undervaluing myself which is weird coming from me but I guess I was too happy to finally get a call from the company I want to work in. I still haven’t gotten my offer yet, but do you think I could renegotiate within reason? 

P.S. When I told them I needed a notice period they said in our records you were unemployed and had to tell them that I recently got employed, literally a week ago. So I kind of rushed with the agreement. The HR said since it wasn’t that long i will put you up as unemployed so that you can be offered immediately.

I just graduated from HS and am going to college to acquire a bachelors degree in business because my goal in life is to own a successful business, but I am attending school online and my school does not offer any kind of vet tech or any animal related program as far as I'm aware. I chose this school over the school that DOES offer that because it's cheaper and honestly I was just focused on getting some kind of degree i could use, but I'm kind of regretting this decision because I could have taken a loan out for school. Like I said, I don't know what I'm doing here. Anyways, I want to work with animals in some way because I love animals and I've had a passion for them my entire life but I dont want to go the vet route because my passion lies mainly with horses and reptiles.  

I live in a southern small town that doesn't have much to offer at all much less anything to do with snakes, so I have 0 real experience with them other than a bunch of facts and knowledge on them from being my hyperfocus since 5th grade. The same pretty much goes for horses except I do have a year of experience working on a horse farm and riding lessons and my passion for horses brings me true joy and happiness that nothing else different from anything else. My issue is I have luttle to no experience, and all of my options to gain experience are at least an hour away and I can't afford to drive that far for lttle pay. I recently started working at my boyfriends mothers dog kennel which gives me some experience on dogs but I don't really think that helps me here. I'm sure there are farms i can work at but I don't know how to convince them to hire me because I haven't worked in that field since freshman year and I'm not even sure if that'll be enough to start me off so I can eventually move somewhere that cares more about horses and start a business.

I am considering for a Master’s degree in areas like, Regulatory Affairs / Drug Development / Toxicology / Life Science Informatics / Bioinformatics / Biotechnology.

1. Which country and course do you think is the best fit based on my background and scope of the field?
2. Are scholarships like DAAD in Germany actually achievable for an average student? Any tips or personal experiences?

1lnzoqa,What would you do if you wanted to break out of life sciences all together?,"Few days ago I have quickly looked through this Subreddit. It looks like the “biotech” job market has not bottomed yet. Judging from what I see and hear, this is a “white collar” recession across the board. 

I have seen someone suggesting that the “biotech” job market could recover in 4 to 5 years in the USA. Or 6 to 7 years. The competition right now is stiff, as there are a lot of people with biotech industry experience competing against each other, leaving little chance to outsiders.

I have been posting my questions back and forth. Frankly, I do not even know what is right and what is wrong anymore. I have been circling mentally endlessly. 

Essentially, I did a Ph.D. in molecular biology (all hands on, 100% wetlab, no bioinformatics experience). I wanted to get into the biotech industry or at least continue research in topics that interest me. Instead I had to do a “dead-end” postdoc. The pay was close to a minimum wage, but it put food on the table. I call the postdoc “dead-end” not because I expected it to go on forever; it was a garbage job with no industry-useful skills to gain.

I quit the postdoc as soon as I could and took the first job offer. I became a project manager (in the name only!!!), trying to develop a ""platform"" to support biomedical research. After several years the project was moved to a different organization because of funding arrangements. I remain a project manager on this project, though, it is all in the name only. All is fiction! I do not have a team to manage. I am the manager, I am the team, I am the project. At this point I have not done any “wetlab” work for about 7 years, so obviously my lab skills are gone now.

The issue is that I do not think I can pull off this project. There is no support, there is no institutional knowledge. The PI is absent and extremely chaotic. At this point in my life I cannot deal with chaos or disorganized people. I do not want to have any meeting on statutory holidays or weekends. This situation has started to affect my health. Everyday I feel as if I am being punished. I wanted to do my best, but I cannot anymore. It feels like I am hitting my head against the wall. This year has been particularly hard. Honestly, I do not know how I continue to function. There is no life left in me. The unfortunate reality is the job market in Canada is even worth than in the USA. I am trying to save as much as I can, because I do not see the job market improving in any meaningful way. 

I need an exit plan. Frankly, I would love to leave Canada. The insane cost of living, weather and abysmal job market -– I am just tired of all this. It feels like a slow drowning.

At some point, I was thinking about going to UAE or Saudi Arabia or Qatar. I see that Universities post job openings periodically over there, but I do not have anyone to write academic recommendation letters for me. So that will not work for me. I do not know if someone at KAUST is interested in accepting an old postdoc either. I have been out of lab for years now. I won’t bother applying for biotech industry roles either. It just doesn’t make sense anymore. If / when the market recovers, I will be too old with zero relevant experience. 

I just do not know what to do. How to get the fuck out of life sciences, before I die. This entire year has been bad on me, I feel like I have collapsed and now just trying to hide it. It looks like everything has collapsed. I have been living on junk food for months, because I have no energy for cooking. I am completely clueless at this point. 

I thought of about teaching English in Japan / Korea, but once decent pay seems to be on poverty level today. Try to get into a postdoc role in Saudi Arabia or UAE and just save money? Anyways, even if someone is willing to give me a position, likely it will be another academic **shitshow**. 

**P.S.** Today is again the same story: this morning the PI sent me a request for the meeting. No time proposed, no agenda. On statutory holiday. Again. I fucking hate holidays -- every holiday there is request for a meeting. All day I was just sitting in the room and crying. I could not read, could not write.

1lnyzze,"Thinking about taking a Gap year to learn to trade instead of going to college, is this a mistake?","I’m 18 and just graduated high school. I got accepted into a University’s aerospace engineering program, which surprised even me (Not the ideal GPA or test scores). My whole family was proud and I know it’s a big opportunity.

But recently, I’ve been thinking really hard about maybe taking a **gap year** not to chill out or play around and use it as a break, but to **learn how to trade full time**, develop myself, and build a skill that can potentially make me successful and financially free. I’ve already started building a 12-month plan that includes daily routines, learning phases, trading psychology, side hustles, and long-term goals. This isn’t a move out of laziness or me not wanting to work hard in college, I’m prepared to treat it like a full-time job.

The thing is, everyone around me , especially my sister, thinks it’s a terrible idea. She was shocked when I brought it up, basically laughed it off and said my parents would never support it. Now I’m second-guessing myself, even though deep down I really want to , and feel like I could do it.

I’m trying to figure out:

* Am I thinking delusionally, or just differently?
* Has anyone here taken a gap year to learn trading or build a skill instead of going to college? Did it work?
* What would *y*ou do if you were in my shoes?
* How do you talk to your family when they don’t see the vision?

I’m open to all advice. Just trying to make the right move for my future and not let fear or pressure make it for me",Otherwise-Trash-3196,0,0.5,15,1751259430,2025-06-30 04:57:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnyzze/thinking_about_taking_a_gap_year_to_learn_to/,6,2025
1lnyzls,quitting gas station job after two shifts,"i've worked at a gas station for two shifts and absolutely hate it. the work isn't too bad, but my coworkers are constantly fighting with each other and the customers are miserable. this is my first job, so maybe they're all this bad but i really just want to find something else. i'm not anticipating it to magically improve, and it seems like the place is a revolving door of new employees under the current manager. the lady that hired me has already quit/left since i started.

if i do quit, i don't even want to give a two-week notice as to not face hate from anyone and just move on.

should i stick it out a while longer, or just call it quits?

if i do quit without two weeks notice, should i expect my manager to try and ruin my chance at any future job elsewhere? i was just thinking of leaving the job out on any future application.

Specifically, I want to help people who:

* Survived childhood abuse or deep emotional trauma
* Feel burnt out from work, success, or hustle culture
* Are tired of therapy and self-help not *sticking*
* Are curious about energy work, spirituality, or manifestation
* Want something deeper than surface-level “healing”

If you’re down to share, I’d be grateful to hear:

1. What emotional pain or fear are you still carrying that’s hard to talk about?
2. What do you *really* want your life to feel like, even if it seems unrealistic?
3. What do you think is standing in the way of healing or stepping into that life?
4. What have you tried before; therapy, coaching, journaling, etc. and why didn’t it work for you?

1lnsvx9,weird timing with resignation— what to do?,"Hi everyone! I just got an offer for a new job that I definitely want to take— I plan on officially accepting it within the next few days. Right now the plan is for me to start july 21, so it's time to put in my two weeks' notice at my current job. However, it's a bit complicated. My manager is on vacation until next Monday (8th), and I leave that same day for a week's vacation which I can't move or cancel.

So my options are:

1. **Give ""two weeks' notice"" this week:** Bother my manager on vacation and tell him I'm quitting, have this upcoming week to wrap up my work, then go on vacation for the second week of my two weeks' notice off. Essentially giving 1 week notice, pretty unceremoniously as well since most people are OOO. 
2. **Give two weeks' notice next week:** Put in my two weeks on the first day of *my* vacation (or the day before), and have 1 week of vacation and 1 week of actually wrapping up my work. This would give my manager / team a little more leeway, and they'd be there for my last week, but I'd still really only be working a week. I also wouldn't have time between jobs, which I selfishly want.
3. **Give three-ish weeks' notice this week:** Inform at the beginning of this week and help to transition the week before and after my vacation. This would make everyone happy, but it kind of seems like overkill on my part. I also again wouldn't have time between jobs. Not the end of the world though.
4. Maybe some other magical option if someone can figure it out??? Give my two weeks on a Wednesday perhaps??

  
I feel like no matter what I do it's going to defeat the purpose of giving two weeks' notice; either my manager can't give direction on how I should wrap up my work, or I won't be in the office to wrap up my work. 

Also, if it matters, my work is not that important and could probably be wrapped up in a week— I just want to be as professional as possible about the whole situation. Manager and team are fantastic and not a bridge I want to burn, there are just a lot of changes at the company making me jump ship.

I am from the Netherlands and after this summer I am planning to study further, I am to finish MBO4 (College in the UK, im not sure what it is in the USA) with the course International Business Studies specialized in International Manager Trade, I am about to get a dutch and worlwide known BTEC degree for this course. 

After this study, I am going HBO (Can say UNI) and I am about to do Aviation probably specializing in Aviation Management. Guys, my dream job is to become a pilot, however for now I can’t afford it so I am taking this degree because I see myself working in the aviation, it is my passion and it is certain that it is also what I want. 
My mother disregards the idea because she told me “its just ur ambition, not practicality” she’d rather have me pursue business again for consistency, and I wanna be honest that I really dont want to at the moment and just because my study now have really given me that corporate and everything focused on business is not something my heart yearns for. I have also read so many threads that it is best to avoid aviation and just pursue a

normal business degree, cause its complex compared to aviation which is niche, which I totally get. 
But, I wanna pursue something where my heart pumps, where my smile shines and where I thrive and yet just thinking about it just makes me so happy, I am baffled with my external influences like my mom disagreeing and a ton of comments about the study I want to do, it makes me doubt.

1lnrr23,Career advice,"Hi Reddit,

I’m in a pinch and what other way of getting help but with strangers on Reddit.

To preface, I’ve been at my current job for a year with the intention of taking over my boss’s position as she retires (August 2025).

I spoke with the CEO and I asked for a salary of 250k. They were ok with the number but I haven’t quite received the offer letter yet.

Pros of the job: super chill, a lot of downtime to scroll on Reddit. The job is brain dead to me. Full benefits, 30 days PTO. Lots of paid holidays.

Cons: it’s a bigger company so getting more money is often difficult. From a geographical standpoint, I don’t care for the snow here and it’s kind of too quiet for my liking but not enough for me to leave my job. Country life. Started a new lease at a new apartment effective July 1st. Trying to get out of it now as I haven’t moved in yet.

———————————————————————————
Interviewed at a different facility and they sent me an offer letter today.

Pros: base salary of 240k with 30% salary bonus at end of year if I meet the listed terms and conditions. Paying 5k to relocate. Same job just more work. No snow. City life.

Cons: newish business looking for someone to take over their operations. A lot more work will be needed as it’s a smaller establishment and need to communicate directly to owners. No benefits as of yet. 15days PTO, 5 sick.

Gotta find another place to live asap. Need to be there by August 1st.

1lnrq00,Need Advice: Transfer to Fordham or Stay at Clark and Do MSBA Later? (Business Analytics Career Path),"Hi all, I’m in a tough spot and could really use some outside perspective.

I’m a rising junior at Clark University majoring in Business Management (Data Analytics track) with a minor in Marketing. I’m pretty involved on campus—I have a leadership role in a business club, I’m currently interning at a nonprofit doing data and strategy work, and I’ve built strong relationships with professors who’ve offered to write recs.

Here’s the dilemma:
Clark just made the decision to reclassify its AACSB-accredited School of Business into a “division” under Arts & Sciences, and it’s creating a lot of instability. There’s serious concern over accreditation, declining rankings, and poor administrative decision-making. The university itself is also facing major financial issues with multi-million dollar deficits projected.

I’ve been accepted as a transfer to Fordham University (Gabelli School of Business) with a merit scholarship. If I transfer now, I’d likely need to do an extra semester (maybe even a year) due to credit loss, but the overall cost would be about the same as staying at Clark and then doing a 1-year MSBA at Fordham after.

My goal is to work in business analytics in a strategy-focused role—something like Business Insights or Product Strategy, not just data crunching. Fordham has stronger recruiting, is in NYC, and its business brand carries more weight. But I’ve already built a foundation at Clark and could finish on time, then go straight into Fordham’s MSBA program.

My options:
	1.	Transfer to Fordham now
✅ Stronger business program and brand
✅ NYC access and alumni network
❌ Lose time (and possibly some momentum), likely delay graduation by 1-2 semesters
❌ Need to rebuild a lot of social and academic connections (although I'm originally from the area so I wouldn't be starting from scratch)
	2.	Stay at Clark, finish strong, then do MSBA at Fordham
✅ Already have leadership role, an internship, and professor support
✅ Stay on track to graduate on time
✅ Same total cost as transferring
❌ Risk of Clark’s reputation and program decline affecting job/internship outcomes

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Is it smarter to make the move now or wait and position myself stronger for grad school and the job market?

Appreciate any thoughtful input—especially if you’ve transferred, gone the grad school route, or work in business analytics!

It’s been about 4–5 months now, and I’m feeling really discouraged.

The company doesn’t use tailored marketing strategies. Instead, they follow a rigid system for all clients, making only minor adjustments. I believe strategy should be customized based on the client, but my ideas often get overruled. For example, when I run ads, they expect every component to match the company’s website, even if it’s not relevant to the target audience.

The workload is overwhelming sometimes, they add on tasks on task. I manage marketing for over 40 companies, and it’s starting to feel like burnout. As a beginner, I’d rather focus on 10 clients and do meaningful work.

Another issue: the manager is very hands-on. It’s not mean-spirited, but it’s micro-managing. I get anxious during team presentations because I fear saying something that doesn’t align with their approach. Ironically, I do great in one-on-one client presentations.

I still love marketing, just not here, and not like this. I’ve started applying elsewhere, but it’s only been a few months, and I’m worried that might look bad. I’ve also considered starting my own agency, but I’m unsure if that’s realistic yet.

I’m torn. Do I stick it out? Keep applying? Take the risk and freelance? Would appreciate any advice.",HumbleBraggerPolice,1,1.0,4,1751230804,2025-06-29 21:00:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnpgct/feeling_stuck_in_my_first_marketing_job_need/,6,2025
1lnpccg,I don't know if this job is too good to be true.,"I finally came across a full time work that offers good job prospects, good benefits, the surrounding areas are good too.

The catch, I don't know if I'm overthinking from corporate PTSD, but this new work place seems a bit too good to be true. 

The interview went very smoothly with no nonsense questions or questions that makes you overthink if you've said anything wrongly. My honesty of having no hard skill was rewarded. I applied for a junior sous chef, but the guy said with my experience I can do chef de partie instead, which I'm happy to since I have no skill. The guy also just said I got the full time job on the spot.

I haven't started full time yet, and will need to submit my notice period to my manager soon as despite being part time, my notice period is one month. I offered an olive branch to the new place saying I'm happy to do a bit of part time before I can start full time.

I fear this new place's HR will suddenly say they can't have me because of my visa status if I already submit my notice period to my manager. 

I also fear while doing part time at this new place, they'll say they don't want me anymore after the one month notice period.

1lnpb31,I'm so unhappy and uncomfortable at my job but it might also be the best I can do.,"Tw: suicide, sexual harassment

Preface this with the fact that I struggled to make a decent living and keep stable housing throughout my 20s.

I went from an archivist/gallery preparator and grad student maming minimum wage to homeless, working maintainence for a hotel, and doing sw on the side to make ends meet agter my best friend khs and my ltp got tired of me being sad about it 2 months later and kicked me out. 

I landed into a decent career as a trucking art handler making $20/hr and that I really enjoy but my first job in the sector got to be too much as covid supply chain issues became a problem. Work got harder, staff smaller, and days longer to the point where 12 hours felt short and I struggled to move my body in the morning. They also denied me the annual raise I was promised ""because covid"" even though they made record profits. I had a manager corner me in the breakroom and proposition me, and a new hire threatened to punch my lights out during training. I left as soon as I could for something better after a windfall from a legal settlement. I try not to touch it except to pay off cc debt a couple times a year. It's my retirement/insurance for if things go sideways again.

Got a better job but was laid off after 7 months. Got a better job, but was super disorganized and unsafe. They had me working during a 6 month remodel and large metal shelving collapsed right on my work station. Had I been at my post I would've been  hurt very badly.

Got a better job with less pay, but struggled to get there on time so they let me go after my probationary period because I was more than 8 minutes late 13 times in 4 months. That one's on me.

Got this job, more than I've ever made, less work than I've ever had to do, and the standards are extremely low which hasn't been good for me because I work to museum standards, less if necessary, but otherwise it's a bone of contention and because I'm a woman it's assumed there are some things I just can't do, despote the fact that we have j bars and forklifts which I am trained and certified to operate for things exceeding 400lbs which is about my limit in sharing a load.

I've been bullied and harassed by multiple people. I was lied to about the position where, I apploed for a trucking handling job, they offered me a crating job, and when I showed up they trained me for a prep and pack job that was super low-skill and had no work going on for 2.5 months. Aside from threading washers onto screws no one could tell me what I was supposed to be doing. I wound up helping with the warehouse to avoid seeming useless. They decided to make me the warehouse assistant for a manager who is constantly talking about his kinks and sex life and making intense eye contact while saying and doing really explicit things. 2 weeks in he said, ""Look at my coffee table last night"" and showed me a photo he took of a woman in all fours with her asshole gaping.

I tried to make the best of it for about a year, then tried to communicate what made me uncomfortable, what job I'd rather be doing, but that's when the bullying started. We also took on two more people who were kicked out of their other departments for breaking equipment or showing up drunk on job sites. One freelancer in particular was playing weird power games, pushing me out of the way, and racing me to get to jobs before I could, then he'd screw them up and I'd have to fix them anyway. I let it go for the longest until he started getting really bold, snapping at me, ordering me around like he was my superior, and while drunk at a work outing he yelled that I was disgusting for wringing water out of my relatively clean socks after spilling on them. It was too much, really embarassing, and I was then expected to give him a ride home because he lives near me.

My manager made a joke about men sharing me in a tone that was not jocular and made it obvious he knew what he was saying was fucked up, and was showing me reels of a girl doing pull ups without a shirt on and said, ""Can you believe she is only 16?""

So I finally filed a formal complaint. mind you I had told him before the underaged girl remarks made me uncomfortable as did showing me porn adjacent reels without warning. I was way too ""cool girl"" about everything because honestly I'm not that easily bothered but when it's every day and basic boundaries can't be respected, or my 10 years of experience can't be respected, it gets so old so fast.

The manager has been trying to be on good behavior but he still can't hide how much he enjoys demeaning and criticizing women which is even more stark in contrast of his glowing praise of the guys he likes to drink with. I've been looking for other work for several months, almost a year, and I haven't found anything paying as well, or good enough to make the jump. I keep telling myself I would be so happy with this job if I got it 5 years ago, it's so close to home and I get a lot of downtime and they don't mind me coming in late or leaving early if there's nothing to do. I like my health insurance. I feel like I need to leave for my mental health but I also feel stupid for leaving without something better lined up. I am tired of job hopping and was really hoping this was a place I could stay for a while and focus on other areas of my life but it's so emotionally and mentally exhausting to tap dance around all the weird manipulations and attempts to cut me down.

I just feel at a loss. I'm too tired and depressed to be making life altering decisions but I don't know if I can dig myself out of this while working here.",marzblaqk,1,1.0,1,1751230431,2025-06-29 20:53:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnpb31/im_so_unhappy_and_uncomfortable_at_my_job_but_it/,6,2025

1lnokz8,What to include in a portfolio for entry level marketing/pr/comms/copywriting jobs? Should I even make one?,"I recently graduated and I'm completely lost. Don't want to dox myself but I majored in a semi-unrelated creativity focused humanities/writing major. The only potential saving grace is that its from an ivy league school but idk. I also kind of fucked around and wasted a lot of my time in college, so I all I is have a few leadership experiences with creating content and leading/writing for creative/production projects, no internships, no related work experience. Since I graduated I've been unemployed and ""focusing on my job search"" but its really just amounted to me smoking weed all the time and being super depressed and occasionally working on my resume. But I quit weed nearly a week ago, I've been locking in, and I think its finally setting in how screwed I might be. I have until august to figure out my next move, because thats when my lease is up. I really really don't want to move back home but I'm gonna need to do something.

Anyway, while I eventually want to pursue this creative field, my plan has been to apply to an entry level marketing/PR/comms job for now to get some stability. I haven't sent out any applications yet to anywhere. I don't have many relevant writing samples to this field due to my lack of experience, but I'm willing to create some and I would say I'm a strong writer. I'm just wondering if it's worthwhile to write a bunch of sample work and make a portfolio, and if so, what should I include?

Also, feel free to tell me I'm simply unqualified and should start searching elsewhere if that's the case.

1lnobk2,Master at home or travel abroad?,"I (24M) have taught English for two years. I travelled to Spain and Japan where I taught English in primary schools. I did a year in both countries and really enjoyed myself. I studied Spanish and Japanese at university before which is the reason for being in both countries.

I left Japan in March and have been unsure about my future since. I originally wanted to go back to Spain because I missed it, the friends I made and wanted a future there. It is quite hard to, but once you have a visa, you have a foot in the door to staying.

My other plan is to stay in my hometown in the UK and do a master degree in translation (and also learning a new language). 

I want to go back to Spain because I'd like to resume the life I had before, travel more and improve my Spanish. Id also like to do a language level test. However, I'm worried about the future and know that I can't be an assistant language teacher forever on a poor salary. I want to havw a proper career and don't know what future I could have in Spain, how long I'd legally be able to stay there and what I would be doing. 

I have more friends in Spain than I do here and do more over there with more independence. I cooked good meals for myself, travelled, met up with friends on days off and after work and visited places around the city. I rarely, if ever do this at home. I also only have two friends here and my other friends moved away or I lost contact with them. I'm scared to lose the fun life, however, I feel I need to have a proper career.

Between leaving Japan and paying for visa documents, I spent almost all of my savings. I have since started a part time job that is scheduled until the end of summer, so I have retained the money I lost. However, I don't like the job and am not good at it. I'm worried that I won't have much in my savings and if I lose the job before, I will have even less and be in a place that is expensive. I'll be living in a shared apartment in Madrid, around 500 a month on a 1000 euro salary.

If I stayed at home, I can get a good job after the master and maybe save with another part time job (if I can find one).

I get jealous when I see my friend's stories and pictures from Spain (and Japan). I don't want to miss out, however I already have the experience. I've already had the experience, and could do it again even just for a year before doing the master again.

I'm quite sure which to do.",dbgnihd,1,1.0,0,1751227950,2025-06-29 20:12:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnobk2/master_at_home_or_travel_abroad/,6,2025

1lnmp83,I seem to have cornered myself by using my personal computer at work. What can I do so that everyone wins?,"I work in metal fabrication, which includes CAD work. A couple years ago, I bought an expensive laptop for two reasons; my old desktop (from 2011) was dated, in need of replacement, and because I wanted my own setup to do things at work, and to do those things outside of work as well. In other words, to do design work for personal or other jobs. 

My boss has benefited from my choice because my computer is faster than the company's computer and I can get more work done, quickly and more comfortably. In return, I get to use the design software at my leisure. 

The main computer at work also has the software, but is slower, and is locked to one spot in the building. In fact it can't even run one of our newer machines, so that responsibility falls on me, to bring in my laptop. This is where I feel cornered. Plus, my coworker uses the main computer sometimes, so we can't both be on it, so I'll use mine.

I have a small fear that one day, either during transportation or at work, my personal computer will get damaged. 

One the one hand, I don't want to approach my boss saying ""I don't want to bring in my laptop anymore"" because it will inconvenience my ability to do work, and hinder the business to do some jobs. But I also can't just tell him what to do and make him buy an equivalent, pro level machine. He should very well figure that out on his own. He will absolutely not spend the money I did, or do the research I did, for something like this.

What situation is there that we both benefit? Do I have any leverage to request compensation for this equipment I provide, without losing access to the software? I feel used because I feel like he financially benefits more than I do. Can the company pay to insure my computer, maybe? I'm just not sure how to have this conversation with him.

1lnk6dy,"As a 39 year old with just a GED, I finally ""made it"". But now I have a ton of anxiety about losing it that I never had before.","Hi all,

I'm a 39 year old single father that spent most of his life struggling paycheck to paycheck. 

6 years ago I left a warehouse lead position and took a massive paycut to become a supply tech at a hospital making $16 an hour because I thought there was more of a future. 

I decided I wanted to be a purchasing agent pretty quickly and started working towards that. I learned the systems on my own, learned excel etc. 

I got promoted twice- to lead tech and then to supply coordinator making $22 an hour. In the last 6 years I have applied, interviewed and been rejected for purchasing agent position 5 times. 

Each time i would ask what i could improve or learn, and then i did thise things. Well- about 4 months ago, it finally happened. 

I was finally offered a position as a purchasing agent. I am not salaried at $78k a year, work from home and have everything i wanted. 

We are no longer paycheck to paycheck. My daughter can now do the extra curricular activities she wants to do- not just the ones that are cheapest. We have a savings account. Something I've never had. 

And the job is great- I have a great manager. I have great co-workers. I have 4 weeks of PTO each year. I am guaranteed at least a 4% raise each year. I have excellent work life balance.

And I'm really good at the job. I have received nothing but good feedback from my manager and their manager. 

Everything is good- great even. But now I have so much anxiety about losing this job. When I was making $16-$20 an hour, I didn't have to care very much. Because I could have another job that pays the same anytime I want. 

But now- its the opposite. I only have a GED. If I mess this up, there's absolutely no way I would find another position that pays this much. 

In the back of my mind I know I shouldn't worry because I am really good at the job. And people seem to like me. But I'm dealing with a ton of imposter syndrome and fear of losing all of this. 

I guess my question is- has anyone been through this? And if so, how did you deal with it? ",WTAF__Trump,77,1.0,28,1751217702,2025-06-29 17:21:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lnk6dy/as_a_39_year_old_with_just_a_ged_i_finally_made/,6,2025

I currently work full-time at one of the best hospitals(best pay + best benefits) in Los Angeles making $70/hour with full benefits, decent coworkers, low stress, and decent seniority. The downside is the commute—I live in Hacienda Heights and spend about 45 minutes getting to work in the morning (waking up at 5:15 AM) and up to 1.5 hours driving home in traffic, which is draining me.

I’m considering switching to a part-time position at the same place (20 hrs/week, same benefits like health insurance, but pension/401k prorated) and picking up a per diem job nearby that pays $67/hour for about 16 hrs/week(not guaranteed), with only a 20-minute total commute.

1lngwv4,"Fresher in SAP EWM (Low-Paying MNC) — Confused About Career Direction (SAP vs DSA/Dev), Need Guidance","Hi everyone,

I'm a 2024 B.Tech graduate, currently working as a SAP EWM consultant in a low-paying MNC. I got placed through campus, and honestly, I joined mainly because I needed a job. I'm a fresher with around 9 months of experience now.

In college, I was more into DSA (Leetcode) and started learning MERN stack. But after joining this SAP role, I’ve completely drifted away from dev, and even my DSA practice has become inconsistent. Now I feel like I’ve forgotten most of what I learned earlier and I’m confused.

Here's my current confusion:

Should I try to seriously upskill and grow in SAP (specifically EWM)?
I don’t know much about its future scope, salary growth, or switching opportunities.

Or should I go back to DSA + Development (MERN, etc.) and try switching to a tech/coding job with a better package?

If I go the DSA/dev route, is it realistically possible to crack product-based or decent startups in 6–8 months with focused prep?


My Goals:

Get a better paying job

Work on something I enjoy (SAP doesn’t excite me much, but I don’t hate it either — just unsure)

Build a stable tech career over the next few years


Any advice from people who’ve been in a similar situation — especially those who moved from SAP to dev or vice versa — would mean a lot 🙏
Also, suggestions for a realistic roadmap or resources would be amazing.

1lngnof,Promotion I've been waiting for not given. What do I do now?,"\*throwaway account\* I've been working for a company in the motor trade for 10 years, over the 10 years there's been ups and downs with career advancement always close but never coming to fruition. Covid happened and everything stayed still due to uncertainty of the business. Once things were back to normal I was hit with long Covid and struggled with tasks for a year or so, which they were good about. Since then I have moved departments and been learning a different role with the view that I was to take over from the dept. manager once he retired.   
I have been in the new department a year, during which the manager and other member of staff have been of due to health issues- meaning I basically had to learn the job on the fly and figure out things by myself when problems arose. The manager retired on Thursday, upper management had not started a conversation with me or indicated what would then happen regarding pay, roles, expected tasks once he left. Friday I asked upper management for a sit down to discuss the future and what I thought would be clarify salary expectations.   
I was told that I needed to carry on as is for the next 6 months, and learn the job (even though there is no-one there to teach me), that I would have some involvement in managerial meetings and discussions, while expected to look after the other member of staff, change things in the department etc, but not be a manager and with no pay increase.I was caught off guard and kind of nodded along with this discussion while holding my tongue so as not to lose it. 

  
I intend to go into work on Monday and re-discuss this with two upper managers for clarification, so there can't be any ""he said / she said"" nonsense. I'm thinking along the lines of initially being direct to clarify the situation ""Am I now the manager of this department?"" yes - then open discussion towards wages, expectations etc.  If the answer is no, then I want to know what the roadmap to manager after these next 6 months looks like, what are they putting in place to train me, give me guidance, who in the interim do I report to and who is taking up the running of the department, until I meet these expectations in 6 months, as if I'm not getting paid for it then why would I be expected to do the lions share.

I've been going out of my mind on if I'm over reacting or what the best way to have this conversation.   
I'm in the UK and have nothing documented, when I switched roles I was the one who had to start the conversation about pay and roles then too.

1lnfynd,Can I get some advice on career paths ?,"
Hey everyone,

I hope your all doing well, I'm an 18 year old based in the UK who's just finished a level 3 Btec IT and Im going into unii. I was first initially looking to go into web development and had begun learned a lot of the core programming languages such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a bit of backend.

However, I've seen a lot of concerns about how terrible and unstable the job market is in the UK especially within the software engineers and web development section. And a couple of my brothers who work on web development themselves told me how competitive and empty the market has become compared to a couple of years ago when they got their jobs.

So I just wanted some potential career paths that you guys may be currently working on that I could go down. Specifically within IT, I prefer getting hands on early and building skills, making portfolios etc to get an advantage. Also, may seem a bit dumb, but a career path that could allow me to get a job/junior role without the necessity of a university degree, however if not I'm always happy to just keep going with my uni course until I finish it for the degree. (Only because I just really dislike the idea of university and have never really seen any point in it and have always been a person who's more skill based rather than the whole degree and certifications)

I was looking at machine learning and engineering careers via there and wanted to see what engineers who are currently in the market would advise for it or any other good potential careers.

* Less organic traffic from traditional SEO.
* More zero-click answers.
* And a whole new challenge in getting visibility.

What’s wild is that most business owners I talk to have *no idea* this is happening. Or worse, they think SEO is still just backlinks and blog posts.

I’ve been quietly testing ways to get mentioned in these AI answers, and I’ve seen some patterns; especially around structuring content, topical authority, and using tools like schema markup or publishing on multiple surfaces (like Reddit, YouTube, Quora, etc.)

Has anyone else here experimented with this?

Curious how others are thinking about AI-driven search visibility?AI Search is quietly reshaping how customers find businesses — is anyone else adapting?

1lnasxl,Manager asks me to work extra at night or will fire me,"Hi all! 

I recently started a tech job (I’m from Europe). It is true that I am not the most intelligent, intuitive or innovative person out there but I try hard and I have a good personality. I am very motivated to make it as I spent 4 years in college it’s important for me to prove that I can be good at something else than classes. 

Recently my manager told me that I am too slow on the projects and take too much allocated time (we have fixed price contracts and I need to perform a task in X agreed hours otherwise we lost money). 

I started 5 months ago and I sometimes still take too long on my tasks. The thing is my manager left to another country and my supervisor too so I only have my other colleagues to consult. 

We had a meeting on Friday and she told me that I should work extra at night to make up for the extra allocated time I use otherwise they’ll have to let me go. 

I find it quite unfair because even more experienced employees complain about the allocated time on some tasks and I feel that even if I’m trying very hard and already doing overtime, they’re trying to squeeze more and more energy out of me. I’m really tired. 

I obviously can’t confront her as I’m 23 and that im new in the company. However it is starting to frustrate me and I’m now dreading anytime she sends me a message asking what I’m doing and how much I did.

I’m a finance student and I got a DUI my freshman year. The case is still ongoing. No one got hurt, but I know I seriously messed up. Since then I’ve quit drinking, focused on school, and started working hard to build my career — learning technicals, networking, and aiming for internships.

But I’m really worried about how this will affect job prospects in finance. Will firms in banking, asset management, or even Big 4 completely shut the door on me? Or is there any path forward?

Not looking for pity — just real talk from anyone who’s seen this kind of thing before. Appreciate any advice.

1ln9t4j,Struggling to Start Career and Looking for Advice.,"I recently graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. I’ve been applying to jobs constantly for months now, all over the US but mostly in Missouri,Arkansas, and Texas. I can’t seem to find much willing to take on the inexperienced. I’ve had maybe 3 interviews. I’m not well connected or “networked” and I’m very awkward in general. I say this because it affects my ability to present well in interviews. I work very well with others but I’m not charismatic. 
I feel my resume is decent as I have had it looked over professionally. 

I’m starting to reconsider even working in engineering at all. It seems pretty oversaturated (at least in mechanical related roles). The manufacturing industry (a very large amount of the mechanical engineering jobs) internships I’ve been in, have been a been a huge turn off because of the common work culture in that industry and by the work in general. 

I’ve tried applying to more technical or trade related roles but have gotten zero success. I assume it is either because I don’t have trade school experience or because the engineering degree on my resumes is a red flag/problem to those employers. I would also like to not destroy my body entirely so that would eliminate a lot of trade work.

It also doesn’t help I’m not particularly interested in one specific field of mech engineering. As a whole I like the academic side of the degree but I don’t think I would love spending my career focusing on one very specific branch. 

Am I doomed for being bad at interviews and awkward in general? I’ve spent many of hours practicing to better myself at interviewing specifically. 

If you read this far thank you and sorry for any grammar errors I missed.

My plan was to keep this job, travel often while working and figure out something else on the side that i enjoy more. The traveling worked out perfectly, but the other part - finding something I enjoy more, while still having the same level of freedom - less so.

Lately I get some hints from my boss, that he doesn't understand why i don't want to ""develop"", or ""do some more exciting things in the company"" and for that it would be good to come to the office more often.

But the thing is: I was NEVER interested in what this company does, I only took this job for the freedom it offers and as an ""easy base"" to put out feelers for something else.

Of course I cannot tell him that, if I want to keep this job. How should I handle that?

1ln83sl,I spent my 30's lost and still am lost at 38,"Yes this is career related. This may be a long one will try to put a tl;dr below if so. For context I will do my best to explain without boring you. This context is needed so you can understand better without judging me like thousands of people have done in my life time.  I am a 38 year old father and husband who has spent his entire 30's going in and out of the mental hospital due to a combination of diagnosis's of Autism, Bipolar, ADHD and CPTSD. My childhood was spent 11 years inside of a small room with the door locked 247.   
  
Missed 19 out of 30 days of school a month and told I was sick in a time they didn't seem to be as anal about paperwork. I ran away at 17, married my wife at 18 and had kids because that's the ONLY THING EVER I was taught to be honest. That I HAD to be married at 18 cuz the entire church believed it...yet I never went unless my dad needed help with his church job.

Around age 20 I started realizing just how imprisoned I was and how I should have worked on myself first. I spent my entire 20s freelancing like crazy. Fiverr later in my 20s think I joined it in 2011, Elance, Freelancer, was on Toptal, Upwork, Guru and even building my own websites to offer services. 

Pretty much I graduated a technical college when I was 28, got hired by the same college's corporate, did well then got laid off. Worked in pathology as a desktop support analyst right after that and in 3 months--laid off. Worked at a multi-service tech company...laid off within 6 months. I then joined 2 more companies only to be laid off. Mind you--I have ZERO issues with any job I've ever done. I've always had 5/5 stars and a 10/10 performance review. No one has EVER complained about me. It's my #1 gloat and the only gloat I really have haha. I started getting depressed like mad so I started smoking weed. I wondered why it helped me so much and I researched, asked people questions, went into shops to ask everything known to man and a budtender was like ""you are more passionate than all of us combined you should work here!"". I applied but the manager said they weren't hiring but then said they know a company who I'd be great at.

So I joined the legal California cannabis industry. I sold MILLIONS worth of products, I promoted thousands of products, I created pages for myself promoting myself and the products I repped. I worked for 34 companies all at the same time and none fired me. Then the industry started laying me off...again....4 months then 9 months then a few weeks then about maybe 2ish at least a few times so i gave up, raised my fist in the air like ""POR QUE???"" and cursed God himself.   
  
I then got a delivery driver job... that had me on 15-18 hour a day drives with strict guidelines. They started taking advantage of me over and over...then laid off after a year and a month. My back was killing me during the layoff and was on pain pills for awhile til i learned I have scoliosis and can't lift 20lbs or more and can't drive more than 30 minutes and now we're literally living off my special need kid's fn disability and damn welfare as i wait for disability payments...except...me trying to heal is RUINING our lives. I can barley hold my 10 month old kid...

So I am about to fn go insane because I feel like a failure, a tool, a sham, I can't keep thoughts in my head cuz I'm so stressed the thoughts keep zooming around like Barry Alan and going a million miles per minute. I am expected to 'be normal' and I feel like there's a pattern with the layoffs. My performance is great all the time so only thing it could be is... my mental health. No one has ever complained and im ALWAYS NICE and genuine.   
I even put metaphorical costumes on when my life is crappy and I gotta work anyways no one ever knows. Last 6 month i've tried 8 medications from my dr to help my brain...bro been trying that for 12 years anyways nothing but Adderall works yet no insurance that'll pay for it. I had to quit weed due to job loss. Side effects were low af BUT the happiness and back pain relief was worth the money. 

So knowing all this while you chew your popcorn; what the hell do I even do? I try to Google help, think of a plan but my brain is a damn randomizer ffs. Only jobs I can seem to have a chance at, even through all the pain, is remote as I can't even fn go grocery shopping and hold a couple bags as I got to physical therapy, a chiropractor and a Neurologist I am seeing constantly. I have too many gaps, too inconsistent of a resume, DOZENS of layoffs btw not just like 6. Never fired, never written up, always given compliments to the point it feels like it's not real life or that someone is rigging everyone around me to be nice to me. I would LOVE to go back to I.T or even the legal cannabis industry BUT AFTER SO MANY LAYOFFS HOW CAN I TRUST THEM? I can't afford to go back to school I still owe 13k from college and my car got repod due to the last layoff.

tl;dr  
I am a broken family man who has struggled to keep a job due to DOZENS of consistent and back to back layoffs in 2 different industries combined with mental health issues that I literally have been trying to help for years BUT with zero issues from ANY job. No one has ever said anything negative about me nor written me up so I honestly think they know I'm 'different' and are unaware and uneducated that people with different brains and thought patterns exist. I used to freelance like mad but don't really have that ability anymore after not doing it for about 6 years.   
  
I have a 10 year I.T gap, went into the legal cannabis industry where I found my second passion other than I.T...only for them to lay me off over a dozen times as well. I got diagnosed with scoliosis around the time of my last layoff and can't lift more than 20lbs or drive that long. Barely surviving in all aspects. So I AM LOST NOW and just want to make my family proud but my experiences I should be making at LEAST 65k-75k by now or hell years ago but I literally get laid off from EVERY NON CONTRACT JOB EVER IN JUST AN 11 YEAR WINDOW!

I'm a Year 3 undergrad at NTU Singapore doing a double degree in CS and Business. Two years in, and I'm still unsure about my path. I enjoy math, theory behind AI/ML, and thinking about startups, but not so much coding. I’ve done a boring internship at HSBC (chatbot scripting) and I hated the monotony. I’ve helped people with resumes/job apps and many tell me to start a consultancy.

I like:

- Math (considered quant roles)

- Dynamic, result-driven environments

- Traveling & working globally

- Singapore as a home base (esp. for finance)

- Working on shared missions with driven people (not solo grind)

- The idea of consulting and startup life


Stats:

- CGPA: CS 3.65/5, Biz 3.78/5

- Want to make good money in my 20s

- Unsure if I should get a job, do a PhD, or master's (but in what?)

- Currently applying randomly to top companies without clarity


How did you figure out what roles actually suit you? Any advice on internships, fields, or companies to aim for based on this?

1ln7bg0,What career do I choose?,"I am facing a crisis here coz I really don't know what to pursue. Everytime I'm trying to learn a new skill I'm afraid that i might be wasting my time if i don't end up liking it.

I am a year 3 undergrad at NTU Singapore, pursuing a double degree in business and computer science. It's been two years since I entered uni and honestly I'm still unsure of what to do. I've done some projects here and there but CS doesn't really appeal to me that much (more like I don't practice enough). I do get excited by AI/ML theory but coding it? Hell naw get too bored to try it out. As for all that I've studied in business, it's more like a lot of theory. 

I've worked at HSBC before but the role was too boring (basically creating script for chatbot in contact center) and I hated how I had to slog every day and live a monotonous life. I've wondered though how's it like working at top banks in other areas like finance, swe but how do y'all figure out which role suits for you? I don't understand what most roles are about to realise it i like or not

I have helped a lot of people in creating resume and applying for jobs so everyone says I should open a consultancy. I've also been interested in how consulting works like daily life of a consultant. 

I really enjoy math to the point I wanted to major in it. I have always been good at it in high school so I gave quant as a consideration too. I even thought of switching to med once 😭

As for a career in tech, since i don't know what I like, I've just been looking at swe roles. 

I've been applying for internships but I'm so confused everytime and just apply at top companies no matter the role or field. 
My long term plan is to have a startup of my own. 

Some things about me:
- I enjoy math 
- CGPA: CS - 3.65/5, Biz - 3.78/5 
- Want to earn lot of money in my 20s itself 
- Not a family person can give it all if I am really into the job  
- I want my everyday to look different, challenging 
I am gonna stay alone and work hard for my career if it's something I like 
- I only work hard when I'm aware of the outcome like too much results driven person 
I need it to keep myself going there should be a driving factor 
- My life's aim is to never settle and travel for work to different countries and explore the world 
- I like Singapore and feel it's a good place for my homebase plus a lot of banks are here. 
- Long term i don't see myself going to job. Rather I'm a type of person who likes to work on a shared mission all night all day with motivated people 

Considering all of the factors about what are the best future career paths/companies/places I can go forward so that I can make a plan? What internship do i apply to?

I'm also torn between getting a job vs doing a PhD (research is interesting but I've failed to properly do it)/Master's but then in what field? Any suggestions?

1ln710p,In a bad place. Need help.,"I left my job in retail management for an auditing position at the same company my husband works at. They did background checks and gave me a start date. I quit 3 weeks out from my start date so I could have a week off before my new job. The Wednesday before I was meant to start…they called and rescinded my position due to a mass layoff.

Its been 2 months and I have applied to over 50 jobs and NO ONE has even offered me an interview. I haven’t even really gotten rejection responses either (of the 50, there has been 7 rejection responses total). The rest just GHOST me.

My husband is the only one supporting us. We’ve burned our savings, and after trying so hard to remove our debt it feels like we’re back to square one.

I can’t sleep. When I do, keep have nightmares where I wake up gasping for air. I’m developing scabs and bald spots on my scalp.

I promise I’m a hard worker, I’m kind, and I love making others happy.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get a job quickly?",DuckyQuackrz,2,1.0,0,1751175206,2025-06-29 05:33:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ln710p/in_a_bad_place_need_help/,6,2025
1ln6t8p,Over it all.. what’s next?,"I’ve been working in kitchens for the past 13 years—every role you can think of, I’ve done it. Lately, I’ve hit a wall. I’m exhausted from the long hours, the backstabbing, the toll on my body, and the complete disconnect from my mental health. I’ve pushed through a lot over the years—moved around, worked in different restaurants—but it all seems to be getting worse.

The focus now is all about profit, and the higher-ups either don’t care or are halfway out the door themselves. Standards are slipping, and no one seems to be upholding what makes a kitchen run with integrity. I’m completely burned out. I even tried to start over recently, but that ended with me right back in a place I swore I’d never return to.

I need help. Advice. Anything.

I’m a 33-year-old woman who’s climbed the ladder I set out to climb—but now I’m done. I genuinely don’t know what’s next for me. How do I start over? What kind of work could fit someone like me—with strong kitchen skills, leadership experience, and a deep work ethic, but no desire to stay in this industry?

If you’ve been here or made a career change, I’d love to hear from you.

1ln6kwu,Requesting 100% remote,"My gf received a promotion that implies moving to a new city. It comes with a good raise, 3 days per week remote and developing a new project she is very interested in.

My objective is to move to new city with her and work fully remote keeping my current position. Currently I only have 1 day / week remote. How do I manage the info in my company so I have the best possible leverage to get an upgrade to fully remote?

**Option 1: short notice.**
The aggresive approach would be giving as short notice as legally possible, that is 15 days. In some sort of ultimatum where I state that I am not able to go to the office starting in 15 days due to personal reasons.Then the company has to decide if they want to keep me working fully remote or they can consider that comunication my resignation.

*Option 2: long notice.**
The kind approach would be giving 2-3 months notice. The message is the same as above: they need to decide if they want to keep me fully remote or let me go, but the the company has time to plan and adapt. It gives more the feeling of ""team"" and working together towards the common goal of keeping me working there.

Relevant data:
- I have been in the company for 3y.
- We are short staffed, 2/8 people in my department will be on leave until 2026.
- I am a manager, there are only 2 people in the company who could cover my current position if I leave short term. They are already managing a huge workload and would not be able to absorb mine or teach a new hire without significant project delays.
- We are not in the US, current job market in my field and country is quite good.
- New city has plenty of open positions in my field and role. The salary would be aprox. 20% lower.
- Emergency savings for +2y.
- We rent and rent is cheaper in new city.

1ln5c1d,Burnout. Imposter Syndrome. No Direction. Meet the AI Career Coach That Actually Gets It.,"Hey everyone,

I want to introduce something that’s been quietly in the making, but could genuinely redefine how we think about **career support, emotional burnout, and purpose** in the age of AI:

# ✨ Meet AIShura — The First Emotionally Intelligent AI Career Coach.

Unlike traditional AI assistants that just spit out generic resume tips or job listings, **AIShura is built to listen**, reflect, and guide based on your **emotional state**, **personality**, and **true aspirations**.

Right now, millions of Gen Z and Millennials are:

* Struggling with **career anxiety**, **imposter syndrome**, and **burnout**
* Stuck between doing what makes money and doing what feels right
* Constantly overwhelmed by decision fatigue and toxic work culture

Most ""career platforms"" out there treat humans like spreadsheets: inputs → outputs. But humans aren’t spreadsheets. We’re complex. We overthink. We hesitate. We feel.

# 💡 What Makes AIShura Different?

* 🧠 **Emotional intelligence:** AIShura doesn't just process data — it reads hesitation, tone, and doubt to provide calming, empathetic advice.
* 🎯 **Purpose-first planning:** It doesn’t just tell you how to get a job. It helps you figure out why you want it in the first place.
* 🪞 **Mirror conversations:** You’ll talk to it like you’re journaling. But it talks back — with clarity.
* 🧘‍♀️ **Mental wellness integration:** It doesn't shame you for burnout. It supports you through it.

# 🚀 Why This Matters

The future of work isn’t just about skills. It’s about emotional resilience. About finding meaningful paths without losing your identity in hustle culture.

We built **AIShura** for students, job seekers, creatives, professionals, and even career switchers who are tired of soulless advice.

We believe the future of coaching is **empathetic, AI-driven, and emotionally aware**.

1ln4y5s,Concerned About Project Management Role Being Mostly Secretariat Work—Is This Normal?,"Hi everyone,

I recently walked away from a job of 11 and started a new job for 6 days. The job ad described the role as 50% ""Project Management,"" 35% ""Secretariat Support,"" and 15% ""General"" duties. I applied specifically because I wanted to do more project management work, and I made this clear during both my interview and induction. It was not easy as the economy is really bad at the moment. Another terrible thing is that my industry, at least in my country, takes a very dim view of short job stints and if I leave this job, it will really leave a black-mark on my job record (which yes, they could access).

My previous job was generic education programme administration but 40% of my time was spent doing projects but on a quasi role basis. I actually wanted to transition to do more PM and QI-related work but my old workplace did not have the opportunity.

To be clear, this was the job ad itself:

MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Project Management (50%)

* Plan, budget, oversee, and manage the implementation and documentation of all aspects of project(s) with stakeholders to ensure that project(s) progress according to the defined scope, on time, and within budget.
* Define and communicate project objectives that are clear, useful, and attainable.
* Catalyze project(s) development by contributing information and recommendations to realize strategic objectives.
* Plan and carry out research and customer surveys to establish issues and their causes.
* Manage projects to reduce the risk of overall failure, maximize benefits, and minimize costs.
* Identify potential issues and provide assistance to resolve them in a timely manner.
* Conduct project reviews after implementation.

Secretariat Support (35%)

* Coordinate meetings, take/review notes of meetings, and collate information for dissemination.
* Prepare presentation materials for meetings.
* Facilitate discussions during meetings.
* Follow up and conclude matters arising from meetings.
* Prepare approval papers with support from relevant institutions.

General (15%)

* Participate in other related organization-level or national-level working groups or projects.
* Perform any other duties as assigned by the Reporting Officer.
* Involve in workplace improvement projects/activities as and when required.



However, after six days on the job, I’ve noticed that the actual work seems to be about 70% secretariat support and only 30% project management. Even the ""PM"" component, which actually does revolves around projects, mostly involves (where I need to play a part):

* Organizing and scheduling meetings
* Sending out calendar invites
* Chasing attendees for their slides
* Compiling slides
* Taking notes and minutes during meetings



So far, I’ve only been involved in two projects, and my role in both has been limited to the above tasks. My hiring manager keeps emphasizing the importance of secretariat work as unavoidable, and I’ve seen colleagues and even my manager spending late nights, till midnight, on minutes and admin tasks.

I’m starting to worry that this role is more about secretariat support (which I actually hate as I have experience doing it) than actual project management, despite what was advertised. I’ve asked around new colleagues and my hiring manager, and gotten conflicting answers—some say it’s just the start, others say this is the norm.

I walked away from a job of 11 years and 2 days WFH for this role and am quit worried because this role is pure WFO. I don’t mind putting in long hours but I wanted to learn something real and not be involved in secretariat work again.

My questions:

* Is this typical for entry-level project management roles in healthcare (or other industries)?
* Is it common to start with mostly secretariat/admin work before being given more substantial project management responsibilities?
* Should I be concerned that the role isn’t what was advertised, or is this just part of a normal ramp-up period?
* Any advice on how to approach this with my manager without sounding ungrateful? I already raised this topic.

The job market is really, really bad at the moment, and if i walk away from this role, i should be mentally prepared for unemployment for a year or more.

Would really appreciate your perspectives, especially from those who’ve been through similar situations!

1ln4upc,Should I even attend my own farewell,"Advice as to whether I should even attend to a farewell

Hi all; I worked full-time in a scientific role without a degree but with solid experience, which was clear when I was hired. I consistently did my job well, handled tasks independently, and kept detailed logs to stay accountable. A few people were genuinely respectful and professional, but overall, I felt excluded and undermined.

I was repeatedly left out of training opportunities that others got, which felt linked to not having a degree, even though I proved I was capable. There was a clique culture — certain people were favoured, while others like me were left out or treated with passive aggression. Some colleagues even directly reported me to higher-ups specifically because I didn’t have a degree, and I suspect some were offended that I was on the same pay grade as others who did.

Despite my evidence and records, management often sided with the clique and demanded my logs for “monitoring,” which made me feel singled out and distrusted. A manager I hoped would help seemed biased and failed to protect me, just like they hadn’t defended others who’d been targeted before. Socially, it was draining — people in the clique got support and opportunities while the rest were isolated. Ironically, after I resigned to find a healthier environment, people suddenly acted nicer and are now hosting a ‘farewell’ that feels fake — more like a celebration of them pushing me out than genuine good wishes.

I’d really appreciate your honest view: Does this sound like bullying, poor management, or both? And what do you think I should do about this fake, performative farewell? Should I show up or not? Also, should I speak up and give direct feedback about the toxic culture before I leave — or would that just backfire? If so, how could I call it out honestly but professionally, so they know exactly why I’m leaving?

1ln3ut4,my coworker won't stop causing drama for me.,"I've been at my job for 2 years now, and me and my coworker Eric, has always been friends, but lately he told me he liked me more than a friend and would give me gifts and flowers, I would say he's been doing this half a year out of me being there for 2 years, I always took the gifts because I didn't wanna be rude, and id think it would be a friendly gesture, well... I had a crush on a guy named Dillan at my work, I didnt really pursue it because he's my coworker. I was going back and forth on it but decided not to because of Dillans past. 

but lately, he's been telling everyone at work that I ''led him on'' which isn't true, he tries talking to me, and I think its a way of him apologizing to me or letting me know we're cool again, but I don't get an apology. he just acts normal, and so I go back to thinking that we're friends. everyone at work says I ''flirt with him'' and I don't. I am a very bubbly happy person, I am 23. I goof around with people I care about and I horse play with them. that doesn't mean that I have feelings for them. the reason why I treat Eric differently is because I joke around with him, and I don't with other people. we have a rule at work where we can't date anyone or else we get fired. 

and he's been telling everyone that he loves me, and he's been weirding me out, right now we aren't really talking and he lied and told everyone I hopped on his back, and messed around with him in the back area. which isn't true, I only bumped him shoulder to shoulder and messed around with him in the back of the area because the back of the area is close to the break room that I was cleaning, and I had to take the trash out and stuff. he's been acting very predatory towards me, I have blocked his number ever since, because he gaslighted me and said it was all my fault and that I lost him as a friend because I couldn't even think of him as second best. I do have a bubbly flirty personality but that doesn't mean I want to date anyone. my past experiences are, I dated my coworker before a long time ago and it ended badly. this person seems to be making my work life a living hell, and I am on the verge of getting fired, and not to mention a lot of people in the front are tired of hearing it from people in the backroom. 

  
what do I do? am I at fault? should I change my attitude? and change who I am as a person? he even says sexual things towards me at work as well and it makes me uncomfortable, he even does it on my text messages and I tell him to quit being a pervert. I tried showing my boss screenshots of him acting sexual and him telling me he wants to get with me, but he didn't want me to ''in case a lawyer needs to be involved.''

1ln1gb0,"CEO ""bucket list"" projects causing burnout and disillusionment","My CEO is retiring later this year. He gave us all about a year's notice, so the retirement isn't coming as a surprise. However, in anticipation of his retirement, he's started pushing several projects onto the staff that I've deemed his ""bucket list"" projects. They're basically projects that don't have a lot of demonstrated strategic value outside of his belief that they're worthwhile, and they all must be completed before his retirement, IMO to contribute to his legacy as an executive.

A lot of these projects could be beneficial, but they would require a lot of time to implement correctly. But because they have to be finished before he retires, they're all under a crazy rush that's sacrificing a lot of quality and putting the organization's reputation and trustworthiness at risk. Frankly, I think there have been some unethical business practices taken in order to accomplish everything ""on time.""

I have been assigned as a support on one of these projects, but it's important to note that this project has been put on my plate and taken off and put back on several times, mostly recently in the last two weeks during which I was expected to complete several hours-long tasks that had to be done the same day. I knew as I was completing those tasks that we were not taking the care necessary to protect the company and best serve our customers, but when I tried to voice those concerns, I was shut down and told to complete it anyway because of our extremely tight timeline.

I have been extremely frustrated by both the inconsistency in whether or not I am supposed to help with this project and the methods in which I've been told to complete it. It's all left me burnout, dejected, and upset. I've felt betrayed by this company that I've loved for years, like I can no longer trust them.

I've gotten several pieces of advice from my supervisors and coworkers, but none of the advice seems the solve the fundamental problem that I am being forced to do work that I feel is unethical. Their advice mostly boils down to ""you just have to survive it until he retires."" I've been told not to mention my feelings around the situation because they will likely be ignored. I've been told to not spend more than 90 minutes a day on this project in order to protect my energy, but I've also been told it should be my second highest priority. I've been told to just do the work, even knowing it's wrong, because even if it is, the blowback wouldn't come on me. But no matter what, I still have to do it, and nobody has a solution for how to do it right. Or at least nobody but me seems to care that we're doing it wrong.

I just don't know how to keep working on something they won't let me do right.

1ln14in,"Career change to nursing, rad tech, or ultrasound tech","I got a bachelor's degree in psych many, many years ago. The original plan was to work for a few years and go back for a master's. I realized I did not want to become a therapist at all in these last 2-3 years and just wanted a job where I felt like my investment was actually worth something. As embarrassing as it is, I have had trouble finding full-time jobs at even $20/hr (in Kentucky), with my education and my work history in 'helping' roles.

  
I have decided that dwelling on the past and trying to fit myself into what I studied wasn't helping me at all. I am heavily considering an ADN in nursing, but still feel a tug toward an AAS in either sonography or, mainly, radiography. I plan to start working as a CNA later this year.

I want something full-time when I leave school and want to make a solid decision since career plan #1 didn't work out. I don't want to fight for a full-time role without benefits. I don't want to just have PRN or on-call work after a second investment in another degree. I have a spouse and tween child, a home and land that could use improvement, and I want to do what I can to better our lives with little to no debt. I want to be home with them in the evening hours, at least three days a week. (I work evening shift hours.) 

I have even had thoughts that maybe I am focusing on the better-paying 'helping' work because it's all I've done (outside of retail).

1lmycm8,leave new job early or follow better opportunity,"i (29M) just started a new job as a banker on a college campus. the office is small and it’s just me and two other bankers, one being the manager. right now as it’s summer time, a lot of students have gone back home so days are REALLY slow. They say around late July is when students start to trickle back in and things start to pick back up. Since it’s just 3 of us, there are times where we can get really busy, really quickly and all hands need to be on deck. This role is technically a sales role (credit cards/checking accounts), as we have branch office and individual metrics we’re expected to hit. Everyone I’ve spoken with at my job has told me this is pretty much a “dead end” branch location, and you should only do 1 year here and leave immediately. Also it feels really weird trying to convince 19 y/os to open up a credit card. I know i wasn’t responsible enough for that when I was that age. 

For context, I used to work for a retail brokerage as  a licensed rep (held 7/63 - both expired last year) a few years ago and i wanted to go into financial planning. I took a career detour for a couple of years and now I want to get back on that path again. 

TL;DR I guess my question is, should i seek out opportunities and apply for roles that align with what I want to ultimately be doing long term, or should I stick it out in my current role for 6-12 months just to not leave my coworkers “high and dry” then jump ship? thanks in advance everyone ",TopShoe2851,2,1.0,3,1751147418,2025-06-28 21:50:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmycm8/leave_new_job_early_or_follow_better_opportunity/,6,2025

1lmv4v8,"Formally educated, not skilled, scared, parent - Don't know what to do. (34)","I have been working in the nonprofit sector for 5 years. First as a contract manager, then staff accountant, Financial Analyst (didn't do much analyst work) - staff and director level, and then finally grant accountant. I did work for years early post college in e-commerce, but hit a wall there. I have a MBA (received 1 year ago) and business degree, but really few technical skills, save for the basic excel skills. Many job listings require SQL, Power BII or in-depth knowledge of systems.   I make 74K but I truly don't think my skills would translate to another job that has a comparable salary. Because of DOGE and the general atmosphere of state and federal funding, I am fearful that the walls will fall off. Truthfully, I am not inherently skilled at simple numbers, explaining complex concepts ( I do deal with self-esteem issues & some anxiety). Both of those things I am working on via reading and journaling. I have a four year old.



Both of my parents were professionals. One attorney in the military and the other a teacher. I am so lucky that they did what they  did, but I don't feel like I can possibly live up to that stability. 

Much of it is related to my own mental health, but there are very real circumstances where I have been given vanity titles (because I do work hard and am valuable). I am just not confident in the company's longevity. I want something with growth and stability (I know, doesn't everyone?) Banking requires specific licensures. I have done accounting, but no CPA and certainly have tenuous grasp on GAAP. Sometimes I think about joining the police force, but I am told I am too kind and wouldn't be a good fit. My spouse also doesn't really want that.



  It seems like some of it is just not settling and the fear that if I stay with something too long, I will waste other potential opportunities. My wife's career also has it's own risks, doesn't pay well and doesn't have retirement. I'm told I am approachable, agreeable and care. That I would be a good teacher. I agree with this, but my salary would take a cut - and that job sounds rough. 

  
We were doing well, but with the nature of grants, it just feels like i took a doomed path. An retired coworker made a career, but I've been told that those careers don't exist anymore and I can't look at someone elses career as an example.

22m, graduated from college with a bachelor's in CS last year. Wasn't able to get an entry level job interview since, not a single one. What should I do now?

I did a couple internships during school, but they haven't been hiring. I don't have any loans, I don't have any job, I don't have any family, I don't have any kids, I don't have any assets, I don't have any house to live in.

Practically every single type of job, even apprenticeships require past experience. What do we tell young people? ""Oh, just get daddy to give you a job."" Fuck off.

1lmu3q2,Any Advice?,"I’m currently facing a difficult decision between pursuing the part-time nursing program at and the full-time dental hygiene program. I would really appreciate any guidance as I try to make the best choice for my future.

While I’m genuinely drawn to the dental hygiene role especially the 1:1 patient care and structured work-life balance I’m concerned about the full-time course load. I have a learning disability that makes it challenging for me to manage fast-paced, intensive programs. I’ve noticed that I tend to succeed in slower, part-time programs with consistent structure, which is why the part-time nursing option seems more manageable.

That said, nursing is a field I believe I could grow to love over time, especially in specialties like pediatrics or dermatology. However, I struggle with science courses, and I’m worried about how that might affect my success in either program especially dental hygiene. 

I’d really value any perspective on how to move forward whether to follow what feels more aligned with my strengths right now, or challenge myself with something I might grow into. I’m also open to any suggestions you might have that I haven’t considered yet.

1lmskv6,It all feels like a waste of time,"I want to be clear, I'm simply giving my personal view as a 30 something year old who had dedicated his life to his career only for it all to be changed in an instant.  
  
I worked with the military, government, policing, and eventually when I was fired erroneously by my supervisor. I felt so betrayed. I had never been fired before but, I had consistently ran into supervisor's who would block paths to opportunities. Who would consistently do everything in their power to prevent those they didn't like to succeed and allow those they did to excel. Now that I'm in college and I'm taking the summer off. I feel so downtrodden starting over like this. I'm not making anywhere near the money I was making when I was working full time. I no longer have any career progression to look forward to and I just work a part time job and go to college. Because what would be the point in doing anything else?

I refuse to suffer through long hours again just so I can end up back at square one. I dedicated my life to these organizations. Moved several times for them, gave 70-80 hours weeks sometimes just to satisfy my job requirements. For what? So that I can be nearly blacklisted and made to feel like a nuisance. 

If you're feeling like you wasted your life. Look at me. I'm starting completely over at 30 and it will take me another 4 years to complete my masters to start a brand new career. One that I don't even know will guarantee any level of certainty of success for my family. 

Sitting at home on the weekends and just waiting kills me but, I'd rather do that then ever put the same amount effort like I had before ever again. What would be the point? Killing myself so that I can continue being treated like garbage? No thanks. I'm good. I've saved all the money I planned on saving and accomplished all my goals I set out to do.

Everyone is telling me to take it and I just don't want to, I fear it'll be the same shit as here just in Milan. Moving abroad sounds very appealing, as does earning more money.  
I just worry I'd be picking it for those reasons neglecting the fact that I don't like the job I currently have and this will be more of that.

1lmpxkb,"Mid-Level Professional in GCC—Torn Between Promotion Delay, External Offer, or Year-Long Overseas Program","Background:
	•	Mid-level specialist at a major public organization in a GCC country.
	•	Early 30s; started this role about a year ago after extensive education and training.
	•	Promotion to senior grade approved but frozen due to budget limitations; delay already 5 months, next chance in 6–12 months (still uncertain due to restructuring).
	•	Already performing senior-level responsibilities.
	•	Promotion would bring ~16% salary increase.
	•	Current workplace is supportive at the departmental level: reasonable workload, opportunities for research/teaching/innovation.
	•	Upper management less supportive; formal overseas training sponsorship ended years ago.
	•	A peer in my cohort landed the senior position after completing a 1-year overseas program through another employer—highlighting the stagnation in my own path.

⸻

Three Options:

1. Stay and Wait for Internal Promotion
Upsides:
	•	Supportive team and manageable workload.
	•	Can continue academic and innovation projects.
	•	No need for relocation.

Downsides:
	•	Promotion timeline uncertain and may stretch past 12 months.
	•	Slower salary growth.
	•	Emotionally difficult to watch peers advance.

⸻

2. Look for External Senior Offer
Upsides:
	•	Immediate senior title with ~16% higher salary.
	•	Pension contributions continue uninterrupted.
	•	New professional network and fresh start.

Downsides:
	•	Likely heavier workload.
	•	Less time for research and specialization.
	•	Risk of poor cultural fit and shift to more generic duties.

⸻

3. Take 1-Year Unpaid Leave for Overseas Program (or resign and reapply after)
Upsides:
	•	Adds strong international credential to CV.
	•	May open doors to better roles in future.
	•	Valuable exposure to global practices.

Downsides:
	•	Significant income drop (minimal stipend).
	•	No pension contribution during that year.
	•	Return still dependent on available senior vacancies.

⸻

5-Year Financial Snapshot (Rounded):
	•	Staying: Income rises in year 2 post-promotion; total ~2.12 million over 5 years.
	•	External Offer: Flat but higher income from year 1; total ~2.16 million over 5 years.
	•	Overseas Program: Dip in year 1; matches others in later years; total ~1.86 million.

Assumptions: promotion occurs in year 2 if staying; salary is stable in other options.

⸻

What Matters Most to Me:
	1.	Staying deep in my specialty (avoiding generic work).
	2.	Maintaining work-life balance.
	3.	Building long-term credibility and leadership.
	4.	Having fair and predictable career progression.

⸻

My Dilemma:
	•	Staying offers stability and alignment with values but risks being stuck.
	•	Moving offers money and title now but may compromise lifestyle and focus.
	•	Overseas program is a long-term investment but comes with short-term sacrifice.

⸻

I dont really like the area I live in (Metro Detroit) and I really want to get out there and explore what the world has to offer.

I want to move so that I can challenge myself and experience new things, but I obviously need to support myself somehow (especially if I move to a bigger city like I want to) and im not sure what to do. My eventual goal would to be an artist and live off of that, but I need to some way to support myself. I'm a US citizen and im willing to do almost anything (minus the military) or go almost anywhere (in or outside the US as long as Im in a big city) that's new, and im very open to suggestions on what you would do in my situation.

1lmoi3r,Informed manager I quit. Told me no.,"After two decades at the same tech job, it’s very clear now (haha) that it’s a dead end job. I told my manager after successfully handling a huge building project basically by myself (again), that literally has required me to work 80 hours a week for 3 months, that I’m leaving.

I have requested over the past 12 years for more people probably 30 times. It always gets turned down due to budget concerns. Their fix however is to give me access to consultants at 3x the price. 

When I told my manager I was leaving effective immediately he asked me not to quit and to give him a week to find a solution.

I’m not sure if this is a good idea. I have very high level concerns for my health and my marriage, plus my salary has actually declined since over the past 5 years and my pension has been frozen.

Considering everything I’ve asked for to run the department over the past 20+ years, I do t see them willing to fix ALL of the issues. My concern is my manager is going to go to bat for me again and possibly come back with a token ‘fix’ and when I tell him that’s not good enough, it will burn a valuable bridge.

1lmo9yi,Bad reputation already at new job,"I started a new job and the training class is a month. The trainers are separate from our assigned supervisor. We lister to one trainer for the first half of the day and we do hands on work with a different trainer the second half of the day. When I went to do hands on with the second trainer she was cold , uninviting and barely greeted me. When we had questions she was be irritated and responded aggressively with a fake nice voice . She also took a long time to respond to make people feel uncomfortable. She would say the answer super fast and cold and go silent. At the end of the class we had to report to her how many assignments we done. 


My number was extremely low and I was lowest in the class. She made a speech saying that there is no reason I should have taken this long and that shes questioning if I’m doing my work. She said she will report it to my supervisor and she’s been writing up notes. She also said she can see everything that we do and shes keeping track of it. I have issues with speed . I think it has something to do with how my brain processes things as well as me being new on the job and not fully understanding what I’m doing. 




She never thought maybe I needed help and was struggling , she immediately assuming Im not working. She was mostly silent and cold but watching my every move for faults and errors. She also started making us report how much work we got done more frequently because I was slower than everybody else and she thought I wasn’t working. 
Right now I feel embarrassed and like a loser because I have issues with speed , the whole class knows I’m the slowest . 


She also reported bad things to my brand new supervisor at a brand new job. I feel like my reputation is already messed up while I’m in training. I don’t feel like I have a chance. We haven’t actually started “working working “and I’m already expected to do bad and not meet metrics. This is affecting my self esteem because I’m already embarrassed about this issue I have with going slow, and then I’ve never been a perfect , outstanding, top of the list person no matter how hard I try. I don’t look perfect. A lot of people don’t try to be my friend, Im quiet and I don’t think people even see me. I feel a lot of emotions and I don’t know what to do from here.

1lmn7ng,Artist considering teaching,"Help me I’m very conflicted. 

Context: everything I’ve ever done has been with young people/kids and creativity. I have an art degree and have just finished my job as an arts coordinator at a youth centre. 

The obvious next step is to get a teaching qualification to teach art in colleges (UK) 16-18yr olds. 

It’s obvious for me as the only qualification I have is an art degree, which is hard to make a good salary from. Teaching would give me stability, a rewarding day to day, a good salary and good holidays.

BUT

I am a musician/producer/singer/performer and I want to persue that way more than I’ve ever wanted to do teaching. 

I have safeguarding qualifications and a DBS but I die at the thought that one day everyone will find out about my double life. 


When I was at college; I loved stalking my teachers online and seeing what dirt I could find on them (this is most teenagers!!)

I’ve been in punk bands and I’ve been a DJ for years and if you google my name; a lot of stuff comes up. 

Teachers need their socials on private….

Being an artist I need instagram and TikTok to promote my stuff- and it needs to be on public for everyone to see

Imagine my students scrolling on TikTok and they see their art teacher doing dances to Charli xcx & singing

It’s treading the line between persuing what the heart wants and aches for and having to be a “professional” to make a living.

Obviously the creative stuff doesn’t pay well and I’ve tried and tried to make that work… I’ve done so much freelancing in sound teching/DJing/ workshop facilitation 

Teaching is a solid plan B for me, while I do the other stuff! But it’s also giving me a solid career plan & path to be on.


So many teachers have done this before and made it work- I just worry that I’ll have to sacrifice making, creating, persuing my passion in order to teach.

I've been in retail for 20 years, military intelligence for 8 years, BA in public administration, and a little experience in entrepreneurship. I've flirted with the idea of writing. I think I'd be good at it but my body doesn't like to sit still. I have a passion for ecology, conservation, and religion.

It feels like the retail environment is making my life worse & worse. I just started a new position with high hopes. They said I would be full time and offered me a good rate of pay & great benefits, but I'm only being scheduled for 0-20 hours per week. (This is the first week of an outlier: 29 hours this week). I gave them open availability at my interview so taking a 2nd job would require some finagling. I've spoken to the assistant manager that I need at least 30 hours per week. I'm still waiting to see what I have on the next week's schedule after tgat conversion.

I'd like to find something more stable and lucrative. What's holding me back is a blessing and a curse: I live in a van that would theoretically enable me to travel anywhere and have a ""base camp.""

-when I accepted my current role I never intended to leave so soon. This new opportunity just kinda fell into my lap a week and a half ago. 
-I do not trust my current boss and they can be very unprofessional (gossips, shit talks others, generally not a good leader in my opinion). Also a yes person and people pleaser which puts a lot of stress on the team to make all the Yeses happen. My boss is the reason why I decided to leave.

1lmk1hr,"Making mistakes at work, how to recover?","I’m 2 months into an internship and made a mistake on Friday. It’s nothing too serious that would loose the firm money or anything but I did make a mess that needed to be cleaned up. 

Basically, I was misinformed about the procedure for a certain task and did the opposite of what I should have done.

Later in the day (close to 5 pm) I realized what I had done and flagged it to my team. They were able to clarify the procedure with me and let me know the best way to fix the mistake which was basically just damage control. The mistake is not necessarily resolved - more issues may come up as a result of this that I’ll have to deal with. 

It’s a long weekend and when we get back in office my boss is going to notice (this type of error gets automatically flagged in our system and she personally reviews every flag) and at the very least will ask me to clarify what happened. Like I said there may also be more to fix. I’m still pretty confused about the situation and not sure how to fix issues that may arise from this mistake so I’ll have to ask for help with that too. 

Just feeling very shitty about this. I’ve also made other smaller mistakes as I’ve been learning that have been flagged, stuff that I guess can be chalked up to learning curve but the fact that mistakes are happening repeatedly is not okay. It really looks like I’m being careless with my work or am not learning. 

I don’t think I’ll be fired over this but I’m worried about how this all reflects on me. And I don’t know how to recover from this and show my team that I’m actually competent. And also will be stressed about this all weekend and not sure what to do when I get back in office.

1lmjtwc,Beginner Career Advice - feeling undervalued - need advice,"Hi guys, I need some advice on my career and whether the way I feel is unreasonable. SOrry for the long post

Quick background:  
At 21, I moved to Denmark to study a 4.5-year bachelor’s in mechanical engineering and management. Around three semesters ago I got into renewable energy and have focused my studies and projects on that since. I'm now finishing my 8th semester, which was an internship.

Due to personal issues, I started applying late and couldn't find an internship in Denmark, so I tried Bulgarian companies as well (where I'm from). I was sending mostly unsolicited applications. Then I found out that my dream (the best in bulgaria in the industry and one of the best in europe) would be at a career event in Italy. I flew there, met them, and got an offer.

At the interview, the program manager suggested I train in Bulgaria for 2 months, then move back to Denmark to help with a big project site. I left things unfinished in Denmark expecting to move back after the training. But when I arrived, I found out the manager had left the company, no one knew about the plan, and they needed someone in the Sofia office instead. I was flexible, so I stayed.

I started in EPC project management but got moved to a new department focused on grid connection & commissioning. We coordinate the construction substations, cable lines, bays etc., with external contractors. I don’t have an electrical background (just a coupe courses at uni) but saw it as a good challenge, and it has been. I've learned and contributed a lot in the last 5 months.

The company has no well structured PM processes - departments work in silos, and most communication happens via email and Viber. Since I joined a brand new department, I’ve taken the lead on organizing and digitizing things. Here's some what I’ve been doing:

* Built and manage our SharePoint and handle all document flow.
* Coordinate our communication with the grid operator, which is about half of our admin workload (the other half - coordinating subcontractors - is handled by my manager).
* Built automated flows for document processing.
* Prepare reports, schedules, and technical documents for different internal and external stakeholders, and follow up on urgent issues.
* Track department tasks; currently building a system to monitor progress across 50+ projects (until now my manager has been tracking progress by memory and notebook).
* Built a ticketing system to track communication with the grid operator and ensure issues are properly followed up and closed.
* Currently developing a tool to generate technical letters in bulk for grid operator submissions.
* While my manager was out for a month due to a surgery complication, I was the only person from our department in the office, basically running the entire admin side of things (excluding contracts and major decisions).
* building a central project tracking page for progress, issues, and comms.

also planning to:

* Create Power BI dashboards with KPIs for project tracking and automated reporting to senior management and to the responsible EPC managers (who are building the respective PV/BESS site itself, while we handle the grid connection facilities)
* Automate more processes.
* Take power systems courses to better understand the infrastructure we work with.

My manager has been really happy with me- today he even took me out today after work to tell me how exceptional my work has been and that there are good things coming (like our department expanding operations outside the country, whereas currenty EPC managers and local staff have been handling the grid connection processes). Still, I’m having mixed feelings.

My role is “technical assistant” and I’m paid €1,200 - not bad for Bulgaria, and there’s been talk of a raise, but I’m aiming for €500 more which is almost 50% and i dont know if they will accommodate my wish. And even then I would be underpaid. I am currently going into debt living here and don't feel that this is reasonable. What worries me more is the title and future. I was hoping for a promotion to project or technical coordinator, especially with all the tools and systems I’ve built. But my manager said the plan is to hire another technical assistant (like me) and a ""technical coordinator"" *above* us. That kind of upset me.I’ve basically been doing that role already, and it feels like someone else will come in and take credit or authority over my work. + 1 more person between me and head of the department. A roadblock of sorts is how i see it.

I can’t quit - I’m still studying, and my thesis is in partnership with this company. But I feel undervalued, despite the praise. I’m ambitious, and I didn’t come back to Bulgaria to be treated like any other intern. I want my growth to be reflected on my resume. “Technical assistant” at 26 sounds like I haven’t progressed much - it reminds me of my tech support job 5 years ago, which paid about the same if we adjust for inflation. Maybe it's egotistical, but i do not feel that i am at the same level as the other technical assistants in this company, who have been studying at random bulgarian universities and living at their parents places. I am also confident that i could get a junior pm role or project coordinator role somewhere else, but i can't quit because of my last semester and thesis, and I don't really want to quit; I mean, I love the job. I think people undervalue me because I am young (the youngest in PM & adjacent departments), and perhaps they compare their career paths to mine - so it seems only reasonable that i should stay in this role for a year or two before progressing. But our paths were not the same, and I worked hard and sacrificed a lot for my education, which is barely even getting applied.   
I am planning to go back and study more in a couple of years and probably eventually live abroad permanently, but I've been spending a lot of time thinking about my current situation. I might move the studying to right after i graduate if things don't work as i want them to.   
 love the job and I get amazing exposure to the industry, I'm learning a lot fast. But i just don't feel satisfied with the situation i described.

So, what should I do? Should I bring this up? Am I being unreasonable or just egotistical?",pulenbezobraznik,2,1.0,1,1751107420,2025-06-28 10:43:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmjtwc/beginner_career_advice_feeling_undervalued_need/,6,2025

1lmjjs5,"Freshly graduated in tech, i need some advice about something.","Hi everyone,

I just graduated with a degree in technology, and I’ve recently been invited to a group interview for a very well known program.

The interview is designed to evaluate teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills. My friend and I both got shortlisted, and at first, I thought it would be a great idea for us to schedule our interviews at the same date and time so we’d be in the same group.

We’ve always worked together really well during university—almost all of our projects were team efforts between us. We had excellent collaboration, divided tasks effectively, and supported each other consistently. So my initial thought was that being together in the same group might actually demonstrate strong teamwork and communication.

But now I’m starting to wonder if this could actually hurt our chances, since:
	•	It might be harder for each of us to stand out individually.
	•	The evaluators could see us as a “package deal” rather than as independent candidates.
	•	There could be an unspoken bias to only select one of us from the same session.

Has anyone here had experience with group interviews like this or with similar competitive programs? I’d love to hear any insights or advice on whether it’s smarter to schedule separate sessions to show independence, and a better chance for both of us to get picked, or if staying together would still be seen positively.

1lmjfv9,I Quit My Job Without a Backup Plan And I Regret It Every Single Day,"It’s hard to admit, but I’m angry at myself. Every. Single. Day.

A few months ago, I walked away from my job at the airport. I was doing shift work — brutal hours, irregular sleep, constantly drained. It felt like I was living in a haze, just existing between shifts. I hated the lifestyle, and at the time, I thought quitting was the only way to save my sanity.

So I quit. No notice, no backup plan — just a decision driven by frustration and burnout.

And now, I’m paying the price.

What I didn’t fully appreciate back then was how **financially stable** I actually was. That job paid me more than any job I’ve had before or since. The benefits were solid, and I never had to worry about covering my bills or putting money aside. But I was so consumed by the *daily misery* that I couldn’t see the bigger picture.

I ended up being unemployed for almost **3 months**. I drained my savings, felt the panic creeping in, and eventually took a job as a **personal trainer** — something I’m genuinely passionate about, but let’s be real: it doesn’t pay anywhere near what I used to make.

Now the weight of that decision hits me daily:

* When I check my bank account.
* When I turn down things I used to afford easily.
* When I realize how far behind I am financially.

I feel stupid. Not because I chased a better lifestyle — but because I didn’t have a plan. I didn’t budget for the fallout. I didn’t calculate the long-term cost of walking away. I just *reacted* — and that cost me months of lost income, momentum, and confidence.

**I know beating myself up won’t change anything.**  
But it’s hard not to think about where I could be right now if I had just held on a bit longer, made a plan, or lined something else up first.

So yeah, I regret it. Deeply. But I’m trying to forgive myself and focus on rebuilding — even if it’s slow.

Thanks for letting me vent. If you're reading this and thinking of quitting — *don’t let emotions make the decision alone*. Have a plan. You might thank yourself later.",Lisapury45,0,0.5,1,1751105864,2025-06-28 10:17:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmjfv9/i_quit_my_job_without_a_backup_plan_and_i_regret/,6,2025
1lmjen2,I Just Realized I’ve Been Seriously Underpaid for Years. How Do I Ask for What I’m Worth Without Burning Bridges?,"I’ve been in my role for just over **3 years**, working in a mid-sized tech company as a **Business Analyst**. When I was first hired, I didn’t have a lot of experience, and I was just grateful to land the job. I accepted the offer without negotiating because I didn’t want to “rock the boat.”

In the time since, I’ve taken on *way* more than my job description:

* I now lead key stakeholder meetings regularly.
* I manage cross-functional teams on high-visibility projects.
* I helped implement a new analytics system that’s saved our team over 400 hours a year in manual work.

I’ve grown *a lot* and I’m proud of that. But here’s the problem:  
After doing some market research (and talking privately with a few peers in similar roles at other companies), I’ve discovered I’m being paid **20–25% below** what others with my same responsibilities and experience are making. In some cases, even **30% less**.

I’m not mad I genuinely like my team, and I know I’ve benefited from the learning and opportunities here. But now that I’m aware of the gap, it’s eating at me.

**Here’s where I need advice:**

* I’ve never negotiated salary before. How do I bring this up respectfully but firmly?
* I don’t want to threaten to leave I just want to be compensated fairly.
* Do I present market data? List accomplishments? Wait until annual review season or bring it up now?

I’m a quiet worker. I don’t cause drama. But now I realize *being low maintenance might have cost me money*. I want to fix that professionally.

**TL;DR:**  
I’ve been with my company 3 years, grown a ton, and now realize I’m being paid significantly below market. I don’t want to quit I want to ask for a raise the *right* way. How do I advocate for myself without coming off ungrateful or aggressive?",Lisapury45,0,0.5,4,1751105725,2025-06-28 10:15:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmjen2/i_just_realized_ive_been_seriously_underpaid_for/,6,2025
1lmjcdj,My Contract Lead Accidentally Sent Me a Message About Me. And It Wasn’t Kind. Should I Address It or Let It Go?,"I work as a **Project Manager** in a large, complex program with many moving parts: multiple companies, contractors, and stakeholders under one roof. I've been in this role for about **10 months** now, and while the learning curve is steep (they say it takes 12–18 months to really settle in), I genuinely enjoy the challenge and the pace.

Recently, I’ve been coordinating a business trip to a site I’ve never visited before. Because of the nature of our work, travel requests need to be signed off by several people. One of them is my **contract lead**. He’s not my direct manager, but I still have to route certain things through him.

Like many PMs, I juggle a lot. This travel request was one task among many and it ended up needing a few revisions:

* First, the airline fee increased.
* Then, I had the wrong hotel per diem rate due to a location mix-up (I thought I was headed to Site A, but it turns out it's Site B about 30 minutes away, with different allowances).
* I had asked a section SME about the location, and they downplayed it. I don’t believe they had bad intentions; they’re just used to how things work and didn’t think it mattered.

I fixed each issue as soon as it came up. I wasn’t trying to be careless just navigating a huge system and trying to get it right.

Here’s where things get awkward:  
We use Microsoft Teams, which sends email previews of messages. My contract lead accidentally sent me a message clearly intended for someone else. It read:

>

That’s all I saw the email cut off the rest. I’m guessing there was more, but that alone hit hard.

He tried to delete the message on Teams, but the email had already been sent and I definitely saw it.

**So here’s my dilemma:**

* Do I address it directly? Ask for a 1-on-1 conversation and express how unprofessional and unnecessary that comment was?
* Or do I ignore it, take the high road, and just keep moving forward?

I’m not overly sensitive I know people vent. But I also know this wasn't just frustration it was dismissive and demeaning. I’m still relatively new to this program, but I’m putting in the effort, and I’m growing. Being talked about like that especially by someone who plays a role in my workflows kind of shook me.

Would love insight from anyone who’s dealt with something similar.  
**Is silence strength here? Or does professionalism mean calling it out calmly and constructively?**

**TL;DR:**  
My contract lead accidentally sent me a rude message meant for someone else, calling me a “5-year-old” over some travel request errors (which I fixed). I saw the message because of the Teams email preview. He deleted it, but the damage was done. He’s not my boss, but he plays a role in my approval process.

1lmjadt,I Didn’t Grow Up Rich. I Just Learned to Prepare Before Life Punched Me in the Face.,"I wasn’t born into wealth. No inheritance. No financial safety net. I worked for *everything* I have and for years, I still lived paycheck to paycheck.

But I’ve always paid attention. I watched friends lose jobs and spiral into debt. I saw family members with good incomes but no savings, forced to sell possessions just to stay afloat. And I made a quiet promise to myself: **I won’t be caught off guard.**

So I started small.

* I built a 3-month emergency fund before I ever owned a flat-screen TV.
* I bought a reliable used car and drove it for 10 years.
* I contributed to my 401(k) even when it hurt.
* I said ""no"" to luxury, so I could say ""yes"" to freedom.

Fast forward to today: I’ve been laid off **twice** in my career both times with zero warning.

And both times, I didn’t panic.

I had a cushion. I had time to breathe, think, plan. I didn’t take the first job out of desperation  I took the right one. That’s a luxury most people never get.

**Here’s what I’ve learned, and what I wish more people understood:**

* 🧠 **Wealth isn’t about what you earn it’s about what you** ***keep*****.**
* 🔒 **Your job is not your security. Your** ***savings*** **are.**
* 📉 **Most people live at 100% of their income. Some at 120%. That’s financial suicide.**
* ⏳ **Discipline now buys you freedom later.** Even just saving 10% of your income can change your entire future.
* 🚪 **When the door closes, you don’t want to be trapped inside with no exit.**

I’m not rich. But I have **options**. And that, to me, is real wealth.

If you’re early in your career: start now. If you’re already established: adjust before life forces you to.

Don’t wait until the storm hits to patch the roof.

I’m sharing this because I wish someone had told me all of this *sooner*. I hope this helps even one person in this subreddit avoid the pain I’ve watched others go through.

1lmj7xg,"We Went From Two Incomes to One Overnight. Here's What Saved Us (and What Could Save You Too)

Be ready. Always. Because nobody ever thinks it's going to happen to them.","My spouse was with their company for over **25 years**. They had stellar performance reviews. Highly respected. Even received a substantial bonus during the most recent review cycle. Loyal. Dependable. Everything a company should value in an employee.

Then… new CEO. New management. A wave of restructuring. The ""old guard"" slowly started disappearing. One by one.

**6 weeks later, my spouse was walked out the door. No warning. No scandal. Just ""thank you for your service"" and a folder of exit documents.**

We were a two-income household for over **30 years**. Suddenly, it was just me.

But here's the twist: **we were okay**.

Not because we’re rich. Not because we saw it coming. But because for the last 5+ years, we’d been banking my spouse’s entire paycheck straight into an S&P 500 index fund. We lived on just my salary. Not because we had to — but because we *chose* not to inflate our lifestyle with every raise or bonus.

So when their paycheck stopped, our savings didn’t vanish. Our roof didn’t disappear. Our stress level? Yes — it went up. But our life? It stayed stable.

💡 **Here’s my advice to anyone reading this — especially those early in their careers or finally hitting a high-income stride:**

* **A layoff can happen to** ***anyone*****.** Even to the highest performers.
* **Live on less than you make.** If you’re part of a dual-income household, try banking one salary.
* **Put your money to work.** Whether it’s an S&P 500 fund, high-yield savings account, 401k, or Roth IRA — start somewhere.
* **Avoid lifestyle creep.** Just because you *can* afford the $90k car doesn’t mean you *should*. A reliable $40k car with regular maintenance will run just fine for 15+ years.
* **Needs over wants.** Start separating the two clearly in your budget.
* **Expect the unexpected.** Assume your job isn’t permanent — because *it’s not*.

We didn’t get everything right over the last 30 years. But we got *this* part right — and that has made all the difference.

I sincerely hope none of you experience what we did, but if you do… **I hope you’re ready.**

1lmj5hn,Is AWS Educate Worth It for Cloud Computing? Or Should I Go All In with KodeKloud?,"Hey everyone, hope you're all doing great :D

I’m starting my cloud computing journey and looking for advice from those who’ve been down this road.

So far, I’ve been exploring **AWS Educate**, and while it’s free and gives a good intro to cloud concepts, I feel like the content is mostly beginner-level and kind of limited when it comes to **hands-on labs** and **real-world skills**. It’s okay for theory, but I’m not sure it’s enough to prepare me for jobs or certifications.

Now here’s the thing — I have a chance to enroll in **KodeKloud**, which I’ve heard is packed with labs, real environments, and practical projects for things like:

* AWS cloud hands-on labs
* Linux, Docker, Kubernetes
* DevOps tools like Terraform, Jenkins, Ansible, etc.

So my question is:  
**Should I stick with AWS Educate since it’s free and ""official""?**  
Or is it better to **invest in KodeKloud** to get real practical skills, even if it costs a bit?

I’m aiming for a **Cloud Engineer** or **DevOps** role, and I don’t want to waste time with the wrong platform.

Anyone with experience using either (or both), please share your thoughts. Would love to hear what actually helped you land a job or pass a cert.

1lmgy1q,"Masters Abroad in Aerospace vs Continue to work as Political Consultant
Advice","**Background:**

Have done my B. Tech in Mechanical Engineering in a Tier 2 college in India and was good at it ( 1 patent, 2 Intl awards, worked with GM 1 year of workex as product dev engineer). Patent and research area was mostly concentrated in aerospace and bit of automotive. Later, left my job to prepare for UPSC Exams and wasted 4 years. Currently, got a job as a Political Consultant in a firm working with an Member of Parliament taking care of her speeches, policy briefs, press met pointers, parliamentary committee meeting talking pointers, Political Campaigns etc.,

I intent to impact society and have a knack in leadership, operations (Worked in an large scale NGO during my college leading teams in city and later regional area for 3 years). I decided to write UPSC exams for that reason.

Since, UPSC was not working out even after 4 years and I was throwing stone everywhere to land up in something to earn some money. I struck two golds: One for job as Political Consultant and another was where I got an offer from TU Delft, Netherlands (QS ranked 3 for aerospace) where I was given a full waiver of fee along with living expenses covered. (It would have costed me around 72k Euros if I had got this) .

**Dilemma:**

Iam liking what Iam doing current as Political Consultant. But, pay is kinda low (35k Indian currency) as I started now and even growth is kinda okaish where I might end up with around 80k in next 3-5 years. Promotions is also weak, plus 6 days work week and location changes as client changes sometimes.

If I leave this and move to Masters in Aerospace. Its been quite a while since I touched this. It would be uphill battle for next two years. And also, since I love more operations and building teams, organizations and maybe I want to create my own product or company in the future. (In India) Not sure if this a ideal path. If I take this up and pull this off on other end, I might walk debt free post Masters getting a job and might save around 10-15L per year.

One more option which pops in my mind is to continue with this job and go for MBA later. But, Iam already 28 and with just 1.5 years of workex now. I got around 93.32 percentile in CAT Exam in previous attempt. Can aim for better, but not sure gonna get 99.5+ for Tier 1 Colleges. If I get Tier 2, I might take 3-4 years to return back all the loans after 2 years of studies. So, can walk out of debt at 34-35 years.

Not sure, if I should continue and do an MBA later. Or take up my Masters!

She asked me why I go to the company meetings (which are mandatory and within working hours) and the company Christmas party only and not to any of their department social events.

She said that this might result in people assuming that I do not like hanging out with them or that I do not like them.

I mentioned to her about my social anxiety and how I go to the other events because a family member is there (they work with me). She told me that I should do the things that scare me because they become easier with time and then she went on a rant on how I should be living my life independently that I should not be relying on this family member because they are not immortal. She said that people my age are already living their own life.

I found this widely inappropriate and I do not how this is even tied to my performance. I do not know what to do at this point and if I am even in the wrong for not attending any of the department social events.

Another item that she mentioned was that if her manager ask her to do something and her working hours are till 3 she does not care and stay till 7 8 if needs be. Those unpaid hours would be compensated in her bonus not directly but her bonus would reflect that.",Prestigious_Wheel767,1,1.0,0,1751090732,2025-06-28 06:05:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmfngw/social_events/,6,2025
1lmflv0,Software Engineer at Google/FAANG vs Mechanical Engineer?,"Hello,
So I got 2 job paths I can take as a university graduate.
I can go down the mechanical/electrical engineering line at one of the big defence firms,

Second path is the Software Engineering offer at Google/FAANG which pays $130k more than all the mechanical/electrical engineering roles offered.

I’m fortunate enough to be able to go down both paths but I’m wondering what should I choose and why is the pay disparity this big for software/tech compared to graduate engineers. Even FAANG is the top of the line for mechanical/electrical engineers and the pathway was still less than the software guys so I ended up just telling the recruiter I’ll go for the software engineering path.

Thanks, grew up in low socioeconomic area so wondering what I should choose in the end but I’m wondering if I really am a true engineer if I take the money as it isn’t a traditional engineering role",confusedneedhelp2,1,1.0,1,1751090569,2025-06-28 06:02:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmflv0/software_engineer_at_googlefaang_vs_mechanical/,6,2025
1lmf77p,Finance careers,"I'm a rising sophomore at USC, and I want to go into finance, but I'm not sure what to do. I used to be a STEM double major in pre-med, but I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do. Decided that finance was the route for me, and I wasn't wrong, but I am having quite a hard time deciding what route to go. Currently, I am doing a consulting project and a small consulting internship (the only things I could find since I switched last minute) during this summer, and I find it alright, but consulting doesn't seem to have the exit opportunities and pay potential that I want. Additionally doing a BMC course and, hopefully, a financial modeling course by the end of the summer. I am from a low-income family, so money is pretty important for me, but I also want something that at least gives me a DECENT (not even great, just at least decent) work/life balance.

I am willing to put in the work and networking, but I am just not sure what route I want to go. I have thought about IB considering my school, but it has a horrible work-life balance and seems to be extremely oversaturated and competitive, at least at USC. I don't mind doing IB since I've heard that it's a great look on the resume because of the experience it puts you through, but I would rather do something I enjoy and have a better chance in especially since I'm behind on networking and don't have nepo of any sort. So basically I have been stressing about this all summer and need to figure it out so I can go into next sem working towards something rather than nothing.

All I know, though, is that I need a career that compensates fairly high but isn't oversaturated/overcompetitive. Should I just go into IB for a few years and deal with it until I exit, or should I do something else? Please send any suggestions.

ALSO, if anyone has any tips for specific things I should do in my position to improve my resume/help me get an internship or opportunity for the upcoming summer, whether it's for finance in general or a specific career, I would appreciate it.",Pristine-College-411,1,1.0,1,1751089051,2025-06-28 05:37:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmf77p/finance_careers/,6,2025
1lmf5fw,I want to switch out of CS. Parents won't let me. Advice please!,"I just finished my freshman year at a pretty solid university for Computer Science but I HATE it. I do not enjoy coding (my brain just does not work this way). I WILL do it if I have to, but this is exactly what I do NOT want to do in the future. The thing is my parents keep trying to convince me to stay and shut down options of me switching my major. The acceptance rate for CS at my school is \~2% which doesn’t matter to me, but matters to them about the prestige of it. Business acceptance rate around 30%. 

I want to do something business related, even like a business-tech. But they even shut down the idea of going to Information Systems (the only tech related business my school offers). Ive brought up the idea of doing IS and keeping a CS major, but they keep telling me to stay in CS because they say the degree is more valuable. (One parents is IS/ Finance and the other, marketing/ tech). They say I can go into Business-Tech with a CS major, which I think is true? At this point I think my best option is to now just graduate and stick with this CS degree and do a masters in Information Systems  if I can’t find a job that I actually like. Or I can even do a CS major right now and an Entrepreneurship minor. My school does not offer an IS minor, and that entrepreneurship the closest business minor to something sort of relevant to what I want to do. 

They do genuinely care for me, but at this point I am of a state of confusion and this whole dilemma is honestly making me hate CS more. When asking them why I should go into CS, they understand the competitive market, but they believe that I can overcome the market and still be successful. I have no idea what my field is going to look like in 3 years. 

I love my parents and of course want to make them happy, after all they are paying for my education. I am willing to stick with this major as long as there are different avenues that I can go down. Does anyone have personal experience of graduating with a CS degree and then doing something more on the business side and non-coding?

BTW: I have applied to several internships over the past couple months, and have also heard nothing which may be why I am rethinking my choices (aka going through a crisis). I also was an athlete for my school, but have stepped away from it to focus on my studies - so I do plan on joining clubs/ programs for both CS and Business next year. 

Any advice? Thanks!",Practical_Neat_2839,6,0.8799999952316284,42,1751088862,2025-06-28 05:34:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmf5fw/i_want_to_switch_out_of_cs_parents_wont_let_me/,6,2025

Would it be impolite for me to ask for a potential raise?

1lmeba9,"Everyone around me is earning more, when will I reach 1 Lac/month?","Hi all,

I had a bit of a reality check today. I told a friend my salary ~₹7.5 LPA CTC, ₹55K in hand~ and her reaction made me second-guess everything. Until now, I thought it was okay, especially since I just transitioned from Sales to a Data Analyst role 3 months ago. The switch meant starting fresh, so my salary didn’t grow.

In Sales, I had incentives, so the low fixed pay never bothered me. But now, with no extras, it's hitting me. People around me are earning much more, and suddenly ₹55K feels like not enough. I’m anxious and wondering how long it’ll take to hit ₹1L/month. That now feels like the bare minimum, but also a faraway goal.

I’m 23 and don’t want to be earning ₹14–15L at 26–27. I can't afford a regular MBA right now but I’m considering an Executive MBA in 2–3 years to grow faster.

Would love advice on:

Is this normal post-switch anxiety or should I be worried?

How can I realistically scale to ₹1L+/month?

Will an Executive MBA help in the long run?

Any alternate paths I should explore?

1lmeb4m,Guilt about wanting to change jobs,"I am the director for a department for a sub entity of a hospital.  For over 60 years, my entity has operated independently (different computer systems, different accounting, HR, maintenance, etc ..), and has done very well.  I left my previous job (it was a horror show) and was hired as the director where I'm at now a little over a year ago.  I've loved it, with only a few hiccups here and there, but nothing major.  My boss is awesome, the other people I work with are pretty good, and the work is pretty easy.

The hospital has had a substantial loss the last few years (our place has been profitable) and has hired a new CEO.  About 3 months ago, the hospital system announced that they were going to be migrating to new software, which will cost quite a bit more per year, and also will be evaluating redundant departments amongst all of their entities, mine included.  We've been told nothing outside of that, other than that nobody knows what will happen.

Recently, about the last month, signs began to point to some redundant positions being moved to the hospital and others.....maybe not.  Again, it's been very hush, and not allot of information from the hospital leadership being disseminated to our leadership to push down to us (just silence on what the plan actually is).  The hospital already has a director of their same department as mine, as well as a supervisor, both of which have been with the hospital for over 20 years.

With all of that, I started looking, and applied for and received a very nice offer from a place that's another 7 minute drive from my current place.  I accepted and am very excited.

When I told boss, he completely understood, as he is frustrated with the lack of communication from the hospital.  At the end of our conversation, he asked if there was anything that he or the hospital might be able to do to keep me there (he believes that I am a good employee and would like to see me stay).  As I mentioned above, I like my boss.  In a short time, I've come to think very highly of him professionally.  He truly believes in me.

The issue is, I don't fully trust the hospital to keep me or others around after implementation of the new software and integrating our processes.  With them spending an exorbitant amount of money on the new software while posting losses, it would seem very odd to keep everyone they currently have across all entities.  I've been assured that I am part of the long term plan, I just cannot envision it.

Ultimately, my delima is this - leaving for the new job, or staying where I am at purely out of respect for my boss.  I feel like I am turning my back on him if I leave, but I am afraid if I stay, I may regret it (by either not liking whatever my new role would be, or being let go after a year or two).

I hope I've done a good enough job at explaining everything.  I appreciate any advice or input anyone may have.",mj8780,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1751085836,2025-06-28 04:43:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmeb4m/guilt_about_wanting_to_change_jobs/,6,2025
1lme3ir,Lack of respect,"I’m trying to understand to the best of my ability and maybe I’m looking at it from the wrong angle.

Me(28) team I work for man(31) and woman (57). I then have a manager as well. When I first started working for this team it was going really well, the lady never worked in office which was fine but me and the lead guy would communicate a lot and things were good. All of the sudden over time things shifted very poorly. He stopped coming into the office and pretty much talking to everyone. If he came in the office and talked to people it was a shock. Doesn’t greet goodmorning, doesn’t communicate with me and instead just goes straight to the manager. I do work directly with him and he would rather complain to my manager, not give her all the details then having a weekly meeting with me. My manager also just accepts this and says it is what it is. 

I feel confused and blind sided all the time. The woman is slightly better but not really. I’m the only person in the entire office that is personally asked to drop papers off to their car because they can’t come into the office and grab them. It feels belittling and degrading to be honest. 

It’s only getting worse and I feel like I’m getting a slap in the face. I’m not sure what would be next to make it even worse. ",daisyrose44,1,1.0,1,1751085092,2025-06-28 04:31:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lme3ir/lack_of_respect/,6,2025
1lmdkif,Got a 20% raise… but was quietly demoted and replaced. Feeling very confused and down,"Hi all, I’d really appreciate some outside perspective on a tough situation I’m in right now.

For the past year, I’ve been leading a complex, high-impact product initiative, full ownership across vision, roadmap, delivery, and cross-functional coordination. It’s been intense and honestly the hardest year I’ve endured at work. I’ve fought with all my might to keep the project going and help my team as much as I could. I was formally promoted during that time, operating at a leadership level.

A few weeks ago, I was removed from that role and the ownership was given to a colleague who, frankly, has been fighting with me for over a year about decisions in the project. He’s been consistently difficult to work with abrasive, often dismissive, and has a reputation across teams for poor collaboration. He always blames others even if his technical tasks have all been done very badly (think about migration scripts done incorrect and pushed to production with no QA, terrible syncs, etc). Even my own team has noticed and expressed frustration. He’s also been very vocal about wanting my job, to the point where he made a PowerPoint presentation pitching himself for it. I think leadership values him and he is passionate about leading and making decisions.

Leadership gave him the role. I was told this that they “need me elsewhere,” and that I’m key for this other part of the business (which is very strategic as they have merged the two main business lines into one). It does relate to what I was doing as I have to connect now the main business lines to the operational project I’ve been leading until now. They gave me a 20% raise and added a “lead” title, but at the same time, I’ve been excluded from all leadership chats. I’m still involved in strategic discussions and decisions for three business lines (think about taking decisions and creating roadmaps), but I’m no longer part of high-level leadership planning.

To make things harder, this all happened while my former boss, who I’d built a lot with and had a strong working relationship with, is on maternity leave. The timing has left me feeling even more unsupported.

I’ve tried to stay reflective. I know I’m not perfect, and I’ve asked for honest feedback on what I could’ve done differently. But every time I ask, they just say they’re very happy with my performance, they need me, and I’m “important” to this new team. No concrete explanations. Just praise… paired with a visible demotion in structure and influence. I feel shrunk.

Despite the praise, the actions haven’t matched the words. I’m still excluded from leadership conversations, and the person who openly campaigned to take over my role now owns the project I built, while I’ve been moved where I feel sidelined after working weekends and trying to do everything I can to keep things afloat.

I’ve started sending CVs to other places, I’m very hurt. I’m trying not to get emotional over it but frankly I’ve been struggling. Of course I’m giving my best to my new team and I’m trying to take it as professionally as I can.

Any perspectives or stories are welcome. Thanks for reading.",demonfuzz_,25,0.9399999976158142,23,1751083273,2025-06-28 04:01:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lmdkif/got_a_20_raise_but_was_quietly_demoted_and/,6,2025

1lmd2h8,I'm 17 and I just dont know what to do anymore.,"I'm sorry in advance if this is a long post. But please bear with me.

From the title, I am a 17 years old girl who just doesn't know what to do in her life anymore. I've never been this lost, and I've never felt so empty ever. 

For context, I love arts, I love everything about it ever since I was 3. Its my love and its been my passion until now. So I figured, why not do 3D animation in games when I grow up? Maybe make a company where I could even treat fellow artists well especially with all the bad news regarding jobs in arts now. 

I've also made money doing art commissions, and used it to help my family when we were struggling. And I was so proud of it, I believed and my family believed that I will grow up to be an amazing and successful artist someday. I also got into an art related Strand in senior high, so that's that. I've heard a lot of positive things about me from teachers, peers and friends. And I'm so proud of that.
 
Fast forward, we moved into another country because my dad got an opportunity for his job and we also have plans to move into Canada next where I will go to college soon. I'm still 12th grade right now.

Today, my father received a call from my aunt (she's amazing and cares about me a lot btw)
She wanted me to go to Canada for college, then I heard something about ""We know someone doing arts rn, with a lot of experience, diploma and everything, but they dont have a job. So I think you should talk to your daughter and ask her to reconsider to do nanotechnology because we're worried for her future.""

And that line alone made me feel...empty, like I didn't even know what to think, feel or how to react anymore it's like I expected it.

Of course, Im a thoughtful kid dont get me wrong, Ive asked hundreds of people (or rather read about the pros and cons of jobs relating animation rn, it's oversaturated, ai crisis and all that) but I've also read about the people who do get a job. And that alone, has made me overthink over these past few weeks, and has made me scared of my own future. But is it really impossible? Ik that ai wont COMPLETELY take over, and that I need to put in the actual work for me to get a decent job. And that I needed to be the best of the best because, art is a competitive thing now that all the cons are up.

Im also diabetic, so expenses in life for me is kinda a little expensive. And I've been scared.

I've asked my friends for advice, and they all tell me I should never give up on my dream. But words now are practically nothing.

I've been meaning to go into a confession or to get advice from a priest (Im not religious, but might as well try, Im in need of really, really desperate advice)

I dont know what else to do, because I cannot see myself doing anything other than arts.

On the good side, they told me I could pursue arts, just after I get a job so Im guaranteed that I wont get hungry.

But I dont know anything else. I can't see myself in another thing. I've never felt so empty in my entire life. And I sincerely would not wish this on someone else.

I dont have any body else I can ask.

So if someone out there has any advice, please comment, because I seriously cannot take it with the amount of pressure Im putting myself in rn. This is by no means force, but I would love to hear from anybody out there. Thank you sm.

1lmbf41,“What do you think of HR as a career? Does it pay well?”,"HR as a career can be both rewarding and dynamic. It’s no longer limited to administrative work — modern HR includes talent acquisition, employee engagement, HR analytics, training and development, and strategic workforce planning.

From what I’ve explored through an online HRM certificate course offered by ILMS Academy, I realized how diverse and impactful HR roles are in real-world organizations.

Salary-wise:
	•Entry-level HR roles may start modestly, but as you move into areas like HR Business Partner, L&D Manager, HR Analytics, or Compensation & Benefits, the pay becomes quite competitive.
	•HR professionals with digital skills (HR tech tools, data analysis, etc.) are especially in demand.

So i think If you’re someone who enjoys working with people, solving organizational problems, and contributing to company culture, HR could be a great fit.

I hope the above shared information would be helpful.

1lm9uhm,"Struggling between Digital Marketing and Software Engineering – what should I do? (Sri Lanka, recent grad)","Hi everyone,

I’d really appreciate some honest advice from anyone in tech, career development, or anyone who's been through a similar situation

🧑‍💻 My Background:

I’m from Sri Lanka.

I’ve completed both a Diploma and Higher National Diploma (HND) in Software Engineering.

Due to some personal issues, I had to repeat a few modules — but I got through it and stayed committed.

I’ve worked on projects in Flutter, React, and Java, and uploaded them on GitHub & LinkedIn.

⚠️ The Problem:
After graduating, I spent two months applying for software internships and junior roles.

But:

The job market here is saturated

Most internships are unpaid, and

I just couldn’t afford to stay unemployed any longer.

 My Current Situation:

Since I had already done Google Digital Marketing certificates, I pivoted into that and landed a Digital Marketing internship at a reputable company (WPP Group).

The internship is actually good — great people, solid learning experience, and they even gave me a laptop.

But I still feel strongly about Software Engineering. It’s what I love and where I want to end up long-term.

💸 Financial Reality:

I don’t come from a financially strong background. I need to earn and build a stable career as soon as possible — which is why I took the marketing route for now.

❓ The Dilemma:

What should I do?

1. Stick with digital marketing, try to grow in that field and stabilize myself first?


2. Or keep building software projects on the side, and slowly fight my way back into tech — even if it takes longer and I have to juggle both?

I'm willing to hustle — work extra hours, freelance, study more — but I just don’t want to make the wrong long-term decision.

If anyone’s been through this or works in hiring, tech, or even digital marketing, I’d love to hear your take. What would you do in my position?",sigreiden,1,1.0,1,1751071191,2025-06-28 00:39:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lm9uhm/struggling_between_digital_marketing_and_software/,6,2025

1lm8ms0,What should a Warehouse Operations Manager do?,"I am a 54-year-old white male working as a warehouse operations manager in a food-grade warehouse. I didn't focus on my education until later in life, at which point I earned an MBA. I want to move forward in my career, but I feel stuck.

Although I have gained significant experience, my loyalty to this company may have hindered my progress. They rely on a makeshift warehouse management system created by an executive about 15 years ago, which has been poorly maintained. I hold a green belt in lean six sigma, but I haven't been able to implement any projects because my leadership team doesn't recognize their value. The corporate safety and compliance manager told me in front of the COO and CTO that lean six sigma is ineffective at this company, and the executives didn't react at all. I find this to be one of the most foolish statements I've ever heard.

I have four supervisors whom I am trying to encourage to take responsibility for their areas by having them conduct employee reviews, enforce safety regulations, maintain cleaning tasks, and develop their own departmental metrics or utilize the metrics tools I have created for them. However, the corporate office, located on the opposite coast, does not see any value in these initiatives.

One of the most annoying aspects is the employee reviews. I believe they are important because my team has an average of 2.5 years of experience, compared to the main warehouse's average of 12 years. I have taken matters into my own hands and conducted the reviews anyway, as I think it's essential for my supervisors to connect with their teams. I suspect my corporate office knows about this to some extent, but if they had to officially recognize that I was doing it, I would likely be instructed to stop.

The most recent frustration comes from our attendance and tardiness policy, or rather the lack of it. This company released a new employee handbook after more than 10 years and sent it to the lawyers in my state to make sure it was ready. Naturally, it includes a clause in the attendance section stating that the company can change anything they want at any time. My location has many attendance problems, so I was eager to implement this policy. However, as soon as I started, employees began calling the independent hotline. Now, management has issued new guidelines. Employees receive a 15-minute grace period each day. They are not considered late unless they arrive 16 minutes late. They must have two occurrences before the attendance policy takes effect. After the third occurrence, they receive a verbal warning. If an employee spaces this out due to the rolling 30-day timeline, they could be late by 16 minutes or more up to 10 times in a calendar year before facing termination. I have briefly mentioned the drawbacks of this basic attendance policy to my manager and the corporate human resources manager, but they simply respond with, 'things happen.'

My team works an 8-hour day. Employees are only at work for 8 hours because they don't have to clock out for lunch. An employee at my site can clock in 15 minutes late without any penalty, take two 15-minute breaks, and have a 30-minute lunch along with a 15-minute clean-up at the end of their shift. I forgot to mention that I thought I had some control over the employees for being late since our time management system rounds to the next 15-minute mark. So, if they clock in at 6:02, they wouldn't start getting paid until 6:15. The company decided we can't even do that. If an employee clocks in at 6:15, they still get paid for that first 15 minutes. Also, because the system rounds forward, I've had to inform employees that they need to clock out anywhere from 15 to 1 minute before their shift ends, as clocking out right at the end will give them 15 minutes of overtime. An employee who is paid for 8 hours may only actually be working for 6 hours and 15 minutes.

My manager and HR say their boss instructed them to do this. I've thought about going to the COO regarding this, but it might not be wise.

Additionally, I lead the safety team at my facility, and I frequently have team members approach me with best practices from other warehouse jobs, like wearing steel toe boots and high visibility vests. My company doesn't provide those items at their main facility and has no plans to allow me to have them at mine. I feel this puts me in a difficult position since I'm caught in the middle.

There are many other issues, but I won't bore you with them. I definitely feel like I need to move on.

Any thoughts?",Cobra-Dane-28,1,1.0,0,1751067639,2025-06-27 23:40:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lm8ms0/what_should_a_warehouse_operations_manager_do/,6,2025
1lm7lok,I don’t know how to deal with this situation,"
I’m employed as a softwer dev by a company that has me working for another company, where I’ve been with the same team and project for almost two years now. I hadn’t felt this comfortable or liked a project this much in a long time, and just yesterday they called me in a rush asking for my CV ASAP because I’m probably going to be moved to another project.

I’m not sure if it’s with the company that employs me or the one I work for, but either way, it means changing my current project and team. They haven’t given me any reasons, and even my manager was surprised — which at least comforts me a bit because I get along well with him, we work well together, and he doesn’t want me to leave.

He says it’s probably due to a lack of funding for this project, where they’ve hired four new people this year. Since I earn more than those colleagues, I assume they’re moving me because of that. Another theory is simply that they need me more urgently elsewhere.

In any case, I’m feeling both sad and angry because this came out of nowhere, and it’s clear we’re just assets they move around without thinking about anything other than money (and sometimes not even that, since this project is very complex and the new people are juniors).

I don’t know how to face this situation other than asking for a raise or begging not to be taken off this project. And to top it all off, I just got a Teams notification about an interview today at 1 PM, and nobody even told me anything. I haven’t been given any more information so far, and the project manager is out until Monday.

I'm a bit nervous  :)

1lm7i34,Switching Careers from Science to humanity as a 26 year old,"I'm 25 and want to switch careers — is it too late? (Background in pharmacy, but I feel lost)

Hey everyone,
I’m 25 and have a master’s degree in pharmacy — but honestly, I never connected with this field. I only did it because of family pressure. My father runs a pharma business and had certain plans for me, but I’ve never been interested. Science started feeling like a burden after school, and COVID just made everything worse. I lost 3 years of my bachelor’s to lockdowns, then ended up doing a disappointing master’s from a government college. (No offense, but the experience was horrible.)

Now, after 6 years in this field, I feel completely directionless. I don’t know if I should do a PhD, get a job, or switch fields entirely. The thought of continuing in pharmacy honestly suffocates me.

The subjects I’m actually interested in are:

Hindi/Urdu/English literature

History, anthropology, and comparative religion


These have always fascinated me, but I never had the space to explore them seriously. Is it normal to want to switch careers at 25? Is there any scope in India for these fields? I’m ready to put in the work if I can find a clear direction, but I need help figuring that out.

Anyone here who made a similar switch or works in one of these fields — I’d love to hear your experience or advice.

1lm6z6m,Political Science major in career limbo.,"Hopefully this doesn't violate rule one. I'm keeping it strictly career related.

So I'm a political science major, I'll be a senior in college this year. My ideal career is definitely in policy making. My grades are solid, and I'm attending a very well respected university. I've tried to to find internships, and have only had one that I left on very good terms. Other attempts at gaining internships, however, have resulted in rejection. Sometimes I can get as far as an interview, but that's it.

I've revised my resume and cover letter several times to the point where the people who I've had review it have said it's one of the best resumes and cover letter they've read. I've also secured two really good references. 

I've been applying to jobs on Indeed and LinkedIn non-stop the past few months and have yet to even hear back. I'm really starting to worry, especially with how bad the job market has been getting. The only back up plan I have formulated is to get a low skill job just to pay the bills and volunteer for a political group, or see if I can get a part time, unpaid internship. But that's really the only thing that I can think off. And I'm worried I won't be able to make any progress.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for what else I could be doing? Specifically, if there's anything about my approach that I can fix or if I'm looking in the wrong places.

I would like some career advice concerning my situation.

I am a 28 year old guy with both a master's degree in mathematics and another one in mechanical engineering. While studying, i managed to gather a 4 years of total experience as a working student in general software development (Backend/Frontend/Datascience/Embedded Systems/Simulations/Machine learning).

After my studies i got into embedded systems development out of pure curiousity for two years. The work was fine, but i always had the presumption that i was not doing what i could. The job also paid 55k. After 2 years, i quit, for another job in software development. This time however, a math degree was required. For 3 years of experience full time experience and 4 years of working student, i am getting paid 60k. Had to take the job because of this crappy economic situation here in Europe. 

Problems:
- I am incredibly underpaid for my age, for my skills, for my knowledge.
- The company i work at, is very small and archaic in multiple ways. For most of the employees, this is their first actual jobs and they don't know what they are actually doing. 

Question:
I really hate myself right now, as i feel like i am circling a drain and not going anywhere in life, despite working extremely hard all my life. Worst is, my old university mates, that went into finance from just the math degree are considerably earning more than me. Basically everyone is earning more than me.

What would you sugest someone with a master degree in math and another in mechanical engineering could do to better their careers?

1lm4xq5,"Planning on swapping careers, I used to do 3D modeling","Hey, I do 3D modeling for a game company for a living, I loved it a lot. It was always something I was passionate about. But as I'm sure you know, Ai Generation has been taking over, either it's a fad or not. I can't really say, but my company has been very enforceful for me to use it.
And I have used it but, it has completely sucked out the joy of my work. I worked at this career for years because I loved it.

But these Ai tools, have done nothing but made my work flow slower, my work has become sloppier and I spend more time fixing things than making things.
I've tried to have an open mind about it, but after using these tools for 6 months. I've lost my enjoyment, I want to go back to how I worked things, but my company insist I use these tools I don't enjoy using.

A lot of Our 2D art staff was let go of out of nowhere, lost a lot of people I enjoyed working with. And now we have some new hires that use Ai tools. And it's clear they have no passion in this industry. We've swapped people in the 2D division at least twice now because the results they produced was sloppy or didn't help with the 3D team. 
You ever heard of the term ""you can feel the love on the paper"" for artists. These people, have no love. Hell I even asked a few of the new hires why they are even here to begin with. And they said it's because of the money. I'm gonna be honest, we don't make much money in this job. If I was here for just the money, I would be in a different career. 
But now I'm hearing rumors that they might start cutting off the 3D team for more Ai generation staff. 
If this what the future holds, then I don't see myself enjoying or working in this field anymore, every time I asked the others in my field, they either feel the same as I do, or the Ai generation team often act unempthaic, and often tell me to ""adapt or die""
Well I'm gonna be honest, what's the point of adapting, if these tools often produce worse results or slow me down or suck the enjoyment out of it.

I'm a firm beliver of ""if you love your job, you won't work a day in your life"". I hear so many people live miserable lives because they often force themselves to work at a place they don't enjoy. And that they are only in it for the money.
I don't need much money to be happy, I'm a simple guy to please. All I care about is working at a place I enjoy, and provide enough funds to pay the bills and support my family. 
And honestly if you know how to manage your money well responsibly. It really doesn't take that much.
But now the point, does anyone know what career I could transfer too with my skill set? I do a lot of 3D modeling of all aspects including animation and I even can do video editing.

TL:DR
I do 3D modeling for a game company and I also do animation for 3D in this company and video editing as a hobby. but I need to transfer careers due to the curtain environment being unstable or unsustainable for my path. As my higher ups are forcing me and my co workers to do things that have honestly hurt us.
What career can I transfer my skillsets too
I'm willing to take classes for a degree or trade if needed.
I believe in working hard and smart for success, and I'm ok with making just a realsitic amount of money.
I'm more focused on working for something I enjoy and passionate about than having a crazy amount of money.

Hi everyone,

I just completed my 12th grade (PCB stream), and I’m feeling really confused about what path to choose next. I have a few options in front of me, but I’m unsure which one aligns best with my future goals and interests.

1. BSc Agriculture – Seems practical and has decent government/private job options after MSc. My parents think it's a safe and respectable path.


2. Biotechnology – I find it interesting but I’ve heard job opportunities can be limited unless I go for research or higher studies.


3. Drop a year for MBBS – I didn't crack NEET this time. I’m not sure if I should take a drop and prepare again. I’m scared of wasting another year without guaranteed success.


4. Animation – I absolutely love creative work. I enjoy painting, storytelling, and even want to start a YouTube or Instagram art page. But my parents are very academic and don’t take animation seriously. They worry about job security.



I feel pulled in different directions — one part of me wants to play it safe and make my parents proud, while another part wants to chase something more creative and fulfilling.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How did you choose your path? Any advice would be appreciated.

1lm4fbu,How can I navigate my Vet Med job?,"I need advice. 
Im currently in school to become a Vet Tech and have completed 1 of 2 years of school. This program is accelerated drastically, most programs are 3-4 years before one take the VTNE. Part of the program requires externships so I started an externship at a Veterinary practice and loved it! For those who may not know an externship is like an internship but does not have to be paid and requires certain skills are learned and checked off.
Anyway the Vet practice hired me and I’m so lucky to have found this job. They pay well and are a specialty practice so I’m doing more then just vaccines and annual check up type of vet assistant work. 
Most of the staff has been patient and aware of my need to train and learn. And then there’s the team members that have inspired me to come to Reddit for advice.
I’ve noticed at work every department has at least one or two members who are just unapproachable, like I can’t do anything right around them. They nit pic, over explain and dismiss me very fast with no check ins to assure me. I guess I’ll give some examples. I was told to take vitals and a tech insisted on taking over half way through. The same tech dismissed me from restraining a cat for a blood draw after requesting someone else hold in the first place. The same tech also corrected me putting a syringe on the table instead of leaving it in the wrapper, it was a silly mistake on my part but this turned into a 5 minute discussion and I felt embarrassed and harped on. 
My approach to this so far is do what I’m good at and just keep my head down and speak when I’m spoken to and ask just a few questions if I have to. I’ve only been working in this department a week so I think I’m still safe to ask questions without being annoying. I have one more week in this department before moving on to the next. So things should get better.
A few years ago I was fired from a Vet Assistant job because I was so discouraged and scared of doing things wrong I was never able to learn and thrive. So I went back to school and wanted to get into this career with more experience (and for my baby girl) But so far school hasn’t covered a lot of applicable matter for my job.
The job has given me a lot of material to go through and I’m going to be eating it up and processing it and I also have tasks that need signing off by them, hopefully they allow me to try more hear and there but I feel written off in this particular department despite doing well with assisting during procedures among other things. 
As I write this I see I’m really in my own head and it’s not that bad. And I completely appreciate that this is a medical job with a very right and wrong way to do things. And I know these animals are real patients that deserve quality care. But how should I approach a situation where I feel psyched out or nit picked by the team? Have any other training tech’s experienced this? 
And before I get advice about how or when to ask a question trust me I pick time and place very carefully. And as a “to the point” person myself I don’t mind when people are blunt or snappy. I do mind when people act as though I’m too simple to instruct. I guess I mainly wanna know if this is an expected energy in vet med? I’ve had a stomach ache before each shift over it. Otherwise I LOVE the work and helping animals and their families.

1lm46zq,Have I messed up? I'm not sure what to do next,"Hello, I am based in the northeast of the UK, I graduated almost 2 years ago in Renewable Energy Engineering with a BEng (Hons), after graduating I became a full-time carer for a family member as I was the only one who could, I did this until the end of March of this year. I started looking for a job within the energy or renewable industry soon after but I'm struggling to find one, I'm applying for any trainee, entry, and graduate schemes I can find within the area, I've had 3 interviews in which they all said I did great but they chose a candidate with more experience. I know I'm still young (23) so maybe it's silly, but I'm worried I've ruined my life by not looking for a job straight after graduating, as I feel like many of my skills have deteriorated since University. I've recently started doing online courses on websites such as FutureLearn and Alison and also created a LinkedIn profile. While caring I did delve into copywriting and made some cash on the side but my dream is to work within the renewable industry as I'm very passionate about making the world greener. I'm just not sure what to do next to progress in my career. Thanks for reading, any advice would be appreciated.

1lm46b2,Advice on a Interview Process,"Hey everyone, 

Just wanted to get some outside perspective and maybe a little reassurance. I applied for a position and I passed the phone interview, and even though I asked for a bit more pay than was listed, the interviewer told me there might be wiggle room for the right candidate.

Last week, I went in for what I thought would be a formal in-person interview but instead, they just gave me a walkthrough of the warehouse. No real questions, just showing me what the role looked like. It actually made me feel hopeful. They told me I was the last person they were interviewing and thanked me for coming in.

Then today, I got a call from the interviewer’s boss. He said that they “spoke very highly of me” and that they have “a couple positions available” for me. We’re supposed to meet Tuesday to go over them, but he didn’t say what the positions are.

Now I’m spiraling a bit. 😅
	•	Does this mean the Parts Clerk role is filled and they’re offering me something else?

	•	Or is this actually a good sign and they’re just trying to find the best spot for me?

Has anyone else experienced something like this?

I really want to make the right move and just want to know how to handle Tuesday’s conversation without sounding pushy but also not getting stuck in a role I don’t want.

1lm4345,How do I know if I'm on the right path?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a senior accounting student, and I've had a bit of a non-traditional path getting to this point. I played college football for two years, which honestly took up a lot of my focus. I started at a D2 school, then went to a junior college where I earned my Associate's in Accounting & Finance. I finally decided to hang up the cleats in 2023 and transferred to my current university in August 2024, where I'm set to graduate in 2026.

I've got two internships under my belt already: a Business Management internship at the largest shipbuilding company in the U.S., and a Program Management internship at a privately owned shipbuilding company. I'm just now really getting into the swing of career planning, which feels a bit late, but I'm catching up!

I have two more internships lined up at mid-sized public accounting firms, which I'm excited about. I also recently interviewed for an internship at BNY Mellon, and I'm really hoping to land that one, possibly to replace one of my accounting internships.

Honestly, I've been spending a lot of time on Reddit, and I've been a bit fear-mongered into thinking accounting will be super boring and draining. So, I'm looking for some real advice in any of these topics:

1. **Experiences in Accounting:** What are your experiences working in the accounting profession?
2. **Career Transitions:** What's it like transitioning out of public accounting into more finance-like roles, or moving into industry? Any advice or stories there?
3. **Realistic Salary Expectations:** This is a big one for me. I grew up borderline in poverty(single mom with three boys, definitely not middle class), so while I'm incredibly grateful for any salary I can get, I'm also aiming high to set myself and my mom up well for the future. What are some realistic salary expectations for someone with my background and trajectory?

Any advice or shared experiences would be amazing. Thanks so much to anyone who reads this!",One_Click5735,1,1.0,2,1751055742,2025-06-27 20:22:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lm4345/how_do_i_know_if_im_on_the_right_path/,6,2025

1lm3e7e,Leave after 4 months?,"Need some advice. Started a job in HR at a bank 4 months ago after working in the auto insurance industry with 2 other businesses over the past 10 years. I feel like I have made a mistake  accepting this new job. 

The new HR job started good learning new things, making more money etc. But the red flags started coming out soon after starting. My new boss is quite creepy calling me a smart girl and just gives me a weird vibe like you don’t want to be alone in a room with them. My boss also likes to discuss politics with other employees and religion. This is the head of HR! 

The person that is supposed to be training me started off good but now I started asking to learn more and take on more responsibility and she says let me think about it and then nothing. I spend 4-6 hrs during work trying to teach myself things or reading hr blogs but that gets old quick. 

I am also supposed to be learning how to do payroll but that is few and far between even when I ask to help. 

The turnover in this new company is extremely high 22 people in the last 2 months with only roughly 380 people in the whole company. 

The amount of gossip around just the HR department talking negatively about employees is an everyday occurrence. 

I asked if they do employee satisfaction surveys and they haven’t in the last 3-4 years. 

Pay raises are around 20-50 cents that I have seen. 

Very conservative dress code, suit coats, ties, no tattoos or piercings, no died hair beyond a natural color. None of this was mentioned in the interview when I asked. 

Should I stick it out and just enjoy doing nothing and getting paid or start looking elsewhere? 

Will this look bad on my resume a short stint like this?

1lm2rhv,Poverty to Corporate: Can’t Fit In,"I’m curious whether anyone else has had a similar experience or would have any advice for me.

Quick background: white 21F,  poor background, factory working family from grandparents to parents to cousins to siblings, was good at school, valedictorian, practically pushed to go to college to not “waste my smarts,” did well through soph year, got a competitive corporate internship, got a repeat offer, here i am now in that 2nd internship (different team, peers, department)

Last year, i didn’t connect with anyone. Despite usually being a social butterfly (at all my part-time jobs at Walmart/Restaurants, I’m known as the moodmaker and i’m always chatting and smiling, very well-loved by coworkers.), I was really intimidated by the professional environment, didn’t like talking about weather/sports or gossiping about my coworkers, so let myself just clock in and clock out without really networking. 

But this summer, for my repeat internship, I came in so excited to be intentional with my peers in particular. Last year, the feedback from an anonymous form I got was things like “speak up more” or “share your opinions” — so I came in fully attempting to be myself: positive, cheery, enthusiastic (though toned down for the professional environment). 

It is met with the same. Gossiping behind my back, not laughing at jokes I make (but laughing at a male intern’s when they’re cut from the same cloth), small smiles exchanged among my peers when I’m speaking — like there’s an inside joke about me that I’m not in on. I’ve been vulnerable this summer, sharing deeper than surface-level things about myself to avoid small talk, supportive of them, finish all my work quick and well.

I guess I just don’t know if there’s some hidden communication in corporate that i’m not aware about, or some culture difference. I pay for everything myself (college, car, housing, food, etc.) and my peers usually don’t pay for any of those things and their parents are from corporate backgrounds, so maybe there’s disconnect there? 





Really trying to seek out what I can change because I can control that— but I also feel a little hurt that being myself isn’t … acceptable in the corporate world? I don’t know. What do you think? :)


TL;DR — HOW do I connect with coworkers and peers in a professional environment by being myself?",Safe_Highlight438,1,1.0,2,1751052458,2025-06-27 19:27:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lm2rhv/poverty_to_corporate_cant_fit_in/,6,2025

1lm0urm,Should I Leave My Comfortable Current Role for a New Opportunity with a Learning Curve? Need Advice!,"Hi all, I’m feeling super anxious and could use some perspective on a big career decision. I’ve been with my current company for 8 years since graduating college, and in my current senior-level role (no direct reports) for 3 years. I recently got a job offer from a more prestigious company, and I’m torn about whether to take it. Here’s the breakdown:

Current Role: •  Senior-level title, but no direct reports. •  45-minute commute each way, 5 days a week in-office. •  Very flexible manager when it comes to requesting time off. •  I’m comfortable, know the job inside and out, but feel like I’m not growing anymore.

New Role: •  Lesser title (not senior-level), but at a more prestigious company. •  3% salary increase and a potential 30% increase in yearly bonus. •  Involves areas (tech/cybersecurity) I’m not fully familiar with, so there’s a big learning curve. •  Likely more work and busier overall. The team works 24/7 around the clock but follows an “follow the sun” approach where team members around the globe will hand off to each-other based on time zones. •  Only a 5-minute commute and hybrid (3 days in-office, depending on the manager). •  I don’t know how flexible the new manager will be with time off until I start.

I’m really torn. On one hand, I think the change could be good for me mentally. I’ve been in the same company for 8 years, and while I’m comfortable, I feel stagnant and like I’m not growing. This new role could open doors to a new career path in tech/cybersecurity, which excites me but also scares me because of the unfamiliarity. I’m worried I might struggle with the learning curve or not perform well, and I don’t want to regret leaving a stable, comfortable job. The shorter commute and hybrid schedule are huge perks, but the unknown flexibility of the new manager makes me nervous since I value that in my current role. Has anyone faced a similar decision—leaving a comfortable job for a new challenge with some risks? How did you weigh the pros and cons? Any advice on managing the anxiety of a big career change or tackling a role with a steep learning curve? I’d really appreciate any insights or experiences you can share!

1lm0b37,My wife has anxiety about publicly speaking. How can we fix this?,"My Wife (30F) gets serious anxiety about publicly speaking in front of her whole company that has about 100 people. 

She’s currently a manager. She got promoted because she’s good at her job as an IC. She’s incredibly smart and talented. She's comfortable speaking to her small team of 5, but sometimes she encourters a list of problems I'll mention below.

Earlier this week her boss asked her to do a presentation in a company all hands and only gave her two days to prepare. My Wife declined and asked if she could present in the next one instead. She was super hard on herself and was frustrated about her inability to speak to an audience comfortbaly on short notice. I think that's tough expecation on herself but she disagress and wishes she was more like her manager. Her manager would be able to do the presentation on short notice so how can she be more like her manager?

I don't necessarily have this problem because I grew up as a theatre / drama kid so I was always performing in front an audience. Sometimes I still feel nervous when I have to present,but I can try to use that nervousness as an advantage and try to find a way to break the ice or something. Idk, I'm having hard time and I don't know how to help her. 

She has gone to therapy about this. Her therapist said everyone gets anxiety about public speaking and everyone also handles it differently. Her therapist has given her medication for anxiety and my Wife uses it, but it still doesn't help with the public speaking problem.

Here are the problems she experiences:

- Speaks fast, and is trying to rush everything she says and then she runs out of breath because she doesn't breath when she talks.
- Sometimes she'll freeze up. She doesn't tell her group or audience that she needs to think about the question, and then the awkard silence makes her uncomfortable and then she can't think, thus taking longer for her to talk.
- These two problems create a loop because she gets self-conscious and thinks she can tell that everyone else can tell that she's getting nervous. Thus making her more nervous + freeze up more. She's thinking too much about what other people think. I've tried to tell her no one cares, but it's hard for her because she's still nervous.  
- She hasn't analyzed this herself yet, but I think she just overthinks all of it. 

I've thought about signing up for an Improv class, but I don't know if that's the best answer. If you can offer any suggestions, that would be appreciated. The wikihow's on public speaking aren't helpful.

1llyoh4,Pay cut to leave toxic role,"Would you take a pay cut for a less toxic job role?

I’m currently at the management level in the aviation industry. My role has become incredibly toxic and has seriously affected my motivation, morale, mental and physical health at certain points.

I’m fairly close with a senior manager in the company, and as a potential solution, he’s offered me a supervisory position under him in a different department. There’s a possibility of being promoted back to a management-level role, equivalent to my current position but on another account. However, there’s no guarantee that this promotion will happen.

With this supervisor role, I would be taking a 12% annual pay cut.

Current role:
	•	$65,000 per year
	•	Limited opportunities for career advancement

Supervisor role:
	•	$57,500 per year
	•	Potential promotion to management at a $67,500 salary

Would you make the move? My main concern is that the pay cut is quite significant, and there’s no certainty the promotion in the other department will materialize.",J-LauCY,2,1.0,2,1751042632,2025-06-27 16:43:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llyoh4/pay_cut_to_leave_toxic_role/,6,2025
1llye3a,Terrible coworker is making me want to leave my job prematurely,"Hi everyone. I am at a loss for what to do and could use some advice. I'm hoping this subreddit will be a good starting point.

I am currently a receptionist at a financial firm. I have been here for over half a year and have noticed already that outside of busy season, there is not a lot to do. I have a counterpart that I work with that I have had problems with since week two. I can't go into much detail atm, but there has been bullying, harassment, etc. directed toward me. Our work ethics are also very different and that has caused me to lose a lot of trust in them because they mess up tasks frequently and give incorrect information to coworkers and clients which I feel I have to (and often do) fix. My training was abysmal because of this (they lied to me often at the beginning and omitted information so I can't trust anything I've been told), so I don't feel confident in many areas of my job. Most of which are areas I don't find out about until later when I'm asked to complete a task and have no idea how. 

A month ago, I started classes back up to finish my computer science degree and am looking to get a CompTIA A+ certificate in the fall to transition to IT. I have been interested in joining the IT team at my firm and was asked if I was interested, but it looks like that won't be a possibility until at least the start of next year. I have a LOT of downtime right now since we're not in a busy season, so I've tried to use my time wisely which my counterpart does not like and constantly questions me about.

I dread each day that I come in and have started to have nightmares about my coworker. I'm relieved when they're off work and all I want to do is get away when they're here. With a possible promotion now delayed and the tension building, I've been wondering if this is the right place for me. However, if I leave here, it will be the third job I've left since 2023. I've had short stints here and there since moving to a new city and I'm starting to wonder if I need to go to a different area, suck it up and just hold out, or start looking elsewhere. I love my boss and my other coworkers are great, but this one person is a thorn in my side that I'm forced to sit next to for 8 hours each day and I'm losing my sanity fast.

I've been looking into an autism diagnosis because I think that's where some of my issues are stemming from. I shut down pretty quickly when I need to process my emotions during heated discussions and I cannot handle how back and forth my coworker is. I also don't talk a lot and am pretty blank faced most of the time and that has angered my coworker. I have made several reports to HR and nothing has been done, so I'm starting to wonder if I just need to remove myself from the equation. Their attitude toward me and gossip has made me an outsider when I already have trouble with social situations at work. 

I want to go into IT/computer work, but I don't have the qualifications yet. I can tell I'm getting more unhinged as the days go on because of how grating it is to be at work. I've worked in a lot of different areas and have no clue what's right for me atm. The job I enjoyed the most was being an operations clerk at a warehouse. I did a lot of problem solving and computer work with few social interactions. I've wanted to go back, but there aren't any openings. I'm going for software engineering and am hoping to get a remote/hybrid job when I graduate, but I have a couple of years until then.

I make good money here, but at the end of the day I don't like most of what I do. Receiving phone calls all the time stresses me out, I have to be front and center in our firm, glass walls everywhere so I can't hide away until my lunch break, and all of the tasks are too easy which makes it worse that my coworker messes them up all the time. They talk down to me and treat me like a child which makes me angry, but I can't do much about it. I'm good at my job, but I'm constantly overshadowed by someone more talkative who takes work from me constantly unless they don't want it.

I'm just tired. I'm hoping I can get some advice on where to go/what to do. I can feel myself getting quieter and angrier by the day and I feel like if I have to stay up here much longer, I'm going to blow up and walk out. My boss is great, but they've expressed that they can only do so much and I worry that this is all I'll do if I stay.

TLDR; I work in a boring corporate job with an awful coworker and it's making me want to leave. I want to go into IT but don't have the qualifications yet to do so.",magleamae,3,1.0,6,1751041948,2025-06-27 16:32:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llye3a/terrible_coworker_is_making_me_want_to_leave_my/,6,2025

1llwfwn,I had an unfortunate day at my new job and my anxiety is eating me alive,"After nearly a decade in Canada, I am back in my native Denmark, having spent that time in order to ensure me and my partners life together.

I work a sort of niche information and communications technology role within the construction industry.

It was hectic coming back and after 6 months I’ve landed a dreamboat of a gig with a massive architecture and engineering company.

They set up a role other than what they initially where looking for, because my international qualifications meant they could use me fir their cross boarder outsourcing efforts - It’s an amazing opportunity to show your worth and I am 100% confident in my skills.

The people I’m in a team with are reserved Danish civil engineers… I am an animated life of the party type of person who seeks validation naturally, it’s an adjustment - That and most of my professional experience have been in North America and Danes are culturally veeeery different.

They do have a dry jokey sense of humor with each other and leading up to the upcoming week 28, 29 and 30 industry summer vacation weeks, we had a wrap up team meeting with a social event afterwards (Go-Carting).

My manager who has had my back reasonably asked me to do a couple of slides to make a little ‘hype’ for my presence to remind them my outsourcing is now a full time available asset for them, that can take off a massive work load for them and make their projects more profitable (It’s been ordered by high-up management, they are contingent on what I can help bring them in via savings by end of fiscal year already, they drastically need someone who can do what I do so that’s at least some security).

So I thought I’d try and join in on their colloquial fun and throw in some memes representing my team mates based on their ‘odd’ qualities that they had already talked about in jest with me etc. (The rolling eyes Downey Jr. meme for the self proclaimed grumpy guy etc. nothing derogatory of course) - And it just did not land what so fucking ever.

I actually got stink eye from a few people afterwards.

I then ran into traffic on the way to the event after and ran 10 mins late to the event space and apparently you needed a code to get into the area (it shares space with a sun panel farm), that was in the registration email. 

When I was there they had already started racing and after waiting for 40 minutes I gave up and drove home - I called my manager and explained and he didn’t seem peeved, he said yeah shit happens…

He just left for a month of summer leaving me with enough prepared work to occupy maybe 10% of my schedule, not a chance for a chat to clear the air and 11 coworkers who I was pretty sure hated my fucking guts.

I’ve personally reached out to two of them to explain that I am nervous and settling in and to please not judge me based on me putting my foot in my mouth - They said they hadn’t even thought of it and I believe them.

There where people that had a visceral reaction to my little performance though and I’m not sure where I stand with my manager when he’s back.

I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety and I ruminate over stuff like this to an unhealthy degree, I am self aware of that being the case - But managers out there, please put yourself in my manager’s shoes and look at me 1/3 into my probationary period, would you put it down to new work jitters? Would you worry about my integration into the team as a whole?

I’m 33. I was promoted to a manager role 3 years ago. We are evaluated yearly. My first evaluation went well. From year 2 onwards, things got complicated. I failed my evaluation last year and was told I’m on a path to fail again this year.
I’ve studied management and know without a doubt that my qualities would translate well in many fields of work. But where I am, it simply doesn’t fit and I’m aware of that. I’ve been told that since I’m still regarded as a great asset but a misfit for this particular role, I can be transferred back into my previous position. The pay is the same and that position is unionized, meaning my job security would be great.

1llp1py,Struggle with loss of my job and then finding a new one.,"I got fired from my job after 4+ years there. I always had amazing employee reviews. January we had a dept merge and then lay offs and laid off 3 people in our department. I had to take on two of those people’s jobs some of which admin. Everything was fine except the emails started getting more and more. Mid way through May I ended up graduated with my bachelors after working 10 years to complete. I wanted to take a break after but we were so busy and my new manager made me feel uncomfortable. But I did spent a little time away from the computer (remote work) because I was so burnt out. In 2 weeks I got a written warning (not formal) and then 3 days later I got fired for poor performance on 6/2 even though I worked 8-7 trying to make the work back. My manager told me I needed to take on more and I did which screwed me in the end. 

I’m having such a hard time. I’ve never been fired. I’m 33 and I feel so embarrassed and horrible like I’m not good enough. My confidence has gone down. And now with the job search I fear it’s getting worse. I’ve applied to over 80+ jobs and have gotten only 6 rejections but no interviews or let alone responses. My previous job rejected my unemployment and now my fiance is taking care of me during this time and we live in a very expensive area. I’m not sure what I am doing wrong. I’m looking at jobs now that are under me. From making $80k a year now looking at jobs that pay $22 an hour. I have no idea what to do. I was banking on my unemployment coming through because I was able to get different insurance to see a therapist through it. I’m tailoring every cover letter I send in. I’ve reworked my resume so many times to show more stuff I can do. My job was entry level but I’m not getting any responses. I’m not a pessimist- more a realist, but it’s slowly changing. I know when I have a bad outlook nothing will come my way. I worked in compensation and cross worked with the sales operations, finance and, hr team. I’m applying to anything that fits anything. Any advice is great.

1lloqh2,In existential career crisis | Job Experience on paper but not in real,"Worked 4 years odd jobs in marketing and communication- nothing fancy, just the usual content marketing, campaign management, content strategy, digital marketing, etc. 

Did MBA in Marketing but was during covid so couldn't land any marketing job so took campus placement in a pharma Analytics company. 

Worked there 3 years but they didn't let me work long enough on one project to learn it properly. Kept bouncing across multiple tools and datasets, and got fired this month because of bench policy. 

Now problem is whatever interviews I'm giving, because my CV says ""3 years in pharma analytics"", they're expecting expert-level knowledge of pharma datasets and exact step-by-step process of solving any problem (for example, exactly, which columns will you pick from any Dx, Rx, Px dataset to create solution for a client problem) whereas, like I mentioned before, I've been bounced around so much between datasets that I don't have knowledge of that much granularity- I can tell big and obvious columns like ICD code, Patient ID, date of Diagnosis, etc., but not that level which they're looking for (""I'll check for enough look-forward"", ""I'll check for historical patient activity"", etc.). 


I tried looking for same in both paid and free resources but apparently there aren't many interview trainings available on functional domain knowledge. 

I tried applying to other domains with only data analytics tools, but not even getting interview callbacks for those roles. 


So any resources or guidance on how can I learn about tackling deep-dive pharma analytics questions will be a big help. 🙏🏼",Strange-Campaign6013,2,1.0,2,1751013149,2025-06-27 08:32:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lloqh2/in_existential_career_crisis_job_experience_on/,6,2025
1lloq8k,Law Student→ M&A Consulting: Realistic Path or Pipe Dream?,"Hey r/consultingcareers! 👋

**TL;DR:** Law student with agriculture/business background wants to break into M&A transaction consulting. Need brutal honesty on feasibility + actionable advice.

**Background:**
- Currently pursuing LLB (2023-26) + Company Secretary qualification (Pursuing) 
- BSc Agriculture (2019-23) with decent academics (7.58 CGPA, top 20/140+)
- Legal internships focused on due diligence, regulatory compliance, and corporate law
- 3+ years equity/forex trading experience
- Strong research skills (legal databases, financial analysis)

**What I've Done So Far:**

✅ Legal internships with exposure to land due diligence for banks/PSUs

✅ Regulatory compliance research for healthcare companies

✅ Corporate law research (Companies Act sections, merger-related provisions)

✅ Currently pursuing Tech Law & Fintech Regulations diploma

✅ Trading experience with understanding of financial markets

**My Questions:**
1. **Is the law → M&A consulting transition realistic?** Most posts here are about traditional consulting paths (engineering/business majors)

2. **Which firms should I target?** Looking at Big 4 (Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, EY) vs boutique M&A shops vs legal consulting arms of major firms

3. **Skills gap analysis:** What am I missing? Should I focus more on:
   - Financial modeling/valuation
   - Industry-specific knowledge
   - Technical certifications (CFA, FRM?)
   - MBA eventually?

4. **Geographic considerations:** Based in Delhi, flexible to relocate. Mumbai vs Bangalore vs staying in Delhi for opportunities?

5. **Timeline reality check:** Graduating in 2026. Start applying for analyst roles now, or gain more experience first?

**Specific Areas of Interest:**
- Cross-border transactions (given my legal background)
- Tech/fintech M&A (aligns with my current diploma)
- Regulatory aspects of transactions

**What I'm Willing to Do:**
- Relocate anywhere in India
- Start at entry level despite having some experience
- Invest in additional certifications/courses
- Network aggressively (already accepted to HPAIR 2025)

**The Honest Questions:**
- Am I being naive about the transition difficulty?
- Would firms value my legal due diligence experience, or see it as irrelevant?
- Should I complete law degree first, or start applying now?
- Any specific firms known for hiring non-traditional backgrounds?

**Looking for:**
- Realistic timeline expectations
- Specific action items for next 6-12 months
- Networking strategies beyond LinkedIn
- Interview prep resources for M&A roles
- Anyone who made a similar transition

Really appreciate this community's no-BS approach. Hit me with the hard truths + actionable advice!

I have always found Maths easy, not necessarily ""exciting"" or something that I wanted to dive deeper to figure out mysteries but no matter how complex a calculus or a world problem can get, I just find it easy. Secondly, physics is also something that I just find easy but not necessarily exciting or something that I'm obsessed over. Lastly, economics is something that I'm genuinely obsessed with, and something that I've always had the pleasure of conducting research on. However, my grades in economics (although always A\* but not a high A\*) are not as good as maths or physics or other subjects, which is unfortunate I have a feeling that if i'm not the best at what I'm studying or the line i'm pursuing, then the job market in the future will be very rough with me; and despite my enthusiasm with economics, i feel that if I push a bit harder then I can possibly get better at it but it may be a bit too late as i'm applying for universities in a few months (undergraduates) and I need to choose my career within DAYS. 

Should I pursue the financial line (i.e. economics), or should I move to a safer path like Engineering (electrical, mechanical etc) ? I need to decide my career path. in the next few days (p.s. I plan on moving to the US or Australia, most likely US... and i also plan on applying for financial aid so as an international student its also harder for me to get in, so i need to choose my career wisely in a way that universities will actually accept me as someone who has genuine interest in a particular subject and is also good at it, though I don't have genuine interest in maths/physics, even tho i did get to the national camps for my international olympiad teams, i don't really have any other extra curriculars for these subjects... whereas for economics I've conducted research studies, written articles etc)

1llmqfg,Feeling lost after being told to “reconsider if the job is right for me”,"I was handed a formal letter of warning today and was told to reconsider if the role was the right fit for me. I can’t deny that the issue I was handed the letter for could have been a big problem, if there was actual proof of misconduct. I understand my mistake, though there are and will be no consequences nor real proof that I did something wrong: the manager claims to have had a reason to go through my old tasks and found a “mistake” in the way I did things *internally*, with no actual proof that I did something wrong, but I can’t prove the opposite. Still, in shock, I did sign the letter. My manager pointed out that she didn’t want to mention it because she “mixed our personal and professional relationship” and likes me as a person. In that talk she also mentioned that the company might have to lay people off and that I could get fired, hence I should reconsider my position. I can’t even take this up with HR because my manager *is* the HR. 

I’ve been with this company for 1.5 years and while it’s not exactly what I wanted to do and have degrees in different fields, I did / do enjoy the job and people. I’ve been playing with the idea of applying elsewhere and did mean to ask for an interim letter of recommendation, especially after being there for a year. But now the letter of warning will reflect negatively on that too. 

I’ve been looking at jobs in my field but I feel so lost. Like I am unqualified for everything. I’ve been working for close to 10 years, have degrees and experience, and still, I feel like I can do nothing. I don’t know what to do. I am so ashamed and scared of disappointing people. Especially my partner, the sweetest person on this planet. He will say I could never disappoint him, but I am so ashamed. I feel like a failure and don’t know what to do. 

I know I should just apply for jobs but I am scared and nervous as it is, now even more so. All of this just makes me doubt myself so much. I feel like I can do nothing right. Even at a job I’ve been at for 1.5 years I made a mistake.

1llmoni,Should/how should I bring up my coworkers behavior and work quality?,"Recently started a new job at a startup.  Fully remote. My immediate co-workers are one man and one woman. The woman is great, but it’s only been a few weeks and the man has a mounting series of things against him:

- Inappropriate hire. He doesn’t know this job, and I spend hours explaining and delegating to him, so far leading to little time on my own. I was not hired as a manager, but I am one because of him.
- Poor behavior. He takes feedback personally and has poor confidence, leading to a meeting being centered around his unwillingness to move on to the next task, and instead insist that we ruminate on minor moments. This is the tip of the iceberg though.
- Damaging behavior. The only woman in the company works on our team, and this dude is plain ole insensitive and ignorant to his  misogynist behavior. He’s getting away with it partially, because he’s rewarded by other men on the team for acting immaturely. What has disturbed me enough to post is that recently we were on a remote call, and someone egged him on to show off his nerd sword prop, which was all fun and games. However then he moved onto show off his firearm, which felt wildly inappropriate. I believe it made the other coworkers feel similarly. He put it away after our mixed reaction.

Frankly I know I could keep a record of this person’s behavior and probably get him fired. 

Soon I’ll have a meeting with hr/leadership to check in on how i’m doing, and I can’t tell if I should bring it up or wait until I’m sure I want this guy gone. I’m so new, i’m not really sure what the social climate is yet, and doing do might just backfire on me and sew further division.

But if this dude gets worse, our team will possibly start to rot from the inside and people will start to avoid us/not support our work as well.

So yeah, what do I do? Do I bring this up yet? How?

1llm9fx,Should I ask for a raise within 3 months of receiving one?,"Hi

I started working at my current company last November as an outreach/executive assistant

I was able to get us from 6 clients to 25 in 3 months, and I was doing EVERYTHING prior to that the company was stuck for 8 monhts, I got promoted as a result to and negotiated my salary

After that, we hit a plateau for about 4 months. During that time I was still improving profitability, managing 3 team members, and trying to build structure as we grew.

3 months ago, I received another offer and I asked for salary increase, after many conversations they offered me another 8$ increase with a bonus if we hit our monthly goal

Since then, I’ve hit the goal every month. I also built automation systems to save time/money, set up long-term planning for the team and clients, and basically ended up owning ops, client success, growth, and internal systems.

but I wasn't able to achieve it as a program director , I had to step outside my role and be a growth director, client success manager, operation leader and so many more, after doing some research the title that most represents me is ""VP of operations""

Given all of that, do you think it would be greedy or rude to ask for a promotion only 3 months after a new raise/offer package? Specially considering that it would be mu 3rd raise in 9 months

Note that the average salary of PD on my industry is 70K and VP of operations is 110K, I make 53K/year, I am underpaid anyways

1lllved,Career in family business or as an employee ? When is one better ?,"Hi everyone, I’m a bit lost in life and don’t know what to do. I’m 26 and just completed my masters in mechanical engineering. My family owns a manufacturing company, where I have worked at for over 6 years now. 

My father is planning to leave the company to my sister and i, but I’m not sure if I want it. 

All (2) employees are going to retire soon ( alongside my father) and the job involves heavy physical labor. I don’t love it, but I also don’t hate it. I’m not sure if we should just sell the company and I go work as a manufacturing engineer . Having a business is satisfying, but incredibly stressful. However, I’ve never worked as an employee so the thought of a bad manager and coworkers scares me. 

I currently only earn $26 hr. My father states this is temporary and I will later have his salary once he retires, which is very soon. As things stand, I can expect to make from 110k-300k myself if I take his role ( depending on how good of a year it was) Maybe having set vacation time and a 9-5 is easier though ? 

I could, however, scale the business and hire more talent, although finding machinists is difficult now a days. My sister and I handle the finances and customer relations already. I’m not sure what I should do ? If I become an engineer right away, my salary would immediately grow, but I may regret it as well. I may regret it vise Versa as well.

1lll6yr,Thrown Into the Deep End: Building a Constituent Services Program Alone in State Government?,"**TL;DR:**  
I joined Maryland state government through AmeriCorps and now work full-time doing constituent services. I get 45–80 contacts a month, ranging from quick fixes to complex, red-tape-heavy cases. I've been tasked with building a program (SOPs, workflows, partnerships) from scratch, with no staff or budget. I’m trying, but I constantly feel like I’m failing people. Am I just not stepping up, or is this setup flawed?

I joined Maryland state government through AmeriCorps after working gas station and retail jobs while finishing my degree. About 10 months ago, I was hired full-time, primarily to handle constituent services.

Each month, I manage between 45 and 80 constituent contacts. Some are one-off emails I can resolve quickly. Others turn into long, drawn-out cases involving red tape, interagency collaboration, or deep resource digging to find the right support for a veteran or family in need. Topics range from housing, education, financial aid, legal issues, caregiver support — even things like **home repairs (roofing, plumbing, accessibility), navigating state benefits**, and urgent referrals for people in crisis.

Recently, leadership told me this is what I was brought in to do — and that I should now build out the program. I’ve been asked to create SOPs, design workflows, and establish a sustainable system. But I don’t have a team, a budget, or even much of a roadmap. I had an intern for a while, but they’re gone now.

I’m trying to step up. But it’s hard. I feel like I’m doing a disservice to the people who reach out. Like my progress isn’t enough, or what I do doesn’t amount to anything lasting. I wasn’t trained for this level of responsibility, and coming from AmeriCorps and service jobs, it’s been a steep curve.

I’m genuinely asking:

* Am I being too hard on myself?
* Is this just how public service works early on?
* Or am I in a position where the structure itself is flawed?

Would appreciate any thoughts — especially from people who’ve done this kind of work in government or nonprofits.",Heavybeingsalad301,1,1.0,0,1750999507,2025-06-27 04:45:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lll6yr/thrown_into_the_deep_end_building_a_constituent/,6,2025
1lll5m9,I need help moving on from the poor experience I had working with a work colleague,"Last year I was constantly put on projects with a colleague who is very talented and constantly praised for her work. At first I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn from her, little did I know how horrible she was to work with. 

Fortunately, I came clean to my manager about my poor experience and was she was moved to a different team within our larger org (8 months ago). But every time I hear her name and hear the praises our VP gives her in ATM, I can’t help but still feel a sense of jealousy, and unfairness about how she still continues to thrive even with how she treats others poorly to the fact that no one wants to work with her? I’m frustrated I still have this icky feeling and haven’t moved on to where hearing her name no longer bothers me. Any advice on how I can mentally move on and not let her bother me anymore? 

For context, we are the same level and working with her was insufferable, she’s a narcissist who would constantly talk over me, fight me for the limelight in larger settings and in meetings with leadership. We were required to work together on high impact projects and she made my work day miserable, she consistently insisted we “collaborate” on zoom calls for 5-6hrs straight, making me work through word through word on writing a simple sentence together. It was beyond brutal. At the same time she would always disregard my ideas and be fake about it by saying “oh that’s a great idea you can work on that part” to then me spending hours developing it and then once done her telling me it’s bad and insisting elements be changed and I redo it or it get scrapped to focus on her idea that she was working on. On top of it she would constantly make jabby remarks on how other people were so much better to work with. It made me believe she was widely loved, more talented and it was just me who was the difficult one or a poor collaborator. I recognized she had talent in areas I lacked so became the bigger person and let her lead in some areas. 

It was months of this and finally I couldn’t handle it anymore where I tried to ask my manager if I can work on other projects in the future and in a professional manner told her we don’t need two people of the same level working on the same project as it was duplicative of resources. My manager continued to probe and I was just so frustrated I finally came clean. Turns out she has a history of being like this and no one actually liked to work with her, she was delusional and put like 20 people down to do her peer review when in reality nearly everyone didn’t bother to fill hers out and those who did gave negative remarks. My manager was even experiencing the same things and did not want her on the team. With my experience we put it all in writing to get her moved off of our team and my manager also gave her feedback and steps to make improvement, which she never took or worked on. I honestly felt so relieved after learning all that and having her removed.

The issue is she will never be removed in totality because of her talent. our VP loves her and constantly praises and rewards her with cool projects and opportunities to travel. I get so annoyed and jealous whenever I hear these praises or that she got to go to xyz place, and it’s frustrating me that I feel this way!!!!! How do I move on from this, and not let her bother me anymore?! 

My vp also acknowledges the work I do and Im trying to get promoted to the next level but have this constant thought that bothers me that if he promotes me he’ll also promote her because in their eyes it’ll be fair since we are counterparts. I just need to move on from this feeling. I’d appreciate any advice!!

1llkj3z,"Professor told me to take more initiative at work, but I’m not sure what I’m missing","I regularly go on work trips with an experienced colleague and a university professor to do environmental and noise sampling in a large industrial facility. I’ve been doing this for about a year now, and I’m pretty familiar with the procedures — I prepare the materials in advance, I know what needs to be done, and I try to stay proactive and helpful throughout.

The thing is, the other two have been doing this for way longer than me. They know the place inside out, they have a clear picture of what needs to be done and when. So out of respect (and basic logic), I don’t go around saying “today we should do this and that.” I just fit in where I’m needed and try to support the flow.

Yesterday, though, the professor pulled me aside and said I should “take more initiative” and not wait to be told what to do. He added that I might have to come here in the future with less experienced colleagues, so I should be ready to take the lead.

It honestly threw me off a bit. I don’t think I’m being passive — I do things without being asked, I stay engaged. But I also don’t think it would make sense to try and “take charge” when I’m with two people who clearly know a lot more than I do.

I’m thinking about bringing this up with the other colleague (who knows the professor well) to get a better sense of what he really meant.

1llkb7n,Started a new SECOND job and I hate it.,"I was out of work for a while after I moved, so obviously I was excited and happy to get back to work and to accept any work.

The first job I got is awesome, I enjoy talking with my coworkers, the work is easy enough and it keeps me busy, (difficultly isn’t a big issue for me). Although it’s just a casual position.
However, the second job I got is a PT job, (more hours than the other) I really don’t like it, I don’t mesh well with my coworkers and my trainers. It’s come to the point where I dread going to work because I know it’ll just be full of micromanaging and small comments that make me feel stupid. 

I consider myself a good worker, and haven’t had this issue where I feel incompetent at work. 

My question is, is it unreasonable to quit the 2nd job? I’m planning on going back to school in the fall and keep my casual position at the first place. Has anybody been in a similar position? 
These jobs will be temporary for me till I can finish school. ",Bystrough,7,0.8999999761581421,4,1750996588,2025-06-27 03:56:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llkb7n/started_a_new_second_job_and_i_hate_it/,6,2025

1lljqnm,Career/study advice please :),"Hi ! Hoping I can get some advice and insight here. 

I'm looking at enrolling in a university course for the first time (32F, never been to uni) but I want to ensure I'm making the right move before I do as it's a 3 year course and costs $90k AUD (In Australia this is payable once you start earning over a certain threshold) so a big time, effort and financial impact if it's not for me.

My career experience is entirely corporate (business admin then insurance managing workers comp and income protection claims - i just fell into these roles and they paid well) so this will be quite a jump. 

I've been afflicted with a couple of chronic illnesses that have completely knocked me on my ass and made me take my health more seriously. It's something I care about and am fascinated by,  and would love to be in the position to help others the way my naturos have helped me. I'm not looking to get rich, I just want to be comfortable, passionate about what I do and doing something that aligns with my values.  

Can you give me any food for thought ? Things to mull over when weighing up what I should do? Your own experiences about heading to uni a bit later in life ? Struggles? Just anything you think would be helpful would be highly appreciated.

1lljpl8,Work at Fidelity/Tech Sales or Pursue CAA School - 26 y/o $200k in Debt,"Hey everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or insight—

I’m 26 years old with a bachelor’s in economics (2.9 GPA undergrad). I later completed a post-bacc in biology with a 3.4 GPA and have taken all the prerequisites to go to CAA school (Anesthesiologist Assistant). I also worked for 3 years as a dental assistant, went on a medical mission trip, so I have solid healthcare and volunteer experience.

Unfortunately due to poor financial guidance/arrogance I am $200k in debt from my undergrad. Going to CAA school is an additional $200k ($400k total after grad). Upside, guranteed job, $200-$300k salary off the bat. Yet, it is EXTREMELY competitive and I am not sure if I have a chance at getting in. Moral of the story I was looking for some feedback if its worth me spending years on trying to get into CAA school given I've completed the pre-reqs already and invested money? Or just let go and move on?

I’m currently in tech sales as an SDR at HubSpot. Here’s the pay structure over the next 1-2 years (if I follow the SDR → AE path):

|Role|Base|Variable|OTE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|||||
|||||
|BDR Level 1|$52,220|$22,380|$74,600|
|BDR Level 2|$54,400|$26,800|$81,200|
|BDR Level 3|$56,620|$30,480|$87,100|
|Account Executive (L1)|$65,410|$58,190|$123,600|

I'm also considering looking for a job at Fidelity, starting off as a Financial Represenative and working my way up in an branch to a Financial Consultant. I would love some feedback on this route based on my situation and what the pay progression looks like?

Moral of the story: I already have **$210k in student loan debt**. If I pursue CAA, I’d be adding another **$200k** in debt ($400k total) but securing a $200-$300k job. I'm scared I have no shot at CAA school because of how competitive it is and I might waste years trying where I could've been progressing in another field (Tech Sales or working at Fidelity)

Thanks in advance.",Good_Ranger_1199,1,1.0,0,1750994611,2025-06-27 03:23:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lljpl8/work_at_fidelitytech_sales_or_pursue_caa_school/,6,2025
1lljgg2,Offer for Job in Dream Industry with severe pay cut and Far From Home. Should I leave my current local higher paying job? Rlly Confused,"21M here who recently graduated last month with a degree in data science and economics from a top university in the US. I have been working since January of this year at my current job as a systems analyst overlooking business systems in this medium sized company in a super small town. However, the pay is $95,000 annual with a potential bonus. That is about the only upside to the role other than the comfort it has as a chill job, able to live at home with minimal expenses (thus higher take home) in California and being around family. 80% of the day I tend to spend studying completely off topic subjects because of the boredom and remainder waiting for my manager in the case there were any items for the day. I truly do feel like the days dread by. The job didn’t exactly align with my expectation, and the description was a little exaggerated on what the day-to-day would look like. The only thing keeping me at this point is the pay and comfort of home with family. People tend to move to this area of the state to settle down or retire and so the lifestyle isn’t as a live. At this point, even if I am assigned a task I apply very little effort and I’m still able to get by without anybody complaining and also feel like personal/professional growth has plateaued completely.

Recently, I was offered a data analytics role in Chicago from a Fortune 500 company (within top 100) I had interned with during college with a hybrid (3 days on site and 2 remote) role paying $20k below what I am currently (in addition to$5k bonus and review based variable pay). I had always liked the industry company, culture, benefits, etc and I’ve always kept a Hawkeye on the jobs in the company. However, this move would require me relocating to a whole new state where I would face loads of new expenses and my take-home income would dramatically drop. The company ranks pretty high amongst all variables, but it falls around average with pay. The industry and company I have always found myself working for engaged with and always saw myself working in without really considering factors like pay and location deeply. Now that I have the offer I’m starting to hesitate around the pay cut, location, distance from family/girlfriend, long-term goals, and so many other things that I’m just confused. After researching some higher-ups in the company, I found that it takes about 4 to 5 years in the company to reach about a manager position making about 90 to 135,000 if you’re lucky. However, now that I actually received the offer, although it excites me, moving to a whole new state by myself sounds daunting as it would be a new beginning and starting to think it wouldn’t be worth it. I have already tried negotiating the offer but HR and Comp seem to be fixated on the offered base salary. I definitely do see myself growing a ton more from this role as I’d be able to hone in on my technical skills that are marketable today, build a broader network of connections being in Chicago, and feel like I’d get a better quality of life for my young age. However, I am not sure if this would be a fair trade-off for what I’d be sacrificing. 

With tech and analytics market demand/future constantly changing, it’s hard to see what it will become in the next 5 to 10 years and thus it’s hard for me to see where I’d like to be as it’s even gotten bad to the point where I consider pursuing the medical field again. I also don’t see myself querying and building dashboards for the next decade, thus I feel like the case I find myself actually working in such a role would be in an industry/company I feel good about. Currently I’m exploring different hobbies I have had alongside my current job (e.g flying planes, real estate).

I am a huge part of a very close knit small family and moving away would definitely change things. To ease the pressure in the case I move for the job, I was planning on visiting once a month at minimum.

1lli44j,Getting into Agriculture with unrelated degree...,"Hello everyone,

I recently graduated college in the US with a degree in Political Science and a minor in Environmental Science. I wanted to be a lawyer at one time, but honestly I have no interest in law anymore. I really want to get into agriculture in some capacity, I just don't know how to start. I have a few questions and I bet someone here knows better than me, so here it goes!

1.)Can I conceivably get into agricultural jobs at 25 with no past experience? 
2.) I know Political Science isn't exactly related to agriculture, but would I be able to leverage my Environmental Science minor in some way? I studied a lot of ecology and land management to earn the minor.
3.) Do you know of any resources I can use to find agricultural jobs?
4.) I know agricultural workers are in demand in many countries, do you know of any programs outside the US which would provide training/work? Do you know of any programs within the US would provide training/work?

I'm not above doing any kind of work and im eager to learn. I just want to get into the industry! Please let me know what you think, or if you have any suggestions!

1llho0t,Should I Leave a Great First Job for a Contract Role in a Field I'm Passionate About?,"Hi all,

I could really use some advice as I'm facing a tough career decision.

I graduated in December 2024 with a degree in Biology and started my first full-time job this January (2025). I'm currently working as a non-technical QA Analyst for a small firm in the animal feed industry, making $50K/year, fully in-person. This is a new space for me—my background before this was in healthcare and research, and I was on the Pre-Health track throughout college (which I haven’t completely ruled out returning to one day).

The job has been a great learning experience. The team is kind and supportive, and I truly feel like they took a chance on me, as they typically don’t hire new grads. My manager is amazing, and everyone in the office knows everyone. The CEO is close to us, and there are awesome events we get to attend. They’re also slowly expanding the scope of my responsibilities, which could mean more growth or compensation down the line.

Now here’s the curveball: I was recently approached by a recruiter (I wasn't job-hunting) and after a quick interview and assessment, I was offered a Associate Medical Device Reporting (MDR) Specialist position at a major med device company, working in their neuroscience portfolio. The recruiter told me they liked me a lot and offered me the role immediately after reading my assessment. And, this is a field I’m genuinely passionate about.

Here’s the catch:

\- It’s 27/hour but it’s a contract role through an agency. There's a possibility of becoming a permanent employee.

\- It’s 3 days WFH, 2 days in office.

\- It’s at a huge company, which could open doors — but I’ve also heard about layoffs at this firm.

I wasn’t even planning to leave my current role yet — maybe in a year or so, after building more experience. But now this opportunity is staring me in the face.

If you were me, what would you do?

Stay at the first job that’s stable, kind, and growing — but in an industry I’m less knowledgeable about? Or take a bit of a risk on the second job that’s closer to my interests, partially remote, and could potentially lead to something big (or could end abruptly)?

Any thoughts or guidance would really help. Thank you so much in advance!",FuturePhysician0705,2,1.0,2,1750988282,2025-06-27 01:38:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llho0t/should_i_leave_a_great_first_job_for_a_contract/,6,2025

1llhawq,Job Offer,"I know I’ve seen a bunch of these posts before, but I’m going to post this anyways. 

First, I’m currently employed at an insurance agency where I don’t anticipate losing my job anytime soon. I need out for a number of reasons, which I won’t get into.  At this point, I won’t accept a counteroffer if they decide to present one. 

Okay, so I’ve had several interviews already and it’s coming down to two at this point. I have what I believe is my final interview with company B tomorrow morning.  Then I’m jumping on a call with Company A tomorrow afternoon to discuss what I believe may be an offer. 

Of course both seem like really good opportunities. Reputable companies. Room for advancement with folks retiring. Company expansion. Similar pay ranges. Much shorter commutes. Plenty of pros and only a few cons but nothing that is a red flag for me. 

I don’t have any written offers at this point. Neither have asked me if I was interviewing elsewhere. Both gave me their base salary/range. No indication on how quickly they need to fill these roles. I was able to find out that neither have any real candidates at this time. Both postings show that they been up for at least two months now. 

Okay, so here are my questions…

1. If Company A provides me with a job offer tomorrow do I negotiate with them then or thank them and tell them I need time to process? 

2. Do I tell Company A that I have a final interview with another company?  I don’t want to lie and say I have another offer when I don’t, but I may that same afternoon depending on how quickly Company B moves, if they like me. 

3. Do I share with Company B, who I’m interviewing with tomorrow morning, that Company A is presenting a job offer that afternoon? 

Appreciate the feedback and feel free to provide any other tips with this.

1llge91,Stay in Canada or move back to Australia?,"Hi everyone, I, (29 F) am in a dilemma and would appreciate any perspective I can get. I am a Canadian citizen who moved to Australia about 2 years ago on a working holiday visa in order to progress in my career (there's less people there and I knew it would be easier to rise in ranks because the competition wouldn't be stiff) as opposed to Toronto where the job market is in the gutter, you're fighting with over 1000 very qualified people over a job that requires an unnecessary amount of experience for the salary it's offering. So I decided to move to Australia to find better.... which I did. I was able to get my first ever manager role as an Office Manager for a multimillion dollar firm, although it wasn't in the field I'm trained in/want to pursue. Three months into working that manager role, I was poached by a really big media company (for Aussie standards) to work for them. I did only one interview and BOOM, I was offered the role. It was the first time where a company that I worked for flew me out to different places and I got to learn so much and earned more than I ever have. Unfortunately that all had to come to an end because my WHV was expiring and I eventually had to head back to Canada. The company wasn't able to sponsor me because the over head cost was just too much at the moment. So, I am back in Canada. 

**Intermission for career context:** My work background has been in media and my goal is to work for the likes of NBC Universal, Netflix, TikTok and other global creative/media companies. The roles that I am after are: Global Celebrity and Influencer Lead, Creator Marketing Manager, Brand and Sponsorship Lead.

  
My parents, especially my dad are very career/education focussed and NEED to make sure everyone sees that their kids are doing well. So two weeks into me being in Canada and applying to about 93 jobs at the time all over Canada with no luck, my dad stepped in and offered to help me find a way to get back to Australia since he saw how brilliantly I was doing there. We settled that I'd do an MBA program at a university in Australia and he was willing to fund it all, as he is very well off. Fast forward, I end up getting into a top MBA program in Australia and even get a 25% scholarship offer. I've now accepted and paid for my first semester of uni, with my student visa still pending approval. **PLOT TWIST NOW:** 1 of the 93 jobs that I applied to in Toronto end up reaching out to me wanting an interview. Good company with multiple offices in North America and it's a role within the media field. I take the interview out of curiosity and also because I don't start school until much later in the year and I'll need a job regardless in order to save up some money before returning back to Australia. I do the first interview and within the first 20 mins they LOVE ME and my experience, particularly the one I did in Australia because it fit so well with the role I'm interviewing for. The interviewer basically says she has a STRONG feeling I'll end up getting the job and even preps me with notes and what to say in the second stage. I do the second stage, I kill it, third stage, aced it! **I get offered the role**. Now I actually have a decision to make because I didn't actually think I'd get it... I was planning to work temp jobs in order to make some money. But this job offers full benefits, the salary is $65,000 (which isn't as much as I made in Aus) but for Toronto it's good I guess and it's a permanent position and the people seem lovely.

As of today I have accepted the role but only as a means to do it for the meantime before I have to leave but I'm starting to feel bad because I feel like I would be crazy for abandoning a full-time job with benefits and stability. The role would also be my first marketing role. In Australia, work-wise, I would only be able to work 48 hours per fortnight because of school, which makes finding a good job in my field harder. But once I graduate, I'll be given a 3 year visa that allows me to work full time. I've already built so many connections in Australia, the pay is significantly better and the life goal and plan I have for myself (to work at Netflix or NBC Universal) is easier to get to quicker because of the unique experiences I have and again less densely populated Australia. Also I i just love Australia in general and have made life long friends there. I'm conflicted because it feels like I'd be leaving something stable, but not life changing, for an unknown in Australia but if executed properly, **IS** life changing. My goals can still be achieved in Canada, but I don't want to hustle and grind until I'm 40 before getting a role that my younger counterparts would otherwise get in a smaller market. Does anyone have any advice or if you're older and have a longer tenure into your career, how would you go about this decision.

1llfyqg,Employee has extremely unrealistic progression roles but ideally would like to keep them in some way? Is this possible,"So I have read loads of under appreciation posts for employees and I just want to preface that this one isn’t our issue. 

I think my employee is great! He has been with us 8 months, I joined slightly later. The issue I think comes because we are the same age but I am further along in my career. 

I started my career 2 years before the other employee and have been in the industry for 8 years now, and led a team of 5 people for 2.5 years prior to this role. But because we are the same age there is friction. In this role I lead a team of 6, including the employee mentioned. He has complained that I am a block to his progression, he even mentioned this on my 3rd day at work and tried to take over my role. But he has never managed people or has any experience on the other sides of our business (only knows display but we do display, social and search advertising),however, wants to manage the whole team of 6 who work across all those verticals. He also wants to be on 20k more and mentions it constantly. 

I know I’ve only mentioned the bad sides but he does have some skill in other areas eg analytics, reporting, efficiency on comms and is a nice guy. Also, we are a small team so losing him will be a bigger hit. 

The issue is how do we help him understand he is quite far off from his desired role on the below areas when he doesn’t accept that these are blockers:
- no experience in the other specialities 
- no team management experience 
- poor public speaking skills (good knowledge but ums and ahs and doesn’t make eye contact. Also loses train of thought. All of which give the impression he is unconfident and unsure of what he is saying. It also doesn’t install confidence in us as a company so he is now often kept away from important clients) 

To make this clearer whilst I was away they said that they could do my role and that there progression should be taking over my role and h to en becoming director - I am the head of the team, the whole company doesn’t have directors. So this is a BIG reach. 

I’ve never had an issue like this in other companies before but he does not accept feedback. 
He complains that he is not on client sales calls. We mention, it’s because of the “ums” and “ahs” he says a lot, which were previously mentioned. However he rejects that people take that in to consideration when listening to sales calls. Also says that whilst he may talk fast and look away the content of his words us bar none so won’t accept that potential clients aren’t won over by this behaviour. 

Please please help because I do like the guy despite knowing he has flaws and is quite off base with a lot of his views.

Also uk based just in case that’s important 

Also that despite losing his train of thought in a sales pitch … with our founder and a BIG prospective client … that it was our founders fault for jumping in to plug the gap. Really our founder should have given him more time and he would have eventually then found his point again. 

All of this does sound really bad, but I do just want to see if anyone has any insight in how to open up this guys eyes to everything that he needs to learn to progress to his desired level.

1llf0wa,22 F “feels like I’m running out of time”,"I 22 F,

Have always felt like I’ve never had a true career path in my life, never had any passions or hobbies, never been gifted academically since I could ever remember. Have ended up in hospitals due to just simple conversations of my future. It’s terrifying. 

I’ve tried going to post secondary which was a huge step after high school near killed me. I went into a field (Animation) where I had no exams, no text book studying, no Que cards, no essays because I know my weak brain can’t handle that. And I still crashed out and ended up dropping out a year and a half into my 3 year program. 

I’ve now been just working at restaurants for over a year just either avoiding the question entirely or if I’ve tried to think about it crashing out and spiraling all over again. 

I am VERY self aware of my problems and solutions, my mom has made such a good point that people work cause they have to not because they want to, and I feel like I hold a lot of pressure to almost need to have a soul purpose and can only persue that but I’ve never known not even had an inkling in 12 years of this ongoing question of my path in life. 

I’ve sat down with myself recently to just even simply look at programs back in school because I feel like I’ll have no future without one, at-least not one that can keep me afloat in this crashing economy for when I’m older. I’ve trickled into possibly marketing and advertising but again nothing sounds exciting to me I’m almost just falling into that “because I have to” and because I’m scared, and there’s not many steady yet fulfilling entry level jobs. 

I’ve now fallen into that mindset of those under 25 feeling like they are running out of time. I know everyone’s storys are different and everyone has their own path and forms of happiness, I guess any I’m asking advice for those older who have been though this or those in their young twenties in the same spot

1lldwzo,Is this normal in corporate?,"I’m interning at a small startup this summer, and it hasn’t been the best experience so far. I’ve been having a lot of issues particularly when it comes to communication with my supervisor. They tend to give me pretty vague instructions, and when I try to follow up with clarifying questions or express that I’m unsure how to proceed, they often seem irritated. I still ask for clarification because I want to be sure I’m doing things correctly, especially since they can get frustrated easily, and I don’t want to make a mistake by misinterpreting their expectations.

There have also been a few instances where I’ve done exactly what was asked, only for them to later get upset that I didn’t do something additional that was never mentioned in the first place. For instance, I recently organized some reports in the company’s online system the way they instructed, but afterward they criticized me for not organizing them in a different way as well. I pointed out that I hadn’t been told to do that and bluntly told them that I’d need clearer guidance going forward if they want me to do something specific.

I mentioned all this to a few friends, and they said it’s pretty common in this field to have to “read between the lines” when getting instructions, and that I was being argumentative. But in my case, that feels impossible because I can’t read my supervisor’s mind. Or maybe I’m just slow. Either way, I constantly feel anxious that I’ve messed something up or will get blamed for doing exactly what I was told. Is this kind of thing typical in corporate environments, do I really need to somehow learn to “read between the lines”?

1lldqzt,Do companies usually ask for reasons why you left your previous job during background checks?,"Hi! I recently signed a contract with a new company and submitted my resignation to my current employer. However, I was terminated shortly after due to attendance issues.

For context: I had an admin hearing regarding my attendance, waited about a month with no clear update, so I started job hunting. The job offer from the new company came first, so I signed and resigned before the termination was finalized.

I asked my former HR about the Certificate of Employment (CoE), and they said it will only include basic information—like my job title and employment dates—without mentioning the reason for separation.

My concern now is: during background checks, do companies usually ask for the reason why you left your previous job? Or do they just verify job title and duration?

1llcog7,From UX Designer to Clinical Social Work?,"Hey everyone — I’m in the thick of a possible career change and would love some perspective.

I'm 33 and currently a mid-level UX designer, but lately, I've been seriously considering leaving tech altogether. Like many others, I was laid off in November 2024 and have been unemployed since. The market is brutal right now, and while I’ve been trying to stay optimistic, this downtime has made me reflect hard on what I actually want out of my life and work.

A bit of background: I’ve always had a winding career path. My Bachelor's degree is in Hospitality (...yep!), and I've worked in wedding planning, hotels, food & beverage, taught English abroad, then went back to school for Graphic Design and later earned a UX/UI certificate from a bootcamp. Somehow, three months after graduating in 2020, I landed a six-figure UX role. It felt amazing — like I had finally figured it out. But that stability didn’t last, and I’ve since come to realize that I’ve had a love/hate relationship with tech all along.

What’s been missing for me is the human connection. Yes, UX does help people — I don’t want to dismiss that. But I’ve realized I want to help people *directly* — in real life, in real time, and in ways that feel more personal and grounded. The tech space, while intellectually stimulating at times, has also been incredibly isolating for me. I’ve grown tired of the fake corporate vibes, the politics, and what honestly feels like a lot of BS. I miss authenticity, emotional depth, and community.

I’ve always been drawn to service — hence the Hospitality degree, I suppose. I’ve volunteered throughout my life and have a deep interest in human behavior and community work. Earlier this year, I asked myself: *What if I actually went for it? What if I pursued my hidden but long-standing dream of becoming a therapist or counselor?*

After a lot of research and soul-searching, I’m seriously considering a Master’s in Clinical Social Work. It would allow me to become a licensed therapist while also offering flexibility down the road — whether that’s direct practice, policy work, or program development. It feels like a meaningful path, even if it's a challenging one.

That said… I still have doubts. Am I just giving up on tech because the market is bad right now? Is this a reaction to burnout, or a real calling? I don't want to see myself as a quitter, but as someone adaptable and aligned with what truly matters. Still, I know social work comes with its tough realities — emotionally and financially — and I’m trying to weigh everything with open eyes.

I would love to hear from others who’ve made a leap like this, especially from tech to mental health or service-oriented fields. What helped you decide? What surprised you? Any regrets or affirmations?

1llb4g2,Job opportunity or a big mistake?,"Here´s the thing.

I´m working for a big tech company in Germany. I´m a production engineer for about 10 years now - had a decent career, got a raise here and there, had lots of freedom on how to fulfill my job and was happy in the place where i was, until about 3 month ago.

By April management decided to relocate my (prototyping) business to another plant. Reasons were mostly different opinions within the managing board. Because of a potentially big business with a large OEM, the relocation was rushed pretty fast. Machinery and all the other hardware were gone within a few weeks.

Since my involvement in this field of production were quite product specific (assembly and testing) and not general (like machining), i was tasked with supporting the receiving plant - which is about 1,5h away from my home. So for about 8 weeks i travel nearly daily to the other plant on business trips - driving times are working hours and i can use a car from my companys vehicle fleet. 

So far so good - i still have a job and a reason to go to work because of the need to transfer my knowlege. On the downside, often i have to stay late (potential SOP) and the commute is quite long, so i am coming home late (6-7pm). I have two kids aged 6 & 4 which makes it even tougher, to miss time as a family.  They go to bed at around 8pm.

Long story short: everybody knows that i am in a crucial role for this project, as i got told now by different people in project and senior management. Yesterday i got a job opportunity to switch to the R&D department within this product field - but i am struggling to make a decision here.

On the upside, i can continue in this product area, where i have built a lot of knowlege which is currently not replaceable at my company. I will receive a small increase in salary (\~5%) and get a job as a development engineer (usually more prestigious than production engineering). It was verbally commited that i can work around 2 days per week from home. 

On the downside the commute (on the other 3 days) will no longer be counted as working hours. I will spend a lot of time on the autobahn and most likely in traffic jams. I will miss time with my lovely kids and wife. When i break down all costs, due to increased wear on my car etc., i won´t make more money with this new job.

Right now there are only 2 options on the table.   
Option A:   
accepting the aforementioned opportunity, switch positions. Maybe push my career a little bit, join a group who is eager to get my knowlege/experience. Miss familiy time.  
Option B:   
decline and stay at my old plant where currently are zero opportunities - HR has announced to use its ""right to issue directives"". That means basically being shuffled around to any group within my current plant where they most likely dont need/want me. Have short commute (20min) and more family time.

Sorry for the long message - i would appreciate some honest opinions. Thanks!",Commercial_Sky_8270,1,1.0,0,1750970605,2025-06-26 20:43:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llb4g2/job_opportunity_or_a_big_mistake/,6,2025
1llaz0n,Employee quit claiming better Work-Life balance. I'm confused.,"One of my engineers quit gave me their two weeks notice today and told me the reason was seeking better work-life balance being promised at another company. This really surprised me. I asked him if there was anything specific that I could help improve this for him like lessen his workload, but he didn't really give me any feedback. I even suggested to take a few weeks off to think about it, but he said that he's thought about it for long enough and that he's certain on his decision. 

He's been on my team for the past two years. We got along very well and was well liked by the team. He did good work. I gave him a promotion 8 months ago. He always had a good attitude, and he had minimum complaints that I would address immediately. 

My company is fully remote. We require 3 hour overlap for people to be online for meetings, collaboration, code review, etc. Weekly meeting burden is one 30 minute company wide meeting, and one 30 minute team meeting to sync up on work. Everything else is done asynchronously. No hard deadlines for tasks, except of course for recovery efforts in the event of an incident or outage. We have unlimited PTO and require everyone to use a minimum of 4 weeks, and at least one week has to be consecutive. We shut down the week of Thanksgiving, 2 weeks for xmas/new years, and every other friday off during the summer. We do require engineers to be on call, but it's a 10 week rotation, during business hours only. 

I personally feel like my company has one of the best work life balance policies that I have ever experienced. I'm truly very confused. Is there something obvious here that I have missed or should be more proactive about to ensure people don't leave because of burnout? Is there something that would impact someone's work-life balance that they would not be comfortable talking to me about?",gay-giraffe-farts,1434,0.9599999785423279,515,1750970246,2025-06-26 20:37:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1llaz0n/employee_quit_claiming_better_worklife_balance_im/,6,2025

I’ve been working in my current bank for over 3 years, and 1.5 years in my current position. Lately, things haven’t been going well — I’m not hitting my targets (though I’m not alone; the new sales plans are difficult for everyone), and I’m under a lot of stress. One aggressive client is even trying to blame me for things I didn’t do.

I applied to another bank. It has a bad reputation — they constantly cold-call people offering jobs, and I actually rejected them once before when I was in a lower role. They’re known for chasing staff and struggling to retain people.

This new bank is not a leading institution in my region, and the market is small — three larger banks dominate it. Still, they’re offering me double my current salary.
However, the catch is:

I must bring in 60 new clients and

600,000 in loan portfolio

in just 6 months, starting from zero.


If I don’t reach that, I’ll be fired.
my current job — even though it’s chaotic and stressful, I still have some stability.

I’m stuck. The offer is tempting financially, but I don’t believe the goals are realistic — especially in this market and with the bank's reputation.

I have no issue with the trades, but all those people who are saying your degree is useless, despite historical evidence of the contrary, don't listen to that. Yes, new grads are experiencing the rare event of higher unemployment compared to others, but to simply say that renders all degrees useless is bogus. We don't know when the hiring market balances back, but it has a trend of coming back.

When it does come back, you will regret listening to a Redditor telling you that degrees are useless without knowing your aspirations. If you want to start in a trade, go ahead. Just know that your degree is still usable for your future if you ever can't do the alternative you chose. And know that there are majors with great returns that pay off, so life isn't black and white. There's a lot of nuance that people often don't mention.

I’m currently finishing my BTech in Civil Engineering with honours in Structural, after completing a 3-year diploma earlier. I’ve also started learning STAAD Pro recently. But honestly? I feel really lost and overwhelmed about what to do next.

I’ve gone through a lot of Reddit threads, and many make the future in civil (especially in India) sound scary or depressing — low-paying site jobs, zero work-life balance, no growth unless you get a govt job, etc. I’ve realized I’m not interested in preparing for government jobs. I’m more inclined toward design, planning, BIM, or possibly technical specializations.

I’m open to pursuing higher studies, and even going abroad if it makes long-term sense — but I’m not sure which country, what course, or if it’s even worth it compared to just upskilling here.

I’ve read about people switching to Revit, BIM, coding, project management, or even data roles after civil. Some of that sounds interesting, but I don’t know what’s realistic, and what’s just hype.

TL;DR:
	•	Diploma + BTech (Structural)
	•	Learning STAAD Pro
	•	Not interested in govt jobs
	•	Open to higher studies or going abroad
	•	Want to avoid the site job trap
	•	Need honest suggestions: What direction is actually worth pursuing today?

1ll3vtk,Suggestions/Guidance,"Hi everyone,

I am seeking guidance from professionals working in the supply chain field. I currently work as a category buyer for packaging commodities at a semiconductor company. We have three authorized suppliers for packaging, and we are restricted to working with only these three since they are approved by our customer.

Could anyone suggest the types of reports I can generate in relation to these suppliers? For example, I measure on-time delivery metrics and the quantity they are able to meet each day. Since we operate on a Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory system, we rely on daily quantities. For instance, if our build plan requires 10 pieces of a certain part, and the supplier can only deliver 5 pieces, they fall short by 5 pieces, which affects our quantity metrics.

I would appreciate any ideas or suggestions for additional reports or ways to improve and grow in this area.

During my time at the school, in about July 2021, I found work at an HVAC company and I worked there for about 7 months. 5 of those months where when I was in school, and then I graduated in December 2021. However, the HVAC company was still keeping me as a low level warehouse sweeper making $13/hr even though I had the HVAC certification, and even though I kept asking about when I would be doing HVAC work they kept moving the goalposts. Finally, I had enough and started applying for other HVAC jobs, and managed to find one that offered me $16/hr.

Around that time, I was super burned out from the other job, so I gave myself 3 weeks before I would start the new job just so I could rest, recover and start the new job fresh and with a new perspective. During that 3 week period, a local ISP called me in for an interview and offered me a job for $15/hr. It was slightly lower than what I would be making in the HVAC company, but I value job stability and security over immediate short-term gains, and when I was at the original HVAC company I saw that when the weather got bad or conditions were too poor for driving, I was sent home without pay through no fault of my own. I wanted something that gave me stability, and a guaranteed time of arriving home, and I didn't feel that the HVAC company could provide that, so I started working at the ISP.

I was at the ISP for a year as a Tier I Helpdesk agent before I got promoted to a Tier II. I was at the ISP for a total of 3 years from March 2022 to May 2025. In that time, I went from $15/hr starting to \~$42,000/yr when I left. Around the time I left, I was frustrated that I wasn't making enough to even afford an apartment in the city I live even though I had been there for 3 years and knew pretty much every in and out there was to the whole job. I don't live in a very HCOL city either. Rents are usually around $1100 - $1200 for a decent apartment. I didn't want to have a conversation with them about salary, because I knew that they had said if I got my Network+ certification, that I would get a pay raise, but a former coworker of mine had been there for about 15 combined years and when he left, he was making about \~$43,000/yr. They also stated that the salary for the role I was in would top out at about $60,000 per year, and at the rate I was going, I felt like it would take way too long to reach that. Obviously, I had lost faith that I could make a living there, so it was time to make a change.

I began sending out applications around January 2025, and in April, I got an interview with a major hospital chain in the region I live in. They asked me to take an assessment to gauge my level of technical ability. The role I applied for was a helpdesk position, but when I completed the assessment, an entirely different person reached out to me and asked me about my interest in a System Analyst role for their EMR/EHR system, Epic. I stated I was interested, did the interview, and heard nothing for about a full month. When a month passed, I reached out to the person who originally reached out about my Helpdesk application, and he stated he found it strange they didn't get me for the System Analyst role because according to what he was told, I did very good on the technical assessment; enough to qualify for the System Analyst role . I guess that's why I got called in for the analyst role even though I didn't apply for it.

Regardless, he told me I was basically a given for the helpdesk role, but the only issue is that it's a night shift job that I work 7 days a week at 18.40/hr and then I get a week off afterwards. I also get a $1.75 differential for working the night shift, and I get an additional $2 differential for working on the weekend. As it stands now, I have been in this current hospital helpdesk role for about a month, but the idea was to step into this role to use it as a stepping stone to get the analyst role when I'm eligible for transfer in 6 months. My idea is to tough out the night shift and stick with it for 6 months, and then apply for the system analyst role and hope that I can secure a position, since I was told that the reason I wasn't selected for the analyst role was most likely because they prefer internal promotions instead of external hires. I did a bit of investigation, and I heard that the analyst roles were rumored to start at $26/hr as of a few years ago, so it may be a bit more now.

This is where I've found myself in a pickle. I am obviously not in an ideal situation right now, but I intend to make it work and use my work to propel me into that analyst role once I can transfer in November. However, an opportunity came up as a maintenance supervisor at an apartment complex in my city that was around $28/hr. They needed someone with an HVAC certification to help with supervising for the maintenance side of things in the complex. I went to the interview with an open mind, but also thinking that I probably wouldn't qualify for the role since I hadn't done HVAC or maintenance related work for the 3 years I was in the ISP.

However, to my genuine surprise, the lady I spoke to showed clear and real interested in hiring me on. Bonus is that in the past, I've gotten bad experiences with jobs that say they're starting around a certain range, and always offer me the lower end of that. However, she stated she wanted to hire me in at that $28/hr starting pay. She stated she still had to discuss with the guy above her about the details, and there was a possiblity I could start out at $26/hr and then in 3 months, after my evaluation, bring me up to $28/hr. That's still way way more than the $18.40/hr I'm making right now even including all the differentials.  However, I also get other forms of income including bonuses each month depending on how well the property is doing, and every 4 weeks, I am rotated onto the on-call list and I get paid $100 no matter if I get a call or not, and if I do get a call, I get overtime pay. They also have a strict schedule of 8a-5p so the hours are set and I would preserve work-life balance. I also am offered a discount on rent, which she said in the past has been 40% off which would make their most expensive $1600/mo apartment sit at just over $1000/mo. They also have multiple education opportunities for certifications in plumbing, electrical and more.

The job I have now is easy, and I'm building to something that **MIGHT** work out. However, I feel like I would be stupid to pass this opportunity on, considering that it's pretty much guaranteed to make more money right off the bat. I also see it as the opportunity to learn skills that would be of great benefit when I'm a homeowner and would enable me to fix and repair things myself without having to pay someone a bunch of money to do it for me. On the other side though, I feel slimy for leaving a job  I just started this soon. I want to do this as ethically as possible, but I'm inclined towards taking the higher paying opportunity but I also don't want to mess this up and cause a major career fumble this early in my working years.

Some other pertinent details as well:

I just paid off my car in April. I have a $1952 balance in a 0% interest installment on a laptop I bought in January (stupid, I know. I'm trying to get better at making wiser financial decisions). I also have $540 in an apple card installment for two separate apple watches that I bought for me and my sister. Finally, I have a $3918 balance in a card that I use for my monthly expenses. It's very high right now because I just finished dealing with some repairs and maintenance that totaled around $3200 on my car, but at least it's fixed now and has no other issues for the foreseeable future. The $3918 is revolving though, and is paid off each month. These are my only debts, and none are interest accruing. 

I have 790 in checking, 750 in savings, and a $5100 Simple IRA from my old job as well as 688 in an HSA. 

I also do English/Spanish medical interpreting on the side, which can make me around $500-$800/mo depending on how many jobs I get, but that's a side gig I'm doing during the day when I get off my night shift.

  
I am single and not planning on dating for a good while, but I eventually want to be able to save up enough money to put towards a down payment on a home. At least enough to get me a reasonable monthly payment and avoid Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). Homes in my area can vary from $150k to $300k depending on what you're looking. 

  
I live in the West Tennessee Area. 



Any and all advice would be appreciated, and if there is any clarification needed, I will be more than happy to provide it.

1ll3264,Need career advice — I want to become financially independent but I can only work online due to family restrictions,"Hi Reddit,

I'm turning 26 this year and need some serious advice on how to build a career and earn money — entirely online.

I’ve completed an MSc in Computer Science, but the past 5 years have been extremely hard. It's not that I didn’t want to work or grow; I simply wasn’t allowed to. My family is very traditional and controlling — especially when it comes to girls. They didn’t support me going out for exams or jobs, and often said things like ""that's not for girls"" or that spending money on me would be a waste. So I missed out on opportunities, including B Tech( I couldn't take entrance even though I was topper back then) and several jobs I was offered after my degrees.

Even now, I’m not allowed to step outside alone, speak freely, or question anything. I don’t have my own bank account or a personal SIM card. I recently asked my mother what would happen if my future husband turns out to be abusive, and she simply said, ""That’s fate and I have to accept it as it is."" When I tried to talk back , I was beaten for it saying girls shouldn't talk back.

This was the breaking point. I’ve decided I need to take control of my life — even if it means doing it all secretly. I want to earn money, support myself, and eventually have freedom.

Can you please help me with career paths for me? 

**The problem is, I can’t go outside, so I need to work online.**

I’m willing to learn anything. I’m not afraid of starting from scratch. I just need help figuring out.",No_Tension_2463,0,0.5,8,1750951697,2025-06-26 15:28:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ll3264/need_career_advice_i_want_to_become_financially/,6,2025

* **Teal HQ:** Their Chrome extension was great for job tracking and saving descriptions.
* **Fiverr:** Used it to get a quick audit of my LinkedIn + resume. Not super expensive, and worth it to get perspective from someone with recruiting experience.
* **ChatGPT:** Helped with rewording experience bullets, creating custom cover letters fast.
* **Canva:** Designed a portfolio version of my resume for creative roles.
* **Glassdoor/Levels.fyi:** For comp research before interviews.

I think combining free tools with a bit of freelance help made a big difference especially when I hit a wall writing about myself. Hope that helps someone. Happy to share links if people want.

1ll2fv9,Is it worth speaking up about my unhappiness?,"Hi all,

Recently I went on FMLA for health issues, when I returned I had a meeting with my boss who said that she is thinking about moving me to a different position in the company as “ she needs someone who is here”, and I understood completely even though I was disappointed and a bit embarrassed because I did love my job. A few weeks went by and no changes were implemented and my attendance had been perfect throughout that period of time until a few fridays after that I got an email 9 minutes before the end of the day. Half the office was CC’d in the email, with her stripping me of all of my responsibilities and saying I am only to do what I’d basically bitch work. I work in a professional field where I have two degrees and have years of experience. But now all I do is destroy files by scanning and shredding them. My pay has not been changed nor my hours or anything like that, so it’s not illegal just extremely shitty. I will admit after I saw that email I was devastated and felt publicly shamed. I have taken some time off due to the same medical issue that flared up due to the stress that came with the anger and frustration with that email. By this I mean instead of 40 hours I worked maybe around 30 hours a week. I want to address this issue with my boss and explain my disappointment with the decision but I want it to be in a manner that is not going to get me fired, or retaliated against. But also, I feel like “ what’s the point” and maybe I should look for a better job, I would prefer not to as this job pays very well and I do love my previous position. I have an email typed up but I don’t know if even speaking up is even worth it.

1ll155k,Some advice about potentially quitting - don't even want to come back in after this week,"I used to be a chem major but didn't like the work as it was to automated. I finished my degree and went into a healthcare/sales function. It's a one day school/3 day work thing. Been doing that for 3 months now. Soon I noticed they didn't disclose some things. Like not having a collective agreement, and the building being terrible: covered in water damage, mold and sewer issues. Co-worker says they have health issues every winter. This wasn't disclosed up front and I have a mold sensitivity (which I didn't bring up in the interview so that's also my bad). I have been sick for a month now, my guess is that the mold isn't helping. Next, I feel like they kind of overdid how busy it was. And I'm just sure if the sales part was really for me, but I do love the healthcare part. All of this already had me questioning whether I wanted to proceed, considering they pay for school so if you finish the degree and then leave you have a debt. I want to prevent that by figuring out if I like it enough the first half year.


Now, the first time my co-worker got mad and made me cry was because I was 2 minutes late once because I had a food item leak in my bag. She has been very mad with other people multiple times before but I figured I wouldn't have to deal with that and it was a one time thing. But due to a communication error this week she got mad at me and went way too far. I won't get into details but she made me sob and I still feel horrible, attacking me on a personal level, and first going to other people in the company to tell a skewed version of what happened to them before coming to me. She was so mean and out of line. To the point of me not even being allowed to work this week and being sent home. I was already questioning whether or not I wanted to stay and this feels like the final push to leave. She is one of the only co workers I have so I need to work with her constantly. I actually have a job offer standing for a full healthcare position so I will be going there this weekend to see what it's about and am really thinking about taking it if I enjoy it. I just feel really guilty about it. And I have so much anxiety about going back in next week I genuinely don't want to, been nauseous with a headache ever since it happened.

Problems using the computer, problems with the system we use, problems with finding easily accessible information on contact information, problems with time management.

Once I realized it, stuff like that happened a lot. I just covered for her, or her assistant (I’m not her assistant) would cover for her. 

I brought up my concerns to my boss who passed it along to her boss. The big boss helped out in court, also to observe that prosecutor. The big boss didn’t deem that there were any issues. The moment she left.. bam. That prosecutor started crashing out.

1lkzxab,Executive Education: Navigating Change in a Dynamic World,"Amidst today’s speed-driven global economy, the pace of change is relentless. Disruptive technologies, shifting workforce dynamics, and global crises like the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the way businesses operate. For leaders and professionals, this means that the traditional models of leadership development are no longer sufficient. Executive education, once considered a mid-career boost, has transformed into a critical, ongoing process that supports leaders in staying agile, resilient, and prepared for future challenges.

# What is Executive Education?

Executive education encompasses specialized academic programs designed for professionals in managerial or executive roles. These programs, typically offered by business schools and universities, aim to enhance leadership, strategic thinking, and management skills without leading to a formal degree. They are often short-term, ranging from a few days to several weeks, and focus on practical, real-world applications.

According to the Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Business and Management, executive education consists of short, intensive, non-degree programs offered by university business schools to attract individuals in or near top executive positions. Similarly, Berkeley Executive Education describes it as topic-based, intensive academic programming for professionals and business executives designed to improve their business, management, and leadership skills.

# How Executive Education Helps Professionals

Executive education equips professionals with advanced skills and insights needed to navigate complex business environments. It supports continuous growth, enabling leaders to stay competitive and drive meaningful change within their organizations.

1lkz4e0,I’ve been rejected more times than I can count – and I still struggle to pitch ideas confidently.,"I’ve been building projects and testing ideas for a while now – and while some gained traction, many conversations ended in silence, skepticism, or a flat “no.” Investors, friends, coaches, even target customers.

Each time, I tried to move on.

But if I’m honest, some of those “no’s” stuck with me. They became doubts, then fears, then excuses.

Recently, my co-founder and I tried launching a service concept in the team development space. We believed in it. Still, the hesitation to pitch it boldly – again and again – was real.

What if it’s “too early”?

What if we’re not ready?

What if it’s just not good enough?

Turns out, *rejection doesn’t have to happen to paralyze you*. Sometimes just the **anticipation** of rejection is enough to hold you back. That’s the part that frustrates me the most. 😔

So now we’re doing something a little different:

👉 We’re asking this community – those who’ve been there – to share:

* What helped you push through the fear of rejection?
* What mindset shifts, daily habits, advice or tools made a *real difference* in how you show up with your ideas?

You can share what worked for you, or what you’ve seen work for others. Honest reflections, no hacks or hustle-speak.

Maybe we can build a thread that’s actually useful for those of us trying to stay brave. 🤗",emildrud,1,1.0,1,1750941641,2025-06-26 12:40:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lkz4e0/ive_been_rejected_more_times_than_i_can_count_and/,6,2025
1lkyw3n,What's the next move?,"Hey guys!

I want guidance on what should my next job should be,

I'm a Tech support at a reputable Telecoms Company that provides Internet and TV services and ever since I got the job I moved up pretty fast from a regular to a senior in only 2-3 months and another 2 months to becoming a Senior Tech Manager (i don't even know what that is) But basically I'm responsible for more complicated technical problem and offering technical advices to customers while also lecturing employees in the call center.

Right now I work remotely which is nice, pay is really bad and I need to move up more in the world to something more refined. This job is becoming very tiring a repetitive and management don't offer help much other than 'advice' there's no more room for promotions since a Staff Manager is the max a Call Center can offer (which i'm not a fan of, nor managing employees).

  
I don't own any tech certificates or diploma as I gained my flavorful knowledge from reading a lot, hands-on and disassembling and basically being a tech geek ever since i was a kid. I'm very good at troubleshooting and PC hardware as well as expertise, windows stuff. I also find it hard expressing what i'm really good in a single sentence or word cause my knowledge is broad yet not very specific but they're all within the tree of electronics and tech. I find myself a great candidate for IT manager but I want to know more.

  
P.S. I'm also trying to avoid customers as much as I can as it has become very energy draining for me everyday to explain and feel like I owe them the fucking fort knox for their 60$ monthly plan over a problem they have

I am under a contract by my university to complete this 6 month internship in order to get my degree, and my internship is a stipend pay, giving me $400 per month.

I'm in a small company that has a hybrid schedule. Monday - Fridays are online. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday are in person. For the first month I had a manager who would guide the interns on what tasks to do, then they got fired. They were replaced by a new person who doesn't exactly guide the new interns, other people in the team would guide the interns since that manager got fired. At first adjusting was rough as I had to take more independence with my tasks. However I could go online as many of my tasks were online. Now that has changed and my new managers want me in person Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday which I have no problem with but the thing is my managers sometimes aren't there when the interns (me) are in office which makes things harder as I communicate with them using Slack. And I am receiving tasks that's the other interns role which is why I am supposed to be present in person, especially on days when they aren't here. I hate going to my internship in person I feel like this company is so disorganized when it comes to their interns, amd I hate the fact that I have to do the other interns tasks too that's the only reason I'm in office. I don't know how normal this is and yeah maybe I should just deal with it for 3 more months because maybe this is what the workforce looks like in real life, but I hate going to work Tuesday.

1lkyfsx,Need advice on switching paths," I’m at a crossroads and could really use your help. I’m 31, originally from another country, and moved to Australia to chase a better life. I worked my butt off to get a bachelor’s in accounting and an MBA here, and after a ton of hustle, I landed what I thought was my dream job in auditing at a Big 4 firm. It felt like a huge win – finally a role in my field after years of grinding. I was so motivated, thinking my career was set.

But the reality hit hard. The work is soul-crushingly mundane – repetitive tasks, endless spreadsheets, and no room for creativity. The culture is even worse. My seniors constantly make me feel like I’m never good enough, no matter how hard I try. There’s zero appreciation, no “thank you,” just negative vibes and vague feedback that leaves me questioning myself. Busy season was a nightmare – long hours, no work-life balance, and it broke  my spirit. I’m so burned out and honestly heartbroken. I thought this was my path, but I hate it. I don’t want to do accounting anymore.

The problem is, accounting is all I’ve ever been good at, from school to now. I feel stuck and scared to start over at 31. I don’t know what else I could do with my skills (accounting, MBA, some analytical chops). I’m based in Darwin and would prefer to stay here, but the corporate culture in my firm makes me dread work every day. The career coaches here are uninspiring and just push the same old corporate ladder nonsense. I’m craving a career that feels meaningful, with a better culture where I’m not just a cog in a machine.

Any ideas for careers I could explore with my background? I’m open to upskilling, but I’m feeling so lost and could use some advice.

1lkxtxa,Awful at communication,"
Hi everyone
I wanted to check if any of you also struggle with communication. Personally, I’ve noticed that I forget words, I give way too many details, and sometimes I’m just not understandable. What I say often lacks structure, and I feel like it's not clear to others. It honestly makes me feel awful because it impacts my career, which relies heavily on communication. It also isolates me socially because I don’t express myself well.

On the flip side, sometimes I overshare. I’ve realized that in trying to be friendly and empathetic, I end up saying negative things about myself and maybe give off a bad impression. That could be why I sometimes feel like I’m not taken seriously or respected.

I’m becoming more aware of this now. Do you experience something similar? If so, I’d love to hear any tips or tricks you’ve found that help manage or improve this.

Also, I really want to learn how to talk about light things, you know, small talk, without always diving into deep or heavy topics. I want to become good at that too and actually enjoy it.

The one good thing though is that I’m super curious and well-read. I always have something to say no matter the topic 😊

Thanks in advance

1lkxgs8,Offered my dream job...can't take it?,"Hi All, 

I am looking for some career advice. I currently work in a home health setting in a clinical role, I have for a long time. I have been looking to get out of the clinical role for a long time, even completing extra education in hopes of making some sort of career switch. I don't \*hate\* my job but there is no room for growth, I am existentially bored, and I can't do this forever. I've left this role and come back because it is the best role for me if I have to be in this career. 

THEN....the perfect job comes around. It is a great blend of my clinical experience and more administrative education. I apply, interview, get the job. It was originally a remote job but, due to recent changes, it is now hybrid and requires in-person work 3 days per week. 

Here is the problem....my spouse has a job in the small rural town where we live. This role has minimal in-person time but still has some and it is required. Switching jobs is not an option for my spouse for many reasons. This is simply not an option. My potential new job is 4 hours away. The family has to stay here...probably long term. Moving is unlikely. 

Here is my question....can I make a four hour commute? It would likely involve staying overnight at least two nights per week near the job. This would mean time away from my kids and spouse. My spouse is willing to take on the extra responsibilities. It would also mean a lot of wear and tear on my (new) vehicle. This is an incredibly rare and great opportunity for me...turning it down hurts. It feels like I will be stuck in the rural town with a dead end job forever. 

Would you make the commute and sacrifice time with family if it meant you could have your ideal job?

1lkxe0h,Project Management vs Loss Adjusting,"I’m looking for advice on a career shift. I’ve been working in insurance (claims, technical support) for 4 years and want to move either into a project management (ideally construction or building adjacent) or a loss adjustor role. 

I have no formal qualifications but 13 years of full time experience (9 in customer service, 4 in insurance) and experience doing loss adjustor relief work at my current company. I am looking at doing a course of some description to gain a formal qualification but I’m unsure what would benefit me in the long term. A diploma of project management would cost about $3000-$3200 and a diploma of loss adjusting would cost about $4200-$4500. 
I would have to save for both of them as I don’t currently have the funds, though the loss adjustor course allows me to pay module by module instead of all upfront. My current role MAY also provide some study support (time is more likely than money) for the diploma of loss adjusting due to my experience. I’m just here looking to include something on my resume past graduating high school but I’m torn between the two options.

If anyone has any advice or an argument for or against either option please weigh in!! I’m struggling in my current role as it’s very monotonous and I desperately need a change/to learn something new.

1lkwqi0,Wanted to be a 2D artist/animator for interns but ended up being in graphic design,"Hello, I'm a BMMA college student (Bachelor of Multimedia Arts). I'm leaning more towards drawing being it on illustrations, animation, storyboard, or any 2D related for drawing 
(I took BMMA since that's the only thing that's closest in my area).

I've been struggling to find an animation studio at my place, it's either their not accepting interns, full for interns, or you have to ""enroll"" to their program that can potentially be an intern (It's not worth it imo because it's REALLY expensive) and majority of the time is remote (which we're only required to intern on site).


Our OJT deployment has started for the past 2 weeks now and I really don't want my OJT to hit my college schedule and capstone until our midterms-prefinals, I was basically running out of time but also running out of choices so I ended up being in a small studio that does advertisements for brands and I'm really not liking it so far. The experience? I guess it's alright, it's almost a week still. Maybe I'm just tolerating it so I won't have huge regrets of why I hate what I'm doing.

I just feel really sad because whenever I find an art studio they're always remote. I just wanna be passionate about what I'm doing even if there's no allowance in return. Right now all it feels like I just need to finish this for the requirements (we need 300 hours for completion).

1lkwbm7,Are my services getting abused at work?,"So I work as a 'marketing executive' for a relatively small to mid-sized company (40ish members of staff). This is my first marketing role after graduating, so I took the role under the assumption that it would only be relatively short-term, and to be honest I expected a level of 'overwork'. I'm part of a team of 2; so between us we cover all marketing functions at all levels - bearing in mind that as a business we retail globally and sell to leading manufacturers who are quite demanding in terms of marketing requirements, at both a B2B and B2C level. Currently my roles include:

\-**Solely responsible for all company social media** scheduling, posting, creating, analysis, and strategy. Every single thing to do with socials - it's on me (we are active across multiple platforms and the company has some deluded plan to expand how active we are across them).

\-**All company artwork** \- which is not insignificant. The two of us have to create all of this, from product labels, to 3D renders and general marketing material. We also have to create artwork for buyers and often find ourselves working towards deadlines of less than 24 hours and get the slack if there are any delays. They expect it to be done immediately, and have no concept regarding the time these things take.  

\-**Trade shows**: we are tasked with designing the stands, deciding on the products to exhibit, and organising and booking the transportation to and from. We also have to find the actual shows in the first place.

\-**Setting up new products**. It also falls on us to set up and new products and gather any samples anyone might need. For some reason it's also our job to determine pallet configurations and product dimensions.

\-**Photography and copywrite** \- we also have to perform photoshoots for all company images and product any literature that might be needed.

  
\-**General data analysis** \- it's up to us to perform any data analysis that needs doing. This could include annual sales reports, stock monitoring, all of that stuff really. Mixed in there is some 'marketing' stuff (SEO, trend reports, etc).

  
\-**General admin**. Any time there is a meeting - it falls on us to take meeting minutes, prep the presentations, schedule the meetings, and even order the food for the meeting for god sake.

  
Look, I understand that you have to 'get stuck in' with a smaller business - but this business is not THAT small. It seems exceptionally poorly ran, and we both feel as if we're getting totally abused as a result of our inexperience and desperation to work in the industry. On top of this - we are in office 5 days a week, I have an hour to commute each way, and the general atmosphere in the office is incredibly 'back-stabby', and just ultimately quite glum and depressing. Being someone who is attracted to creative roles, this place is driving me crazy. For context I've been here for about 8 months now. Oh and also - I earn below the national average salary for my age bracket. In fact - I earned more in my previous role as a warehouse picker. 

Anyone else have any experience with this sort of thing? I keep getting told I need a year of experience which I think is totally BS. Any advice/similar stories would be appreciated. I feel like I'm going crazy!

I am seeing so much information online about how overly broad non-competes aren't really enforceable. In some states, they're also not seen favorably or seen as enforceable.  But regardless of their enforceability (which I assume is something you'd fight in court?) isn't the real threat that you will have to divulge it to your next employer and this might be enough for them to rescind their offer?   
  
Or, additionally, whether or not you could fight the enforceability in court, the company technically has the legal standing to send cease-and-desists, which, again, is going to signal drama to your future employer?

1lkvtwg,what do you guys think of my cover letter and what should I change for a job at a major telco provider and feel free to make changes,"Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for the Business Sales Consultant role at your company. What stood out to me was your commitment to doing things differently and putting customers at the centre — this feels like the next natural step in my career.

In my previous role, I worked as a Business Development Manager focused on the SME market. I took it upon myself to pursue complex, high-value multi-site business accounts — typically handled by another team. I identified the right businesses, made first contact, and led the full sales process. One of my proudest wins was closing 27 electricity and gas accounts with a major supermarket chain in just two days. That deal alone covered over 50% of our team’s weekly KPI across eight field agents and marked a standout result we kept in our channel.

In another role, I worked with warm leads, helping customers find tailored storage solutions by asking the right questions and getting to the heart of what they needed. Whether I’m cold prospecting or working inbound interest, I focus on listening, understanding the problem, and delivering the right outcome.

While I’m still early in my sales career, I’ve been able to learn quickly, work well under pressure, and take responsibility for my results. I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science, which continues to strengthen my technical capability and confidence in digital systems.

I bring energy, resilience, and a strong focus on customer outcomes — and I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute in person.

I know people will tell me to enjoy life while im still young, I am doing so. But i just want to have a headstart and actually plan my future now. 

What jobs WILL make me rich? how? I heard Lawyers are barely any good nowadays. Doctor? does everyone who take up med actually become like well paid doctors? if not, how do i become one?

1lkur80,Feeling stuck and unsure about what’s next,"Hi. I’m feeling pretty desperate and generally want to get some input on my situation. 

I studied my bachelors degree in Biochemistry and graduated in 2021, I then moved abroad and worked in a academic facility for a year and a half and then moved into (what I thought was going to be) a long term job in a pharma tech company as a lab/research associate. I enjoyed this job and felt I could see scope for progression here, but unfortunately last year the majority of the company was laid off, including myself. So I was only there for around a year and a half also. 

I’m now working in a job that is completely out of my scope and I have no idea how to get myself back into a feeling of fulfillment with my career path. I feel so lost, and stuck. When I lost my job I moved to the city my husband lives in, which has such limited opportunities for science. There are two masters programs here (medical biology and molecular biology) but I don’t even know which to pick because I find it so hard to formulate what I actually want to do. I’ve always struggled with imposter syndrome, I’m shy, introverted, have a lack of confidence which makes me feel out of place at work in general. I started to wonder if science was even right for me, but now working outside of it I crave familiarity and going back into my field. I thought a masters would help me reconnect with the subject and find that spark again with learning (I loved studying) and help build my knowledge and confidence back. I’m 26, about to turn 27 this year. And when I think of my friends back home they all seem so settled in their careers and I’m still tossing and turning over what I want. 

I really struggle that my path hasn’t really been linear- that I lost the job I thought I’d have for a long time. I just feel at a loss as to what I should do, and I’m really at the end of my tether on how to even seek clarity. I have ideas of what I might enjoy but a lot of these opportunities would only be available to me in my home country and in my native language, and my husband is so happy where we are and with his job that it feels wrong to try and uproot us.  Hence why I started looking at masters programs. I just worry that my brain fog is inevitable, I feel I can’t retain information, I struggle to understand things the way I used to, I’m worried I’ve genuinely lost cognitive ability and would struggle with science. I don’t know what’s caused me to feel this way, I had a pretty bad burnout/breakdown in my first job when I moved abroad and I’m just not sure my brain has ever recovered.

1lkub3y,"I'm scared, please give me advice if you have any","(Im sorry if this is long) I'm 17 years old, and I'm scared. I've been meaning to pursue an art career since I was very very young. In this case animation.

But I'm scared, I really am, not just because of ai but because of the oversaturation in this career.

I know that theres a possibility I will achieve success, because I am very passionate in what I do, and I what I create. I'm also very passionate to inspire and tell my own stories and life experiences to people and future kids who will see my work. I love details I love my passion, and I cannot see myself in any other field other than arts. 

But I'm also scared as I write this, simply because I hear my family is facing a lot of financial problems. And I wish I didnt need to hear it, but im also deeply worried for my family. (we have overcame some of it, because of my dad's hard work, he has helped us in so many ways we can only thank him for and I'm so proud of him)

I'm also diabetic so life expenses for me are a little expensive. And that adds up to my fear of when Its finally time for me to find a job.

Now, all I am thinking is 

""What if I can't make my dreams come true? what if I actually die early? What will happen if I grow up?""

This sounds stupid so forgive me if im ranting here. But I'm so so scared for my future because I also know how expensive the economy is, and how some companies with greedy boses ruin their own workers for the final output.

I'm considering doing animation but only as a second..? Job? But honestly I cant see myself doing anything other than arts. But in this economy I dont know what else to do, Im scared. I dont know what job to take to at least earn me a decent living so I can pursue my passion on the side.

Not only this, but animation school cost 35k dollars for a year (i know this because there's a chance im moving countries for university and I'll be living in my aunt's home since she's my family.)

I have hopes, but only a little, because I've helped my family in some way too from my art, and I made a good amount. So that at least makes me proud to know I had my chances to actually help and make money, and it was nice to know that people actually like what I make.

But if people have any advice for me, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you and keep safe ",Jolly_Potential4487,1,1.0,0,1750924469,2025-06-26 07:54:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lkub3y/im_scared_please_give_me_advice_if_you_have_any/,6,2025

1lktgik,Need Advice working with senior engineer,"Hi all, I work with 2 senior engineers, let's call them Dave and John, on my team. I recently got promoted. 

To give a little bit of background, I worked with Dave when I first joined. He is extremely knowledgeable and intelligent. He is however very critical of my code changes and hinders my velocity greatly, I got very poor reviews working with him. 

When I switched to working exclusively with John, my velocity increased significantly and I didn't get as many comments on my code. I was able to get promoted while working with John. John is also extremely intelligent as well, but Dave seems to be more ambitious so the managers listen to him more. 

Now, I'm working with both of them. Dave is again extremely critical of my code changes, tells me to do one thing and then in another iteration tells me to remove it, tells me to do something even though it's already done, questions some things that are explicitly defined elsewhere in the code, etc. Now some of his comments are actually useful and helpful. However, I can get an LGTM from John on the same code change that Dave rips it apart. 

I've spoken to other eng on the team and others have the same experience. My manager is best friends with Dave and is also not very nice to me. I just got a bad review back because of his constant comments and delays in reviewing my things.

1lkso16,Sales Position Advice. Am I getting screwed?,"Hi everyone,. I work for a growing fence company with annual revenues between $20-30 million. The company is relatively new but expanding quickly, and overall, I like the team. However, I have some concerns about whether I’m being fairly compensated or if this setup is typical for sales roles in similar companies.

Most of our sales team is young possibly new to sales—and fully bought into our sales culture, which is great. But I worry they may not be seeing the bigger picture. It feels like we’re being used, and I want to understand if this is standard practice or if I should be pushing back.

Here’s a quick overview of our setup:
All leads are provided, and the company invests in a CRM system to support us before on-site visits.
We work on a 100% commission basis, with a rate of 3% of revenue. For example, a $2,500 sale earns me $75.
We use our own vehicles and pay for gas and maintenance out of pocket.
We cover up to 2 hours of travel from the office, averaging about 6,000 miles per month (roughly 72,000 miles annually).
We’re W-2 employees, which is a plus for health benefits, but we can’t write off mileage.
To make $100,000 per year, I need to sell over $3 million in fencing.

Given this setup, am I right to feel like I’m getting screwed? Is it unreasonable to think that, with these conditions, I might be going through a new vehicle every two years just to keep up?

They were replaced by a new person who doesn't exactly guide the new interns, other people in the team would guide the interns since that manager got fired. At first adjusting was rough as I had to take more independence with my tasks. However I could go online as many of my tasks were online. Now that has changed and my new managers want me in person Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday which I have no problem with but the thing is my managers sometimes aren't there when the interns (me) are in office which makes things harder as I communicate with them using Slack. And I am receiving tasks that's the other interns role which is why I am supposed to be present in person, especially on days when they aren't here. I hate going to my internship in person I feel like this company is so disorganized when it comes to their interns, amd I hate the fact that I have to do the other interns tasks too that's the only reason I'm in office.

I'm ashamed of where I am, and I feel like I'm behind my peers. I want to work hard and make a difference, but I don't know where to start. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you turn things around?

1lkngib,Struggling to commit to jobs & ashamed,"30F UK and I just cannot for the life of me commit to a workplace or career. I'm looking for some honest advice, be as brutal as you need to be because I'll preface this with being very aware it will likely come across very immature/ entitled/ naïve.

So, in sum, I had a very unusual 20s. I'm from a very normal working-class background (normal comprehensive school etc) but I was absolutely obsessed with studying, got straight A\*s at GCSE, A\*s at A-level and got into Oxbridge. I won't say exactly where/ what for as I don't want anyone to recognise me from this post, but it was a humanities subject. I already knew though that I had a mental health problem (which in hindsight caused the obsessive studying!) and it finally came to light with the pressure of Oxbridge. So, I was diagnosed with a pretty severe mental illness while there.

Without giving specific (again, scared to be identified) - my mental health issue had been caused by a traumatic event I experienced at 12 years old and, by 18, I was completely consumed by it. Along with the diagnosed illness, I was essentially just a walking ball of neuroses, severe perfectionism, and a really deep nihilistic depression and it took me the best part of my 20s to even make any headway with it. I saw multiple psychiatrists, had inpatient stays etc. the whole works and was very treatment resistant.

So, from 20 (when I finally dropped out of Oxbridge), to my mid 20s I basically just had voluntary experience and short stints at entry level jobs while having all this mental health treatment. All I ever wanted was to get better and live a 'normal life'. I worked incredibly hard at the therapies and, by my mid 20s, I had made miraculous headway. I'm now below the threshold to be diagnosed, but still have general neurotic/ perfectionist tendencies. I then applied to a local university to complete a part-time humanities degree (the same one I had dropped out of from Oxbridge) and worked part-time. I did that successfully for 4 years with no major issues at all. I got a 1st in my degree, got three promotions at the job, and all was well.

However, I graduated at the end of last year the same time I turned 30 and it's like I've just become frozen. I got my first proper full-time office job and lasted only 4 months. This is where the embarrassment comes in, so please bare with me - but I just found full-time work so deeply suffocating and utterly horrendous. It wasn't even the work, the people, anything material it was just the monotony of knowing I had to go to work every single week day for the majority of the day and then my ENTIRE LIFE is squeezed into a few tired hours in the evening and two measly days at the weekend. I felt mentally and physically exhausted on an existential level (sorry to sound so dramatic).

Now I know everyone else just gets on with this and I feel embarrassed at admitting this (hence the reddit post). But I'm just utterly gobsmacked that people can stomach this and do it. I know of course people don't enjoy it but I feel like I cannot stand it to such a genuinely deep, existential extent. I'm such a passionate person, I have so many interests and I am actually a hard-worker. I was praised at that job and they were sad to see me leave. I left officially due to an illness but I can't say that's the truth. To be honest though, it did quite literally make me unwell and I was diagnosed with an autoimmune illness while I was there but it was absolutely stress related due to my horror at working full-time.

I'm now volunteering and job-seeking but I have no clue whatsoever about what job I would be able to stomach more because it's the nature of full-time work that I'm struggling with.

I'm worried that because my 20s were so unusual and I haven't had a normal experience of working that it's somehow 'ruined me' so to speak. I just cannot fathom working full-time for decades and not feeling (to be brutally honest) suicidal. Working full-time makes me feel like my entire life and identity have been taken away. For context, I do not have any mental health diagnoses anymore, I'm completely 'normal' in all of my life except working.

I do have a weekly counsellor who I've been with long-term and who knows me incredibly well. She says I'm struggling with feeling disillusioned because I've always worked really hard academically and unconsciously bought into the whole 'work hard and it will pay off' mantra. I'm now finding out that my degree is not that useful, there's no exciting career waiting and - more pertinently - I don't even want an exciting career because I don't want my life to be consumed by a job full stop! She also says I have based my identity (unconsciously) around my academic abilities, so to leave university is like being given a blank slate and I'm feeling purposeless.

I do agree with her, but it all sounds so pathetic and mundane - it doesn't seem to capture how deeply difficult I'm finding this problem.

How can I get past this aversion? Or, more realistically, I'm looking for anyone who has had a weird 20s like me, who is a late-bloomer, and might have had a similar experience? I feel like the only person in the world with this problem (being melodramatic here) and I'm feeling pretty hopeless about it all.

Side note that I feel is relevant - I have always only wanted to do a PHD. But, in the course of my therapy, I realised that this is really just me running away from reality. There is no solid career in the UK anymore as a lecturer and I don't think I even want that job anyway - it's just that the only thing I enjoy is studying. Even then, my counsellor challenges me on that and says I don't actually enjoy it - I just enjoy the avoidance of everything else! I do tend to agree.

I'm swinging wildly from wanting to pursue a rigorous career that aligns with my love of studying (law?), working multiple entry level part-time jobs so I have variation, trying to work shift work so I maybe don't feel the monotony of 9-5. It's all so unfocused but at the heart of it is just such a deep aversion to full-time work it's crippling me. What doesn't help either is that I live at my family home and have very little outgoings, I live frugally and don't have to pay much rent. In an ideal world, I know I should move out and have the pressure of paying rent but I live in London and it's just not feasible even with my previous full-time wage. If you think I should prioritise that above all else though I'm open to somehow making it work. I do obviously need to find work soon, but I can live on a part-time wage if I'm honest so that's what I'm looking for right now. But it bugs the life out of me that I can't work full-time and I do genuinely want to be financially independent and a properly functioning adult!

Thanks for anyone who read this and feel free to be brutal as I said. I've read this back and I do get how whiny and entitled it can sound. Believe it or not, I am actually desperate to just have a normal life and I'm crippled by how difficult I'm finding it all.",veryhappysisyphus,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1750901226,2025-06-26 01:27:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lkngib/struggling_to_commit_to_jobs_ashamed/,6,2025

My company posted a new job in a different department but within my scope of practice. I reached out to my manager and asked if she thinks it’s a good idea for me to apply, she said go for it. She told me to reach out to an employee on that team and ask about day-to-day so I can see what the job entails & to also message the hiring manager. 

I messaged the employee, she gave me a brief overview of the job and advised me to message the hiring manager or the director for more info. 

The hiring manager is on vacation for another week but the director is still working. 

This is my first corporate role so I don’t know what’s best practice here - should I wait for the hiring manager to come back? Or should I send the director a message in the mean time to get myself on his radar? 

And whenever I do message either of them - should I send a Teams message or an email? Anything I should specifically say?

1lklicl,Taking a paycut for a more exciting role/company?,"Hey all! I'm in a bit of a decision pickle and would appreciate some advice from anyone that's been in a similar situation.

I just recently started a new role after being laid off for a while and while the company and team seem very good and welcoming and the work is interesting, the work hours and culture of staying late are a bit intimidating to me. Coworkers are repeatably staying past 8pm and I worry that will eventually happen to me as I ramp up and start picking up more and more responsibilities. At the same time, I was just offered a role at another company that I was interviewing at that is way more exciting in terms of the company and role. The only downside is that it would pay significantly less, down $15k from $130k to $115k. I'm trying to weigh the idea of a paycut like that against the excitement of this company, which has great name recognition and is a field I have been very excited about as an interest of mine.

Any advice on the situation or how to balance these options would be appreciated!

1lkldf7,What education should I get to keep my career moving?,"I'm looking for recommendations on what kind of education or training I should pursue to keep my career progressing. I’d like to build on my current role managing a large maintenance team and property portfolio, while also preparing for future opportunities in leadership, policy, or project oversight.

For context I'm in my mid 30's and live in Canada. I'm a Red Seal certified welder and I have a certificate in project management from a local college (not PMI). I have a lot of experience in residential and industrial construction.

After a move to another city and a bit of covid related job shuffle I ended up taking a really good opportunity to manage maintenance operations at a large property management organization. I currently oversee a team of 15 people and look after a portfolio of over 30 properties.

I've been in my current role for about a year and a half and have been receiving positive feedback on my work. I'm lucky enough that the organization I work for is willing to invest in me and pay for training and courses as long as it's relevant to my current role or responsibilities I might be taking on in the future. 

Initially I thought about looking for certifications specific to residential property maintenance but most of that is designed for people ""on the tools"" and I'm realizing that it might be much more beneficial for me to look at a bigger picture and take some training specific to management/leadership.

I think financial literacy courses or something that could help me be more effective at writing new policies and managing bigger teams and larger projects would be great. Not necessarily all in a single course. I foresee myself staying with this organization for a while so I see a possibility of taking it as far as taking a couple of courses per semester and working my way up to an associate degree in a few years but I don't know what courses to take that would help me grow and move my career along and not pigeonhole myself into my current position.",PolishedPerspective,1,1.0,0,1750895251,2025-06-25 23:47:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lkldf7/what_education_should_i_get_to_keep_my_career/,6,2025

1lkk4o2,"Is taking a redeye flight the night before work ""unprofessional""?","
Long story short one of my best friends got fired and dumped within a week so I gathered a few of our friends and we all went to Vegas. For reference I do not drink and at no point during this trip did I drink or do any drugs.

I [29M if relevant] need to give 2 weeks notice for any pto requests so I just took off on Friday after work. The redeye was way cheaper than any other return flights so I just sucked it up,  made the most of the Sunday in Vegas and then got a few hours of sleep on the flight back, and 2 more when I got home before I got up and went to work.

Monday mornings we have a large management wide meeting in a conference room and small tall came up and I mentioned my whole just landing 3 hours ago to some colleagues. I believe I verbatim said ""My weekend was pretty good, spent some time in Vegas with my friends. [Other person asks if I was only there for a day] I got there Friday and just got back this morning."", and then the meeting started and I went on with my day.

At the end of the day my boss calls me into his office. He asked if I really just got back from Vegas this morning. I told him yes, I took a redeye back because it was so much cheaper. He told me it was very unprofessional of me, and I should have told him my plan ahead of time so he could tell me not to do it. I told him I didn't think I did anything wrong, I've gotten less sleep on Sunday nights before. He didn't appreciate that and told me I made myself sound like an alcoholic. He said he was going to have to talk to HR but was considering giving me a formal warning.

I'm really confused? As I said I don't drink and most of the team knows that from when we do happy hour and I get a cocktail. I felt a bit tired but like I said, I've definitely had worse Mondays. This certainly isn't something I'd do every weekend but I'm an adult and capable of making these choices no?

1lkjffo,What to do… what to do.,"I work in a very specialized sector of veterinary medicine.  I’m currently 100% remote and live in the PNW. For the last 2 years, our company was the only company that offered a specific type of equipment, but now as of the last 6 months or so, other companies who have a lot of money to spend on marketing and sales are now following in our foot steps and offering a similar service for half the price.  Our boss was just let go out of the blue last week due to “money”. None of us are sure if that’s actually the real reason or not, as he didn’t really do much to begin with so it may have been due to performance. So the rest of our small team is on edge now.  One of my best friends is a manager for our competitor and has let me know they are hiring like crazy and business is booming. The company has reached out to me to join them in a travel tech type of role, but I’d be taking about a $5000 a year pay cut initially.   There “might” be room for salary negotiation. And I’d be traveling 3-4 days a week instead of being home remotely 100%.  I feel like I’m at an impasse and just need to talk this through with a third party (you guys!) as I don’t know what I should do.  Our management informed us today that they have no plans for marketing (probably no budget) and also let us know their sales team isn’t even trained on our product!  None of us knew this - no wonder why we’re performing so poorly.  Do I abandon the sinking ship?  Or give it a little more time to see if things truly do turn around now that my immediate boss is no longer there?  I’m just scared I’m giving up something good if I leave for another company.

1lkjael,[Career advice] Should I specialize in SAP or become Data Engineer (Azure/ Fabric) what’s better,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for some career advice and would really appreciate any insights. I graduated around 9 months ago with a degree in Information Management and Multimedia, which provided a broad mix of IT and business knowledge. During my studies, I worked with languages and tools like C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and covered topics such as business intelligence, customer insights through data analytics, machine learning and forecasting, project management fundamentals, cybersecurity, GDPR and much more.

For my first internship, I focused on security and GDPR compliance, where I created documentation and templates. In my second internship, I worked a bit with Azure, building some small pipelines and using Logic Apps, although I didn’t go too deep into it.

Currently, I’m working as a consultant at a client site, where I’ve been for the past 8 months in a role titled Supply Data Master Administrator. Around 60% of my work involves data entry, like adding or updating product data. I also build small automations using Python or Excel, create data quality dashboards in Power BI, and handle operational tasks like investigating and resolving incoming support issues. Occasionally, I develop small tools to help the operational teams. While I’m grateful for the experience, I’ve realized that I’m not really growing or deepening my expertise and I want to change that.

Now I’m trying to decide between two career paths to specialize in: one is becoming an SAP Consultant or Specialist, focusing maybe on a niche area like SAP MM, SD, or FICO. The other is becoming a Data Engineer working with Azure/Fabric, with the long-term goal of growing into an Azure Architect or even higher roles.

I live in Belgium, and one thing I worry about is outsourcing. I’ve seen how some roles, especially technical ones, are being outsourced to lower-cost countries like India. So I’m trying to figure out which path is more future-proof, both in terms of job security and growth opportunities.

I'm also curious about the potential to work independently down the line. How easy is it to become a freelancer in either SAP or the Azure/data engineering world? What’s the demand like in Europe for independent consultants in both areas? I’d love to hear from people who have experience with either (or both) paths, what you chose, why, and how it’s been working out for you.

Thanks so much to anyone who takes the time to respond. Your perspective could really help me make a smarter, more informed choice

Salary reviews usually happen in March, but this year they were delayed. In April, we got an email from the GM (cc’d: director + financial controller) saying reviews would happen in the coming weeks and any increases would be backdated to April 1. The GM has since left the company. 

My review was the last and only happened in June. I was given a 10% increase with a new title - but no updated contract. My latest pay didn’t reflect the raise or any backpay. When I raised it, the director said no one is getting increases until July 1 and there will be no backpay. This was not communicated to anyone during our reviews.

He also said I wouldn’t get backpay anyway because it’s a new role, not a raise- contradicting his reason for not giving me a new contract. Most staff haven’t been paid yet since they are monthly, and many are expecting backpay.

1lkhv9e,"Stuck between two options - More to learn, lower pay or less to learn, higher pay?","Hi everyone! This is my first time posting here so sorry if the format is off.

For context - I graduated college in Spring 2022. I had two internships my senior year, where I learned that I love project management. I applied for a Junior PM job at a SaaS company, didn’t get it, but was invited to join a different team. That role wasn’t at all what I was looking for but I took it due to the managers promise to give me project experience. I worked as a coordinator for the technical support department. I was there for almost 3 years before my layoff in February. I gained a lot of project coordination experience that counts toward my PMP hours.

Recently, I was offered a job at a fintech start up. The role is formally titled Software Account Manager where I will be doing client onboarding/ education to the platform. Additionally, the managers said there is lots of project opportunity, considering it’s a very early days start up. The initial offer was lower than I was making before, but I managed to negotiate it up from 65k to 69k with a 5% bump in 6 months. This is just slightly below what I was making before, but nothing that will impact me significantly. 

The other role I’m still intervening for but I have a strong feeling they will make me an offer as I have the final interview next week. This role is almost exactly the same as my previous role, but with a $15k salary increase. While the pay bump is super nice, I worry that I will pigeon hole myself into technical support type roles and not make any progress on my PM goals.

So my question is - would taking the lower paying job at the start up make sense if I feel that the work will more closely align to what I want to do career wise? I know start ups can be scary, especially one as early days as the one I’m joining. On the other hand, the other company (which is well established) has had multiple rounds of lay offs in recent months, that an old colleague of mine who joined them early this year describe it as a “risky” time to join. 

This whole situation has been making me very anxious. I’m the first in my family to work a cooprate job so I feel a bit lost navigating this. Any and all advice is appreciated !

I've been working as a field service tech for a point-of-sale company this past year. I have been saving up to finish my degree in Cyber Engineering, with plans to re-enroll in a couple months.

Should I quit soon to complete the certification prior to re-enrolling?

1lkfx0i,Should I pursue a finance degree or a trade?,"
I’m 27 M living with my mother. I went to school a few years back and failed pretty miserably. I was majoring in STEM and was balancing work while simultaneously dealing with my mental health problems, ended up crashing and burning. Been working shit jobs since and I’m pretty over it. 

I really wanted to go back college and get a degree in STEM, but now I just don’t think I can handle the workload while working full time. I just get too stressed and burnt out. 

I’m thinking about switching my degree to finance, my community college offers online classes for finance so I can work while doing that. I’m just worried about burning another few years on college and then not finding a job. I have a friend that has a finance degree and he gets paid pretty shit, but idk if he’s actively been looking for other jobs. 

My mother isn’t well off, she lives off welfare and lives in discounted housing. I pitch in rent, she doesn’t mind me being here but neither of us are doing great financially so if something goes wrong then we are screwed.  

I’ve also considered a trade but I have not heard back from any apprenticeship programs I apply to. 

What’s my best coarse of action here? At this point I’m just looking for decent pay so I can help give me and my mother a better living situation as soon as possible.

I am currently a PM working for an Engineering consulting company (pretty small org.. about 250 people). I have my PMP and I am pretty happy with this role 

I do eventually want to make a switch into being a PM for a tech company, I don’t think it’s necessarily for the money but it’s more so I truly think I’d enjoy it way more. I say that because I have worked for a startup company that sold SAAS and did custom built deployments and I really enjoyed my role in that. My background is chemical engineering so I don’t have much coding background and I pretty much suck at coding.

Do you know what type of roles I can apply for, what tech companies/roles where I don’t necessarily need a lot of coding background?

For reference I am making about $170K USD right now. So ideally I’d want something around that or more is nice but not a deal breaker.

1lkdzck,Uncertain about Next Step in Career,"Looking for some guidance as I navigate a few career decisions and uncertainties. I’m a 28-year-old woman, currently single and living at home. 

After working full-time with the federal government in education policy for three years, I left to pursue law school with the long-term goal of practicing law.

Since graduating law school last year, I’ve been working part-time at another federal gov department and as a guest/supply teacher while preparing to qualify in my home jurisdiction. I’ve signed an offer to article with a well-known British firm starting in September 2026. However, I would also like to become qualified in my home jurisdiction (dual qualified) and I have an opportunity to article with a firm in my home jursidiction as of fall 2025. But, my ability to article here depends on passing my remaining qualification exam at the end of August 2025. Results won’t be available until October, so if I pass, I could potentially start articling locally by November. The catch is that the firm I’m currently speaking with isn’t particularly strong (more of a smaller, lesser-known firm), but it would allow me to finish articling by the time I'm supposed to leave for the UK, thus, achieving my objective of becoming dual qualified. I'm currently also applying for other articling positions here for fall  2026, which won't get back to be until the end of august 2025.  

If I fail the exams I have in August, I won’t be able to article in my home state until I pass, and that timeline is uncertain. Meanwhile, I’ve also been offered a one-year policy internship with the provincial government. The pay is lower than my old federal job, but it’s a guaranteed 1 year position with solid experience. If i accepted this position, I would be starting the role in August 2025, and would be putting articling in my home jurisdiction on hold. 

My questions are:

* Should I accept the provincial internship, knowing that I might quit if I pass the exams and can article in fall 2025?
* Would leaving the internship for articling reflect poorly on me?
* Should I prioritize the UK articling offer for 2026, or keep focusing on qualifying and articling locally?

Any insight or advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m trying to make the most strategic choice for my legal career while balancing some practical and financial considerations.

1lkckli,Sales career advice,"Career choice

I’m one year out of college and have been working as an SDR, and more recently (5 months ago) promoted to AE for a quickly growing start up. The company is in an industry I have little interest in, but I’m getting 65k base plus potential 1k/month bonuses and 1-2% commission on deals closed (average deal size is 300k), team pipeline is also close to our EOY target which would earn me an additional bonus of 10-15k. I get little communication/guidance/support, but do alright for myself. I live in constant angst that I will be fired, but have no reason to think this way. I’ve been slacking for a month while applying to other jobs and finally got an offer which I accepted. New job pays 68k base with quarterly bonuses (which I’m confident I can hit) of 1-3k. Total comp falls in the 72-82k range. It’s also in a management role in an industry I have experience in and enjoy, although it would be fully in person. I don’t want to be in sales long term, and the new job would give me a shot at progressing in my career and getting the exposure to workplace interactions (it’s very hard to learn while working remote). 

Also worth mentioning: current role is fully remote and I will be moving to a city with a lower COL this time next year. Also offers unlimited PTO, lots of sick days and other flexibility, which I love. In comparison, new job offers 10 days a year with some floating holidays and regular ones- total for the year is 18ish days which must be accrued, also will have to take a 5 day unpaid leave at some point. At my current role, I’ve already taken 3 weeks off and have 2 more approved for later in the year on top of some sick days.

Am I being stupid to take the new job? A year ago I would’ve killed to be fully remote. I have a call with my boss scheduled for this afternoon and a start date for monday. Do I quit?


TLDR; need to choose between a job with amazing benefits in an industry I dislike or a job with okay benefits in an industry I like and want to be in long term. Moving in 1 year so this mostly pertains to that time frame, although I am allowed to continue working with current company after I move.

1lkcf3p,Should I leave my current job of 2 months for something else?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been working as a **night auditor at a hotel** for the past **2 months**, and while the tasks are fairly easy and low-stress (which I appreciate), I’m already questioning whether it’s worth staying.

The hotel is part of a **well-known and respected brand that offers solid career growth, especially in areas such as** **finance and accounting**, which I’m currently studying in school. I originally took this job thinking it could lead to something bigger within the company.

But a few things have made me second-guess that decision:

* The **work environment is toxic**—there’s constant gossip, drama, and coworkers talking behind each other’s backs. It creates a negative vibe during shifts.
* **Training has been inconsistent and confusing**, and most of the people training me haven’t even been there that long. Everyone has their way of doing things, and I often feel unsure of whether I’m doing things “right.”
* They’ve also started **training me for other roles without discussing it with me first**. It feels like they’re adding more responsibilities without clarity, support, or input from me.
* I’ve noticed that **a lot of people have been leaving**—some for promotions or transfers, but others just disappear with no explanation. The high turnover stands out.

I have a couple of other opportunities possibly coming up soon. My main focus right now is **paying my bills and staying on track with school**, and I’m not sure this job is helping with either.

That said, I’ve only been here 2 months, and I don’t want it to look like I’m job-hopping without giving it a fair shot.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation, where the job itself is manageable, but the environment, inconsistency, and unclear expectations make you question staying?

Also, if you’ve left a job quickly before, **how did you handle telling management?** Should I call, email, or text? What’s the most professional and least stressful way to resign?

Would love advice on:

* Whether it’s worth staying just for the brand name,
* If leaving a job after 2 months looks bad (especially with a good reason),
* How to balance short-term stability vs. long-term career goals (especially in finance/accounting),
* And the best way to professionally resign when the time comes.

Have you ever had a friendly relationship with someone from HR? Do you think they truly see you as a real friend — someone they’d go out of their way to support, especially during something like a compensation negotiation?

Or is that line between “friendly” and “functional” always there, no matter how well you get along?

I’m wondering if it’s naïve to think HR would advocate for you like a manager or mentor might.

1lk9sp8,Was it unprofessional to adjust my salary expectations shortly after speaking with HR?,"Hi everyone,

I had my first interview for a job two weeks ago, and it was with two team members from the department I’d be working with. I really liked the role, and it became my top choice.

Today I got an email from someone in HR, saying she would like to speak with me on the phone to go over some additional questions. I replied that she could call me anytime. She called me the same day and asked a few things, like when I could start, and also about my salary expectations. I gave her a number that I had originally had in mind.

But right after the call, I started to second-guess it. I went back and looked at the job description again, and also thought more about my experience. I have three years of experience in a very similar field. It’s not exactly the same role, but there’s a lot of overlap in terms of responsibility and required skills. The more I thought about it, the more I felt that my initial number was probably too low.

Since she had said I could reach out again if anything comes up, I decided to call her back about an hour after our conversation. I politely told her that before the process moves forward, I would like to slightly adjust my salary expectations. I explained that after reflecting more on the position and my experience, I realized it might be fair to aim a bit higher. I also said I didn’t want to come across as unprofessional and that I just wanted to be transparent now, rather than too late in the process. She said she would forward it.

Now I have my second interview coming up, and I’m a bit anxious. A friend of mine who works in HR told me she has never seen someone call back like that and that it might seem odd or like I’m just trying to negotiate too early. That made me really insecure, and I’m afraid it might have hurt my chances.

So, I’d love to hear from people in HR or anyone who has been in a similar situation. Was this unprofessional? Or was it okay to adjust my expectations shortly after the conversation?

1lk9ps8,Almost a perfect job but I hate it,"Hi there! So right into it. I am early 20s with 3 years of working experience, a CS degree and I have a pretty good in office QA IT job. Really great team, decent pay for a junior position, really like the location and love the office culture. However I hate it... I generally complete my work pretty quickly but I am really starting to dislike the process of investigating and writing test cases etc. I am a C# .net dev at heart and even though they've thrown me a bone with letting me develop some automation, I still feel very bored there. Another piece of context to add is that I had a large automation project I was working on canned because there wasn't a lot of results to show to the client after working solo on it for roughly 300 hours on developing the infrastructure, testing it, and getting it reviewed a senior (while the end product was constantly being updated, meaning I'd have to maintain the project alongside it).

The pay is also not cutting it anymore, I've had to deal with a bunch of financial issues and am in a bit of debt, I still make it to the end of the month but there is barely anything to go on even a movie date with my SO. 

I also while in college did some gigging as a musician (guitarist) / sound tech but because the music industry sucks in my country so much where I am it basically went nowhere. It is my first love and I'd love to do it as a job but really it isn't viable. I still have fun posting covers to YouTube but only just started that again recently.

I am considering starting to look for other another job but I am pretty scared of the change and not finding something good in the area or failing poorly over time with remote work.

TL;DR 3 years experience as an IT QA with a good team, good office culture, amazing area, kinda alright pay (enough to keep me afloat) but heavily bored of the job and looking to move to more automation dev work.

1lk9i5r,Applying for the same company after quitting.,"Last month I F/27 put in my two weeks as a bank teller. At the branch I felt incompetent; that everything I did and said was wrong.  I worked in a small town so the other workers knew everyone and cared more about customer service than policy. I was an outsider so I didn't  grown up with the people of the town. Even when I would try to provide customer service over policy I would get scolded for it and vice versa. It was a lose, lose situation every day.  Every month it felt like I was being called into my managers office to discuss a interaction I had with a customer that was not to the other workers standards, since the reason I was called into my managers office to discuss were not from the customer, but the workers themselves.  Most of the time my manager would agree that I did nothing wrong and the customer was not angry. I just needed to work on understanding the policy and procedures. I lasted a year on the date. May 24, 2024- May 23, 2025.  While the other workers gave me stress, the majority of the scolding was coming from the Teller that trained me. She would get mad that I was making mistakes on tasks I never done before, or telling ( not showing) me ONCE how to do a task. Most of the time she and another teller would do all the dual tasks together. When I would ask if I can do a dual task with her she would say that her and the other teller either already completed the task or she and the other teller would do the task later.  My breaking point was on the week the other teller was off. My trainer and I opened that day and I made a spelling error filling out a paper. That was her breaking point. She scolded me that she has no idea how I still making mistakes, and that maybe this job was not for me! I told her that I am not given the hands on opportunities to learn since she always wants to work on tasks with the other teller. Later that day I informed my manager of my 2 weeks notice. I didn't mention what my trainer said. 

  
My problem now is that I did not have a job lined up and have been applying to countless jobs with no replays. I been thinking about applying to another branch at the company but I am at a loss at how to explain why I left my job and why I'm applying again.

1lk9e0r,"Fired, But Someone From Admin Said That I Should Call Them. Not Sure What To Say.","Recently I was fired from an internship position that I only held down for a couple of months. I was fired officially for making jokes about workplace safety that were not appropriate. When they brought me in for a meeting last week I was genuinely shocked because I thought that I was getting along well with the people on my team and that they appreciated my sense of humor. In retrospect it was pretty stupid and I guess I've learned my lesson. It did seem somewhat strange to me though because nobody had ever spoken with me about it before. 

I don't want to make too many assumptions but I think that maybe some people had problems with my work and this was good reason to get rid of me. I had been having some issues that I was trying to improve on and towards the end I got the feeling that my supervisor was pretty frustrated with me. For context I have ADHD and I do struggle with remembering certain tasks and time management. Nobody had a formal conversation with me about my performance until I asked my supervisor to have a meeting with me the day before I was fired. I tried to apologize for a recent mistake and explain how I would try to do things differently in the future to ensure that it didn't happen again. I also revealed to them that I have ADHD. Again they seemed pretty frustrated but it also seemed like they were still willing to work things out. I asked them for any feedback and they did not tell me that that I had been making inappropriate jokes, which made getting fired the next day all the more shocking. 

Anyways as I was exiting the office for the last time, someone from admin told me I should try giving them a call after the dust had settled. I honestly have no idea what to expect. I feel doubtful that they would offer me my job back. I was only an intern and I don't think the issue was necessarily just jokes I was making. I don't know what my goal should be for this conversation, if I should offer a defense or if I should just be apologetic, or what information I should reveal, particularly about my last meeting with my supervisor. 

Any advice on my situation at all would be appreciated. I know some people will say that as an intern I should have made sure that there was no reason for my employer to be unsatisfied with me. That is true and if I get another chance in my industry I will definitely be more careful about my humor and find better strategies for dealing with my ADHD related struggles.

1lk9227,Engineer thinking about Canadian MBA?,"I'm an engineer working in the rail and transit industry in Ontario, Canada. I have my P.Eng, PMP and other designations with 7 years work experience. I work for a large construction and infrastructure company. 

I wanted to pursue an MBA with the intention of growing within the engineering field - whether that's people management, the commercial side of projects, or in more of a corporate job function within the engineering field. There's just some hesitations:

- I don't have a strong undergrad GPA so I wanted to do my GMAT and get a strong score but worried about how high I can get and if it will add value to my overall application of I target schools like Schulich, Rotman or Ivey. Don't want to spend 3 months+ of time and investment to study if it won't amount to anything. Is there still value going to other b schools that aren't top rated? I don't plan on working in MBB or IB since I enjoy the niche/reliability of engineering and the work life balance is great but I don't want to ever close any doors for no reason either because you never really know. So I would prefer to target the top schools if I am going to put in the effort anyways. 

- is there still value in pursing an MBA in this job market? With AI already so widely used - would I be making myself overqualified for engineering work and obsolete when it comes to the future of AI? 

- the risk vs reward of 100k degree and potential job prospects and upward mobility? Obviously nothing is a guarantee after an MBA but a lot of schools, people, and posts make it seem like it's a fix all - where you get the degree and land yourself in a 200k salary job. 

- overall market uncertainty especially in the Canadian market. An engineering job will guarantee a long term, stable, and recession proof career vs middle and upper management post MBA means a lot more volitity. Even if I pivot to MBB consulting there's a lot more layoffs as AI comes into the picture. 

- will it make me competitive for the type of roles I am after or would it just help to lock in within my current profession? 

I guess what I'm after is understanding what the value of an MBA is in today's climate, if it's worth it to pursue or stay where I'm at, move into middle management, which doesn't require the degree and 100k debt. 

My motivations to pursue the degree in the first place: more money, more security in a changing world, growth opportunities within my career

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

I recently received a job offer that was significantly below market rate for my experience and the responsibilities of the role. I’m trying to figure out the best way to respond without burning bridges.

How would you handle a low-ball offer?
	•	Would you counter with your target number and explain your reasoning?
	•	Would you ask if there’s room for negotiation first?
	•	Or would you decline right away if it’s too far off?

1lk84yp,Looking to transition from audit/accounting to healthcare — anyone made a similar jump?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 26F and currently working as an auditor at a mid-sized accounting firm. I hold two BBAs—one in Information Technology and one in Finance—but after a few years in the field, I’ve realized that this just isn’t it for me. I’m not fulfilled by accounting, and honestly, I’m realizing that sitting at a desk all day for the rest of my life isn’t what I want either.

Before I got deep into the business world, I worked in the healthcare field in various capacities throughout college (about 5 years of experience). Looking back, I think I really buried that passion in order to focus on “what made sense” at the time. But I’ve come to a point where I’m ready to pivot to something more meaningful, hands-on, and dynamic—something where I feel I’m actually helping people.

Right now, I’m strongly considering going back to school to become a radiologic technologist, sonographer, or even an RN. I know it’s a big change, but I also feel like this is the right time in my life to go after something that excites me. I figure if I ever want to return to business or desk work down the line, I can—but while I’m young and able, I’d rather pursue something more active and rewarding.

Has anyone here made a similar transition into healthcare? What was your experience like, especially if you came from a business/desk job background? How was the schooling process? Did you find the change fulfilling? And if you’re in one of those roles now, would you recommend it?

Any advice, experiences, or even honest takes (good or bad) would be super appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!

1lk844o,Next step(s) at 31,"Hello,

I’m writing this because I feel paralyzed by anxiety—overwhelmed, overthinking, and trying to juggle everything at once.

I’ve worked at my current job for 2.5 years. The first year was great—good pay (guaranteed), strong results, and supportive colleagues. But then everything changed. Upper management replaced my boss and close coworkers with power-hungry people focused on profit over people.

For context I've mainly worked in retail, services and sales previously and haven't attended uni as I've always been more hands on, blue collard type. Been working since I was 15, the only loan I have is my mortgage. 
Been living frugally and haven't splurged at all since 2023.

Since then, I’ve been doing my best to stay afloat. I work out the best I can, sleep well, and keep showing up, but my paycheck is now almost nothing. I’m on commission, and it’s been over a year since I felt inspired. I've gone to at least 10 job interviews, but nothing’s worked out—partly, I think, because I’m deeply conflicted about staying in this industry.

I can’t keep selling people things I know aren’t in their best interest. It goes against my values. But sticking to those principles has cost me financially.

I feel stuck. I hate my job, and I don’t know where to turn next. I tried to become a police officer, but a technical mistake delayed that path by a year. I’ve applied to electrician training, but the financial support during studies is based on my recent low income—meaning I’ll barely cover my monthly expenses.

I’ve never had a clear dream or calling. I’m not driven by competition or big money. Still, I do see myself in a leadership role someday. I’m not desperate to ""find my passion,"" but I am desperate to make a decision. The uncertainty—especially financial—causes constant anxiety.

So here I am, torn:
Should I get another job for a year, raise my income, and then start studying with better financial support?
Or should I bite the bullet, start school this fall, and rely on student loans?

To top it off, I own a small apartment that might lose significant value soon due to a new building ruining half the view—one of the few upsides that justified the price I paid.

I live in Sweden which is a positive and I know I have at least 30 years left in my to work so studying IS WORTH IT but I'm drained of motivation right now.

I'm single, no pets, no children by design. Have had relationships before, have visited quite a few countries in previous years as well which gives me some comfort today as I'm not stressed about traveling or shoving a lot of money into big excursions.

Have no one that I can crash at to elevate my expenses or anything like that. Have to stand on my own two feet.

Excuse the long text. I think I had to get it off my mind...

1lk7g7m,Leave or stay (<1 year),"Hello,

I recently had a very uncomfortable and unexpectedly confrontational meeting at work. I’m just coming off my trial/training period, and less than a month ago, I received a stellar performance evaluation. However, in this latest meeting, I was handed a document listing every mistake I’ve made since starting the role, each followed by a note that I’ve “markedly improved since.” This left me confused. If I’ve shown clear improvement and my most recent evaluation was so positive, why bring this up now?

I don’t believe my job is at risk, replacing my position would be difficult under current circumstances, but the meeting left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoy my work and have a good relationship with most of my coworkers. The only ongoing tension is with one colleague, and unfortunately, that individual is now expected to step into my manager’s role, which could make things more uncomfortable going forward.

Separately, I recently received a job offer from an old connection. I initially interviewed without serious intent to leave, as I hadn’t planned to move on so soon, it hasn’t even been a year. However, the offer is for a position that aligns more closely with my long-term interests and pays more. I reached back out to express renewed interest and am now setting up a final meeting to discuss logistics with the hiring team. I’d even be open to relocating.

Now I’m torn. I genuinely like my current job, but this recent experience and the looming shift in leadership have me rethinking things. Should I stay in a role I mostly enjoy, despite some growing red flags, or move on to an exciting new opportunity?

  
OOOO one last thing I love this organization and although its large and I would never work for this team again I am likely interested in rejoing this company at another point in my career maybe a few years from now. Will this quiting before one year affect my HR file and affect my chances of rehiring?

**TL;DR:**  
Great recent review, but just had a confusing and negative meeting reviewing old mistakes despite “marked improvement.” One problematic coworker (with potential to become my manager) adds to discomfort. Got a better offer that aligns with my interests and pay goals. Not sure if I should leave a job I mostly like after less than a year, or take the opportunity now.",HawkEmbarrassed6352,1,1.0,1,1750862375,2025-06-25 14:39:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lk7g7m/leave_or_stay_1_year/,6,2025
1lk781r,High Stress Asynchronous/Flexible Hours?,"The asynchronous job ends up being roughly 40 hours a week, but the hours are very flexible since it's a global company, so at all times is someone working.

1lk6q7q,How do I navigate structural changes,"My organization seems to be going through some restructuring. I am pretty in tune with how the new structure will look and overall think it’s a good idea and will provide growth in my role. There are 2 things I am struggling with. The first is $$$. I have been with my company for well over a decade and have a history of taking on more work whenever asked. I never minded too much as it kept things interesting. However, these increases in work load (very rarely did I lose tasks when taking on new work) never came with any raises. I was only ever given promotions when it was abundantly clear that I was no longer doing the same job as everyone else (and these promotions only came with minimal raises, I am still at the low end of what my position should be making. The only time I was given a significant raise was when I had an offer in hand from another company making more than I was as a manager to be an individual contributor). I’m worried about falling into the same pattern. If things get structured the way the seem to be going, I will be doing my current job x3-4. I don’t expect a title change just more work. I feel like if I were to receive that piece of paper saying I was getting a new title it MAY be easier to have the compensation conversation but would be very hard for me otherwise. If the entire organization is moving in this direction what would happen if I said no, I don’t want to do this without a significant raise? 
Next, with this new structure it is almost certain there will be a new higher level manager position created (that I would be reporting to). I would be a long shot for the job for many reasons and don’t even think I’d be interested in it at this point in time. The problem is, 2 of the 3 likely candidates I don’t feel I could ever work for. 1 has certain relationships with individuals that would have a large say in who gets the role. However, I do not feel they are an effective leader. They are not responsive and pass off responsibility (and blame). The other, I actually like their ideas and how they operate from a business standpoint but, to put it bluntly, they are an asshole. They do not listen to other people (even when they have more experience with certain things) and make assumptions about how things operate that end up coming back to bite us. He wants to appear to be a team player but really just wants to make himself look good. On many occasions I have asked for him to share information (things that are well within the scope of my role, nothing that would be deemed confidential) so I can mitigate certain risks but he insists that if there are any negative outcomes he will “fall on the sword for the team.” Maybe I’m wrong for wanting us to stay out of situations where we need to apologize and correct mistakes. This is a known behavior. He has been passed off to multiple teams because people have such a hard time working with him. Unfortunately, I think he will be the one getting the promotion. The third candidate is only really in the running because of their current responsibilities, but is not a strong leader overall so I don’t think they will end up getting it. I have a decent relationship with them and feel they would not make waves for me. Overall I’m feeling a bit disheartened by where I see things going despite feeling excited about what my role could look like. I’m torn between just putting my head down and trying to push through (even if I’m miserable) or making a big fuss about things which probably won’t end well either.

1lk46dr,I got too comfortable and messed up building my career. Is there any way for me to get a remote job as someone with a masters degree in linguistics?,"I am from a third world country. I have a BS and an Mphil degree in Linguistics. I have been working as a translator for over a decade despite being 26, because I got into it in my teens. It is what made me choose these subjects for my degrees as well. My problem came from the fact that I got too comfortable in the work I was doing. I was working as a language services provider (English <> Urdu) for another linguist, who sourced out their work. The work was ample and paid nicely and I kept at it while finishing up my degrees. I did get a job as an administrator in a local court house (a very hard to get job), however, it did not pay good, so I eventually left it.

For several reasons, it seems that I might have to find a new career for myself soon as I might not be able to continue the previous work for long. My options now are to find some remote work which leverages my skills and knowledge or become a school teacher, which will land me in poverty in my country.

I guess my question is, what kind of a career can I try to work for which is remote and doesn't land me in poverty. I am great in my own field; have good problem solving (except, apparently, this one) and good administrative skills, and I am also fairly creative and am always doing something: photography, videos, short story, stage plays (have written, acted and directed in them) and sometimes, political opinion pieces. With all of this, is there any hope for me? I would also love any recommendations about (maybe hard to learn but easy to get in) careers I can work for (courses, learning skills, certifications, anything will do).

At this point, I'd do unpaid stuff, if it meant getting my foot in the door (which is I guess, an internship lol)",Najam99,2,1.0,6,1750854060,2025-06-25 12:21:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lk46dr/i_got_too_comfortable_and_messed_up_building_my/,6,2025

1lk1mh0,Remote job opportunities,"Hey everyone! 🤗 
Like many of you, I spent *months* sifting through sketchy listings and generic job boards trying to find legit remote opportunities. It’s exhausting. 

Recently, I came across a free service that actually delivers value: **They curate personalized remote job openings daily** and email them directly to you. No spammy ""get rich quick"" stuff just actual roles (entry-level to experienced) from companies hiring remotely.

**How it works:**  
1. **You tell them your skills/interests** (e.g., customer service, writing, data entry, design).  
2. **They send 1 daily email** with vetted opportunities matching your profile.  
3. **Zero cost, no commitment** just opt out anytime.  

**Features I appreciated:**  
✅ **Real flexibility**: Part-time, freelance, full-time  
✅ **No experience needed** for many roles  
✅ **Global opportunities** (US, EU, Worldwide)  
✅ **No fees or upsells** (seriously it’s just a free newsletter)  

**Why I’m sharing this:**  
It saved me hours of hunting. Instead of scrolling LinkedIn or Indeed, I get tailored leads in my inbox. If you’re serious about finding remote work, it’s a solid starting point.  

**How to sign up:**  
→ **Send a quick email to Emily (HR)**: [emily.remotejobs@gmail.com]
*(Subject line: ""Remote Job List - [Your Job Interest]"")*  

**Include these details:**  
- Your name  
- 2-3 job types you’re seeking (e.g., ""Customer Support,"" ""Content Writing"")  
- Any key skills (e.g., ""Fluent in Spanish,"" ""Shopify experience"")  

**Important Notes:**  
🔒 **Privacy**: They only use your info to send job matches (no shady data sharing).  
🚫 **No paid placements**: this isn’t a hiring agency. Just a free alert service.  
📆 Takes 24-48 hours to get your first list.  

**My experience**: Got 3 interview invites in the first week (for roles I’d have missed otherwise). Even if you’re just exploring remote work, it’s worth the 2-minute email.

b. taking the GRE to get into B schools in India that accept GRE. I used to be so energetic about going abroad and studying as I thought that would be the best thing for me .

1lk03c5,From software engineering to what? Looking for advice on my carrer path,"Context:
Hello everyone. I come from a programming brackgorund pretty much most of my life and now have a BSc in software engineering. 

I think I'm going through a quarter life crisis and feel like I have to figure out what I wanna do with my life quickly. I hate the thought of working a 9-5 that doesn't push me to learn something new every week. I wanna be stimulated, not by cheap dopamine but by work I love.

The more i formally studied SE the less interested I became in it in regards to IT jobs like front end or back end dev, dev ops, ui/ux, etc. 

Getting nerdy:
I've always been into wild physics theories I couldn't fully understand and love deep philosophical discussions on the nature of matter, consciousness, time, etc. 

Another big love I have right is for Bioinformatics, 
but I've seen less posts describe going form SE to Bio than Bio to SE. I do believe my programming background would be a good headstart there in terms of problem solving, but I lack formal bio knowledge.

Yet I never persued these fields in the beginning but only studied in free time, seeing as the best thing my small town had to offer was Software engineering. 

Question:
What direction should I take my professional life, such that I am most satisfied with what I do and what I want to do? How are the fileds of Data science, ML, Bioinformatics looking these days realistically - for someone with my interests?
And, alternate timeline, is it late to switch to study full-on theoretical physics?

1ljzc09,Torn Between Pursuing an MBA or Continuing in Tech‼️ Which one to choose?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently at a crossroads in my career and would genuinely appreciate some insight from those who've been in a similar situation.

I come from a BCom background, but over the past 1.5 years, I’ve been working in MERN stack development, and I really enjoy tech. I'm also curious about AI and the way it's shaping the future — I’d love to be part of that wave in some capacity.

Lately, I’ve been seriously considering an MBA, ideally with a focus on tech/product management or analytics, but a part of me is scared:

I’m an introvert, and I’m unsure if I’d “fit in” or thrive in the MBA world, which often seems loud, high-pressure, and full of extroverts.

I like coding, but I sometimes feel like I’m not good enough. With so many new frameworks, languages, and tools emerging constantly, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed or behind.

I'm worried that I might choose the wrong path, or worse — end up being mediocre in both.

What’s making it tougher is that I do like working with logic, solving real-world problems, and I’ve started becoming curious about business and how tech products scale. I think I’d enjoy something like Product Management or AI Strategy, but I’m not confident if I’ll succeed, especially with my personality.

🙏 What I’m Hoping to Learn:
Has anyone here made a similar switch from tech (or a non-tech background) into an MBA? Was it worth it?

Can introverts succeed in MBA and post-MBA careers?

Are tech + MBA hybrid roles (like PM, tech consultant, AI-focused roles) truly worth the investment?

Would I be better off doubling down on my developer skills and going deep into tech/AI instead?

While searching, I thought of jobs I'd be interested in, and it was a big one. Thing is, I know/was told that the it job market is terrible right now.

That made me think about other job markets, and more specifically, if the idea of pursuing a job doing something you like is even reasonable now. Like, if you want to make animations or something, is spending all the time to get the skills and certificates needed even worth it, or will you likely not get anything with it because of how the job market is?

I still feel very new to job searching, so I apologize if I've made a mistake in some area, but I just wanted to know.",SpookySquid19,10,1.0,3,1750825934,2025-06-25 04:32:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ljwhw1/is_pursuing_a_job_in_something_you_enjoy_even/,6,2025
1ljvac8,I am lost. And angry.,"Hi there, I'm 19M turning 20 this year and recent life events has got me rethinking everything. I feel like my hands are tied because of my brother, who is 12 years older than me. For starters, I run a Google Ads agency. The only reason I started it was because I was a broke 17 year old back then and I wanted to make my own money. Before that, I was only intrigued because I heard him mention ""digital marketing"" and thought it sounded cool. I was heavily influenced by my brother as I used to see him attend meetings, and I really wanted to be like him one day. I forgot to mention that he's an entrepreneur of >10 years , starting multiple businesses and failing, then trying again. It is no wonder I look up to him for advice, especially business related.

6-months ago, I hit a snag in my agency. Trying to juggle my mother's mental health, studies, and a business that's just taking off is not for the weak. I burnt out. I pushed myself too much in the pursuit of my dreams. In the end, I decided to make my mother and my academics a priority, which led to clients leaving me; a really daunting experience. I promised myself I would never go through something like that again, and told myself I'd be taking a break from agency building for a few weeks.

A few weeks turned into a few months. Even now, I'm not working on it. There are a few reasons for it:

1. I am interning at my brother's startup right now (8.30-7 usually)
2. Everytime I start doing agency work, I get stressed and anxious
3. My brother has constantly told me to not continue building an agency, as service businesses aren't scalable

The combination of these three reasons are why I am stuck right now. My internship is only paying me a measly $300 per month, and I am not happy being stuck at office for 10 hours everyday typing and clicking away. My horrible work ethics during internship has got me scolded recently, and I have lost the respect of my colleagues. However, when I brought up the issue of my salary, I got a, ""I think you are being paid too much because what you are learning here is much more than what money can give you."" along with other feedback about my work ethics and work quality. I feel undervalued and insulted, especially when another intern they've just hired is making 4 times my salary.

It's not about the money per se. Agency shenanigans has taught me that short-term profits do not come over my long-term wellbeing. It is about the unfair exchange of value that's going on here. I've given up my 4-figure salary at my own agency to come and work for my brother for $300 in hopes to use my talent to help him, and spend more time with him. My talent did help him, and I did get to spend more time with him. Which is why the problem is at this opportunity cost, he did not think it was worth it to even pay me market rate ($600-$800) for an intern. Mind you, I have a diploma in Computer Engineering. $300 is insulting, really. Matter of fact, he thought it was too much, and said it was a privilege for me to get an internship without having to go through any interviews.

What I really want right now, is to work on something that I like that pays well. What I liked about agency was that I got to talk to people, really really cool and successful people. I had freedom of my time, and it paid well. What I didn't like was churn, and the boring work it took to get to talk to these people. Either way, I wasn't stuck on my computer for hours everyday, and my calendar had meaningful meetings. But with this internship, I'm stuck on my laptop doing repetitive tasks every single day. But what can I do? This guy is my brother, and my boss.

I don't know what to do moving forward. Start an AI agency? Continue working on my google ads agency? Start a startup?",fartfacewon,1,1.0,2,1750822015,2025-06-25 03:26:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ljvac8/i_am_lost_and_angry/,6,2025

1ljuaoj,Seeking Advice on Handling Significant Pay Cut and Potential Layoff,"The company I currently work for has been in steady decline, with four rounds of layoffs over the past year and only a skeleton crew remaining. Earlier this year, we were all subject to a 12% pay cut. 

More recently, in part due to the company running out of money, the executive team drastically overhauled the compensation structure—slashing my base salary by 75% from what it was when I was originally hired and replacing it with a commission-heavy model. The new base salary is frankly laughable, especially given there’s no viable sales strategy and virtually no sales activity. The new structure is both unrealistic and unsustainable.

I don’t wish to accept the new pay structure and would prefer to be laid off in order to receive severance and qualify for unemployment benefits.

1ljtq1z,"What should I do? Didn’t get the promotion, MS in Counseling but work in Customer Service","I have worked in customer service for my current employer for about 4 years. I started working for the company when I started graduate school for counseling (3 years), then I started looking at my options for moving up a few months after graduating. I recently applied for a position that I met the preferred qualifications for (so probably on the higher end of possible candidates). While my title is customer service my contributions go beyond that title. My ideas have been used to make changes in our company’s processes and communications. My company makes a big deal about wanting to promote/hire from within the company. I found out that I didn’t get the position. The interview seemed to go well, so I feel irritated. The interviewer seemed to have reservations about the fact that my position was in customer service initially. However, after sharing my contributions and experience the interviewer seemed to warm up to me a lot. That is why I felt like I was still a strong candidate.

I am not sure if I should start looking for another job or wait on other opportunities in the company? I am just worried that the company isn’t going to have many good opportunities in the near future because we are not very big, so between 100-200 employees.

1ljteje,How to get Opportunities in life?,"I’m a Finance student from Toronto, Canada, and I’m tired of not getting any opportunities in life.

I’ve applied to hundreds of internships, scholarships, programs, conferences, and events, etc. Nothing works.

I’m ready to work. I’m ready to learn. I’m ready to do anything. But I’m not getting any opportunities.

People talked about missed opportunities, while I'm begging to get one.

I came to the realization that you genuinely have to be rich to make it in life. The majority of top finance, consulting and acting jobs go to people who attend top schools. Those people also end up going to private boarding schools before attending university, which cost like 40k a year. In other words, they were born rich.

Yeah, there’s some people who gets a high-caliber job, but the majority of the opportunities in life go to these stuck-up rich people who don’t want to help others. They have this circle where they only want to give opportunities to other rich people, creating this enclosed circle.

I’ve been networking like crazy at school, networking events, nonprofit organizations, Linkedin etc. I wasn’t born rich. I’m starting my career from the absolute bottom. I don’t know what to do.

My life feels miserable now that I don't have any internship. I have so many dreams and aspirations, and I’m willing to perform. But I’m not getting any chances.

I’m just a broke college student. All my aspirations are crushed because I’m broke with no industry connections. Most people don’t want to help me out or know anyone, despite reaching out. I need to get rich.

I’ve linked a couple more posts about my resume and job process if you want to understand me better.

What should I do?

I’ve spent the last ten years working in the fashion and personal care world, a space I’ve come to love deeply. Along the way, I’ve had some incredible jobs and some that left me feeling totally disconnected. What’s always stayed with me is how hard it can be to find work that actually feels right. Not just a job, but something that supports your life and truly means something to you.

It’s something that’s been on my heart for a long time, and recently, I quietly started building a little project. It’s a small site for women looking for jobs in fashion, beauty, wellness, and personal care. My hope is that it makes the search feel a little easier, a little less overwhelming, and maybe even inspiring.

I just wanted to share it in case it resonates. And if you’re open to it, I’d love your honest feedback. What would you want to see in a space like this? Here’s the [site](https://www.glowhired.com) if you’d like to take a look.

1ljpcin,Full time job feels like walking on eggshells with people but there is absolutely no reason for it to feel as such,"Hey guys, 

I am a recent graduate, graduated from undergrad last year. My company feels very caring, they care for my wellbeing outside of work, respectful of my boundaries, communicative, and understanding. Everyone on my team. The whole company feels like this. I already hit my month 3 at the job, almost about to be month 4. 

However. 

This is entirely to do with me and my own experience. But I just get really fight or flight adrenaline rush when I am having 1 on 1s or meetings with superiors. It’s like I start to disassociate. 

I got fired from my last job for bogus “underperformance” claims. I was breaking up with my ex and having to move out from the home we lived in together in ONE WEEK during the first and only month I was employed at my last company. No one at the company knew this, but I would show up kind of visibly distraught, sluggish, upset. My old coworker said it was like night and day, until I tried to turn it around.

But even being employed there for one month, I hated it from the start, cliques were present, and leadership was shoddy. This was also a full time salaried position, but it was the complete opposite of my current experience at my job in terms of both workload and company culture. 

At my job today, in my own head, it feels like any wrong move I make will make me end up in that chair again, across from my manager, ready to put me on a PIP or fire me. I just don’t know how to not get triggered by this sight. It’s not good. I don’t want my current job to feel like I am not present with the work I’m doing. I’m just traumatized?

1ljnpnv,I'm 23 and I've wasted my life. Is everything over?,"So I'm 23 and I'm completely lost in life. 

I was a semi decent student in school but i never had any talents. I wasn't very good at arts or sports neither. I never felt like I had an inclination or something. 

I didn't manage to get accepted into a university, although I tried twice. I failed the entrance exams mainly because i used procrastinate everyday and i didn't know how to study correctly. I remember that i wouldn't start studying until midnight and then it would get too late. I still have sleep problems, i could never sleep ""early"" i always stay awake until late midnight. And I don't know if my brain is actually wired how it is supposed to in order to do OK academic stuff. 

After failing to attend higher education i started working in a warehouse. I stayed there for 1 year but it was just a dead and job and it wouldn't get me anywhere. I thought that getting a trade could probably be the solution to ""finding a good job"" but i was wrong. 

I'm physically weak and small and the construction site was hell. The tradesmen would get very mad and yell at me constantly (I have literally 0 spatial awareness). They'd say that i was too dumb for manual work and i didn't have the brains that were demanded for it. I got laid off after a while and i began feeling really overwhelmed and useless. I didn't know how to use the tools correctly. Whenever I had my hands on them it didn't feel right and I think I need more time than the average person to get a grasp of how things work. 

I also don't have any close friends at all. Rarely anyone messages me and i usually stay at home everyday. I don't get social cues and I'm really awkward with people I don't know. I've been depressed and unemployed for a year now and it's terrible. It's just latestage alienation. I'm basically a NEET

I can see my parents disappointment on me which gets worse and worse everyday but i don't know how to get out of this situation. 

I've been thinking for years that I might be autistic with ADHD but i was never diagnosed as a child and it's petty hard to get diagnosed here when you're an adult. I don't have any social skills at all and i suffer from general anxiety disorder and depression. I find it hard to complete simple tasks. For example i have my driving's license but i won't drive, I'm a terrible driver and sitting behind the wheel is something that my brain refuses to handle. 

Could i possibly have learning disabilities or be borderline mentally retarded who's somewhat functional? Life's so hard. I feel like I'm genuinely trying but I can't make it. 

My life is just dull and repetitive. I've completely lost track of time. I just wake up and wait till this day is over only to experience the same thing the next day. It's like groundhogs day, but with grey colors.

I see everyone being happy or making progress in their lives but im still 23 and stuck in the exact same place that every one was after high school. I feel like I've missed so much time and it's too late. All of my classmates from school have already graduated from uni and are trying to get their lives together while I'm still at 0. 

The worst thing is that i don't have any interests or passions, I don't feel like anything is worth trying tbh. I also can't think of anything that I'd like to follow. Everything seems just boring and blunt. Plus i find it hard to understand complex subjects like Maths. I'm not American so I can't go to a community college and I can't join the army here in my country. 

I wish i could be smart and excel in Maths but no matter how much I've tried, i couldn't make it. Time is running fast, I'll be 30 after blinking. The thing I'm most afraid of is that I'll stay forever with my parents and after they'll gone ill end up homeless... 

Is it too late for me? I really want to make it. Maybe I'm an undiagnosed neurodivergent? Has someone gone through the same thing? I'd appreciate any helpful advice...",Scarface19999,19,0.6399999856948853,42,1750800836,2025-06-24 21:33:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ljnpnv/im_23_and_ive_wasted_my_life_is_everything_over/,6,2025
1ljnmx9,Luxury Retail 24 hour Job Decision,"I am currently 26 years old and I work in the luxury retail field. I’ve been at my current company now for about 2 1/2 years starting as a temporary assistant to a permanent full-time worker. 

I like the company that I work at now mostly because I enjoy the staff that I work with. We are a smaller team and smaller brand so we are truly like a family. I have learned a lot from my colleagues and build great relationships with my managers and clients while here.

Recently, I applied to another brand and received a job offer yesterday. It is unequivocally a bigger name and bigger store with more prestige. They are offering me the same hourly rate with a higher percentage of commission. 
When I came to my boss about this recent opportunity, he offered me an even higher hourly than the offer and a promotion to being a senior. 

Current store:
Pros
-Well connected with everyone on my team, management, and the higher-ups
-Promotion and higher hourly rate
-Well developed clientele


Cons
-Higher and more demanding expectations than  the already high standards set now with promotion
-although I love my team, there can be drama
-very slow off-season
-not as much demand consistently throughout the year

New opportunity:
Pros
-bigger brand and new opportunity to learn
-I would gain more insight in the industry as a whole since my current job is my only experience
-slightly higher commission
-there are big things coming for this brand in the next year. It is the brand to watch.
-more consistent pay throughout the year

Cons
-because it is a bigger brand it is more cutthroat with hitting high sales targets
-how management operates is very important to me and I’ve heard that the management is not the best at bigger brands
-It would be more challenging to start over again

I need to make a decision by tomorrow and I’m not sure what to do. I could take the leap and try out something new altogether. An opportunity I’m honestly very excited to have been offered. 

On the other hand, my company has treated me pretty well throughout the past few years. (well as well as retail can treat you I guess. Retail is just known for being toxic.) my current company sees a lot of growth potential in me and to be promoted three times within 2 1/2 years on my resume would also look good. 

Right now I’m at a 50-50 split because my boss offered the promotion. I would appreciate any advice from anyone in this field or anyone that has experience this dilemma.

1ljl761,"26, stuck between lineman or firefighter please help","I’m 26 and trying to figure out what direction to take with my life. I’ve been a union painter in the film industry for a while, but I want something more stable. A real career I can grow in, with benefits, time off, and the ability to support a family.

Right now I’m stuck between becoming a lineman or a firefighter. I’ve been researching both for months and I still can’t decide. I’m hoping people actually in the trades can share some honest insight.

I like working with my hands and being outdoors. I want a stable, union job with a future like a pension or retirement. I’m okay with physical work and tough conditions, but I also want some kind of work-life balance. I don’t want to be gone for weeks at a time weekends off or regular rotations are a big plus. I’m not the best at math but I’m willing to learn if it’s worth it. I care about purpose, but I also care about making good money.

Lineman seems like great money, strong union, and lots of opportunity. But I’ve heard it’s super dangerous, the schooling and apprenticeship is long, and it can be really hard on your body. I’m also worried about having to move or travel just to get a job early on.

Firefighter I like the idea of helping people, the team environment, and the 24 on / 48 off schedule some departments have. I plan to get my EMT soon and maybe go through a fire academy. But it seems really competitive to get hired and I don’t want to waste years trying and not get in.

If you’ve worked as either (or both), what do you wish you knew before you started? What’s the day-to-day like? What would you recommend for someone like me?

I was never that good in school but I feel like doing any of these I’ll be very motivated since it’s something I really want to do

I’ve been working as an in-house Product Engineer for the past 3 years, developing robust industrial electronics (mostly safety systems for cranes and heavy-duty vehicle implements). Lately, I’ve been feeling burned out and unfulfilled in my current role. I live in Latin America, where my total compensation is far below what a minimum-wage engineer in the US/EU makes for a tiring 44 h workweek. I’m considering pivoting to remote freelance work—primarily PCB design (from simple layouts up to RF) and broader electronic project development.

The guy above me was laid off, and I was told I have an opportunity to step up but will not be able to follow the original plan to move me into project management.

Not ideal, but I accepted it and took it in stride. I immediately coordinated with tons of people, jumped onto anything he left behind, stayed working extra hours to cover last minute deadlines, and started getting up earlier to absorb his calls.

I was supposed to be given a pretty large project. I was excited about this and was happy to finally have an opportunity to do something noticeable. However today I was informed that my manager, once again, took the work from our group and gave it to someone on her team who has very little experience in our discipline. 

So essentially, my upward movement has been stalled drastically, and I am also not being given opportunities to prove myself. Previously those opportunities were all given to the person who was laid off, so this felt like my chance.

1ljjzwp,Torn Between Meaningful Work and Big Money,"WOOF

This is a tough one for me, and I could really use some outside perspective.

I’m m-36, just had my first child, and I’m in the final stages of interviews for a new job that would almost double my salary. But leaving my current job feels like leaving a part of who I am.

I’ve been with my current company for nearly a decade. They hired me when I had zero experience, and it completely changed my life. Over the years I’ve grown into a more senior role as an account manager, become the go-to person for others, and built strong relationships with my team. I make \~$100K with a $30K bonus structure, solid benefits, a company car, and a flexible, mostly remote schedule. Since my child was born, they’ve even allowed me to work exclusively from home, which has been a huge help.

I genuinely love the work. It’s meaningful to me. I feel like I’m doing good in the world, and I have autonomy, purpose, and a great team. My job doesn’t feel like a grind, and I’m able to set my own hours.

The flip side is that growth is basically stalled. I’ve received only one promotion and about $40K in salary raises over nearly 10 years. My manager isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, and there’s just not much room to grow—at least not financially. I never minded that before, because the work felt worth it. But now, with a child, I’ve been looking more critically at our finances and long-term security.

So, just to test the waters, I took an interview—and now I’m deep into talks for a new role. It’s very different work, and a bit of a stretch from my values, but not in an unethical way. The offer on the table would likely be \~$200K base with additional bonus potential. it's still remote but with 50% travel.

It’s also a “build from scratch” situation—no real infrastructure or team in place. I’d be the first person in the role, building something from the ground up. There’s talk of growth, expansion, even future leadership roles if I succeed. It’s got the vibes of a startup, with the backing of a large company.

But the truth is—I’m emotionally invested in my current job. The people feel like family. I’ve gone from being the noob to the expert mentoring others. I’m passionate about what I do now and i am very good at it. I worry that I’d be walking away from something rare for something riskier that’s only attractive because of the money. I know this is a situation a lot of people would love to be in but i am having a hard time. Maybe this is the midlife crisis I have heard about my whole life?? yikes.

Still, money matters more now. I want to give my kid the best future I can. And I know opportunities like this don’t come along often.

**TL;DR:**  
Been in my current job for \~10 years. Love the work, love the people, great flexibility, decent pay ($100K + bonus), but no real growth potential. Have only received 1 promotion and $40k worth of raises in \~10 years. Now I’m a new dad with tight finances, and a new opportunity is offering $200K+ to build something from scratch. It’s less aligned with my passions but has big upside. I would use my past 10 years experience and network to be primed for success. What would you do?

Interested in Masters in AI/ML, Masters n Data Science, and Masters in Data Analytics.

Willing to learn hard and fast if I know I can realistically get into the field.

Long-term, I want a high-paying job with growth, ideally at the intersection of tech, business, and strategy.

My Questions:
Can someone from my background realistically make it in AI/ML or Data Science?

Is Data Analytics a safer bet considering my skill set? How is the job market for it?

If I go for a Master’s abroad (e.g. in Australia), which of these paths offer the best return on investment?

What preparation should I start now (I have about 3–6 months before applying)?

1ljinnl,Do I stay in NYC for an entertainment career or move to Dallas for better quality of life?,"Hi! Never made a post like this before. I (M27) am feeling more confused than ever about my career path and I’m under pressure to make a major decision very soon. I’m based in NYC and worked in entertainment/media for three years at a major multimedia company as an executive assistant and in marketing. I left in April due to impending layoff risks on my team and some growing industry disillusionment (low pay compared to other fields, lack of growth, etc). 

I took a higher ed admin job due to that being another industry of potential interest. However, the position is much more entry-level than advertised and has no real opportunity for upward mobility. The pay is slightly better but I don’t see room for meaningful career growth here. I’ve been trying to get back into E&M and my old company has a role similar to my prior one available, but it’s eventually spinning off to a new company so the long-term stability is questionable. I’ve applied elsewhere but NYC’s E&M market is quite stagnant right now (I know LA usually has more options but I can’t move there atm due to personal reasons).

Here’s where things get really complicated: my partner and I were presented the option to move to Dallas, TX very recently. There are many compelling factors to consider this move (cheaper cost of living and being able to save more money, living much closer to our families, more comfortable lifestyle), and my partner can transfer internally within their company. We’ve realized the only thing keeping us in NYC is the convenience of already living here. But Dallas has virtually zero E&M opportunities so I feel like I’d basically be giving up on film/TV dreams for now and likely settling for a random corporate marketing/comms/admin role. Our plan would be to live in Dallas for at least the next year while we evaluate where we want to end up long-term. 

I guess I’m having a hard time feeling like I’m giving up on E&M entirely as it’s always been my goal to work in film/TV and I made it very deep in the interview process last year for a few roles at other major companies, which gives me hope that another great opportunity could eventually work out. I also don’t want my three years of great experience at a major company to go to waste. However, the options seem so limited atm and I have reservations about the volatility of the industry (it’s notorious for layoffs) and the meager pay unless you reach the exec level. 

I’m so overwhelmed about what to decide. Unfortunately, we also have to make this decision very soon as we have to renew our lease in NYC within the next week if we choose not to move to Dallas.

1lji3mj,Getting Cold Feet after accepting a new job offer,"I have been working remotely the past 2 years and yes the hours and flexibility are great and have their pros. But I occasionally feel isolated since my wife has such a hectic schedule. I just accepted a job for $96K salary in person 45hrs a week. I love working for my current boss and company and they just counter offered me the same $96K base for only 40hrs a week plus profit sharing and bonuses that can stretch up to $8k-$10k. Do I take the counter at the company with better work life balance but risk burning the bridge with this recruiter and company since I already accepted or take the risk for less pay and go back in person to the new job?

1ljh3lk,What to do next?,"I’m 25 and been working for the past 4 years. I’ve been in my current company for 3 years. I’ve been on the lookout for the past half a year due to several factors:

1) company is not giving bonuses or promotions. (Boss has tried but his hands are tied) 
2) I no longer have the motivation to work there and my sense of belonging is gone 

That being said, my boss does treat me well and it’s BAU despite me not having the motivation 

However I’ve been getting barely anything. The one job offer I was most looking forward to dropped me after several interviews and case studies and I’ve been ghosted left and right. 

Enter company A. A notorious e-commerce company has offered me a 20% increase in salary. However I know that the job is extremely fast paced and slightly out of comfort zone and it’s five days in office (my current job is 2 days in office). I’m not particularly keen on this job but it’s the only offer so far 

Two routes to take:

1) I take up company A’s offer, but just potentially go into something a lot worse 
2) I try to get a counteroffer from my current company to match company A’s offer. While I do believe that there’s a high chance for me get a counteroffer, I do think it’s a dick move as I’ve pulled it before and it removes my chance of escaping current comp. 

The only thing stopping me from taking route 1 is that I’ve done the math. Going in 5 days a week will significantly eat up not only my time but also almost 70% of the pay increase anyway in terms of food and commute ",uwant_sumfuk,1,1.0,0,1750785628,2025-06-24 17:20:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ljh3lk/what_to_do_next/,6,2025
1ljh35y,Stressing about moving out & asking my company for a raise,"This will likely be a long post so I apologize.

I am 31 y/o male in New England. Never spent a second inside a college classroom. Didn't have much direction in my life until a few years ago. I landed an amazing job at an amazing company which makes me feel incredibly fortunate. Basically, inside sales for materials distribution. Almost two years I've been here. I think I might have low-balled myself with the starting salary, but within these two years I've gotten bumped by 10k which I think is pretty generous. I've never made a peep about my salary, just accepted what it was & when more came, I was thrilled. However, now that I finally have a bit of a savings & am looking to move out, it's clear that the money I'm making just isn't going to cut it. Rents are just so high for anything other than a cardboard box and it has me feeling really stressed.

I love this company - The people I work for & with are absolutely top tier. I wouldn't dream of leaving. But I have been floating the idea with myself of asking them if there is any possibility of bumping my pay to accommodate for my new living situation. Up until now this pay has felt very good, but I am in a much different position in life than I was two years ago when I started. I've done the budgeting & after rent, utilities & everything else to consider, end of month I'd be lucky to be left with $250.00 - And that is only factoring in the lowest possible rent. Is that normal, or am I overreacting? I feel like a person should still be able to save at least $250-$300 each month, not barely have that leftover after every other expense is accounted for.

Around October last year was when annual raises went out. And honestly, I was incredibly happy & actually surprised with how much I got. I was given a 15% bump. The last thing I want to do is be greedy or appear unappreciative. I don't want to jeopardize my relationship or my standing with any of my superiors. But I was thinking of speaking with them & asking for at least 13%, not necessarily immediately, but maybe at least in October when the raises go out again. Or maybe even 6.5% now if possible & the other 6.5% in October. Am I crazy? That's too much to ask for right? I don't know... Or maybe it's best to not ask for anything. The full 13% only leaves me with an extra ~$300 every month. I don't think I'm being greedy, I'm not trying to live above my means. I just don't want to be searching the couch cushions for change at the end of every month. Also, based on a conversation I had with a co-worker who is basically in my same position, I have a suspicion that I am still currently very underpaid.

Not sure what to do, if I should say anything or just suffer through the outrageous cost of living. Any advice would be appreciated.",Waihf,1,0.9900000095367432,2,1750785601,2025-06-24 17:20:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ljh35y/stressing_about_moving_out_asking_my_company_for/,6,2025

1ljgnnd,"Feeling stuck, undervalued, and anxious at work. I don’t know what to do anymore","Hey everyone,

I'm a 26-year-old Linux system administrator, and I've been working at a small company for 3 years. I initially joined just to complete my internships, but eventually became a full-time employee. When I started, it was just me, the CEO, and one other person in a tiny 1+0 office. I was basically the first technical hire, and over time I became more like the CEO’s right-hand guy — not just doing tech work, but also picking up a lot of extra stuff, being involved in decisions, and earning his trust.

He would often call it a “master-apprentice” kind of relationship. I was working really hard, especially after a difficult breakup 2.5 years ago — I threw myself into work to cope. I became the “reliable one,” the go-to person, and it felt like I was valued.

But lately, everything’s changed.

The company started hiring aggressively — lots of new, inexperienced people. One of them, who’s supposed to assist me, has a totally different personality. Very loud, talks a lot, tries to stand out — the opposite of me. I’m introverted, quiet, and honestly hate being in the office every day. But that’s not even the main problem.

The real issue is... there's not much work anymore. And now I feel this crushing anxiety:

What if I don’t have anything to do?

What if they think I’m useless?

What do I give to the person under me when there’s nothing left to assign?

I constantly feel like I’m falling behind, even though I’m not. I come home exhausted, mentally drained, and I go to bed super early just to escape the day. I’ve been depressed for a while now. And even though I feel like I’m not functioning properly, I’m terrified to look for a new job because this place does feel like home — or at least it did.

I keep thinking:

>

It’s confusing. I'm stuck between staying in a place where I feel safe but undervalued… or leaving and risking total uncertainty. Have any of you gone through something like this? How do you deal with the fear of being useless at work — even when people don’t say it out loud?

1ljgf23,"At 25, unemployed and soul-searching, I'm torn between the comfort of hospitality work and the deeper purpose of nursing. Is starting over at 30 worth it?","Need Advice:

Hi! I’m turning 25 next month and I’m currently unemployed. I worked in the hospitality industry for about six months. I was a Front Office Associate (or receptionist) in a hotel. I actually enjoyed what I was doing there, but the long commute made me resign. I stayed for almost six months in my first job. Then I got the same job at a hotel nearby, but I only lasted a month because the management was terrible and the way they processed documents wasn’t up to standard. It was a four-star hotel, but it felt like I was working in a two-star one.

I’ve been unemployed for five months now. I took a two-month break to rest and travel, and now I’m applying again. I’ve received a few initial interview invites, but I’ve chosen not to return to the life I had before. While working in a hotel was fulfilling in some ways, I feel like I’m meant for more.

I considered applying to BPO companies as a call center agent because of the higher salary, but I’ve heard that once you enter BPO, it’s hard to leave. So BPO is not part of my plan.

I also feel like there are limited opportunities for me in the hotel industry. I’ve never seen older people working as hotel receptionists, maybe because it’s considered an entry-level job. Honestly, I’m also tired of the makeup, heels, and the “glam” expectations of being a receptionist. But one thing’s for sure: I’ll miss talking to different kinds of people every day.

Now, I’m planning to study a second undergraduate degree. Some people say it’s not practical and that I should just take a master’s degree instead. But the undergrad program I want is Nursing. I’ve wanted to shift since my first year of college up until my third year, but back then I didn’t believe in myself, especially because I wasn’t good with numbers. Still, I’ve always enjoyed science and the study of human life.

I plan to study again for another four years. I’ll probably graduate at 29 and take the board exams. I’ll be starting all over again at 30. I feel like there are more opportunities in nursing, both here in the Philippines and abroad. Plus, the work will be fulfilling because I’ll get to help people. I’ve also always wanted to work in a hospital, something I didn’t seriously think about when I first chose my course because I didn’t believe in my own capabilities.

But now, it’s haunting me.

I feel like the hospitality industry offers fewer opportunities compared to nursing. Nursing also seems like a more stable job, something I can do until I’m in my 50s.

Am I making the right decision? Personally, I feel like I am. But I want to hear other people’s thoughts or opinion, especially those that might challenge me or make me reflect even more deeply.

I also thought, if I’m going to be 30 anyway, why not be a nurse? It's my life, after all. And both industries are physically demanding.

1ljftdl,Need Advice Transitioning into a New Career,"I am 26 and currently living at home with my Indian parents, who are extremely controlling and emotionally abusive. While they appear supportive on the surface, that support feels entirely conditional- as long as I follow their expectations exactly, I’m treated okay. But if I assert any independence or make choices they disapprove of, they yell, give me the silent treatment (when I'd dated an ex my mom was not a fan of this lasted 6 months), or other forms of emotional punishment. It's created a dynamic where I constantly feel stuck, anxious, and afraid to make any major decisions for myself.

Professionally, I have a JD and am studying for the California bar exam this July. But the truth is, I am deeply unhappy in law. My parents roped me into the degree, and given my financial inability I now feel indebted to them and the life they've essentially forced me into. I’ve realized that I don’t want to practice, and instead, am drawn to work in child protection and advocacy. I am considering applying to a master’s program in Child Protection and Welfare or Health Policy, possibly in Ireland, where I've found a strong community and feel more like myself.

This decision is especially hard because I live with OCD, and I often get stuck in intense loops of doubt, fear, and second-guessing. I recently left a 3 year relationship that was also unhealthy (my ex would throw things and even speed up the car when angry). My parents now use that breakup as evidence that I can’t follow through on anything, which only adds to my feelings of self-doubt and failure. This is only one of the many many examples I'm sure they've used to make me feel as though I have nothing working in my favor.

 I feel emotionally claustrophobic and like I have no room to breathe, and no way to build a life that feels like my own. I know I need to get out and take steps toward my future, but I’m scared and unsure of how to start.

Currently, I am miserable in my job and am terrified of getting laid off since I am the newest in my team. Every 2 weeks we hear someone get laid off so I’m next soon so I’ve been searching. 

Thankfully, I have two offers from two well known companies. Just not sure what to do since I am moving soon😭 I’m a mid level UI designer.

Offer #1: Full-time, amazing benefits, $80,000 salary. Huge career jump for me. However, it is a 1.15 hour commute to just get there. I will also have to pay two separate city tax. 

Offer #2: Full-time contract, $42/hr (😭), only 2 days in office and 35 mins from my apt. Great job and amazing manager but more of a plateau move. BUT having it as a contract role may help with concerns why it looks like I’m job hopping. Also, this company is known to have fully remote employees so if I gain a great relationship, maybe I can ask to be fully remote when I move?

Which option seem like the best choice? My bf is worried about option #1 commute. But the pay is amazing (to me🙏). Option #2 is literally my absolute dream company but sucks that it is a contract role with no benefits.

1ljfmcx,Unrelated careers with a BA in neuroscience?,"Hi all, I’m graduating with a BA in neuroscience next year. I was on the pre-med/pre-PA track, but I’ve decided I’m no longer interested in working in the medical field. I’m autistic and I just don’t have the energy to talk to patients all day. 

I’m not sure where to go from here. I’ve heard that clinical research and regulatory affairs are good options for introverts, but I have also been considering pivoting to something business-related (potentially doing a MS in finance or accounting, or an MBA after working for a few years) and I’m planning to take some economics courses next year to see if that’s something I’d be interested in. 

I have a couple years of experience as a research assistant in neuroscience and psychology labs, as well as a year of experience as a music festival coordinator and event planner for my college. I would consider myself a dependable, detail-oriented person. I’m a good communicator, but my social battery dies quickly, so being able to spend at least half of my day working independently would be ideal.

I negotiated that up to 17 days, which they approved without any pushback. However, now that I’ve reviewed the company’s overall time-off policy (including paid holidays), I’m realizing that 17 days still feels pretty limited—especially compared to industry standards for this level.

I’m considering going back to ask for more PTO—framing it around my years of experience, what’s typical for similar roles, and the fact that my previous companies offered unlimited PTO. That flexibility really helped me unplug, recharge, and avoid burnout, which ultimately made me more productive.

For context: I previously worked at this company and left about 3 years ago. They’ve been trying to bring me back since then, so I feel like I might have a bit more leverage than usual.

1ljf2as,Career Change - leaving my Solo Carpentry Business to work an Equipment Rental sales job.,"The title speaks for itself. I’m so torn on what to do. 

The main reason I want to switch is because I’m kind of sick of working on the tools and I don’t want to be hanging drywall and mudding and taping when I’m 50/60 years old. 

Breakdown: 

My current business I generate about 65-70K pure profit after all expenses and taxes are paid etc. I take about 2 months vacation a year. So not bad in terms of freedom. I answer to nobody which is also awesome and I have a ton of time to spend with my kids whenever I want. 

The job offer I’ve been offered 

A guarantee of about 80k before taxes and a company truck and a gas card (worth about 10K a year). After tax it would be about 60k plus the truck. So maybe like a 70K value.

Money wise they are quite similar and they both have the opportunity to earn more based on the hours I can put it. I’ve been in construction my whole life. I’ve always been told I’d be great in a sales role. I’m very social and make friends very easily I play golf 3 times a week and am friends with a lot of the other members at my course. 

I don’t like the idea of only having 3 weeks vacation to start at the new role. But the new role offers full retirement pension investment matching RRSP contributions and amazing benefits as well. I think I’m just so nervous about entering back into an established corporate environment it makes me really nervous because I’ve had so much freedom in the past. What are your guys thoughts? Thanks.

1ljeqw3,Which career fit me?,"
I'm finishing my degree in English this year and looking for my first professional role. As someone who is autistic and has ADHD , math learning disability and exuctive dysfunction, my mind works differently. 
Instead of just telling you that, here are two recent examples of how I analyze things.

Example 1: The ""Phone Ad"" That Wasn't

What I Saw: I watched a video that started as a simple tech demo. A creator was showing off his phone's incredible zoom on a very distant building. Then, he zoomed all the way out, revealing he was filming from inside a luxurious European hotel room.

My Instant Realization: The moment I saw the hotel room, I knew the video's true purpose. This wasn't about technology. This was a carefully designed advertisement.

My Analysis: I figured out the creator, who is Egyptian, was using the tech as a hook. His real goal was to sell a lifestyle to his target audience—other Egyptians. The unspoken message was, ""This success can be yours if you buy my course."" The average European viewer wouldn't be impressed by a hotel room in Europe, but for his intended audience, it represented an aspirational dream. The video wasn't a product review; it was a marketing funnel, and I saw the entire structure of it immediately.

Example 2: The Cultural Divide in AI-Generated Videos

What I Saw: When Google's new AI video tool was released, I paid close attention to how people used it.

The Pattern I Noticed: There was a clear difference between users from ""first-world"" countries and users from ""third-world"" countries, like my own.

Group A (First-World Users): They often made the AI characters question their own reality. The videos became philosophical debates about being computer-generated, hitting on abstract, existential themes.

Group B (Third-World Users): Their AI characters would often explicitly state who created them, for example, ""This video was made by Ahmed."" It was direct self-promotion.

My Analysis: This wasn't random; it was a reflection of deep-seated cultural priorities. One group used the tool to explore the implications of the technology (""Look what this makes us think about""). The other group used it to secure credit and build their personal brand (""Look what I made""). It suggested a difference born from a need for recognition and security versus a more abstract exploration of ideas.

(I know people who took an entire year of parental leave). $5000/yr dependent care reimbursement plus other perks that add up to around $2k annually. I don’t currently have kids but could see having one in the next couple of years. 

Started seeking new roles because my company has been doing lots of layoffs and I’ve had multiple managers laid off. I also feel like I’ve had less to do lately, so I worry my role is getting redundant. People at my org are constantly panicking about job security, especially on my team, and the idea of being let go is taking a toll on my mental health.  I rely on the 100% WFH arrangement because my partner moves a lot for work, and I’m the primary breadwinner in the household.

After lots of rejected apps and a few failed interviews, finally got an offer at 120k annually. 100% WFH again, this time working for an L&D team, which is a bit outside my comfort zone. Benefits are worse: no 401k match. 3 months paid parental leave but no additional perks/dependent care stipends. But starting at a new org seems like it would grant me some more job security at least in the short term. 

I’m hesitant to give up my current role because the benefits are better and I generally like my team and feel comfortable in the kind of work I’m doing. I’ve also fought to get extra training and take on additional responsibility in the past month or so which is maybe helping me prove my worth. But I’m still worried about the possibility of being laid off and not being able to secure another 100% WFH job in a non client-facing role (I know a lot of folks who have resorted to lower paying sales/CSM roles because they can’t get hired in ops). I’ve also not been able to secure any promotions at my current org in 3 years despite getting stellar feedback on every performance review. Each time they cite budget constraints as the reason I can’t get more money. I even had one manager go as far as to tell me if I wanted to advance my career, I needed to find a new company. So I’m wondering if this new job is a better career opportunity even though the benefits are worse? Or should I just stay where I am and worry about finding a new job if I’m let go?

TLDR; currently like the work I do at 98k/year. Good benefits and WFH but team culture is really bad, raises/promotions are non existent, and layoffs happen constantly. Got an offer for a WFH job at 120k/year, but benefits are worse and the role would be a career shift for me. Is it worth moving or should I stay where I am & ride out any upcoming layoffs?

1ljeefl,"New job, lack of training and awkwardness from seasoned employees.","This is more of a rant than anything else. I started a new job 2ish weeks ago. I have a degree in the field and two previous years experience so I was hired on as a senior role. The two other employees who are similar to my role have 2 years experience as well (they have worked their way up from lower level admin positions in this company). 

Because of this, these two employees have all the knowledge of this companies processes and specific regional knowledge that’s important to the role.

Since I moved from out of state, I am having to learn a lot the regional specific rules as well as the companies unique process. I’m feeling awkwardness or coldness from the other employees since it seems like I don’t know anything, yet I was hired as “senior.”

My experience does transfer over but of course, they still do things so differently here as far as processes. Nobody has taken to showing/teaching/training me much and I’m trying my best to research and learn on my own. In fact, that’s all I’ve been doing the last two weeks since they haven’t let me do any actual work yet.

Everyone’s been nice, so I’m not complaining about that, I just sense a bit of awkwardness and still feel a bit like an outcast. My boss has been nice but too busy to sit down with me much to give me direction or tasks. The two girls in the department (technically my same role but not senior) seem to really run the show and the boss admits it. I do wonder if either of them were passed up for my position and that’s why it’s awkward. I do think I was hired for a reason though, I had a good interview and my experience matched up with the changes they were looking to make, and I’m the only one with a degree in the field. 

I’m not sure how to insert myself in this situation, and just mostly been in my office doing research and reading and learning what I can until I get more direction from my boss.

1ljdx0z,Feel like I messed up with my engineering career. Looking for advice.,"Hello everyone! Looking for some advice on what I should do regarding my electrical engineering career. I’ve been working at this company for about 3 years now and it’s essentially my first “engineering” job out of college. I was a technician before this while going to school. 
The issue is it’s not much of an engineering role. The pay is decent (towards lower end but still within the range) but I don’t really have any engineering responsibilities and worried this will affect me if I try to apply anywhere else. This is essentially another technical role with the word engineer attached to it. It’s very hands on and lots of fabrication, custom setups are involved but mainly it’s a lot of following directions and writing reports. 
It’s a lot of mechanical stuff too. I’d say 30% electrical and 70% mechanical. At this point I feel much more confident in mechanical engineering than electrical engineering. 

The other issue is that this is essentially a dead end position. There is no structure on how to move up and everyone else here has been in the same position since they started. I have asked for more responsibilities or tasks but they tell me there isn’t much to do right now. Most of my coworkers (including myself) just sit around browsing the web, phone time, etc. and it’s kind of driving me crazy. I try to do work related tasks such as writing new manuals or instructions, improvements for the facility but I can only do so much before I get demotivated. 
Any advice on how to approach this? I can work on stuff that will help me move up somewhere else during work but not sure what I should focus on or what would help me or if there’s any other advice I’m all ears!

1ljdtzj,Advice on this Position,"Hi everyone,

So last year I was in contact via email with a person directly involved in hiring from my industry (heritage), about a potential new role opening early this year.

I sent one follow up email late last year about the position where they did get back to me to let me know that hopefully the position would be up in January, and they would be in touch once the position did open.

In late Feb. I sent another message just as follow up and they didn't return my email. I tried again a month later in late March, and they didn't return my email. I tried a final time in mid in April and they didn't return my email. Each time, I was polite and just asking if they had any possible information on the position, and giving them a small update on my projects as a freelancer to help show my skills.

I did a light search on the institution's website to see if they still worked there and they did. I have been working on other projects as freelancer, and this institution has just been reopening after some construction. Should I bother sending another follow up email, or would it worsen my chances when the position does open and I do apply?

1ljcw95,My Design Job Thinks I’m Stupid,"Hi everyone,

A few months ago I started a new job as a graphic designer. It’s my second job since graduating design school last year. (Contract at previous company didn’t renew - not performance related). 

I broke my leg a few days before starting my new job, informed them immediately (while still in hospital) after the doctor confirmed it was broken. I sent pictures, got doctor’s notes, everything they asked of me. My job wouldn’t let me delay my start date and insisted I drive over an hour to the office with a freshly broken leg.

Obviously, my leg impacted the first few weeks and my performance was not up to my usual standards. I recognize this. However, they offered NO accommodation aside from reluctantly allowing me to work from home as long as someone picked up a computer for me (2+ h return trip). 

I showed up on time everyday, but it was a struggle to work laying down on my couch. They told me that I wasn’t meeting expectations two weeks into the job. I think they would have fired me if it were legal, (🇨🇦). 

It’s been a couple months since I broke my leg and I’m still struggling to heal. I got an extension to continue working from home which I’m grateful they let me. My performance has improved IMO, but I’m treated like I’m dumber than dumb.

I know I’m not perfect but I feel targeted. It’s hard not to. Especially when my work is constantly redone by someone else, or other people are credited for my designs. I’ve made some good work, but I never get the recognition for it here. I’m fine with criticism as long as it’s constructive and collaborative. What they’ve been doing very much isn’t. 

For example, I imported new ase swatches into Illustrator for a client project, and then a few hours later get told that I didn’t so they made a new file where they imported the new swatches and redid a design I made. 

Or, as my manager so kindly said to me: “I hope your performance review isn’t as bad as my son’s report card.” 

I’ve received a tonne of back handed comments since starting here, like being accused of being on opioids while struggling during my first week due to my leg. 

On another note, I find I struggle as their communication is not great. I always try to flag when things are missing in briefs, and always try to quadruple check my work before submitting. But often times, key details like specs or client requests/ideas are left out of the brief or kept in multiple places so it makes it difficult to meet expectations. I DO ask questions to clarify my understanding, but it’s like the brief is constantly changing and under-communicated. 

I’m just struggling. I try not to take this stuff personally because I know that I’m a competent designer and person at the end of the day, but it’s SO hard. I just want to make good work and be a part of a team that gives a shit about each other. I’m losing motivation to continue working here.

How do you deal with this kind of criticism? And with people redoing your work? And crediting others for your work?

Also, any tips on how to deal with back handed comments from higher-ups at work?

——

TLDR: Broke my leg before starting new job, new job not happy with my performance bc of leg. Coworkers redoing my work, publicly calling out my mistakes, crediting others for my work, etc. Negative comments from manager and others at company. Struggling to not take it personally.

1ljcifj,How does a CV downgrade look like?,"Hello,
I've been a data analyst for 3 years, working (abroad) exclusively on tableau, SQL, and excel but I learn and play with python on weekends (pandas, matplot mainly). 
I've been working as a data analyst for one of the biggest companies in my industry for 1 year and 4/5 months. After some salary discussions and some dissatisfaction, I felt it was time to set apart. 

Now, I decided to join a company who recently launched a business in the same industry but with a strong presence in an other vertical of the same industry. Nothing changes overall, the industry remains the same and its concepts apply totally. However, I might be asked to do simpler task at the beginning (or forever in the role?). 

I feel a bit confused because I don't like quitting and anyway the pay is consistent to allow me save a lot and come back to my country with a potential 30k in 1 / 1.5 years. 

Therefore, my questions are:
1. Do downgrades exist in a career and how do they look like? 
2. What should my benchmark be, given my profile description above? 
3. How will big companies look at this switch from big corporate to ""startup""? 
4. If quitting wasn't an option, how could I benefit from this experience in 1 year from now?

1ljb95w,Would you take this promotion?,"I work in a call center doing technical support for a company that operates in both the U.S. and Canada.

•	In the U.S., Technical Support Level 1 (same job I do now) starts at $18 USD/hour, which is about $24.67 CAD/hour at current exchange rates.

•	I’m based in Canada, doing the exact same work, but earning $19.50 CAD/hour.

They’re now offering me a promotion to Technical Support Level 2 (which isn’t tier 2, but handling different systems), with a raise to $20.50/hour, so a $1/hour increase.

Here’s what would change:

•	I currently get 1–2 hours of downtime daily (slow queues, gaps between calls).

•	Mondays are especially dead, sometimes 2–4 hours of downtime.
	
•	In the new role, it would be nonstop calls all day, every day, no breathing room.

So I’d be giving up roughly 40–50 hours of downtime per month, in exchange for $1/hour more, which works out to about $160/month pre-tax, or ~$120 after tax.

Now to be clear, my budget is tight right now, and even an extra hundred bucks would genuinely help.
But when I weigh that against losing 40–50 hours of breathing room a month, it just doesn’t feel like a good trade off.

I’ve been with the company a little over a year, and I’m in my early 20s. The only reasons I’m even considering this are:

1.	The title bump, going from Level 1 to Level 2, would look good on my resume and help with future job applications.

2.	I’m just starting my career, and part of me feels like I should tough this out for my future self.

So:
Would you take this promotion?

So that was a bit discouraging knowing I’d only ever get in again if there is space so I’d never get in first all other students will get a spot secured and I’m only allowed in again based on a space available basis. So I applied to LVN school last year and got accepted but chose radiology instead, but I went ahead and reapplied this year as well just in case I didn’t get into radiology and nursing is something I’ve always kind of been interested in, so now I’m debating if I should just go into LVN school and give up fully on radiology for now. I know LVN money isn’t RN money and I work in the hospital so I know what the nurses do and stuff but I’d use it as a stepping stone. Part of me wants to wait it out and just work, save up, try again for radiology or LVN next year and the other part of me is like time will pass might as well be an LVN right now since you got accepted.

1lj9mq9,Imposter syndrome or taking on more than I can handle?,"I started working for my company in January 2024 as a Grade 3 in Business Support. By April, I moved up to Grade 4, and by September I was promoted into a Grade 5 management role. It’s been a fast progression and I’m proud of it, but it’s also come with a lot more stress. I’m still developing my management style and figuring things out as I go.

Progression has always been important to me. I went into this job knowing I wanted to move up. I have considered a degree qualification paid for by the company that requires a five year contract or other educational programs than can offer advanced progression. Yesterday, I found out a senior management position will be opening in September, and now I’m questioning whether I should apply.

It would mean managing a much larger team in a different office, with a lot more responsibility. I’d also have to leave my current team, who I really like. The pay increase is only £190 a month, which feels small compared to the extra pressure the job would bring. This would also mean that I will remain in the business support sector. 

I’ve only been with the company a year and a half, and I know there will be people applying who’ve been here over 10 years. Part of me feels like I’m just not ready but another part wonders if this is just imposter syndrome kicking in. I am still learning and settling into my grade 5 position. I’m not certain about my long term career goals, I just know I don’t want to be stagnant.

But most of these roles don’t offer sponsorship, and as an international student, that’s been a biggest problem. Even finding jobs that don’t require sponsorship has been challenging.I have been trying all kinds of  tools and strategies and few of these have been working for me:

* Using LinkedIn and Prosple to find job listings
* Gemini and ChatGPT to write cold emails to the recruiters 
* Automating applications with ApplyOnion, which has saved me hours by applying to multiple jobs quickly

These tools definitely helped me save time with much less efforts, but the competition is unreal, and on that top the sponsorship issue still feels like a huge barrier.

1lj8l93,Advice on escalating matters to HR,"Hi all, I’m in my job just slightly under 2 years in and various conflicts already happened throughout this year with a colleague, and only this one. I’m pretty close to the others in my department, and I work really well with them and have since established a decent reputation for my work ethics as I have heard even my boss’ boss telling me they’ve heard so many good things about me since week 1-2 when I first came in. 

Many conversations and meetings have happened between my colleague and I, along with my team lead, and this conflict was even escalated to my boss’ (and that person’s) boss in case it was required but we never got to that stage at the time (they don’t know their boss knows about this). The issues got better after initiate conversations and then sneakily came back in various forms, with A LOT of passive aggressiveness and multiple subtle acts of disrespect. 

I’ve kept very calm and professional throughout the year during 1-1 talks and with any team leads to discuss this matter whether in meetings that directly involved this person or not. On the flip side, this person essentially threw a tantrum and lashed out even to the higher ups in that meeting. This changed the impression of everyone.

Without giving too much context for anonymity, things got so bad that I was advised by multiple people, including the team leads in the recent project, a close colleague who was there at the meeting and another colleague I discussed with about switching to that department (not involved in this matter at all but also not too much context, just a general idea of the type of issue) to bring this up to HR just for file. 

The convo, especially from after the recent meeting, it felt like there was no more comprehension, just nodding and dismissive attitude when I tried to explain my point. I even owned up to my part of the mistake and apologised multiple, multiple times for causing that impact even when my intentions were pure. I never once received an apology for the unfair things that were said to me during the meetings.

The same convo felt like a one way conversation, and this person just kept on repeating already addressed (by team leads in said meeting) points from that big meeting and even included a new insult towards people working in my position, which I have later reflected back to the same higher ups as well. It felt like I couldn’t reason with this person anymore. 

I know I will not be facing HR alone since I have the support of a close colleague who will be coming with me, and everyone has been saying that our HR is very supportive (new concept to me too) and would keep things anonymous unless asked to take action, which I plan to do. I trust what they say since some of them had to do the same for the people working under them or for themselves as well. I have many documentations and will be collating more on my end. Since some of my higher ups have already had some contexts from prior incidents, it wont be a surprising case to escalate. 

I’m proud that I’ve kept my composure and had not lost it yet (I hope I never do and end up like that).

Does any one had to bring someone up to HR (hopefully just the one time or less) and has any advice for me? I would appreciate any! 

It’s been a big thing that’s been weighing on me these two weeks, and I’ve been looking both at internal transfers to a completely different department, while also actively job hunting outside of the company (praying hard for this one!!).

I’m in my third year of a BBA program and have a strong interest in marketing. I’ve done 4 internships so far - 3 of them in social media marketing. I’ve noticed that most student internships only offer SMM roles, and it’s tough to break into areas like performance marketing, brand strategy, or digital ads.

I’ve taken online courses and explored tools like Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, and basic analytics, but these platforms seem to require real hands-on experience - which is hard to get without already having some. It feels like a loop.

I’m worried I’ll end up in generic SMM roles after graduation with limited growth and average pay. I’m okay starting there, but I don’t want to be stuck. Would a specialized certification help, or is an MBA the only way to access better roles like brand management, media planning, or strategy?

I rage applied back there last week at a different department, but similar work, and I've been offered a job. 
The problem is, I feel like if I leave I'm throwing away an opportunity at a job where I'm paid a comfortable salary.

1lj6jxp,What to do when I hate my dream job?,"I finally landed my dream job. I was over the moon when I got it, but two months in, it’s turned into a nightmare.

The workplace is extremely understaffed, and I’ve been working unpaid overtime, skipping breaks to get work done, and taking on extra tasks constantly. The overtime is not only expected but I’ve now been reprimanded for not being more available on the weekends and at 5am in the morning! Yes they expect me to be up at 5am, alongside my working hours to make sure the creative work I work on goes live.

Then last week, I got blamed for mistakes I didn’t make, things that weren’t even my responsibility. These things went wrong because no one had communicated that they expected me to do this work. I explained this and showed proof that I wasn’t told but they still blamed me. My boss messaged me aggressively on a Sunday and expected me to fix this small issue on sunday and when I didn’t respond, I was hit with a surprise performance review meeting. Apparently, they’re now questioning my commitment and their ability to “trust me” to do the job, even though I’ve gone above and beyond. That very week, I had gone ahead and created a strategy to get all the overtime work they were asking me to done. I wanted to take the approach of rather than saying no to work, just time manage myself to get it all done. This plan was used against me in this performance meeting. My senior, who was in my role before I started, ended up admitting that she, at a minimum, works 3-4 hours overtime everyday and has never told our bosses. Because I made this time management document, I thought I was being time efficient but they used it to say I was not efficient in my role because my previous coworker was finishing task quicker than me. The reality is that she was never honest with how long everything was taking her.

I’ve also noticed a lot of sexism. In creative meetings, male coworkers repeat my ideas and get praised. But when I say them, they often don’t respond. My coworker told me that they only fire women. Also my senior told me that our two bosses gave the credit for work she did completely solo to those two guys that everyone calls their favourite. One guy cost the company $10k and wasn’t reprimanded. I get grilled over nothing.

After this previous weekend, I made one single, small typo. This was the first actual mistake I’ve made in two months. I owned up to it and immediately talked about how I can make sure it doesn’t happen again. My boss threatened my job. He said it was very serious and it was a sign I don’t care about my role. This is just simply not true. I have a coworker who is meant to help QA my work, he also didn’t see the typo mistake but when they brought it up they said the mistake was still on me because my work always has to be perfect. They said in my meeting today, if I’m not perfect at this then they can’t trust me.

I understand this but I’ve been doing this work for almost 10 years. I know what I’m doing. These small mistakes have been made because of not clear communication. I’ve tried to help get clear communication but I’ve not been met with clarity.

I’m constantly stressed and even started vomiting from the anxiety. This is my dream job. I don’t want to leave because of these small mistakes but it feels impossible to talk to my boss and now I dread going in. I feel like no matter what I do, it’s not enough. I’m starting to hate the job I dreamed about for years.

Also side note, my boss accidentally fell into this role. He is extremely unqualified, I have years more experience than him and he is actually significantly younger than me. Like he is in his early 20s running a huge organisation. I feel so trapped. If I leave and they decide to black list me, I could never work in this industry again but if I stick it out to a year. At least I can say I did it. But at this rate, I’ve only made one real, yet tiny mistake and my boss clearly said he thinks I’m incompetent. I know I will make more mistakes than this because that’s the nature of the work. I’ve witnessed all my coworkers make the same if not bigger mistakes.

AITA for feeling this way? Or is it time to walk away?",Inevitable-Ad-6132,2,1.0,3,1750757204,2025-06-24 09:26:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lj6jxp/what_to_do_when_i_hate_my_dream_job/,6,2025
1lj6h4k,Should I apply for a job at a company I find unethical?,"Okay so it’s very late so forgive me if this is extremely rambling but I’ll try my best to have it make sense. 

I’m going to be graduating next year with my BSN and I’m currently working a student nurse internship for the summer. The hospital that I’m working at has already posted applications for graduate nursing positions for 2026 grads. The students who are currently working an internship are gonna have priority consideration and there’s always a high demand for nurses so I think if I apply for this job there’s a strong chance I’ll be accepted. 

I’m not wild about this job in the first place because this hospital is known for treating their employees poorly but most other places probably wouldn’t be much better. This position would also offer me some benefits like a sign on bonus and student loan repayment which are definitely big perks. 

The problem is that this hospital has recently implemented a policy that I find highly unethical. Unfortunately I can’t really get into specifics because I’d think I’d be violating the rules of the sub. But I want to make it clear this policy is not illegal and it’s public information so it’s not like they’re deceiving their patients, I just personally strongly disagree with it. 

Because of this new policy I’m having somewhat of a moral dilemma on if should even apply for this job. This isn’t a standard policy and there are a lot of other hospitals I could work for and I’m sure I could find another job. 

The problem is that I don’t know if I’m going to be able to find another job that is going to offer to pay back my student loans. If I really needed to I could always pay them back myself but I think I’d be stupid to turn down an opportunity to have them paid back for me. I also think that if I don’t take this job my parents are going to feel like they are gonna have to help me out with paying back my loans, and I really don’t want to put that stress on them. I also think my mom just really wants me to get a job as soon as possible so she can stop stressing over my employment situation. So telling her I’m not gonna apply is going to stress her out too and I think she’s gonna try to talk me into it anyway. 

I don’t want to compromise my principals, but part of me is wondering if I’m being too much of an idealist. Most companies are unethical so if I wanted to work for a totally ethical institution, I would never be able to get a job. Also I feel like I’d be a fool to turn down the opportunity to have secure employment and have my loans repaid.  

I’d just appreciate some outside input so I can know if I’m being dense or not. ",New_Advertising_1372,1,1.0,2,1750756903,2025-06-24 09:21:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lj6h4k/should_i_apply_for_a_job_at_a_company_i_find/,6,2025

1lj5s92,Career stagnation at 32 — anyone else feel stuck as a dev?,"**Hi everyone,**

I’m turning 32 soon, and I’ve been programming since high school. I also studied IT at university, though honestly, that part feels less relevant compared to what I’ve learned on the job.

I’ve been working professionally for about 7–8 years, with the last 5 spent at the same company. It’s a stable job — the team is good, the pay is decent, and I don’t have any major complaints. But lately, I’ve been feeling stuck.

The daily routine has become too predictable. I miss the excitement of real challenges — the kind that push you to grow, problem-solve, and feel truly engaged. Right now, I feel like I’m only using about 20% of my brain at work.

I keep telling myself that I’m still at a great age to try something new: to explore other companies, take on different types of projects, and grow professionally. But I’m also held back by a sense of imposter syndrome. What if I make a move and find myself in over my head? What if I realize I’m not as good as I thought?

To be honest, I don’t even have a portfolio to showcase my work — which doesn’t help my confidence when thinking about applying elsewhere.

Has anyone here gone through something similar? How did you deal with it, and what helped you make a change (or decide to stay)?

1lj55gi,Stuck 16 Year Old Help!,"Hey yall, Im a 16 year old gay male from Washington, D.C. and I need some career advice.

To lay out my situation, i am currently living with my mother for most of the time and attend school in the city. Growing up me and my mother have not gotten along as she is a very narcissistic, and overbearing person, and she doesn't like the fact that i am feminine and am attracted to men. I have a father and he supports me (which i am very grateful for) but it doesn't take much pain out of me and my mothers situation. Ever since i was 11 years old i had a goal of moving out at 18 and being on my own, and moving out of the district to another city like Raliegh or Atlanta, where my dads side of the family lives. I currently have $7k saved and am on track to get my license soon, and i am heading into my junior year this fall. I wanted to attain some kind of certification in a field to allow me to get a job at 18 but...

i have a dilemma, I don't know which career to choose. I have considered going into real estate or marketing as those are some areas i am passionate about. But given this current state of the economy moving closer to 2030 and ai taking over, i am not sure if this is a good career choice, especially if i were spend money and to go to college for it. Which i am getting a sense that its a bad idea to spend thousands of dollars going to school for an unstable, or soon-to-be ai-dominated industry.

I had a conversation with my father yesterday and he mentioned how trades or hard skills could be a good way for me to have a stable and ai proof job that lets me live the lifestyle i want without going to a 4 year uni.  I wouldn't want to be an electrician or a plumber as those require a very demanding amount of physical labor that doesn't fit my personality. But i am considering becoming a pilot or a barber.

  
I already cut my own hair and some of my friends hair at school and i really like doing it so i was wondering if it would be a good idea to not go to college and just go to barber or flight school. I heard that the median pay for commercial pilots was about $239k per year which is awesome. The only caveat being that flight school is very expensive running people upwards of $100k!

One of the other ai proof jobs i considered doing fresh out of high school was being a personal trainer because i really like going to the gym, and i remember when i was younger being very insecure about my body, and the gym gave me a way to relieve those feelings, so i figured i would love to coach people through their own fitness journeys.

  
Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated, but i need to figure this out soon as i need to gtfo my mommas house lol !

Now for my question, I feel as if there's more to be learned and that I'm going to be under prepared when I start.

1lj3ycu,[LIFE ADVICE] My Family Always Wanted Me to Settle Abroad — But I’m Stuck Between Two Paths. Need Honest Opinions. Should I Go?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 20 years old and need some genuine advice.

Since childhood, my family has always dreamed of me going abroad and settling there — it became my only goal too. After 12th (Commerce), I prepared for English proficiency and got a decent score. I applied for an Australian student visa… but unfortunately, it got refused.

Now I have two options in front of me:
Option 1: Go to Canada (via student visa)
	•	It would cost me ₹30 lakh (we don’t have the money — it would be a full loan).
	•	I’d study and try for PR there.
	•	But I’m scared of another refusal… and the pressure of a huge loan.

Option 2: Stay in India and Learn High-Demand Skills
	•	Build a strong career here, become financially stable, and go abroad later with confidence and savings.
	•	No loans. No debt. But yes — requires patience and discipline.

I’m leaning toward learning a skill in India, getting solid experience, maybe freelance or remote jobs — and then applying for PR or study abroad with my own money and confidence.

I know it won’t be easy, but at least I won’t put my family under massive debt and emotional stress.

Has anyone here done something similar — chose skills over student visa and succeeded later?

Or has anyone taken the student loan + Canada route and come out okay?

Any insight, experience, or reality check would help. I’m ready to work hard, I just want to make the smartest choice now.

Thanks for reading ❤️

1lj3pte,Am I right to want to leave or am I overreacting?,"Marketing/design company had a restructure which reduced my team to half its size last year and I was promoted to design manager/art director. Change of head of marketing who I report to. Since then there has some cost cutting measures which I think significantly reduces our quality output such as 

1. contracting lower cost photo/videographers instead of our long time contractor that couldn’t even get basic editing/colours right which meant more work for me and my team trying to fix their mistakes because of deadline. When I called this out, I was told to lower my standards 

2. Trying to rely on ai instead of hiring proper mural artists even though I suggested a better similar cost alternative that will look better.

3. Most recently I was asked how I’d feel managing an offshore team if they decide to lay off my team members.

4. My requests to improve briefing system and processes were ignored 

In general I feel like my role as an art director is disrespected.every time I object to some sub par quality standards in terms of processes or design assets I feel like I’m being dismissed as being too hard to please while I feel like these are basic quality standards. I feel like I’m being gaslighted. 

Since we are charging our clients the same amount or even increasing prices (while cost cutting and lowering quality everywhere else) i feel like this is also somewhat unfair. 

I’m currently looking to leave but the job industry for a senior designer is particularly hard right now and I sometimes wonder if it’s just the state of the world right now and I should let go of my ‘standards’ because no one cares about quality anymore and just be happy I’m being paid.

The internship itself is going fine, but honestly, prepping for interviews *on top of* work feels like running two jobs at once.

Especially when each company seems to focus on slightly different questions. Some are all technical, others go deep into behavioral, and then some just want “your story” in a super polished way.

What helped a bit was using interviewquestionbank. com It’s basically a searchable collection of actual interview questions, grouped by role and company. I’ve been using it to focus on the patterns like how most entry-level data roles tend to repeat a few common logic questions, or how product-related internships lean heavily into “tell me about a time you…” questions.

Having that structure helped me stop doomscrolling random Glassdoor reviews and actually start practicing.

i texted my manager: ""Hey, have I done something wrong? I just wanted to make sure since I'm not scheduled this week."" this was her response, word for word: 

""I wouldn't say you've done something wrong! But we schedule based off of feedback! Hours are earned not given, and we need to see the want for hours from our employees!

1lj2vkz,Scared of being over 30 as a programmer. I want to switch to Medicine,"Hi guys,
I am already feeling ashamed of what I am about to confess here because it goes against all my beliefs and principles. I really want to ask you for advice, and you will help me to calm down a bit…

Namely, I am 24 years old programmer (studied computer science in Poland, currently working in Spain as I moved here for my partner). I have been very interested in IT since I was teenager; basically, I really enjoy what I do. However, as of late, I have been experimenting a bit of “ageism” from my colleagues who says “wait until you are 35 and you will see that no one wants to hire you”, “corporations prefer to hire men over women especially when you reach your mid 30”, “you have to become a manager at some point not to fear to lose your position “, “we all will be replaced when we are 40 by other tech maniacs”.
 
And I have become paranoid about that topic ever since and can’t see myself being over 40 and working in IT anymore. 

In fact, I started considering switching to Medicine one year ago (I did my final high school exam quite well and I was admitted to the Med University, however I didn’t decide to go, because I was sure that IT was a gold-mine and as it was way shorter than Med, I thought that I would have more time to enjoy my young-adult life and give myself time to think through what I really want in life) and this thought seems more and more attractive to me as I hear more comments on my gender, age and the whole AI-taking-over-your-job thing.

I will just add that I have quite a lot of saving and my partner’s support for the long years of studies if I finally apply to Med school. 

What do you guys think? Have any of you done anything similar when it comes to career switch?

1lj2ae3,I regret quitting my job and I’m angry with myself every day,"I can’t stop thinking about how badly I messed up. A few months ago I quit my job at the airport where I was doing shift work. The hours were rough, the shifts drained me mentally and physically — I hated every minute of it. But the pay was good. Really good, actually. Looking back, I was earning way more than I appreciated at the time.

I quit without having anything else lined up because I was so fed up with the shifts. I just wanted out. Big mistake.

I ended up being unemployed for 3 months, and when I finally found something, it was a personal trainer role — something I enjoy more, but it pays nowhere near what I used to make. The money difference is massive, and it hits me every day.

I regret it so much. I feel stupid for throwing away financial stability without a proper plan. I get angry with myself every time I check my bank balance or think about all the money I lost during those months of unemployment — and how far behind I am now compared to where I could’ve been.

I know there’s no point beating myself up forever, but I honestly can’t stop. I just needed to get this off my chest.

1lj0s0v,I love what I do but I'm thinking about a career change,"As the title says, I'm looking for a career change. But I feel lost at the same time. I've been doing massage about 12 years and a license esthetician for almost 10 years. I truly love the wellness/spa world but as a practitioner, there's just no benefits. No PTO, no health insurance, no 401k match, SLOW seasons etc. As I get older, I can't picture myself in 10+ years doing 4 to 5 clients on working days and going thru slow seasons. I'm not over it, but I'm over it at the same time. I'd love to move up into being a high end spa director but as of today, nobody wants me lol. I don't have a degree. They want you to have a degree even if you have years and years of experience. So now, I'm at a crossroads. I want to get into the medical field, I always said that was the way I'd go if decided to leave this field. The only thing that holds me back, are student loans. I don't qualify for any grants or assistance,  none, nothing, zilch. So it would all be loans and some out of pocket payments during school. I'm looking at surgical technologist or radiation technologist. Im not sure how much the radiation technologist program is, but the surgical tech program is $40k, so im assuming rad tech would be more because its a longer program. Both programs are a degree program and its accelerated.  The community college route is cheaper, but I'd only be able to take 4 to 8 credits a semester and you need an AA(30 credits) before you can even apply for the Surgical tech program(12-18 months), so it would take me about 3 years to get the AA then the program. So 4.5 to 5 years for something that should take 24 months or less, sounds crazy. Time is money! Lol.. I'm literally almost done paying previous student loans off, and it wasnt even that much under $15k.  So getting into more debt thats more than double, daunts me. Im trying to tell myself, its an investment in myself. Both radiation tech and surgical tech,  make good money, in my city/state. Minimum $2k a week and if you travel $3.5-$4k a WEEK. Which sound wonderful to me! I'm single, no kids, no medical needs, in my early 30s. I think now is the time to make drastic changes. 

I guess,  I'd like to know if there are other MTs who have been in the same boat? If so, what career field did you go into or were you able to elevate to something beyond a practitioner?

I just need encouragement and another POV.

My supervisor and I have had two very distinct notable dust ups regarding blatant unethical behavior being tolerated within our firm and I've been the one to spotlight it.

Despite receiving offers from 2 of the companies, I chose to stick things out.

Now here we are 5 months later, another dust up over yet another scenario involving blatant unethical conduct within the company and within days, 2 of the exact same companies are back at my door saying they want to talk to me.

It legit feels like this is being set up especially after the company in the first scenario came off as too good to be true and we didn't even conduct a formal interview, I walked In sat down, the president walked in said ""i haven't even looked at your resume but my team wants you, what's your price"" and everyone at the table wanted my acceptance letter signed right there and my resignation submitted to my supervisor that day.

I’ve worked across investment banking, financial restructuring (think A&M / PWP type firms), and private equity — and over the past couple years I’ve been helping students and early professionals land roles at top firms like GS, PJT RX, Bain, Alvarez & Marsal, Evercore, etc. I've done mock interviews, resume polishing, and even full behavioral prep for a few hundred folks.

Some of the biggest gaps I see:

* People **undervalue behavioral prep** — and end up sounding like everyone else
* **Technical questions** go beyond just guides (especially in RX and PE interviews)
* Non-target / international students often struggle to show their stories clearly, even if they’re qualified

If you’re prepping for:

* IB superdays
* RX/PE interviews
* Case-based consulting interviews
* Lateral finance roles or summer internships

…feel free to drop a question, ask for advice, or DM if you want direct help. I sometimes run mock interview sessions or deep-dives for those who want more support.

The job I applied for was a produce clerk at a grocery store. During the interview, I was asked the usual, ""Do you mind stacking crates, moving skids, stacking shelves?"", giving me the impression I was going to be working inside the store. After the interview, I spoke with a friend, who is also a worker/manager at the same store, and was told that I would be working inside with him in the same department, doing produce. I received my employee guidelines, which state ""all lunches are 30 minutes or 1 hour"" and ""do not punch in for 15-minute breaks"". Now fast forward to my first day on the job, it is 39 degrees Celsius outside, feels like 47 degrees Celsius, and right after I clock in, I am told, ""You are pushing shopping carts outside"". I was never informed beforehand that I would be working outside until my moment of arrival. After asking the manager why I am working outside, they state, ""We were never hiring anyone, we just gave you a job"". In the middle of my shift, I started getting very weak, dehydrated and tired due to the heat. Had I known I was working outside, I would have taken the proper precautions and prepared myself. With the heat and temperature picking up, I asked to take my 15-minute break, but I was told that I could not. They said your position (cart pushers) does not get a 15-minute break, even though the employee guidelines said there was (I was never told this in advance). 

Fast forward to the end of the day: my face and skin were burned, I had calluses, burns, and marks all over my hands, drank 10 water bottles, received no assistance or was given any training on the busiest/hottest day of the year. Not once was I told beforehand what my task was, what to expect, or given a heads up that I would be working outside.

1liumn1,60 day check-in went poorly - stick it out?,"I’m in a new role and just had my 60 day check-in with my boss and her supervisor (about a week and a half early due to an upcoming holiday). I was hired as a Senior Marketing Specialist. I have three years of professional working experience and was a specialist at my previous role.

I wasn’t super nervous going in to the check-in. I have made a few small mistakes (nothing major) but overall have kept up with all tasks with minimal feedback. Well…I probably should have been nervous.

First, they let me know that they don’t think I’m socializing enough with the rest of the company. Okay, fair. I can make a greater effort, but I have been speaking with all coworkers seated around me and talk with the two other members of our marketing team a lot.

Then they really got into it. They told me that they hired me as a senior specialist, but I’m currently operating at the associate level. Their biggest concern seems to be that I’m a “tactical worker” and not strategic enough. That I wait for assignments and tasks rather than creating them myself. They want me to transform their email and campaign processes with advanced recommendations.  I was a bit taken aback and tried to explain that I feel like I’m still in learning and absorption mode. I come from a very different industry and working environment. Still, I guess I understand the frustration.

They’re giving me 30 more days to basically prove myself. It’s hard to feel like they haven’t already written me off as stupid and unhelpful though. I plan to grind these next 30 days and really start some strategic thinking… but I’m kind of feeling hopeless after I thought I was doing a decent job for being in the position for less than two months.

1liu0w9,Need help valuing fixed pension in career change decision,"45yo male married with 1 toddler

After a rough young life I finally have a stable career. 140K public sector in large West Coast  municiplaity. Low stress 2 days in office 3 days at home. Biggest compensation is benefits and fixed pension that would give me 55% salary if I work till 62.

Due to tragic accident my plan to retire at this job has changed. I inherited 2 houses in Asheville, NC (a place we would prefer to raise our son). One house is a rental that covers the mortgages for both and will they will be paid off in 7 years.

Considering going private sector telecommute to try and move for the preferred lifestyle and free housing costs. Could make 160-170K but would have no longterm stability. Would have to plan on possible termination of contract in as little as 2 years. Skills are specialized so not super easy for me to find work.

If you have any opinion on how you would approach this decision free to share.

The general consensus is that fixed pensions are very rare nowadays and should be protected at all cost, but we are a little nervous to raise a kid in large urban area with all the social unrest lately.

1lirqqd,help me choose a path,"
Hi all,

I’m 22 and based in the UK, trying to break into electrical or electronic engineering — but my priority right now is doing hands-on work.

I’m talking about:
	•	Fault-finding
	•	Wiring and testing circuits
	•	Working with motors, control panels, industrial equipment
	•	Being on the tools in a workshop or out in the field

That’s what I’m most interested in short-term. In the long term, I’d like to move into design or technical systems work — but only after I’ve built real-world experience. I don’t want to go straight into a design role with no idea how systems actually behave in practice.

I’ve got A-levels, so I could go to university, but I get the impression that engineering degrees are often more theory/design-based, and don’t give you much hands-on experience — especially compared to apprenticeships. I’m also aware that some degree apprenticeships can be very office-based, which isn’t what I want right now. I could be wrong though, so I’m open to being corrected.

What I’m trying to figure out is:
	•	What’s the best path if I want to be doing physical electrical work now, but still keep doors open to move into design/technical roles later?
	•	Would a Level 3/4 apprenticeship in electrical maintenance, field service, or industrial systems be a better starting point?
	•	Or is it smarter to go the degree route, even if it’s more hands-off for a while?
	•	Has anyone here gone from a practical role into design later in their career?

Any advice or stories from people who’ve done this — or wished they’d done it differently — would be massively appreciated. Just trying to find a route that gives me both hands-on experience and long-term flexibility.

Thanks!

1lir9c5,"How do I appropriately tell a recruiter I've received a better offer, while leaving the door open to negotiation?","I'm a catering chef that works for a company ""A"" which specializes in providing hospitality accommodations in extremely remote locations.  Im adding this just to emphasize that there are only so many of these companies, and only so many skilled workers to go around in this tiny world.

The company (A) i currently work lost it's contract with a large mineral extracting company. Company (B) is taking over that contract and offered me a small raise to stay put and continue doing what I do, just on their payroll. I initially
Accepted.

Company A offered me a small raise higher than B's and a promotion with more responsibility to go to a more remote location with much worse accommodations.  I initially declined and said I'd stick with company B's small raise to stay at the nice camp.

Company A doubled the raise to what's now 20% higher than what i currently make working for them, offered the promotion, and free cert training and testing.  I accepted A's second offer.

Which means im about to leave company B hanging, and I doubt they'll offer me more.  However, i want to leave that door open because its quiye possible they'll be rather desperate.  They will look like shit if they take over my camp, and quality immediatley plummets.

How do I write a graceful text/email informing B of the better offer, while leaving the door open, or perhaps even empasizing openess to further negotiation?  I dont want to burn a bridge, but I cant turn down the 20% pay raise.

I am at a stalemate in my career growth where majority of next logical roles will cause me to have to give the car up.

My current pay would already put me at the high end of the next role (within 5K). 

Even if I max out the remaining 5K on the pay band I would still be net negative after having to buy a car and pay all the things associated with it and we need a car as a family with kids and several different schedules that we balance. 

So looking for some advice on how to navigate this. Of course step one is to ask for as much of a raise as possible but I doubt I will get more than 5K total annual gross pay. 

What else can I ask for or try to negotiate to minimize coming out negative financially or if at all possible break even.

1liqymj,Are part time software jobs realistic? Especially as a junior dev,"Posted in software jobs but found this thread and it seemed like a better fit.  
  
Looking for some sage wisdom. I'm a remote electrical engineering college student. I have always leaded toward software and I would like to get a software engineering role after I graduate. I pretty much have one lined up at the company I interned at. Though I am thinking about starting by working part time because I have other passions I would like to explore. For reference, I'd still say I am a junior dev though I have independently made some projects like websites, chatbots, mobile apps, etc. If anyone is interested I would be happy to send my github for their feedback too... anyways. So here's the plan I am thinking about:

1. Get part time software job/ internship while I finish up school. (\~18 months left)
2. Use that to gain experience while getting to try out the lifestyle to see if it is something I want to fully commit to (take the offer at previous company) or take the risk and pursue my passions while continuing to work as a part time dev.

I guess it is as simple as that, when I started making a list I thought there would be more steps.

Anyways, sage wisdom time.  
Is this realistic? Working part time as a junior dev while I do school, probably remote (I live in the middle of nowhere).  
If it is, what're your opinions on it? Would working outside of my field when I graduate be shooting myself in the foot? Should an EE major even be looking at software eng jobs?

If all of that checks out, and I'm not off my rocker, does anyone know of any companies that are likely to accept this type of dev?

1liqkqb,Canada - Advice for next steps in my career. Should I go for a masters program?,"Hey everyone,

Looking for some advice on a potential career pivot. I'm currently working in the energy commodities sector in a commercial/trading role (2 + years in), focused on physical trading and supply chains across North America. The job is fast-paced and very commercially rewarding, but I’ve realized I’m more drawn to the strategic and geopolitical side of things, especially areas like energy security, economic statecraft, and foreign interference risk.

I’ve been thinking about applying to a master’s program in public or international affairs (like NPSIA or GSPIA), with the long-term goal of pivoting into government or policy roles, ideally in strategic intelligence, defense policy, foreign affairs, or something adjacent. I’m especially interested in work that blends economics, infrastructure, and national security.

But I’m not sure if this is the right move. I have interned with the CRA a while back when I was in Uni. (Business / Finance Bachelors). I know landing a government co-op during a master’s program can be critical to getting your foot in the door. Without that, I’m worried I’ll graduate with a degree but no real pathway into federal roles.

Questions

Would a master’s in public/international affairs help someone coming from the private sector (commodities/trade) break into government or intelligence work?

How risky is it to pursue that degree if I don’t land a co-op?

Are there better or more direct ways to pivot into public sector strategy or intelligence work without grad school?

Any agencies, departments, or programs I should look into that would value a commercial/trade background?

Any insight would be much appreciated, especially from people who’ve worked in or moved into government, defense, or intel roles.

1liptcd,"Feeling Stuck - Considering a Career Shift, Would Love Advice","Hey everyone,
I wanted to share what I’ve been feeling lately and get some thoughts or advice from others who may have been in a similar place.

I’ve been working for the past six months at a tech company in a role that’s a mix of sales and technical work. Overall, I’m doing well , I’m getting great feedback, people appreciate my work, and I’m even in the process of being promoted to a management position with a salary increase.

But… I’m feeling burnt out.

My typical day starts at 7:00 AM so I can get ready and commute, and I usually get back home around 7:00 PM. By the time I’m home, I’m completely drained. I don’t have the energy to do things I care about, hobbies, fitness, learning, catching up on the world, seeing friends, or personal growth in general.

And what’s strange is that the job isn’t even physical, yet I feel more exhausted than I did back when I used to do physical labor.

At first, I told myself it’s just a phase, that I’d get used to it, or that over time the job would get easier or allow more balance. But six months in, I’m looking at my managers and colleagues (most of whom also have kids), and realizing this lifestyle probably won’t change much. If anything, taking a managerial role will likely make it more intense.

And it’s not that I hate my job. On the contrary, my boss is great, the work environment is really positive, and I feel like I’m providing value to the company.
But I feel like I’m completely stuck. I’m not learning, not growing, and not doing anything for myself. It feels like I’m living to work, not working to live.

I think a big part of this is that there’s always something to do at work. There’s never a true ""break"" where I feel free to focus on personal goals. And now that I’m moving toward a management role, I expect that pressure to only grow.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much I want to invest more in myself, in my education, interests, and well-being.

I’m starting to wonder if a better fit for me would be a different kind of job, something where the main responsibility is to be present and available and respond when needed, rather than being constantly active. A role where, in between those moments, I could use the downtime to study, read, listen to podcasts, or work on a side project.

I’m not looking for a fake job with hidden unemployment, I want to do meaningful work and actually provide value. But I do want a role where, when there’s nothing urgent, I can use the time to grow personally and not feel constantly on edge.

I’m still young, no kids, and not tied down, so now is probably the best time to explore other directions. I’m not afraid of learning something new or starting fresh in a different field if that’s what it takes.

Even though on paper I’m in a good place right now, I have this growing feeling that if I stay on this path, I won’t end up with the kind of life I want.

So I’d really appreciate it if anyone has ideas for career paths or jobs that align with what I described. I’m open to studying, training, or putting in the work, I just want to make sure I’m building toward the kind of life I actually want to live.

Thanks so much for reading. I’d love to hear your experiences or suggestions.",Global_Speaker1873,1,1.0,1,1750706628,2025-06-23 19:23:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1liptcd/feeling_stuck_considering_a_career_shift_would/,6,2025

1lipelj,Am I getting underpaid??,"So I'm not sure if I'm getting paid what I should, which is why I'm coming here for help. I work at a small, family-owned business in Arizona as a waitress in the lodge's restaurant. This is my summer job, and during the year, I'm attending college, which is actually how I found out about the job. The hiring managers came to a summer career fair at my school, and it looked pretty good. Because this lodge is so far out in the middle of nowhere, they provide housing and food for the seasonal employees. It's not great, but its enough to survive. We were all told that food and housing is free to employees in the hiring process. Most everyone here, who is a seasonal employee is getting paid $14.70/hr, which is Arizona minimum wage. We all work 8 hours a day, 6 days a week. The reason I feel like I'm being underpaid here is because as a waitress, I'm only making tips. There's no base pay of any kind, and if I'm not making at least 14.70 an hour in tips, they say they will compensate me. I keep a very accurate record of my daily tips, and especially on the weekends, its not bad, but during the week when its slow, I can average at around $60 a day in tips. I have never been paid the rest I would have needed to make minimum wage for those days though because they add up my total tips for the pay period, and average them between the number of days I've worked, and if the average is as high as minimum wage would have been, they don't pay. I am also required to work way more than any other department, and we get paid for the same number of hours. Some days, my schedule is 9 hours, rather than 8, and even if it is 8, I'm required to stay a long time after my shift has ended to finish with customers, or do cleaning tasks. I'm seriously not allowed to leave until some checks off my list of cleaning jobs that must be done. They don't have us clock in or out, so they don't actually pay us hourly, or by the time we truly work. Also, we work over 40 hours a week, because of the 6 day work weeks, so shouldn't i be making some kind of overtime. I signed a work contract for this place, so I'm not sure that I can complain about the conditions, but the only thing it said about our pay is this: ""You are paid on the 5th and 20th of each month. If you have questions regarding your paycheck, compensation, are unsure how to read it, etc., please contact HR. Those departments that receive tips, accurate tip reports will be required for each pay period. Please keep track of your cash and credit tips.""

I am 30+ male and currently trying to make a decision on a job offer and I would appreciate some insights. I have 5 years of experience in data science and ml engineering area.

Currently working in a large international industrial company as a senior data scientist. I am responsible mainly to develop some algorithms for iot data utilizing classical ML/AI then hand it over for software team for deployment. So I don’t necessarily work on the productization part apart from some support. Tech stack is python, databricks and aws. I also work on some internal data engineering tasks and genAI PoCs. The job pays ok and comfortable in general with good manager. But the learning somewhat stagnated. In addition there is more pressure to become profitable or there might be some redundancies in about 2 years.

New offer is in a local large bank. The job is about developing genAI platform in cloud (aws) geared towards AI agents. The main goal is to enable other teams in the bank develop genAI applications. I think the job is quite interesting and there are learning opportunities in the hot field of genAI.

However, the downsides of the new role are:
•	⁠salary is ~2.5k€/year lower (not significant)
•	⁠6 months probation period (can get fired any moment for no reason)
•	⁠non-international environment
•	⁠I will lose my bonus from the current company for this year (15% of yearly salary)
•	⁠no signing bonus
•	⁠lower title (new title would be data scientist/genAI developer)
•	⁠moving to management is difficult due to language skills

1lioz9y,Breaking Into Accounting: Seeking Advice for a Recent Grad,"Good morning ya’ll, 

I somewhat recently earned my BS in Accounting (Sept 2024) and have been actively seeking an entry-level accounting position. I’ve had a few promising interviews, but opportunities have been limited for me due to the fact that most roles on Indeed require 2–5 years of experience or certifications (that I’ve seen), which I obviously don’t have.

Experience wise, I have had minimal direct accounting experience (mostly data entry and journaling in Excel). However, I have taken steps to build relevant skills: Improving my Excel proficiency, Practicing QuickBooks online (free tutorial), and watching tutorials on various accounting software on YouTube. I’ve worked on improving my resume. I’ve even begun working with my OM after hours to learn payroll and reimbursements at my current job. I’ve also reached out to local accounting firms to volunteer, just to gain experience (I’ve been told I’d be too much of a liability - not sure why). I have read other reddit posts that say students have gotten internships through school, but unfortunately, my school didn’t offer internship support, which is fine. I have applied for internships on my own, but have not had any luck. I just want to figure out how I can get a start.  

In short, I’m trying to figure out where I can get my foot in the door. I’m 26 years old and I’m getting married soon. Just looking for some stability in my career. This being said, whatever suggestion that can be offered is MUCH appreciated. Thanks in advance.

1liow79,Changing jobs/career from the energy sector to finance/other higher paying fields (background of Applied Mathematics Masters),"Maybe yet another repeated question, but I trust the redditors will help me :)   
As the title reads, I want to get into the headspace/idea that I'd want to change my job, probably to a different field in about half or in a year. 

I'm 27, closing 28, and I work as a scientist in energy networks (\~3y). I come from a Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering, and Masters of Applied Mathematics. Thus I'm good with numerical modelling, simulations and optimizations. I specialized in computational fluid dynamics, and for the past 3 years (first job after Masters) I've been working modelling gas/hydrogen networks, optimizing heat networks, and modelling hybrid energy assets.  

I'm an expat living in West-Europe (will be getting a permanent residenceship/passport this year), and I work in the energy sector for a distinguished research organization. I believe with such employers there's always a caveat in limitations of pay. The progression of salary scale and seniority scale are kinda inversely proportional in my organization. For example, I get good money in the first few years, but take a long time to get promoted, thus in long term, I might be great and well known in what I do, not getting paid much. The current job is pretty stable (although a little boring at the moment), and I can get away with working \~25-30 hours of full concentrated work in a 40 hour work week.  

To be brutally honest, I'm driven by money as well, but deep-down, I love the science. And the intersection is kind of hard to find (maybe a life lesson that I need to learn though). Although, I feel I might have a shot at finance given the background of mathematics. But I can't help but think, given the harsh market situations and whatever the fuck is happening in the world right now, it might be impossible to land a job there without prior knowledge (let's say for a quant analyst). I know that mathematicians are very much in demand, but I do not know what all skills are required so (I still need to do my homework on this). 

I seek stability (thus afraid to switch), but if I never shoot from the hip, I'll never know. So, motivate me or criticize me. 

So the questions:   
1) Has anybody done this kind of a change before (I believe this aint that niche) ?

2) Does this make sense?

3) What preparations are typically needed ? 

4) Given the fact of being stable with the current job, I've thought about giving trading/stocks a shot (to learn to make more), and then switch to a more financial tech role. Does that even make sense?

5) What would you do?

1lioby2,Contemplating quitting my dream job,"I got hired for my dream job 6 months ago. I moved abroad for it, to a place where I knew nobody. At my previous job, I would sacrifice weekends and evenings to build my skills, and develop my resume in order to make landing my current job possible.

However... I have really struggled with the reality of my ""dream"" job. Not because I have to work longer hours; nor because I have to rebuild my personal life outside of work (outside of work has been good); but because I have been unable to fit in with the rest of the team. In truth, I am struggling to perform to expectation and as a result am a shell of myself at work. I find the environment stressful and the gap between my skill level and my colleagues is probably the cause. Since I am a new hire, I feel this is partly their fault, as I did not lie at all during the hiring process.

In any case, I have suddenly lost all interest in what I once called a passion, and am contemplating quitting and changing my life completely at the ripe old age of 27 haha. I realise this might be a terrible idea, and perhaps I should stick it out, at least for another 6 months. Only problem is that I currently hate my life, and this feeling has largely been present for the first 6 months.

I have about 45K USD to my name. If I were to quit, I was thinking of taking a few years to work part-time, do trusted house sitting (housing in exchange for looking after pets), WWOOF (Housing + food in exchange for working on organic farms), lots of hiking, and volunteering wherever I find. I also have my parents' house that I could fall back on temporarily if needed. Basically, trying to live cheaply with very little and experience the world a bit.

Is taking a break a total retard move? Or should I stick it out longer to see if things get better? Or maybe I should move back to where I was before and find a job in the same area? Right now, I feel very compelled to quit and live a frugal nomadic lifestyle for a bit.",Enough_View_2345,1,1.0,0,1750703246,2025-06-23 18:27:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lioby2/contemplating_quitting_my_dream_job/,6,2025

1limt5b,"💼 Should I Leave a Comfortable WFH Job for Slightly Higher Pay & Career Growth? (Philippines, Tech Support → QA Path)","Hey Reddit — I’d appreciate some advice on a career move I’m considering. I’m based in the Philippines and currently working in tech support. I’ve received a new offer and I’m seriously weighing the pros and cons with long-term growth in mind.

# 👨‍💻 Current Job – Remote Role in EdTech

* **Role:** Tier 2 Technical Support (2 years)
* **Setup:** Fully work from home
* **Net Pay:** ₱53,900/month (approx. $920 USD)
* **Allowances:** Rice and wellness (₱1,200 or $20 USD per month)
* **13th Month and Bonus:** Yes (2% annual bonus)
* **Age:** 28, male, no dependents
* The platform I support is very niche and company-specific. It’s stable and low-stress, but I’m not gaining exposure to industry-standard tools or technologies. I feel like I’ve hit a ceiling in terms of skills and mobility.

# 📄 Job Offer – Hybrid Role at a Company Known for QA Automation

* **Role:** Support/Consulting (client-facing, SaaS-related)
* **Setup:** Hybrid – 3 days onsite in Taguig, 2 days WFH
* **Base Salary:** ₱63,000/month ($1,075 USD)
* **Bonus:** 10% of base annually (₱75,600 or $1,290 USD)
* **Allowances:** ₱3,000 de minimis and about ₱1,300/month for meals ($22 USD)
* **Commute:** Around ₱900/month ($15 USD), with 1.5 to 2 hours of travel per day, 3x/week
* **Adjusted Net Take-Home Pay (after commute and perks):** ₱56,200/month ($960 USD)
* The company (starts with T) is well-known in the test automation space and develops a widely used tool that frequently shows up in QA job listings — let’s just say it rhymes with “Posca.”

# 🎯 Long-Term Goal: Transition Into QA/Automation

I’m honestly burned out from support, even though I’m good at it.  
The job post even mentioned:

>

My goal is to eventually pivot into QA by:

1. Documenting and triaging complex support tickets
2. Assisting QA teams with bug validation and test scenarios
3. Learning their automation tool internally (you probably know the one)
4. Moving into a QA/testing-focused role when the opportunity opens up

👉 I know **there’s no guaranteed internal transfer**, but being in an environment that actually uses a real-world test automation platform feels like a step forward. I’m already seeing this tool more often in job listings and job descriptions.

👉 Realistically, trying to land a QA role from scratch is **extremely difficult** without direct experience. If I forced a switch now, I’d likely need to take a big salary cut and start over from the bottom.

# ❓ What Would You Do?

* Is this a smart tradeoff — giving up full WFH for slightly higher pay and exposure to actual QA tools?
* Has anyone successfully moved from support to QA/testing?
* Would this be a solid stepping stone, or would you stay where it’s safe?

Thanks in advance — really trying to make a smart, long-term move while I still have flexibility. Would love your input.",rodmarcel12345,1,1.0,0,1750699819,2025-06-23 17:30:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1limt5b/should_i_leave_a_comfortable_wfh_job_for_slightly/,6,2025

I also am passionate about environmental issues. I want to do work that will help animals and the environment. The downsides of this major are that I have to take chem 1&2, physics 1&2, and other classes that will be really hard for me. I might have to have an extra year of college to get all of my bio classes done too. 

I wish my college had a wildlife biology or zoology major or something similar, but biology is the best option I have if I want to go this route. What should I do? I also did not have very good guidance in high school and I think I chose the wrong college, not knowing what I wanted to do career-wise.

1lijnms,Would like feedback on what to do,"Hello everyone,

I am interviewing for a position at Company A, and the hiring manager mentioned that they would send me all the details for the interview by Friday (last Friday). However, I didn't hear back from them and assumed they had decided to go in a different direction. Now they are calling me to come in for the interview, but I had already made plans based on our last conversation and the lack of information provided in an email.

I informed them that I am available next week due to my current job commitments. Since I am concerned that I won't be able to take time off this week, I stated that I am free this upcoming Monday so I can work around their schedule. Does anyone have advice on how to handle this situation?

1lijgmm,"Can I accept an offer for a job starting in 12 months' time, and keep applying to see if I can find better?","I am currently pursuing a degree in Economics at a university in the UK. After completing my second year, I successfully managed to secure a year in industry/placement in Internal Audit. I am now 10 months into my 12 month placement and I am due to return to university in September to finish my final year of study.

I have performed pretty well and have had the privilege of being offered a job with my employer to return when I graduate. I have really enjoyed the placement - it has massively improved my confidence, helped me develop a bunch of different new skills, and provided me with some valuable experience to put on my CV. The people are also great and I have no overall complaints on the company itself.

But I'm also considering the following points:

\- I don't want to pursue a long-term career in Audit, I see it as good grounding and potentially a stepping stone into something else

\-  the company I work for isn't in the Big Four (PwC, Deloitte, KPMG, EY), which I think I am now in a stronger position to secure an offer from, and I see value in having one of these companies on my CV

\- I'm also considering applying for grad internships to eventually go into M&A, which is an area I find really interesting, but that I currently I have no background or experience in.  
  
Essentially, there are a number of routes I am currently exploring, and I don't wish to fall back into audit unless I've exhausted those other options. I will be exploring and applying to other positions from this summer and going into my final year of uni, but can I still accept the offer I have received already?   
  
Does it make sense to be pursuing higher rated companies in the same sector?   
  
Should I just stick with audit, pursue the accounting qualifications it comes with for three years (ACA), and then consider transitioning to a more finance-related role after that?

Any words of advice would be much appreciated.

1liiy70,🔍 Just Had an Interview – HR Called Me 30 Mins Later and Said “We’re Also Interviewing Someone Else” Right After Asking My Salary Expectations 🤔,"Hey folks — need your take on this situation:

I just finished a final/important round of an interview today. Barely 30 minutes later, I get a call from the HR team.

They ask me about my compensation expectations — which I thought was a good sign since they wouldn’t bother asking unless I’m in consideration… right?

But then, in the same breath, the HR person casually drops:

“Just letting you know, we also have another candidate who’s currently being interviewed.”

Now I’m wondering — was that just HR-speak for ‘don’t get too confident’, or were they bluffing to lower my salary expectations?

Why would someone say that right after asking about comp? 😂

I stayed calm and professional on the call, but now I’m replaying it in my head like a game of mental chess.

Was this a tactic to negotiate me down? Or a genuine “we’re still evaluating” heads-up?

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially from folks who’ve been on either side of the table (candidate or recruiter).

1lii7yx,"Offered a Partnership, but Goal-Posts Keep Moving","Hi everyone, my name is Lily. I'm a 31 year old female and have been working in the Architecture and Interior Design field for 6 years now. I mainly worked in Residential, working at a firm for a few years before starting my own practice (which did fairly well but I’ve never had business guidance and struggled to scale it). I ended up leaving the state I was living in and relocating, started fresh. This was almost two years ago and I started a new job at a firm that was effectively operating like a startup but with huge projects. They'd been around for 4 years, and had huge commercial projects thanks to one of the partners connections. Partner A is 70 and has been working in the field for 50 years. Partner B is in his 40s. The main thing they struggled with was the chaos of completing tasks - there were only 4 other people in the office besides them, most of them under qualified (two which were interns) to be doing what they're doing. Most projects were failing because of poor management, lack of team skills and Partner A's tendency to anger and blow up relationships. I came in and helped get a lot of things in order and honestly agreed to start for a lot less than I would normally because I saw the potential to solve a problem and help become a key player in a small firm that did get huge projects. Partner A had also assured me that if he saw excellence, I could get to the salary I wanted in a matter of months. Just for context, I was making 90k yearly with great benefits, time off, etc in my previous firm. Here I started $33 an hour and was effectively hired on a 1099 but expected to perform like an employee. I started as an Architectural Designer and within half a year, I had effectively become a Studio Lead/Project Manager, helped with leadership meetings, setting budgets and processes, attended conferences and assisted with marketing and ux/ui (Used to work as a graphic/web designer) and mentored team members. I approached them multiple times, stating that I was happy to take on the additional responsibilities, but did expect a raise. It was constantly pushed back - avoided - excused. Finally, we started discussing the option of a partnership instead of an immediate raise. They did architecture in house, but didn’t have a department for interior design nor any processes in place. They said I would be the managing partner/principal in charge if I could get the company off the ground and we would discuss the partnership terms after we got our first viable project. I created a website, some marketing material and started to push the department. A couple of months later, one of their existing architectural clients asked for us to also go ahead and handle his Interior design documents. I only heard about this from the office manager who asked me to sign off on the scope and pricing that the partners had discussed. I approached them calmly and told them that I felt it was integral for me to be a part of these conversations as the person who was expected to take accountability for these projects (especially after I had pointed out and they had eventually agreed that they priced the project way too low). I told them I felt like I had been treated as an employee and not a partner in that scenario. I also celebrated the fact that we hit the goal we set out and could now talk about the partnership agreement. Partner B said he was excited as well to have gotten this interiors project for me. He seemed more open to signing an agreement. Partner A flat out refused. I told him that we did have a verbal agreement in place and I had very patiently waited and built this department in good faith. He began saying that I was too inexperienced and didn’t have a proven record of leading an interiors firm of this scale - that I needed to prove myself by finishing 3 to 4 projects (which would take years). I told him that while I had less experience in the commercial interior design department, I had successfully run projects on the architecture side and also in the residential interior design side. Also, the idea of a partnership was that each person comes in with something the other is missing - I had time and some knowledge. They had little time, but could fill in the gap of knowledge and finances. I was also very open to discussing the percentages and responsibilities- but we never even got to that. He continued to vehemently oppose and tried to belittle my work and point out ways in which I’ve failed (most of which were actually his responsibility on projects he had mismanaged. He has a history of avoiding accountability). I told them that I was willing to continue without an agreement in place, but since I had no ownership in the company (and was continuing on trust mes which they’ve never delivered on), I expected a significant raise in my pay and benefits that reflected my position. It was very tense in the room. Partner B told me “just give me a number of what you want to run this interiors job”. I told him that I didn’t want to do that and that I wanted either an agreement, or a permanent adjustment to my salary. We couldn’t reach an agreement so we ended the conversation with the conclusion that we’d all think about it. Honestly I feel very slighted and led on. I also feel like they are going to resist compensating me for the value I’m bringing in. The fact that the partnership goalpost is consistently moving is also a huge red flag to me, especially because they trust me to run this interiors job and do it effectively but simultaneously say I’m too inexperienced to receive equity in the firm. I’ve got an option to leave and start my own business back up, but if I could get a partnership with them - there is a lot of potential for profits there. My fear though is that I will build up the department and after the 3,4 jobs are up - they’ll have a process, a portfolio and no need for me. Sorry I know this was long. Would love to get your perspective. Thank you.

1lihxfs,I’m f(30) got offered my first job by my brother as a project coordinator on his business.,"Hi everyone. I’m in a really tough spot and could use some guidance. Here’s my situation:  

 I graduated with an Economics degree four years ago but never started a career because my now soon-to-be-ex husband was well-off, and I unfortunately took things slow. The marriage turned physically abusive, and I’m finally leaving. However, I struggle with depression and panic attacks, so I’m nervous about handling a job for the first time. My brother is an entrepreneur launching an app and offered me a role after I told him about my situation. I’m grateful but unsure if I can do well.  

My Questions:
1. How do I even start a career this late with no experience?  
2. Should I take my brother’s offer, or is a startup too chaotic for a first job?  
3. Any advice for someone with anxiety entering the workforce?  

I feel completely lost and would appreciate any kind words or practical tips. Thanks in advance.

1lihsze,Should i quit the job i got right out of college?,"Hi, I got placed last August, and I was one of the first few to get placed in my college. I majored in Computer Science and have a 8.8+ CGPA. In our placement prep course, we were taught to not be picky and say yes to everything we're asked in the interview, which in hindsight, was obviously bad advice for a student, and was only good for the college rep.

Since it was one of the first few companies, I wasn't entirely serious and just wanted to experience the rounds and interview. Me and many others chose the role of 'Application Engineer' in the form assuming that it was something like a software engineer, but I was wrong. I got through to the interview, where I was asked if I was ok with a role that didn't have much coding and if i was ok with shifts. I was still not giving the interview with the intention of securing the job, I just wanted to experience a tech interview. I assumed not much coding would mean a role like a 'Solutions Architect' or something and said I had no problem.

Long story short, I somehow got through even though I didn't answer well on most questions, and I tried telling my placement in-charge that I wasn't keen on the role, but they didn't care, we were asked to sign our offer letters as soon as the results were announced. I should've been more assertive. I regret that now. Also, in my college, once you get an offer you aren't allowed to sit for any other companies after that.

Cut to the present, I've been interning since Jan in this company, and my role is a glorified support role. We just have to monitor things, automate things like file transfer and troubleshoot issues (or mostly escalate them to other teams). My timings are 11:30 AM to 8:30 PM, but on the 3 days I physically have to go to the office, cause of travel i'm out at 10 AM and back by 10 PM.

I've been unhappy with my role and don't feel any sense of purpose. It's also annoying to always have to be in front of your screen in case an issue pops up, and not have a fixed lunch time (the team is kinda understaffed so if others are on break someone has to be there manning the station). I started to be envious of the other interns in analyst/developer roles cause at least their roles were related to our degree.

After the 2 month mark I was really sad about it all and I was contemplating leaving right then. My manager was also being really passive-aggressive and condescending which was bothering me, but since there weren't many fresher job openings at the time I thought I'd just push myself and finish the internship. I even asked my manager for some web dev projects for our team and i've been working on them on the side, so that my time here wouldn't be entirely pointless from my career trajectory's point of view. I really regretted not putting my foot down and rejecting the job offer when i could. If i had, I could've gotten a better role since so many companies were coming in.

My internship ends in a month and I'm dreading the uncertainty that'll follow once I leave and reject the full time offer. I feel like staying is not an option since I have little to no free time and I have to catch up with DSA from scratch so it'll take time. Also, i'll be asked to work the night shift or morning shift in the upcoming months if i do stay. Ik the job market is awful rn, but it's not like I'd be in a bad place financially or anything. Even though the package offered is really good for a fresher what's the point if my heart's not in it.

Should i take the risk, leave with the internship certificate and start grinding and applying for software engineer jobs?",_fleetingbliss_,1,1.0,0,1750688346,2025-06-23 14:19:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lihsze/should_i_quit_the_job_i_got_right_out_of_college/,6,2025

1lig7x9,HELP!,"I’m reaching out because I could really use some perspective from others who’ve been through the early-career tech journey.

I’m a May 2024 Computer Science graduate, and like many of us, I’ve been navigating the job search for a while now. I completed a 1-year internship as a backend developer, working mostly with Java and Spring Boot, which I genuinely enjoyed. However, after graduation, I found it challenging to secure interviews, which was discouraging, especially given my real-world experience.

So I took a step back, focused on upskilling, and recently earned a couple of AWS associate-level certifications. It helped me gain confidence again, and I’m now planning to work on a few hands-on projects to deepen my understanding of backend and cloud development.

That said — I’m still feeling a bit lost and unsure about my direction.

A few things I’m wondering:

Should I double down on backend development with Spring Boot, or pivot more strongly into cloud-focused roles (e.g., DevOps, Cloud Engineer, Solutions Architect)?

How valuable is AWS knowledge if I don’t yet have a strong portfolio of cloud-native projects?

What kind of projects would best showcase my skills right now to employers?

Is it realistic to aim for AI-related roles down the line, or should I first get a solid foothold in software/cloud engineering?

For those who’ve been through a similar transition: How did you stay motivated during this phase, and how did you know you were on the right track?

I’m really trying to be intentional with this time and make decisions that lead to long-term growth — not just chasing the next thing because it’s trending.

Any thoughts, advice, or even a “you’re doing okay, keep going” would honestly mean a lot right now. 🙏

1liecqi,"Career gap ruined my chances, Struggling to restart career in HR-need advice","Hi all,

I’m into HR and to be honest, I’ve made some very naive decisions early in my career. 

After my MBA in HR, I joined a startup in Feb 2023 where I was handling end-to-end HR functions alone — recruitment, onboarding, operations, employee queries, everything. I was learning a lot, but also being overloaded with work beyond HR, especially by the director. I was expected to handle tasks from other departments with no training or context, and the pressure became unmanageable. At the same time, my in-hand salary also reduced after PF deductions were introduced, and the company was unwilling to support or adjust. I still tried to manage, but eventually, I resigned in June 2023 after just 5 months.

After a 4-month gap, I finally got an opportunity at an MNC in Nov 2023. I was genuinely happy and felt I was finally getting back on track. But just 3 months in — by Feb 2024 — my mother’s health took a serious turn. I had to move back home to take care of her, and I couldn’t manage both work and the situation at home. So again, I had to resign and it caused a major break in my career for an year now.

Since Feb 2025, I’ve been actively job hunting. I’ve not kept any conditions — I’m open to any location or even a lower salary — but I’m facing constant rejections. Either companies are not shortlisting me at all, or they’re hesitant because of the gaps in my experience.

I wanted to ask:

1. How do I explain my gap and short stints without sounding unreliable?
2. What should I do now to improve my chances?
3. Is there anything I can say or do that makes recruiters see beyond the gaps?

I’ve lost a lot of time, and now I just want to rebuild and get back into a stable HR role. If anyone has faced something similar or has advice, I’d really appreciate it.",wavesbeat,1,1.0,0,1750678810,2025-06-23 11:40:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1liecqi/career_gap_ruined_my_chances_struggling_to/,6,2025
1lie9yw,Should I go public sector or private sector?,"I know I’m a new account, but I would appreciate your guidance. 

Background: I (38m) worked as an IT solution architect for a major IT firm but lost my job in 2020 due to COVID. 6 months later, I found work at an aviation company (private sector) as a system analyst (remote). 

In 2024, I was offered a role as a system analyst with the State (public sector) and was told that I could work remotely as long as I live in the state. 

I moved my wife (36f) and kid (1m) to the state at great expense to myself and things were going well. My wife is a SAHM and we live way below our means. We both grew up poor so we know how to make a dollar stretch. 

Last week the department I work for said we had 3 months to either plan to move to the State capital (where the cost of living is 2x compared to where I am) to work in the office or work at our closest office location (for me a 1.5 hour drive each way). 

In frustration, I applied to multiple roles and I have two offers now and don’t know which to take. I don’t mind going into the office but am frustrated that they are making me go so far despite multiple requests for a closer location. 
_______________________
Job 1: Private sector

Company background: it is a Fortune 500 company but has had a MAJOR layoff (500+ people) pretty much every year - more due to culling the low performers than finances. 

Salary offer: 123k plus benefits

Role: remote systems analyst role. I spoke with the manager and he said that 70% of his team are not only remote they live in different states; but he can’t make a guarantee. I also found out that he may leave for a different role in a year. 

Team: everyone working there has been there for 6-7 years and enjoys the work due to the freedom and trust afforded by leadership. They do worry about layoffs but they all said, “don’t be the weakest in the pack.” They also said the manager trusts you to be an adult. 

Reason for the open position: the previous person left for a leadership role. 

Raises: yearly 1-3% raises (depending on performance) and possible bonuses. 
______________________

Job 2: public sector

Company background: It is a major department that has funding that is partially dependent on the federal government. 

Salary offer: 110k plus benefits.

Role: Director/Team lead of IT implementation. I will have to move to a more affordable state and go into the office, but there are many affordable good housing options. 

Team: Everyone working there has been there for 15+ years and enjoys the work due to the freedom and mission. 

Reason for the open position: The previous person left for a leadership role after 5 years. 

Raises: Depends on state legislators and federal funding.

I could really use some advice. I have 9 months of experience in audit from a few years ago, but after that, I took a 5-year gap to prepare for government banking exams in India. Unfortunately, that didn’t work out. Now I’m trying to get into a finance role , but I feel stuck and unsure of where to start.

I’ve been learning financial modeling and brushing up on Excel, accounting, and valuation basics. I’m committed — but I’m also scared to apply because of the gap and lack of recent experience.

While I do submit job applications sometimes when I gather the courage, I still feel anxious about it.

I’m part of the Batch 2024 graduates. Unfortunately, my batch cannot get our TOR and diplomas because our thesis was not entertained by our assigned professor (he had the attitude) — even during our final year before graduation. We complied with all the requirements, but he never gave feedback or approval. After graduation, only a few students had the courage to follow up. About 90% of us are still waiting, mainly because this professor is known to be moody and unresponsive. I admit that I was also afraid to approach him.

Fast forward to Batch 2025 — they’re now facing the same problem. This professor is still not accommodating the thesis submissions. Because of this delay, our program was not able to submit the official list of graduates. Fortunately, our research adviser found a solution: the professor was removed from the process so the program could move forward in submitting the list. It is said that ""ayaw ko ng maulit yung sa batch 2024"". at dun gumuho ang mundo ko. our research adviser approached me and said sa august na ako bumalik :(( anong month pa lang ngayon :((( madami na akong pagod, isip at perang nasayang at wala pa rin nangyayari.

I messaged this research adviser asking for a solution kasi kita naman niya ako magpursigi matapos kahit hindi nakakausad. and she said wag ko daw ipasa ang burden sa kanya at hindi na kami obligado. :(((

tama pa po ba 'yon?

Can I apply for jobs while waiting for my documents? Will companies understand if I explain the situation?

1lidypc,I am an intern with no direction at work.,"I have been interning at a firm for about 2 months now. The first few weeks of work were still manageable with quite simple research tasks. However, my supervisor gave me a new task 2 weeks ago and I'm so lost with how to approach it. For context, I have approached my supervisor several times to clarify what the task is for, clarifying concepts etc. but they keep asking me the questions I ask back to me. I understand they want me to use my brain and be independent, which I am truly trying to do. However, I feel that I am receiving little to no guidance regarding the task, with my supervisor saying things like ""Don't ask me how to do something or if what you did is okay."" But in my opinion, without concrete feedback it feels like I'm directionless? On one hand I understand that I am there to do work for them but on the other I am an intern who is also there to learn, receive guidance and ask questions. It has reached a point where she answers my questions quite condescendingly like it is something I should have already known, and I have gotten so anxious over this job.

1lic4n2,How Do You Keep a Corporate Job as an Autistic Person? I’m Struggling Badly.,"Hi Reddit. I’m a 21-year-old autistic woman and I just got fired (again), this time from a big Scandinavian corporation where I was working as a Data Analyst Intern. I’m exhausted, overwhelmed, and honestly starting to panic about what comes next.

I \*want\* to work. I’m good with data. But I keep running into the same wall: the social side of corporate life.



Things I really struggle with:

\- Small talk, watercooler conversations, and social “norms”

\- Understanding workplace friendships or boundaries

\- Knowing when I’m being ""rude"" just because I’m not smiling enough or didn’t say the exact right thing

\- Open office spaces — they are overwhelming sensory hell

\- Masking constantly just to seem “normal” — it’s \*draining\*



To be clear, I don’t really struggle with relationships in general. I have friends, I’m easygoing, and I actually enjoy meeting new people or talking to strangers. But in the workplace, it’s like a whole different set of unspoken rules. I think the problem is that I \*want\* to work when I’m at work — not socialize. Trying to do both at the same time feels impossible. It’s distracting, stressful, and in the end it makes me worse at both the job and the communication.

Even in remote jobs (which I \*really\* want), there’s still so much communication — Slack messages, Zoom calls, unwritten etiquette... it’s a lot. I just don’t know how to make this career work when I feel like I'm missing a chunk of the ""how to be a corporate human"" manual.

I’d love any advice from folks who’ve found a way to \*survive\* (and ideally thrive) in corporate environments. Even better — if anyone is willing to be a kind of mentor or just someone I could message with questions like “how do I respond to this vague email?” or “is it okay to say this in a meeting?” I’d be beyond grateful.



Please be kind. I’m trying my best. And I’m scared I won’t ever be able to make this work.



TLDR: I'm autistic, good at my job, but constantly struggle with the unspoken social rules of corporate life. Looking for advice (or a mentor) to help me navigate workplace communication without burning out.

I recently completed my MBA with a major in Marketing and minor BAIT. A few months ago, I joined a sales job, but I realized very quickly that it wasn’t the right fit for me. It started affecting my mental health, so I took the tough decision to leave within three weeks.

Since then, I’ve been feeling confused and lost. I know I need to upskill myself before applying to new jobs because I don’t feel confident about my current skillset.

I’m really interested in exploring marketing analytics—something that involves both marketing and data. I’m trying to decide between two paths:
	•	Digital Marketing
	•	Data Analytics

I have some interest in both fields. I want to work in a space that combines marketing with analytical thinking, but I’m not sure which course will be more beneficial for my career in the long term.

Also, courses in India are quite expensive, so I want to make a smart and informed choice before investing time and money.

If anyone here has faced a similar situation or works in either of these fields, I’d be really grateful for your insights or advice. What helped you decide? What kind of roles open up after either course? And what would you recommend for someone in my position?

1li9eyj,When to start looking for new job that I want to start in january?,"Here’s the rundown: 

My lease is up in December. I currently live in Dallas and want to move to LA, ideally the week before the holidays (so I’d want to give my 2 weeks notice at my current job basically as soon as we return from Thanksgiving; which means ideally I’d want a job lined up before Thanksgiving). 

I want to move for “emotional” reasons which isn’t ideal I know, but I’m in my mid 20s, have nothing tying me here, have lived here my whole life and want to experience more, and 2 of my best friends are moving to LA for unrelated reasons at the same time (i’ll be living with them) 

I know the job market sucks overall right now. I have about 3-4 months living expenses saved (adjusted for increased LA cost of living) but obviously I don’t want to have to touch that. What time do I start applying for jobs in LA for a January start date? 

I don’t want to apply now and it be way too soon, even if the process takes 2-3 months, but again I know the job market sucks. Should I start like early August? If I were to get an offer even later in November, would they likely be okay with a first week of January start date?

1li8ooy,i kinda regret my internship,"First of all, I’m just an intern—and this is my very first internship. I got the opportunity to intern at a branch of a big company, which at first felt like a great step for my future career. But in all honesty, I regret committing to a 6-month internship in the production department.

I’ve already completed 4 months, and there are still 2 more months to go. But looking back, I feel like I haven’t gained as much as I had hoped. I expected to learn a lot, be guided, and build a strong foundation—but instead, I was left figuring things out on my own.

The project I was given felt too big for an intern, and unfortunately, I didn’t receive the kind of support or mentorship I needed. There was no one assigned to guide me, and when I asked questions, the responses often came in the form of more questions—like they expected me to know what to do, even when I clearly didn’t.

When the project finished, I found myself with nothing else to do. I kept asking if I could help with anything, but the response was usually “not right now.” Most of my time since then has been spent doing repetitive, minor tasks like packing.

Honestly, I came in with high expectations and a strong desire to learn, but after 4 months with little growth or direction, I feel like this internship hasn’t contributed significantly to my development. It’s disappointing, especially knowing how much I wanted this to help shape my future career.

Is it really okay for things to be like this? Is it normal to feel this unfulfilled during an internship?",Ok_Restaurant_6878,2,1.0,0,1750657101,2025-06-23 05:38:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1li8ooy/i_kinda_regret_my_internship/,6,2025
1li8mak,"Burnout, Boundaries, and Reevaluating My Future","Hi everyone,



I’m really struggling and need some advice. I’ve reached a point of burnout and I feel like I need to seriously reevaluate my career and what I want for my future.



Here’s some background:



In 2019, I joined a friend’s business. It started casually—more as a favor. We had worked together in the past, I had since moved abroad, got married, and came back home for a holiday. He and his wife (also his business partner) needed help, and I offered to lend a hand.



That was nearly six years ago.



Since then, I’ve become a major part of the company. I helped build it from the ground up alongside them. I’m paid fairly and financially, things are stable.



**But here’s the issue:**

We never actually had a proper conversation about my role, responsibilities, or long-term involvement. Everything just evolved organically, and we operated under assumptions—mostly that I was “in this” with them for the long haul. I never pushed back or defined boundaries, partly because I didn’t want to create tension or feel like I was letting them down.



**The result?**

I’ve been working myself into the ground—often 6 or 7 days a week, with minimal time off and zero predictability. Plans are hard to make because I’m always “on call.” We work in hospitality, so we’re constantly putting out fires. I’m extremely hands-on and involved at every level.



Lately, I’ve felt overwhelmed and frustrated. Expectations are sky-high, and I’ve hit a breaking point.



To make things more complicated:



* I’m expecting a baby soon.
* My wife and I would prefer to live elsewhere.
* I don’t particularly love our current environment.
* And most importantly—I don’t think I want to *own* or *run* a company.





Even if they offered me a co-ownership stake tomorrow, I don’t think I’d take it. I want a more balanced life, with clearer boundaries. I feel like I’ve been sacrificing my time, my well-being, and time with my wife and family, all in the name of helping out a friend. And while I care about him deeply, I realize now: *this is his business*, not mine.



I’m not saying I want to walk away entirely. What I think I need is to have an honest conversation about transitioning to more of an *employee role*, rather than being a partner or de facto co-owner. I don’t want to keep making long-term commitments I can’t promise I’ll keep—especially when I’m not even sure where I want to be in a few years.



Recently, I finally broke down and told him I wasn’t feeling good and that we need to talk. We haven’t had that full conversation yet, but it’s coming.



**So here I am now:**

Feeling burnt out, torn between loyalty and my own needs, and afraid that I’ve let this go on too long without saying anything. I feel crazy for even considering stepping back when they’d probably offer me anything to stay—but I just don’t think I can continue like this.



Am I crazy for wanting to take a step back and just work for them until I figure things out?



Any advice would be deeply appreciated.

I like working with my hands, and I can pretty much build the skill set for anything I'm interested in. I just can't find what to be interested in if I could just find something that makes good money and i can start doing now. 

Now for why I'm being paid so low, in the first place the minimum is already low. I asked why my coworker was being paid more than I was and for a raise, my boss's reasoning was she up sales, she changed manicans, was available seven days a week, and she paid by year. Her reasoning was completely ridiculous, both me and her sold about the same, She didn't change manicans I did and even admitted I worked harder so she didn't do much because I did majority of the work. She was not available seven days a week, and she started about a week or two before I did. We also worked the same amount of days I didn't say anything because I really just wanted the job for experience and I plan I quitting soon.",NoSugar1619,2,1.0,6,1750656125,2025-06-23 05:22:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1li8fbn/what_career_should_i_go_into/,6,2025

1li60mk,Helping decide between MHA vs MBA,"As the title says, I am deciding my next step. I have a couple of options I'm considering. Currently I work in a healthcare org with 3 years of admin project management experience and 2 years of clinical experience doing bedside therapy. I have been networking with leaders in my company about moving up into one of the system planning consulting roles and have gotten major support from executive leaders on my abilities to support the enterprise. 

I want to continue my education to ensure my qualifications for these roles when they come up and eventually move into executive/c-suite when the opportunity comes. Live in New England USA. Current salary 65k, potential raise in new roles 100k or higher. 

I currently have a couple of choices that I am looking at for what I want to study and am essentially choosing between an MBA or MHA. 

MBA- I am part of an alumni network that can help me get a fully funded MBA from the top schools (Yale, Wharton, etc..) in the nation where I will focus on Healthcare management and entrepreneurship. These programs would be full time in person and likely wouldn't allow me to move up in the company, but my current boss has already said she is willing to let me continue working while going to full time in person school. This opportunity is contingent on me completing the GMAT successfully (confident I can with significant studies). Then getting accepted to those schools as well as the scholarship program. I likely wouldn't be able to start school til next year if all goes well with GMAT. A lot of what ifs... I wouldn't want to do an MBA unless it is from these schools and fully funded otherwise. 

MHA - I have selected a couple accredited schools that offer part time online programs. If I go to these I could likely still apply to those better jobs in my company, make more money by continuing to work with a raise and do school stuff at night. The MHA would be partially paid by my employer (~30%) and the rest I would take out loans. This program, I would be able to apply right away since no testing requirements and start school this fall if I get everything in quickly. This could help me get those better roles right away as they are in IT planning and systems consulting. But having to take out loans would be difficult to pay for right now unless I got those better roles. The schools I would be applying to also would be less prestigious.

My biggest concern is locking myself out of the MBA by doing the MHA (will not do both by any means) and therefore missing out on the opportunity to attend a prestigious school at little to no cost. With MHA I wouldn't be able to pivot out of healthcare in case USA systems go tits up, and I won't gain the entrepreneurship experience either, which is a large goal for my 10 year plan. However the opportunity to do school now, and possibly get a better job while doing school can really help propell my financial goals for the future. 

I guess at this point, I am asking for any thoughts or insight from others what you think is best and what you would do in my situation.

1li5b8k,My company posted a hybrid job I’m entirely qualified for but I’m not willing to relocate. Should I apply?,"I’ve been working in an onsite role for my company for the past 4 years. In the last year I completed my communication degree and as part of my senior project completed a 6 month internship with my company’s marketing department doing work virtually as I am a few states over from our corporate office. 

They just posted a job exactly matching my qualifications and a lot of the job description was tasks I was completing for them as part of my internship. The job is hybrid with 3 days a week in the corporate office.

There are other corporate employees who are remote and where I am located is closer to where our actual physical business locations are. There are no locations in the state the corporate office is in. 

I was thinking about emailing the vp of marketing (who I have had several one on ones with previously so it’s not totally out of place) and stating that I know I am not necessarily the candidate they are looking for but I felt I had to reach out because I so closely meet the qualifications. I would be happy to relocate closer to the offices temporarily for training and would be able to work from one of our business locations nearby when in the office as many hybrid employees/regional managers do. In addition I’d be closer to our actual places of business, able to visit various locations and work with the onsite teams to assess their needs.

Would this be totally out of place and make me look like an idiot? I would be sure to mention that I would not be offended by being rejected for the role as I am not located where they prefer.

1li4hwe,Am I being treated fair?,"Hello everyone, I just joined a small-mid sized IT company a month ago as a Finance Intern. It's a 3 months internship. I'm a recent MBA graduate so I was hoping go to a job but since the job market sucks at present and I was receiving calls from recruiters relating to only internship, I have decided to go through with this role in this company. The finance team in this company consists of only few employees with the manager being the boss for everyone. Everyday I have no mental peace. I get calls suddenly from the manager giving a task to complete even after getting home. One day, I was made to work more than the office hours....been on the office for nearly 11 hours that day. And on some other day, I was made to complete some work in the night which lasted till midnight. The pay is fine for a internship position compared to other small companies in my country but the fact that another Finance intern who completed only Bachelor's degree receiving the same pay as me, who completed his Master's bothers me. Makes me question if I'm on the right path. Even employees from other departments are asking me why I'm working as an intern after completing Masters degree.

Not to mention that I get no training here. They hired me as an intern so I expected them to teach me something but no, the manager just gives me tasks and expects me to complete them on time but he doesn't teach me anything. He says, ""learn by yourself using the internet"". Even when I ask a senior employee about some doubts that I have related to the task, he says ""no, don't teach him. Let him do on his own"". But those tasks require experienced people's knowledge since they contain sections and laws and other tax related stuff. But I did complete the task on my own and when he reviewed it, he scolded me for some mistakes but that's what happens when a guy does something new for the first time with 0 training. The manager always  mocks me and treats me like crap that I get anxiety everyday at office thinking ""ohh what he might say now"". Since mine is just a team with only few employees, the manager sits beside me and watches everything I do on the laptop which irritates me. Now, I just hate going to the workplace. Everyday I'm on survival mode. 

My questions are:

Am I being treated fair? Is this how it's like on other companies as well??

Should I start searching for jobs in other companies?

My aunt and uncle say they know someone from a big IT company here who could provide me a job there. Should I go through with this?

1li1zrn,Question for what should be expected at work,"I am currently a fresh grad out of college, working at one of the biggest corporations in my smaller town. I enjoy my job, but the one thing that makes it unenjoyable is that 40 hours is not enough. This being my first time in the workforce, I was curious if this is normal. 

  
For example, many of my team members have Teams on their phones and will be available 24/7 even when on PTO. Many of my team members also work 6:30-5 most days. I do not want to do this because I can get my work done to the same quality as their work in 12-hour days. 

My last complaint would be that we are severely underpaid for the work we do because this company likes to hire graduates and underpay them without them knowing. 

  
A few questions I have are:

1. Is this normal? To have team members who never log off?

2. How do I get over the pressure of leaving after an 8.5-9 hour day when they stay for 12 hours?

3. Is it normal to have to log in and out when working in the office or from home? For example, if we use the bathroom, we have to say we are leaving before we lock our laptops.

1li1ndm,Advice needed - new job sucks - have a new one lined up,"I started a new job about 2 1/2 months ago, but it was not at all what was proposed to me or shared during the interview and hiring process. I have had little to no training, there is no room for advancement and management sucks. I can count on both hands how many days I’ve sat at a desk praying they would let me start to work. And for perspective, I’m making over 170K a year so it just does make sense. 

Moving forward, I already have a new job offer, doesn’t quite pay as much, but there are other added benefits, such as working entirely from home and career development, etc. My question is do I owe the current job a two week notice?! reality is I wouldn’t make a difference in the next two weeks anyways with the limited training and and work they’ve given me. But I also don’t want them to burn bridges or withhold a paycheck this coming Friday. I do have a bit of sick time I could burn up. Any advice how to play this?

1lhzpo0,Do I decline the project and negotiate pay?,"I know the obvious answer is going to be to job hop, but I would rather avoid that for now.

I am an engineer in IT. Multiple senior people on my team will be retiring within two years.

In terms of tiers on my team, there are 6 tiers (6 being the highest) not including manager. I was offered manager last year, while I am tier 2. I declined for many reasons.

Now, I am doing projects, that to me seem like tier 4+ pay level projects. I have been doing them to build my resume. However, I am no longer getting anything out of them to accept more of them. I was just given another one last week.

What I want to do is send an email refusing this new project and requesting salary appropriate to it. In all, this would equate to a 30% increase if I got what I wanted. They gave each of us a 3-3.5% increases in our last raise cycle, which is a joke for what I have been doing.

If they don't comply, I will employ quit quitting until I decide to leave.

I do not know how flawed this plan is. This is big corporate. Other teams have multiple tier 4, 5, 6 employees and we have one tier 4 and no 5, 6. We are being screwed. I feel like I need to at least try to negotiate.

1lhyu7y,i hate being a team lead,"I work in a marketing/advertising agency and got promoted to a team leader last December, after working there for a year.

I was the top performer in my previous team and they wanted to start a new team to specialise in an area for our clients, so I was the natural fit in their eyes.

However I’ve never been in a management position before so I didn’t know what to expect when getting the role, my team also doesn’t have a manager like other teams, so I am expected to take on managerial aspects to make me ready to be manager (as discussed in my 1-1s).

But every month since being promoted has been worse than the last, I am miserable and it heavily impacts my personal life because those closest to me see how drained and burnt out I am.

I believe my natural qualities aren’t really suited to a management role, partially due to self limiting beliefs but mostly because I get enjoyment out of working in a specific way which is a way that isn’t suited to being team leader. I enjoy doing the work rather than teaching/leading others to do the work, I love getting fully focused and drowning out background to complete tasks. I get easily burnt out from too much human interaction, and hate the admin side of being a team leader. I’ve found as time has passed I miss more and more when I didn’t have to worry about what’s going on with a whole team of people, and just focused on my day to day tasks. I have of course at times loved teaching others, supporting individuals when they’ve been going through personal challenges and it has been a rewarding aspect.

However, I constantly feel out of my depth, I have asked for training and looks like it’s not going to be offered. Imposter syndrome is ruining my ability to trust myself, my workload is unmanageable with the responsibility of supporting a team alongside. I feel like I am too much of a people pleaser to set boundaries. There are many other factors which also are contributing like colleague dynamics within the team that are stressful to navigate. There’s just a constant unsettling feeling with having this much responsibility, that I know I am not ready for and don’t have the tools for; both professionally and personally right now. 

I am now really at a cross roads with it all, either I have to hold onto a glimpse of hope that I get promoted to manager and when someone becomes a team lead that alleviates some stress and workload, so I can focus on sharpening my management skills and help with the bigger picture aspects of the team.

Or I have to speak my direct report and express that I am not happy in a team lead role, with the fear that I’ll lose my job, be demoted and then ruin future career opportunities or become stagnant.

Has anyone experienced stepping down from a management role and found it to be the best decision? Or has it ended with negatively impacting your career etc?

I just feel like if something doesn’t change soon I’m going to hit massive burnout, and it would be nice to just not have the Sunday scaries anymore.",pxlunaa,1,0.6700000166893005,5,1750626825,2025-06-22 21:13:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lhyu7y/i_hate_being_a_team_lead/,6,2025
1lhyslj,"Conceal your employment gap or termination by lying, not giving “clever” excuses","Yes, recruiters are throwing out resumes when there is a large gap, especially when it’s competitive. I’ve been told this personally from recruiters, one of them explains as, “We get hundreds of resumes and have to sort through it some way… and finding someone currently in a job makes me look good to my boss”. 

The problem is that when people conceal an employment gap, they try to use the “Years only” tactic which is obvious to recruiters what you’re doing. Additionally, there’s an NDA trick - “I can’t talk about what I was doing bec I have an NDA” which is just wrong and will get you thrown out immediately. 

Instead of these “clever” tricks, simply think about ways you can extend your employment date, or lie altogether (and make sure you are covered) - and then address it in the interview w/ no excuse whatsoever. You just have to take steps to pass the verification, and there are options to do that now.

[https://backgroundproof.com/concealing-employment-gaps-or-terminations/](https://backgroundproof.com/concealing-employment-gaps-or-terminations/)

Look out for your own self-interest in interviews people - not what is “moral”. You just have to make sure that you can cover it during the background check, and otherwise, who really cares? You're lying about something that you shouldn't be punished for anyways.

1lhy5t9,Is my company taking the mick or no?,"I’ve been with my current employer for several years. A while ago, a promotion was suggested, but for various reasons, it never materialised. I was repeatedly told I wasn’t ready – despite newer team members and colleagues assuming I was already in a more senior role based on the responsibilities I was handling. I was also actively discouraged from applying for internal roles within my field, being told I wouldn’t be successful, which meant missing out on a couple of significant opportunities.

Throughout my time with the company, I’ve consistently taken on senior-level responsibilities – including attending high-level meetings and working closely with senior stakeholders – despite officially holding a junior job title. Last year, my performance review was unexpectedly negative, even though I’d only received positive feedback throughout the year. What made it even more difficult to understand was that a colleague – who I had mentored and supported – received a higher performance rating.

We had the same job title, but I had been with the company longer and had more experience in the field. I was also naturally earning more, as I’d started on a higher salary due to my background. However, I was told that I was being judged more harshly in the performance review because of this higher salary – despite also having more senior responsibilities in addition to the standard duties associated with our shared role. Looking back, I’m not sure that was fair. We should have been assessed equally based on our performance and impact, and my additional responsibilities should have been taken into account.

This year, I made a clear effort to fully understand what was needed to secure a promotion and made sure I met all the expectations. My manager – who also manages my colleague – put me forward and gave me an excellent review score. I also had support from several senior members of staff, all the way up to executive level. However, the wider business downgraded the score, not because of my performance, but because “no one should be given a score that high” – which feels like a separate issue altogether.

In the end, my colleague – who hadn’t been put forward for promotion by our shared manager – was promoted instead. My manager expressed surprise and couldn't explain how or why the decision had been made. To make matters worse, I’ve been working towards this promotion for over two years – longer than my colleague has even been at the company.

After years of going above and beyond, being told I consistently perform well above my job title and pay grade, it’s been disheartening to be overlooked in this way. I’ve been reassured that I’ll be promoted in the next cycle, but it’s difficult to have faith in that promise.

I understand that businesses have their own internal considerations when it comes to promotions, but the decision-making process has been unclear and inconsistent. It’s hard not to feel like the goalposts keep moving – and that I’m being penalised for doing more, not less.

From an outside perspective, does it seem like I’m being taken for granted and it’s time to move on? I’m struggling to trust the process, and the whole experience has left me feeling demoralised and disappointed.

Position 1.
Assistant to the sales manager. I'm supposed to be an interface between the sales and every other part of company or clients.

One thing that makes me inclined to this role is the interview during which I noticed that they seemed quite *motivated* to employing me

1lhx825,feel stuck as someone one year out of high school with confusion on what to go into,"my whole life ive been a artist and I genuinely don't want to rely on it as a career. I'm in a situation where I'm working part time, gonna get my G1 in two months and am turning 19. in high school my main focus was to pass. I got a lot of 50's in grade 9-mid 11, than all 90's in grade 12 in which I had become more mentally stable, picked easier courses and had my energy put towards my comic in which ive now become unhappy with and believe I need to redo in the futur. I don't have the stability to put my energy towards a big project as such. so I'm only good at art but can't deal with a career out of it.  I enjoy writing but I suck at it, I enjoy moving things  but no one is gonna hire a 5'5 skinny guy for that and its not a career.

  
I briefly thought of becoming a art school teacher but I wouldn't be able to work part time for 5 years well doing school I think id crash out. I feel like I have potential but I always need guidance but I have guilt about asking for any. and now ive reached the post where I'm mentally stable reasonably, and trying to prioritize what I need to do but I feel genuinely lost and I'm under a lot of stress. my current job is in retail but its a high stress eviourment and I'm always stressed to the point I cat sleep for fours after my shift that ends at 12, and they keep cutting my hours because I'm the worst out of all the other employees. I take longer to catch onto things and often get fatigued and brain fog half way through the shift cause I'm focused on nit running behind and over work my nerves. 

I feel cursed because I wanted a job in carpentery but the course options I have are either 3 months and 10k or 2 years. and essentially everyone says don't go into it because its the worst its ever been right now. 

im not lazy, Im good at things. but whener I sit down to research career options I go in Circes and end up stressed with a headache and wanting to die. 

  
my dad went off at me over messages saying I should be kicked (don't live with him) out and everything, but I feel like a lot of the reasons I'm so behind on life is because I never had his support, I'm stressed cause he just went off on me and half the things he said I already thought about myself.

ive had a learning disability my whole school life, I sometimes take a minute to process things, I have adhd, and anxiety and it all leaves when I get comfortable In something in doing, like my old job was a horrid eviourment horrid hours but we all where highschoolers and you where taught one on one by people who where friendly, and understanding. I feel like I'm destined to fail because I'm quite a independent person yet my learning style is like ""explain everything 12 times in a way I can't get confused""  

I want to go to school and be less of a burden to people, I feel like I'm smart despite failing a lot of classes I tried my hardest at. I love psychology but I think that's just the cinema and artist in me. I'm a introvert but I live to talk to people and work in social eviourments. I like to hear them and collaborate or discuss and problem solve. 

I apologize if this is word mush, and I have a feeling this will be removed. but if anyone has any form of advice or thoughts of careers that are social. I live to do art but I can't do art when I'm stressed about a career. pursuing art is asking for failure when what I create is enjoyed by very few it feels. 

my grandma will support me for anything I try too do but I don't wanna be a failure and waste everyones time.  

  
this post feels like that in its self as it sorta states nothing but ""idk what to do I'm not good at things also idk what to do"" 

id be pen to anything as long as it was social and I had some guidance. everything feels so isolated in this current.

I've been in this role for almost half a year now, and work wise, I believe I have been doing my job well. A lot of my role involves talking to clients on video calls and going over their data - the face to face client communications aspect of my job was something I was more nervous about when I started the job, but ever since, I have gotten used to it since I've had similar experience like this working in retail and such.

About my job itself, it is quite a heavy workload, which isn't great but I am very much someone that can get by through difficult jobs if my work environment itself and my colleagues are good. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen to be the case in this job. I have never felt so isolated at a workplace before. All my colleagues in my entire department have not made me feel welcome, and they never have asked to  get to know me. When I started the job, I thought this was just their intial reaction and that they'd warm up to me. There is very much an 'in group' clique of people who have been in that company longer than me, who always have lunch together and discuss and openly make plans around me and never invite me or ask me about my opinions etc. For the first few months of  this job, I genuinely questioned myself, and thought that I was the outcast, and blamed myself for not being welcomed by them. However, only in the recent month, I have been speaking to some of the newer colleagues who started just after I did in my department (they are on slightly different specific teams than me), and they have also told me that they have been facing the same struggles. Majority of people on our office floor/department itself tend to be quite unwelcoming to the new starters, and honestly it was just a massive relief and validating to hear it wasn't just me struggling as well! I know that I am on the more introverted side, but I know that in every job I've had before, I have been able to make friends and get on with people very well, and so it is just validating to hear that it is literally not just something wrong I have done. 

In particular, one colleague who started about two months before me, and is a bit older than me, reaffirmed to me that the company is genuinely one of the worst places she has ever worked at, which was oddly comforting to know that at least I wasn't the only one thinking this. She also reaffirmed that our company hires mainly fresh out of university graduates, as we don't have much of an idea of how a good office environment is supposed to be, and that the workload is genuinely unfathomable and unrealistic comapred to her previous jobs she's had in marketing before. 

My manager has been giving me feedback on my client calls, and has always told me I consistently keep improving the way I conduct these meetings, and said my confidence has really improved since I first started the job. However, this week, my manager pulled me aside for a 'chat', and said ""I don't think you're suited to your role, and I don't think you are enjoying the communications aspect of your job"" He said he would speak to another manager at another department to ask if I could potentially move to another team, but said ""I can't promise anything"". He kept digging on further, telling me that I'm quiet and on the introverted side, and asked if I am really connecting with my colleagues. I did tell him in a later chat that I don't mind the communications aspect of the job - that obviously, my ideal role would have more of a creative aspect in marketing and that would mean less of the face to face comms side - but I reiterated that I've done customer service jobs before in the past, and that I am confident I can do that, My manager replied saying ""but DO you enjoy it though?"" and also asked ""what will YOU do if there's no space in other departments then?"" This left me quite dumbfounded, as I think this is a question that HE has the answer to, and he also said if it comes to that, he doesn't know what will happen to me, which insinuated to me that I might get fired. After this conversation, I was genuinely crushed, becasue I really did think I was doing good at my job, and it came out of nowhere. As soon as I got home, I couldn't stop crying for the rest of the evening because I am so scared of the possibility of being fired, and I kept remembering those months after uni I was unemployed and on my last few bucks, and I really don't want to go back to those days. After this difficult chat, I have genuinely been dreading going to work every morning. 

Additonally, during that conversation I had with my manager,  he also told me that this certain task/KPI I have to reach every day has not been reached at all - he told me that my name under the computer system showed I hadn't done this at all. I was left genuinely astonished by this, because I have been doing that task every day, and even been carrying extra work due to other colleagues going on holiday/leaving (as our company has an absurdly high turnover). I asked to see this on the system, and reiterated that I HAD done those tasks, and I asked him to ask the IT team to fix this on my system because it wasn't accurate at all. However, he only said he might ""look into it"" very half assed. It really pains me to see that the work I absolutely have been doing has not been recognised due to a computer glitch- and in all honesty, it made me think my manager might have potentially even lied to me about this, and just wants to kick me out of the team.

What's more, during this particular chat, my manager told me I needed to speak to him more about my personal life. There are a few things outside of work that have been affecting me, and this is something of a very sensistive topic which I struggle to speak to anyone about. During this chat, I felt like I had to open up and tell him about this - and it almost made me tear up in front of him. After opening up to him about this, the most he just said was that we can't always leave our home life at home, and that things won't always be good. This felt extra crushing - I felt like I was forced to open up to something that is extremely hard for me to talk to, and he didn't even give me proper advice or help to deal with it at work about it - it just seemed like I had said that for no reason, and now I worry extra that he just sees me as weak now.

I honestly don't know what to do. I wake up every morning and I absolutely dread and fear going into work. I am so scared I might get fired if I cannot move into another department. I have started applying to lots of jobs already, but it's taking time to hear back. I really just want to quit this job outright and not go back because it is really affecting my mental health. I have cried and had so many panic attacks over this job, and this job has also started affecting my appetite and I've been breaking out in stress rashes.  It feels like my manager is trying to push me and bully me out of this role, and I genuinely don't know what to do anymore. I can't decide if it's worth it to just quit altogether. This post is more of a pent up rant that has been eating me up recently, but I genuinely am open to advice and suggestions of what to do. I'm worried that every 'career job' like this will look like this from here :(",Kitchen-Cable-5081,5,0.8600000143051147,0,1750617820,2025-06-22 18:43:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lhvai9/i_genuinely_hate_my_job_and_i_think_im_being/,6,2025

1lhuipa,Looking to make my career in a biochemical related field which will tolerate fluctuations of market and be in demand for the foreseeable future,"Hello Everyone:
I (20F) am currently pursuing a B.Sc ( equivalent to BS) degree in Life Sciences ( Biological sciences) from one of top ranked colleges of University of Delhi, India.
I am very torn about what exactly I should do after my bachelors.For background info, My parents are very supportive of my Career and will make sure I am able to pursue anything I want to and am good at. No restrictions here, but this adds to the challenge as they cna provide me little to no guidance on this conundrum, as neither of them is from a biology/science background.

I have read countlees career advice posts here on reddit, surfed through the internet to look for reliable career opportunities in this field but none of them seem to fully solve my dilemma as I am not particularly interested in any specific field. It has been one of my qualities since childhood that when it comes to academics, specially, I am able to adapt to any course or subject and in general I don't limit my skillset to a particular field.
If I want to pursue Masters after my Undergrad, should I look for a college abroad, say, Germany, UK,Switzerland, Singapore, South Korea, etc, or should I do my Masters from here in India? (Mentioned South Korea as I know Beginner level Korean and plan to get a certification in the future)
If I do settle on the location, what course should I opt for? Biochem? Biomedical sciences? Biotech? Molecular Medicine?
If not this, should I try learning programming languages like SQL/Python and try to integrate these with a field say, Biomedical sciences and look for jobs in this sector?
There are SO MANY different options that my head starts paining once I start to sift through the myriad of choices, mainly due to the fact that I have not restricted myself to any particular field but have decided that research is not for me and I would like to work in the industry.
Biotech, Genetics, Molecular Medicine all fascinate me  to my core. I would love if I could make a career in any of these wonderful domains.
Integration of Data Analysis in Genomics/Biomedical is another options that is quite alluring.
I was also looking into lab certification courses if it will help me have a leg up in my career?
I am also pretty confident in my communication skills and ability to grasp concepts quickly.
I am not afraid of hardwork/toiling if I know if will grant me the in demand skills of this century .
Any and all advice appreciated!

1lhudjh,Need to leave deadend job and start an actual career,"Im trying to get out of my dead end IT job that has very little transferable skills that would help you advance your career, and dunno what to do. My job right now is basically just moving and setting up office desk tech. So things like setting up monitors and docking stations etc. and some low end IT troubleshooting. The work itself isnt too bad, but i got forced into a supervisory role that i dont like as much as when i was just doing the actual physical stuff. It’s more about managing people now and i hate it. The pay is very low and it’s part time, the only opportunity for advancement is to move to more of an admin/management role which i would rather shoot myself than work with the current owner of the small company. I have a wife and kid with a second on the way, so need something that pays better with more stability and options for advancement. 

I saw a comment here on reddit that led me to getting certified to work in wastewater treatment plants. This is what my primary goal has been, but there has been issues. I didnt realize that there just arent that many openings in this field, and when they do show up and i apply, im applying with 0 experience in the field… and nobody wants to take a chance on that. Ive been applying for 6 months now and have not gotten one interview yet, so im close to giving up on this.

Looking at other options, everything seems so specialized like you need school, lots of experience or both. I’ve been looking at the trades since I like more physical work/using my hands, and to become an apprentice a company needs to sign you on so you can start gaining experience and schooling. The problem with that is that they definitely want people that have construction backgrounds, and my background is basically low end tech support. So Ive thought about just trying to get a laborer job and then hopefully get introduced to a trade through that? Not sure about that. 

I’ve also thought about taking a 6 month course to get a gas license to work in HVAC. But this is expensive, and Im worried that it’s going to be similar to my other certification where i have it on paper, but without any god damn experience nobody will hire me. I’ve also thought of getting into nursing because it seems like they’re always needed. i like the science and being on your feet kinda thing but i prefer working more with things than with people.

Anyway, i just feel very stuck right now and am worried about my future. Im 30 but it feels like Im basically no different than a 20 year old as far as career goes.

1lhsuwd,What should I expect?,"I’m an employee with Autism. At my current job, I have had disciplinary action once because I violated an attendance policy. When my grandfather passed away in February, I was dishonest about where I was towards the end of work. Because I panicked, I ended up lying to my employers that I came back to work when I, in fact, left to go home. I did not know what bereavement was and was given a 1 day suspension in March. Since then, it has not happened since and I’ve been told my work outside of that has been the best it can be.

When major life events happen to me, I tend to lie in order to fill the gap of communications deficits. I understand how huge of a liability it is and damages trust very clearly. 

So when I went to the ER last week on Wednesday and still felt pain, I panicked. I did not have time to take off of work for medical reasons, and was late again. There’s a pattern to this. For a second time, I was dishonest. This time however, I tried to tell the truth. I even informed my employer that when I panic and don’t know how to communicate, I stammer and lie. I go to a therapist and intend to continue talking to her about this.

They informed me that on Monday at an unscheduled time, HR would be coming to see me for a meeting. I’ve NEVER been in an HR meeting and don’t know what to expect. I wanted to call HR to ask for disability accomodations, but never did because I thought I could do it on my own. Although I don’t think I’m being fired, I know absolutely nothing. What do I need to do to be prepared? Should I be expecting termination? I’ve already sought out other jobs just in case and looked for good lawyers… but I’ve been sick this whole weekend from stress.

Now, with four children and at 36, l'm keen to revisit my medical education. I've got my transcript (14,000 hours) ready and translated. I'm particularly interested in roles that merge medicine with English, such as translation or medical administration. I believe there are other options too

1lhnn28,Recommendation for career options for my 16 year old brother,"Hi all,
My 16 year old brother has recently completed his GCSE exams (examinations that students sit at 16 years in the UK). He is hopefully going to get good grades all 8s/9s). We've been having lots of discussion on what to in regards to his A level options. There are currently 2 options:
1. Go down the medicine route and take A level Biology, Chemistry and Maths and become a doctor. This path will be slightly easier for him as I am doing medicine myself at Cambridge and my other brother is studying pharmacy at UCL. So we have a lot of insight into the admissions process.

2. Do a level economics, maths and geography and go down the finance route. Either become an investment banker..or maybe actuary? My brother is quite good in maths, and is excellent in economics. However the people we have spoken to said that finance is super competitive (even more competitive than medicine) and cut-throat. So slightly worried in that sense.
He says he has interests in both, and doesn't mind doing either. He's planning to go with the subjects in which he gets the best score in his GCSEs? 

So, can anyone pls advise how we can make a decision? Specifically foe people working in the finance field, is it really that competitive, and what advice would you give him to help him make a decision? We will support any decision he makes, but want to make sure he knows what he's getting himself into!

1lhn03k,How to become attractive for smaller companies with PHD in ML? How,"Hi,

I have been looking for a job for 5 months without any offers.  
I am looking for jobs in Europe (no visa needed) and the USA (visa needed, type O1). The problem is that there are only big companies with multiple interview rounds which I am not used to it. I would also go for smaller companies. 

TBH, despite the pity of the time constraint, my long-term goal would be the US, because as an ML enthusiast, I can gain the most experience there.

Background: I finished my PhD in Computer vision (machine learning) in Germany last year. And I have one ML top conference paper, 4 workshop papers from the top conferences, then a larger signal processing conference and 2 smaller venues. I finished the PhD with an exam in 3.5 years.  
My current contract runs out.

Potential skills gap: My LLM skills are not that high, but I am currently learning them. I had interviews with Apple (post-training) and Meta (entry level, ML loop) in CA, which I failed. Amazon's recruiter went silent after the Microsoft layoffs.

Other issues: I don't gain attention from smaller companies. I think that for the US it is a visa issue, and for Europe, they see that I want to switch after one year.  
To be more specific, for Europe, I tried mostly Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Finland. I also tried the UK, but there I don't get any reply back and in France is a language barrier in my opinion.

I assume that companies in German areas calculate that the employee should stay at least 2 years or longer, and my profile does not look like this. Before PhD, I worked for autonomous robots (think logic) (1.5 years) and later another company (only computer vision; 5 months --> switch to PhD).

The only option I have is a startup where I get 2% equity but no salary. And maybe for the other two startups, freelancing work.

\- Could you share your thoughts and opinion about this? At the end, I need to earn money to survive. Sometimes, I think that going back to my home and becoming a roofer. Maybe, try out a social experiment and write a PhD dropout and my CV.  
\- Would you tell HR where you apply that your contract runs out?  
\- Might you see other issues? Maybe I was not aware of them.  
\- Another idea is that I start my own company and besides that I still prepare for interviews. What about this option?

1lhlmrd,Questions and seeking suggestions for studying in 30s with no career behind..(Australia),"Please and kindly, miss me with the ""something you love"" shtick.
I just want to begin in a career with lots of room to grow and to make decent money. I'm known for being a smart worker, but due to personal struggles I've haven't held jobs for long term and I haven't started in any career, just been a ground level worker since I left school.

I don't have formal or trade qualifications. I was planning to study software, but I've been told it is so extremely competitive to find jobs after graduating, with hundreds of applications for every 1 job.

I wanted to study a diploma in project management, but I've seen that this credential alone isn't so useful. And that with my spotty job history (mostly casual labour/construction) it's probably not going to get me into any PM job - but maybe it would still look good in my resume for future opportunities 


I'm at the bottom rung in a civil construction company, I'm glad to be getting some more tickets and experience. Do you think it's worth doing the diploma in project management anyway and stick it out with the work I'm doing now?

This diploma seems good for the fact it's online/at your own pace.. so I will be able to keep working while studying. I just worry it will be for nothing. But if it at least makes my resume look better, I wouldn't mind either.

1lhkuiw,"Got into a top 30 US college to study CS/stats, but I’m already in a global business school that takes me to cities like Singapore and NYC. Not sure if I should trade that for a rural campus and a more “official” tech degree. Is the switch worth it?","I’ve just finished my first year at a rotational business school where students change countries every four months — so far I’ve studied and built real-world projects in places like Singapore, Milan, Africe, Argentina and NYC. It’s been exciting and hands-on, but lately I’ve started questioning my path.

Deep down, I’ve always been drawn to STEM, especially computer science and statistics, and sometimes I wonder if I should’ve pursued a more technical degree. I was actually admitted to a top 30 U.S. liberal arts college this year, where I could switch to studying CS and stats. But it comes with trade-offs:
	•	📍 It’s in rural Ohio, so I’d be giving up my current exposure to global cities and diverse experiences.
	•	💰 It’s also significantly more expensive, which raises financial and value concerns.

On the other hand, I’ve been told (even by ChatGPT) that I could still reach my STEM goals by staying in business school and aggressively self-learning CS and AI — especially since many technical jobs prioritize skills and projects over degrees, and some university CS programs are still overly theoretical.

But I also read here that many of you feel a CS degree opens more doors and builds a stronger foundation — so now I’m torn between two very different approaches.

Would love any thoughts:
	•	How important is the actual degree vs. what you build on your own?
	•	Is the location/travel experience worth keeping if it limits tech coursework?
	•	Has anyone successfully transitioned into AI/stats-heavy roles without a formal CS degree but a business degree?",Hot_Competition_1868,1,1.0,7,1750588475,2025-06-22 10:34:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lhkuiw/got_into_a_top_30_us_college_to_study_csstats_but/,6,2025

However as I did a double degree and did comp sci I’ve been lucky to have a chance at Google and become a Security Engineer at Google.

The Security Engineering path at Google pays significantly significantly much more by a mile out of school and definitely down the line too as big 4 can’t compete with FAANG engineering pay.

Thing is I’ve always been a numbers guy and from my internships cyber and software hasn’t been about numbers more about coding or using tools while I do enjoy accounting an excel.

So tldr big 4 accounting vs a Google Security Engineering offer, Google Security Engineer path will pay me much much much more money than I’d ever make as an accountant even starting in the top accounting position which is Big 4 Accounting.

1lhk84n,Ready to take on a new challenge,"Hey!
I'm currently earning 53k a year working a 8-4 in a soul crushing job that's not worth my time or energy. It's in the health care field. I have changed jobs multiple times in the last few years and I think this is a clear sign that I've just had enough of being bossed, having a boss, being  in this sector doing managerial work dealing with other people's mess ups all the time and getting very limited satisfaction from having to trawl through every day for survival. That's no way to be, no way to live and the drawbacks are way more than the rewards associated with the role.

I'm on sick leave currently from developing a pressure sore from driving to work (yes a pressure sore lol) and refuse to belive that my only option is to return and rinse and repeat the same mistakes that I'm making. And it's got me thinking, there must be another pathway that I can take, not necessarily an easy one, but something that's going to be work on my terms and that's going to serve me in productive ways that put the responsibility for myself to earn in the forefront.

I have about 12,000 pounds in savings and I've been looking at starting something up using a small amount of this potentially in affiliate marketing / drop shipping, an arena where you are responsible but challenging yourself in a good way and having potential to be rewarded for hard work. I'm open and willing to learn it's so much more appealing than my brain going dead in the next 20 years through over working in an unproductive environment. I'm at a real crossroads amd want to make a good decision for me. I have knowledge of the social care sector, am a musician and would like to maximise my earning potential so living can become a possibility. I've come to understand that no salary is going to satisfy my goals of financial independence and that I need to be pro active.

Only issue is, I have no clue where to start. I'm looking for some very practical tips and advice for where to look in the Internet minefield for good, solid advice on starting up with AM. I'm happy to pay for tutorials but only legitimate people nothing scammy and I'm willing to put time amd effort into this with no desire to cut any corners. This way I figure I'm taking responsibility to seek my own income on my terms amd not have to give 50 plus hours of my week to another company. 

I'd be grateful of any serious advisors that could respond to me on here, who will read this and have been where I am. Which is tired of the grind, knowing there is a better life balance out there, that you've flogged yourself for 20 years only to be in the same place as you were financially all that time ago and you can't see a way forward in the rat race. Money is not the primary motivator, it is a desire to make a positive difference to others, create more time to do the things that serve me and my community and get back my time which is so important for us all.

So, to those out there who this resonates with, from a 41 year old male that's got some fire in them. What practical steps and considerations would you advise to start up my own ventures and what options are out there that would be profitable, challenging, rewarding and enjoyable?

I am seeking advice on how to keep my employment at tesla yet move into a more comfortable role better suited,"Hello, I hope there is someone here who can help me for I am in desperate need. I work for tesla as a Facilities maintenance technician. I love the company and my benefits. I want to stay working in this plant. For context most of my experience is in trades such as , machining, welding and certificated equipment drive such as forklift and scissors lifts amoug others. Most of that experience is in welding and forklift driving. I struggled early on after trade school for welding working in too fast pace environments and finding places will yo give me the teachings I need to gain proper experience here in NY. End up being tossed aside as soon as they thought I could not keep up. Whether there was proper time to give me a chance to make that decision. I feel can be argued either way. Regardless, I was able to pass any weld test and get stae certificated to work on government projects. I just could not keep up in a fast pace environment. In the end I ended up in this new position at telsa. My new role is non-trade specific. Most of my day to day is beyond outside my experience. However I have  shown worth and an ability to learn in a environment friendly for teaching others. Yet this position is a high critical role that is an expense to the company so I need to consistently show worth and handle contast high importance responsibility. I can work under pressure, yet this is a constant pressure and stress that I struggle with. Maybe other techs have had the same concerns and to my knowledge some have left to other departments for the same reason. There has also been alot of role changes and movement in personel in the department adding more strain on everyone. Since employment I slowly have started to fall behind, due to this I feel my employment my be in jeopardy. I do not feel I am fit for this this department. There are other open positions in the plant such as warehouse work and welding I am more suited for. I have seen the environments for these department and feel I would succeed greatly in them. However, due to falling behind I have some disciplinary marks on my record which will fall off at the end of the year the biggest one being September. I am making my best attempts to make it that far. Furthermore my department is short staffed. How do I approach applying to these positions? Without making it seem like working here is too much or I am unfit. Experience wise I have 2 years welding and 3 years forklift certificated. These positions are also a set down in pay rate. Do I talk to HR or my manager about somehow being transferred? Any advice to keep my job but to be put into a more fitting job without making it seem i can work here entirely?

1lhib5a,How long should I stay as an administrator?,"I've had a tough couple of years for jobs. I left a role I had been in for 1.5 years to do my masters degree and hopefully start a new career. I did my masters, and quickly realised that the job market is cooked and that it was going to be insanely difficult to find a job in that industry. I pivoted to looking for roles that were tangentially related to my area of study. 

Turns out it was insanely difficult to get a job full stop. I applied to hundreds of roles in different industries, including pubs and retail. Nothing. 


I eventually found a contract role doing something similar to my previous job. They ended up really screwing me over with hours, only giving me 15 hours of work a week while they kept promising more soon. I did this for three months before quitting because it was a toxic environment and I saw no end in sight. 

I then did three months in a temp role that I hoped would turn into a permanent one (it didn't). 

Another few months of job hunting and I was truly losing my mind. My confidence and self-esteem were shot and I was genuinely considering moving back to my home country. Then, I finally got a job offer as an administrator, and that's the role I'm still in now.

It's been about four months, and while I enjoy the role and the team, the joy of not being unemployed has worn off and I'm left worrying about my future. I'm thirty years old doing a job that doesn't even require a degree. Don't get me wrong, I'm lucky to have a job at all and being an administrator in a busy department is a difficult job, it's not the job I studied for, or even really related to it in any way. I'm also not thrilled with some of the stuff my company does, and feel a bit weird about contributing to a company that I don't share that many values with. 

So, all that aside, I'm not sure what to do. I'm desperate to start looking for another role, to try and get my career back on track. I'm also aware that it won't look good on my CV to be constantly job hopping. Right now I'm thinking it would be best to stick this one out for a year before looking to move, but I can't help thinking that I'll be 31 at that point, and it will have been three years since I did my masters. Will I even have a chance of getting a job in that field?

Apologies if I sound whiny, feel free to roast me in the comments (but also give advice pls)

1lhhn5a,"Chemistry vs Accountancy vs MedTech/Nursing – Which One is More Practical, Sustainable, and Secure for the Future?","Hi everyone! I’m from the Philippines and I’m currently at a crossroad trying to choose the right college course and long-term career path. I’m torn between **Chemistry**, **Accountancy**, and recently considering **Medical Technology (MedTech)** or **Nursing** as well.

I’m not just looking at what I’m good at or interested in anymore — I really want to make a smart, **sustainable** choice that will help me **support my family**, build a **stable future**, and hopefully live a balanced life. So I’m looking for advice based on:

1. **Job security and demand** – both in the Philippines and abroad
2. Whether it **pays decently enough** to raise a family and eventually give back to my parents
3. **Sustainability and long-term stability** of the profession
4. **Opportunities for career growth, promotions, or specialization**
5. The typical **work environment, lifestyle, and work-life balance**
6. Chances of **working abroad, shifting fields**, or pursuing further studies

**For context:**

For context, I enjoy both science (especially research in high school) and math (back in elementary). However, I didn’t come from an ABM track, so accountancy would be a bit of a learning curve for me. On the other hand, I know Chemistry can be very rewarding but may take more years (especially if I pursue research or academia), and I’m not sure about the salary scale or job availability for chem majors in the Philippines or abroad.I also see a lot of people going into MedTech and Nursing for opportunities abroad — and I’m wondering if **that might be a more secure or practical route**, even if it’s not where I originally imagined myself.

I come from a working-class background, so **financial stability is a big factor**. I also dream of helping my family, maybe building a business in the future, traveling, and living a balanced life—not just surviving paycheck to paycheck.

If anyone here is in the field (or has switched between the two), I’d deeply appreciate any insights about:

* Your experience in either field
* Pros and cons I might not be seeing
* Realistic salary expectations
* Work-life balance
* Which one you feel has more future-proof opportunities

* Do Chem graduates really need a master’s or PhD to earn well?  
* Is the stress level in accountancy as intense as people say (especially during board season or tax season)?  
* Is it possible to shift from Chemistry to Med or Law later? Or from Accountancy to business or law?

However, now I am just considering between chemistry and accountancy as both have so many job opportunities and field that I can work with.

1lhhh8f,Should I leave my current role for a 36.29% salary increase for a temporary role?,"I’ve been on the job hunt for the last couple of months, and finally managed to get an offer, but as a 6 month contract. 

The new role is with a well known financial company and would be a no brainer for me, if it wasn’t temporary. There is a possibility to be brought on full time but I feel that is something that is said quite often.

This pay bump would bring in an additional $1500 a month for me, which may not seem like a lot but I would finally be able to breathe. 

I’ve only been at my current role for a year. It is within the non profit space but solid and I have gained favor with senior leadership but I am burnt out. There is a lot of chatter about me going around and possible promotions but it seems to happen slow there. (The people in the high paying roles have been there 10+ years) 

I’m still fairly early in my career, and this role would be an instant resume booster for more opportunities. 

I’m leaning more towards going for it, but any advice or any similar experience would be helpful. ",z0diacinvestor,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1750574619,2025-06-22 06:43:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lhhh8f/should_i_leave_my_current_role_for_a_3629_salary/,6,2025

First post here. I’m 17, been asking ChatGPT for help but want real advice from people.

What are some good career paths if I want:

* Global mobility (Paris, London, Shanghai, Copenhagen)
* Decent pay

I ruled out :

* CS/engineering (feels soulless)
* Medicine (meh)
* UX design/marketing/journalism (oversaturated)

1lheqi8,40 LPA Offer from Middle East Startup via 3rd Party HR vs 30 LPA from Singapore-Based Startup with Indian Setup,"Hi folks,

I’m at a decision point between two job offers and would really appreciate some guidance — especially from those who’ve worked in international startup setups.

Offer 1: From a Middle East-based early-stage unicorn startup offering 40 LPA for a Senior Engineer role.
However, they don’t have a legal entity in India, so employment will be handled via a third-party Indian HR agency.
My concerns:

Stability & Legitimacy: How dependable are third-party HR setups in such cases? What risks should I be aware of in the offer letter or employment terms?

Legal/Compliance Issues: Could this affect my taxation, PF contributions, insurance, or financial planning here in India?

Work Culture & Time Zone: No real visibility into their internal team dynamics. Anyone worked remotely for Middle East-based startups? How is the collaboration, work-life balance, and IST alignment?

Offer 2: From a Singapore-based early-stage startup with a proper legal and operational setup in India, offering 30 LPA for a Mid Engineer role.
I personally know people here, and the culture, HR processes, and work environment are said to be quite positive and reliable.

So the trade-off is:

A higher-risk, high-reward offer with compensation at 40 LPA and seniority — but with structural and compliance uncertainties,

Versus a lower-risk, slightly lower-pay (30 LPA) offer with a known good culture and full legal clarity in India.

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you’ve had to choose between similar kinds of offers. Any red flags I should not miss?

I’ve taught in schools, but the last couple of years or so I’ve been teaching remotely. I think I’m just tired of being a teacher. The career of education I feel just sucks. In the online world, the money is better and you do less work. In an actual school you make less (though at least it’s a guaranteed salary), and do more work.

Anyway, what other jobs can I do aside from being a teacher? I’ve got a lot of transferable skills, but have no idea where to start.

1lhd60q,"Why I Stopped Making Excuses About ""Hard""","I used to think life was tough until I got my first real job. Then I thought the 9-5 grind was the worst thing ever until I started my own thing. Now I get it - they're all hard, but in completely different ways.

Your regular day-to-day stuff? Sure, it's hard. Bills, relationships, staying healthy, dealing with random life curveballs. But it's predictable hard. You know what's coming.

The 9-5 world cranks up the difficulty. Now you've got deadlines breathing down your neck, bosses who don't get it, coworkers who drive you crazy, and that soul-crushing feeling of building someone else's dream while yours collects dust. At least you get a steady paycheck though.

Then there's business. Holy crap. This is where things get real. Every decision is on you. No safety net, no guaranteed income, no one to blame when things go sideways. You're basically signing up to get punched in the face repeatedly while somehow staying optimistic enough to keep swinging back.

But here's what I figured out - the hardest path usually builds the strongest version of yourself. The 9-5 teaches you to follow rules. Business teaches you to make your own.

So yeah, pick your hard. Just make sure it's the kind that actually gets you somewhere.

1lh9jt6,What I learned from being completely lost in my career,"I’ve noticed that a lot of people here feel lost or stuck in their career.

Just wanted to say - I’ve been there.

I studied engineering because it felt “safe” but I knew early on it wasn’t for me. I’ve experimented with different companies/startups, tried different paths, felt the pressure to make it all make sense. I’ve had days where I felt like I was behind in life, doubting my value, wondering if I’d ever figure it out.

If that’s where you are right now, please hear this:

You’re not broken. Your path isn’t supposed to look linear and your past experiences aren’t a waste, they’re actually clues.

What helped me most was stepping back and slowing down. Not to find “the perfect career” but just to understand myself better. Here’s the simple framework I followed:

**1. Reflect**

Write or talk out loud about your past experiences. What energized you? What drained you? What did you avoid? No edits allowed. Just do a braindump and then analyze.

**2. Discover**

Look for patterns. What values or themes keep showing up? What types of work or people spark your curiosity? You don’t need to commit at this point, you're just exploring, be extra curious.

**3. Act**

Instead of a big leap, try a small move: talk to someone in a new field, take a short course, attend an event in your desired industry or even shadow a friend. One experiment leads to the next.

This loop of **reflect → discover → act** gave me back a sense of control.

I didn't get instant answers, but finally, real direction.

It allowed me to more from engineering -> business analysis (banking & tech) -> tech consulting (many industries) -> product (SaaS) -> startups in wellbeing (fitness, nutrition) -> now building in AI & education.

Just wanted to say, wherever you are right now, keep going.

You’re not late. You’re just early in figuring it out. And really the most important thing is to actually notice that you need a change. It's always the first step the hardest.

I know so many people who are miserable because of their job or career path, complain about it but don't do anything to change it. I'd argue that's 99% of the population

Hi everyone, I'm really in need of some guidance. I’ve just completed a Bachelor’s degree in Conference Interpreting and Translation at the University of Bologna, focusing on German, Russian, and English (C1–C2 certified levels). I'm from Italy and currently live here. 

While I’m grateful to have strong language skills, I’m now realizing that without a technical or business specialization, career options feel very limited, especially if I want something stable and decently paid.

I’m considering three possible paths to get back on track and build a real career. I’m also fully open to relocating abroad if that helps.

1. International Sales/Export
Start working now as an Export Assistant or Junior Sales Rep, and grow into roles like Export or Area Sales Manager, ideally in sectors like pharma or industrial manufacturing. I’d be open to doing a Master’s in International Trade or Business to help with this.

2. Finance, Wealth Management
Pursue a Master’s in Finance or Accounting (even if my degree isn’t in economics), and aim to enter wealth management, investment advisory, or compliance at mid-level firms or banks.

3. International Relations/Diplomacy
Enroll in a Master’s in International Affairs or Diplomacy, and look for roles in NGOs, EU institutions, or international organizations.

 I’m 23 and have a short experience working in a company as a language assistant for export and sales. But now I’m honestly overwhelmed and anxious about wasting time heading in the wrong direction.

Has anyone been through something similar? Do any of these paths sound viable from your experience? I would really appreciate any realistic advice or even examples from those working in these areas.

1lh7bdf,To Everyone in the Middle of Their Career: Let’s Talk.,"You’re not “just starting out,” and you’re not at the finish line either. You’re in that weird, in-between space where your LinkedIn looks polished, your calendar is always full… and yet sometimes you quietly wonder:  
*Is this it?*

Here’s the truth no one tells us:  
Mid-career is not a straight line. It’s a maze of decisions, invisible ceilings, pivot whispers, and the slow realization that *climbing* may not be the same as *growing*.

If that’s where you are — you’re not alone. Let’s talk real:

✨ **You’ve built something.** That deserves respect. The late nights, the compromises, the wins (loud and quiet). But maybe now you want more than building *for others*. Maybe you want to build something *of your own*.

 **You have clarity now.** Not all shiny things matter. Not all “titles” feel good. You’ve seen behind the curtain — and you’re wiser because of it.

 **Your value is not just what’s on your resume.** It’s in how you lead meetings with grace. How you mentor without a formal title. How you navigate chaos calmly. That’s what the next generation needs to see.

**You don’t have to reinvent everything.** But maybe you get to *reclaim* some parts you’ve buried: creativity, flexibility, purpose, joy. They still matter. They *should* still fit.

So here’s your permission slip:  
You can want more — or less.  
You can pivot, pause, or go deeper.  
You can stay — or you can stretch.

Just don’t go numb in a career that no longer feels alive.

You’re not behind. You’re in the middle.  
And the middle is where the magic often begins.

 Thinking about shifting gears or finding your next “right thing”? Let’s share stories. There’s power in the middle ground.",Frostyd88,1,0.6000000238418579,1,1750541289,2025-06-21 21:28:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lh7bdf/to_everyone_in_the_middle_of_their_career_lets/,6,2025
1lh759t,"Offered a vague ""career growth"" opportunity — is it actually a downgrade?","Hi all,
I work as a technician in an entertainment company. The work can be delicate, but most days it’s light — almost like a monitoring/surveillance role. I work rotating shifts (nights, morning, midday, evenings), and earn around €1750–2200/month depending on holidays, shifts, and weekends. There's not much overtime, but in summer we often work 6 days a week. End of career colleagues in my department reach €2500–3000/month.

Recently, a senior manager approached me with a vague offer: a chance to follow a different career path — more responsibility, more stress, potentially taking work home (including unpaid calls), and significantly less pay. In exchange: 9-to-5 hours, free weekends, and theoretically faster/higher career progression. He framed it as a way to “escape the comfort zone,” and even hinted that I will one day replace someone in a currently vacant leadership position (I’d basically be acting as a less qualified stand-in for now). I’d also need to earn a university degree along the way.

At first, I was excited. But the more I think about it, the more doubts I have:

There’s no formal job title or description. Until I gain experience and qualifications, I’d be working in a ghost role.

The pay cut would be steep — I’d lose €400–700/month by giving up shifts and weekends, dropping me to a flat ~€1450/month. This would slowly improve with promotions, but…

Senior colleagues have turned down the same offer — and their version came with the full leadership role, full qualifications, full pay. Even then, they estimated they'd lose up to €12,000/year due to losing shift premiums. The higher your base pay, the bigger the hit when leaving shift work.
My current position has a pretty slow advancement path (long wait times to go up a step) and this new path would surely be faster, but a higher position for less pay seems kinda ehhhh...

So while I like the type of work being proposed, and I’m not against growing, I’m also not very ambitious — I mostly want better pay and long-term stability. That said, the idea of doing the exact same job for the next 30 years is a little depressing. The new path could lead to more stability down the line, but at a real cost now.  I'm also pretty scared of saying no and being punished for being a let down.

Is this kind of “stretch assignment” ever worth it? Or does it sound more like cheap labor dressed up as a leadership opportunity?
Will I regret turning it down — or regret taking it? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",Gabrbr,0,0.5,3,1750540811,2025-06-21 21:20:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lh759t/offered_a_vague_career_growth_opportunity_is_it/,6,2025

He suggested that I take finance and my brother and a lot of the people around me are suggesting that I take finance because it is more of a secure option and it has more opportunities in the future. But I like marketing a bit better. I am also interested in logical, mathematical stuff. So finance is not that bad for me. I can still do it and do all of my extra certifications and stuff that I want in digital marketing. So basically the things that I do outside of college are going to be the same, which is in content writing. Just my career would be different. And if I was in finance, I would most likely take up jobs in financial planning, wealth management, some sort of an analyst, or like some banking roles as well. And there are many government exams also for banking, so I might try there as well. So what do you think I should do? Is marketing really that messed up? What should I do? What specialization should I choose? I am okay with doing finance, but I am heavily leaning towards marketing. And I took science in my 11th and 12th and I really faced hell when I was in 11th and 12th, so I don't want to feel like an imposter again.
Please help. Thank you!

1lh6d0u,"I feel like a failure in my life, need help in correcting it.","Hello everyone,


I'm from Telangana, India, 24(f) years, completed my intermediate in MPC(Maths, Physics & Chemistry) with 85.3% and when I have joined my engineering college and took branch as EEE(Electrical and Electronics Engineering) due to parents pressure and got 8 CGPA in 1st semester and it got dropped to 7.5 CGPA as lockdown has started and I haven't attended any online classes. 

In my second year, my father's health detoriated and he was admitted in hospital and as he was the sole bread winner in my family, we did not have enough money to run the house anymore and it was also at the locked down time. So, I have tried getting an WFH job and I got an job as customer service agent for 15K per month and I have joined it(it was in the year 2022). And I'm currently still working in that position while still taking care of my family as I have stopped giving my semester exams and I have 21 backlogs remaining to complete my undergraduate degree.

I have also stopped going outside and meeting my friends and never went to college. Now when I have reconnected with my school friends recently I got to know he working as an SDE with 27 LPA. My friend reminded me of our school time, where my friend used to score less than me in exams as I was a topper in my school time. Now my friend is asking me to learn coding and leave that customer service agent job and get a good software job.

I don't know if I can start learning coding now and crack any software jobs as I have 21 backlogs in my engineering time. 

Can anyone experienced or the one who went through the same guide me as how I can start a new life? As even I do not want to stay in this position any longer. I do feel like a failure and will stay like this for my entire life.

As I do not know anyone in this field I have searched google and in AI's for help and I have got a roadmap on how to crack product based companies jobs. 

First is to learn a programming language like C++, Java or Python, then we need to learn Data Structures and Algorithms and start practicing in Leetcode.
Do some projects in web development/app development or in any other niche.

Learn System Design, OS, Computer Networks and DBMS. Now, tailor our resume based on the company which you are trying to apply and start applying.

I don't know if this the correct path or not. But can anyone who has experienced the same can guide me or just tell me if this path is correct or not.

If I can crack software jobs with 21 backlogs or just mention my education qualification as Intermediate only.

I only just need guidance on what to do in my life to escape from my current self 

Any help will be wonderful.

Thank you!

1lh69tk,Having a real hard time finding a career path here.,"I’m in my 20s. I’ve tried out more jobs than most people will have worked in a life time, legitimately over 20 jobs within a variety of sectors. Skilled trades, administrative, customer service…

I don’t know what I want to do, I more so only know what I want it to provide. Which seems pretty common, but need to know whatever it is that’s going to get me there so it can be a reality. 

Skills wise I am in the middle of technical & communicative. Meaning I can comprehend & or learn some pretty technical skills, but not to the level of an engineer. And I’m social, yet hate sales. It’s pretty hard as I seem to be just not fitting into any of these roles. I do not like completely physical jobs, no more trades work for me. And I’m not technically inclined enough to do business analytics day in & out.

Usually I word all this stuff in a more positive tone, but I think this way is more realistic. I do not want to be a loser who just dreamt of something grand. I want to actually have the nice things I dream of.

1lh5nsd,"23 y/o, BSc in CS to Finance (EU/UK) - which path should I take? One of the toughest decisions in my life.","I am 23 years old and I just finished my BSc in Computer Science at a solid public university in Western Europe in March of this year, and now I want to pursue a career in finance. However, I am unsure which path to take.

**More of my background:**

1. At the end of May this year, I completed an 6-month internship with a Big 4 firm and received a full-time job offer. It was in Financial Services IT Audit, which I honestly found only mildly interesting. However, I did get to audit some highly decorated investment banks and learn a bit about trading systems and IFRS. I received a full-time offer, but I couldn't imagine my butt off for over five years before reaching an acceptable salary level.
2. Previously, I worked part-time for a large European software company for 1.5 years, across many departments (especially enjoyed data-related roles there).
3. I also minored in Economics, if that's worth anything.

**My original plan was:**

In general, I would like to work at the intersection of data-related roles, such as data analysis, data processing, building pipelines, training and optimising models, ***and*** trading. I am specifically interested in quant-developer roles, but I am also open to more broadly risk-related or data roles.

**There are two (or possibly three) options on the table:**

My original plan was to go to the US and apply for master's programmes at good state universities such as UMich, Georgia and Berkeley, and then use the post-graduate visa to work there. However, I am not happy with the current political situation in the US, particularly with regard to international students. I also missed the very early deadlines due to issues with ETS. I am therefore currently figuring out my best options:

***1. Imperial College London: MSc Financial Technology***  
This course is in their business school, which, as I know, isn't as highly regarded as their STEM courses. However, it is a conversion course for people with an engineering or computer science background and includes some decent modules such as: Financial Econometrics in [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/), Computational Finance with C++, Mathematics for Finance, Big Data in Finance I and Investments and Portfolio Management. These modules could help me break into the finance sector. The name and networking opportunities in London could also be valuable.

Downsides: Some people consider the course to be too unquantitative to really help you get a good job, and the insane $60,000 tuition fees plus London living costs for one year might not be worth it. I personally find some of the modules a bit underwhelming as they seem to be introductory programming courses, which is laughable for a computer science undergraduate.

Now you might ask why I haven't applied for better courses? I did. For example, I applied for the RMFE at Imperial College London, but was considered for this particular course instead by the admissions team. I also considered the Computational Finance course at UCL. However, many programme directors and professors told me that my Computer Science programme was inadequate for such courses because I didn't take the ""hardcore"" mathematics courses. In fact, the four maths modules specifically designed for computer scientists, including analysis and statistics, involve proofs and so on and I find them sufficient, but that's another topic...

**2. KULeuven in Belgium: MEng Computer Science (2-year course)**  
They offer the option to focus on AI/ML

My professor, who has 40 years of academic experience, recommended this university in particular as a decent option in Europe, alongside TUM. As an EU citizen (I am Irish too), I would benefit greatly from the reduced tuition fees. It is also one of the top 50 universities in the world for computer science, and I could take advantage of their exchange programme to spend one or two semesters at NYU, Georgia Tech, UMich or McGill. Spending two years there would also give me more opportunities to build a finance-related portfolio and undertake summer internships.

However, it is not finance-related, which could cause problems when trying to get a job in finance. On the other hand, it could be helpful if you wanted to work elsewhere as a backup. I could also do a PhD afterwards if I wanted to, which I think would be more difficult with the Imperial degree.

**3. Gap year/direct full-time**  
I'm not sure if that's a good option. I lost some time and many good roles (even postgraduate programmes) now require a master's degree. I have some connections at one of the Big 4 firm, I worked for, but I imagine it will be difficult to get a full-time risk-related/quant role there with my background. But I want to mention it anyway.

What would you do in my situation? This is one of the toughest life decisions I'm ever going to make, and I feel very overwhelmed. I have already done my own research, of course, but I would love to hear your opinions.",bybeso,1,1.0,0,1750536705,2025-06-21 20:11:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lh5nsd/23_yo_bsc_in_cs_to_finance_euuk_which_path_should/,6,2025

1lh3ihw,Demoted After Store Closure — Feeling Undervalued and Considering Leaving,"
Hey everyone,

I’m looking for some advice or even just to vent a little.

I’ve been with my company for over three years, working my way up to Store Manager. Recently, my store location was closed, and I was told I was at risk of redundancy — with only two weeks' notice. It was a stressful time, and although I was gutted, I accepted a role at another store to avoid being out of work. The catch? It came with a significant pay cut, and the role was a step down to Sales Associate.

During that process, HR kept reassuring me that there would be plenty of new opportunities in the future. That’s the only reason I stuck around.

Fast forward a bit — the Assistant Manager at the new store resigned, and I thought maybe that would be my shot to work my way back up. But to my surprise, the company hired someone externally without even posting the job online. I didn’t even get a chance to apply. Now I’ll be taking orders from someone who’s been in the company less time than I have — and I’ve already taken a huge step down as it is.

It honestly feels like a slap in the face. I’ve gone from running a store to being sidelined, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. I’ve been loyal, flexible, and did what I thought was right in a tough situation — and now I’m feeling completely undervalued and disrespected.

I’m seriously considering just leaving. It’s draining and demoralising at this point.

Has anyone been in a similar position? How did you handle it? Would love any advice or thoughts on how to move forward.

1lh1dqh,Is it realistic to switch from a government job to freelancing in fintech data analytics? Need advice from people who've made similar moves,"Hi (30M India)
I’m here to get some genuine advice from people who’ve either made a similar transition or have experience in freelancing, data analytics, or fintech.

I’m a BTech graduate from the 2016 batch. From 2016 to 2018, I worked at a US-based MNC, which gave me solid corporate exposure. Since 2018, I’ve been working in the Indian government sector, handling financial audits, balance sheet reviews, and compliance checks for institutions.

While the job is stable, I’ve never felt truly satisfied. My first posting was in a remote tribal region with poor infrastructure and no internet. The health anxiety I experienced there was intense. It took multiple personal requests to political leaders just to get a transfer closer to home. Recently, I’ve again been posted to a location nine hours away from my family, while all my batchmates remain in home postings due to stronger political backing. The repeated instability has pushed me to seriously reconsider my path.

Since March 2024, I’ve been upskilling with a focus on data and tech. I’ve learned Tableau, Power BI, SQL, Python, and the basics of machine learning. Now, I’m strongly considering transitioning into freelancing in the fintech data analytics space — helping clients with financial dashboards, automation, and analysis projects.

I currently earn around ₹60,000 per month. I’m financially stable, with decent savings, and my wife also earns well. So I don’t have any immediate financial pressure. I’m not quitting impulsively, but I want to explore whether a freelance path could be realistic for me in the near future. Even earning ₹40,000 to ₹50,000 per month remotely with flexibility and peace of mind would feel like a win.

Here’s what I’d love advice on:

How realistic is it to build a career in freelance fintech data analytics with my kind of background

What kind of projects, clients, or niches should I focus on as a beginner

Should I build a portfolio on platforms like Kaggle, GitHub, or Medium

What are some common mistakes first-time freelancers from non-tech backgrounds make

Is it better to start freelancing part-time while keeping my current job, or prepare and go all in when confident


Any thoughts, suggestions, or shared experiences would be deeply appreciated. I’ve seen others make bold transitions, and I just want to make sure I move forward with clarity rather than frustration.

Growing up, I always had a thing. Always. At every stage, I knew what I liked, what I was good at, what made me excited. But now that I’m actually supposed to know what I want to do with my life? It’s like my passion just disappeared without leaving a note.
Some context:
•I hate coding. Not because I suck at it, but because it just drains me. I can’t keep solving logic puzzles that make me feel like a human calculator.
•I get bored super easily. Repetition is my enemy.
•I want to wake up excited about the day, not dreading another loop of the same thing.
But when I like something? I go all in. I obsess. I’ll lose sleep over it, in a good way.
•I’ve tried content creation, marketing, coding, cybersecurity, tech in general… some of it I enjoyed, some of it felt meh. But I haven’t had that “yes, THIS is it” moment yet.
So if you’re doing something exciting, creative, unpredictable (but not in a burnout way lol), or if you've felt like this and figured it out, please share your story. Tell me how you got there.
I’m not looking for a miracle answer. Just some real human advice. A direction. A bit of hope.
Thanks in advance. My ears (and existential crisis) are wide open. 🫠",cats_are_cutie,6,0.8100000023841858,9,1750522120,2025-06-21 16:08:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lh03qn/i_feel_lost/,6,2025

1lgzmie,New job vs current job - what would you do?,"Hello all! 

Long read - would love your input, TLDR at bottom 

My current organization is a govt-affiliated company that is often going through re-orgs. I’ve been there almost 6 years now with 3 new managers over the years due to several issues but mainly them not jelling well with their own bosses. I’ve kept my head down and done my work.

Anyway back to my current company, they’re going through some cuts now. All divisions are going thru it now and my division is no different. I accidentally saw some paperwork and my name isn’t on the chopping block (at least for now) but you never know I guess 

Separately, a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn for another role, very similar organization, similar role. Pros and cons below 

Current job:
- tenure
- DB pension (work 30 years, get pension for life) 
- my boss seems to like me
- most recent performance evaluation had be placed above average 
- enjoy work, it’s easy
- $75k CAD salary with 3 weeks vacation 
- hybrid with 1-2 days in office 
- boss very understanding of personal life 
- boss seems like he’s BFF with the chief of division so perhaps has some sway? But at the end of day, business decisions abt layoffs or restructuring supersede these relationships anyway 
- CONS - long commute (1.5 hrs each way but thru a work subsidy it’s free), constant reorgs and instability at times which stresses me out; new reorg results are coming in Aug) 

Potential job:
- different industry but same role 
- pension (very similar to defined benefit) 
- work seems interesting, same role
- new comp - $84K CAD plus 4 weeks vacation (salary is top of band) 
- commute is 40 mins driving each way but it’s a straight shot on the highway 
- CONS: 2.5-3 days in office + navigating personal health concerns noted below 

My main issue is I’m currently going through fertility treatments (one of which recently failed). I’m currently off work for a week due to a TW…. Miscarriage. I’ve kept my boss updated and he even sent a flower bouquet and get well soon note. I immediately cried 

Well- The recruiter called me and said the new place wants to offer me the job. I said I’m looking forward to reviewing the offer which will come next week. I just feel the timing of this is terrible, I’m in a bad mental state and I know the new role seems good for me but I’m so conflicted. Joining a new organization and immediately letting them know that I’ll need XYZ time off due to medical needs isn’t a good look in my opinion.. my husband thinks otherwise and said to let the new place know that due to some health related needs, you’ll need to take a few hours off here and there. TBH I know the salary is a negligible increase but the commute being 1/2 off is good. The new leaders seem down to earth based on my convo with them and the main thing is stability and understanding in my current health situation 

Thanks in advance for your input/advice. 

How should I navigate this? Would you take the new role for more stability or would you stay in your current role given the health concerns? What would you do? 

TLDR - current company is unstable and going through reorgs, new job looks promising but currently going through fertility treatments so need help deciding what’s best and how to navigate situation ",rustymcrustycat,1,1.0,0,1750520870,2025-06-21 15:47:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lgzmie/new_job_vs_current_job_what_would_you_do/,6,2025

1lgzb5p,Dilemma Switching Jobs,"Hello I am a 22f currently working as a car dealership receptionist. I've got a bachelor degree in psychology and throughout all my schooling i've worked within car dealerships as a receptionist and a technology specialist. I love the dealership environment. I am currently working at a dealership where I love my manager and all my coworkers. I actually look forward to going in some days just bc i've bonded so well with the people I work with. However, I am a receptionist and for the most part have nothing to do at the desk. I spend 7-9 hours a day just trying to pass the time and look busy. I get off late at 8pm every day and don't get to see my husband for more than 1- 2 hours a day. Most of my day is spent doing nothing. Its getting old. I recently got offered a job as a service advisor at a different dealership. I like the idea of a fast paced job but i know it is the most stressful job at any dealership. I speak to the service manager at my dealership frequently and he's always stressed but manages it well. The service advisors there have a friendship like no other due to the trauma lol. I am debating taking the new job or staying where I am. The dilemma I have is whether to leave a job where I love the people I work with, work 37.5 hours a week but stay late and am bored or work for the new dealer where I know no one and work 50 hour weeks but get off at 5pm every day being able to see my husband more even if I work EVERY Saturday til 4. Currently I work every other saturday and work til 6 on Saturdays I work. I also have off every other Tuesday. This job is Mon-Saturday 7-5pm and Sat 6-4pm. This is a lot of hours but I will get paid close to 6 figures in the position and have more time in the evenings with my husband during the day.  We aren't worried about money and I don't need a high paying position as he makes great money as a software engineer. The plus of the current dealership is my coworkers and low hours during the week. The plus of the new one is getting off at a time where I can actually see my husband more every day, make a lot of money, and being more involved. The negatives of this current job is late hours and boredom. The negatives of the new job is high stress, not knowing new coworkers, and 50 hour work week. 

TLDR:
I don't know if I should take a 80k-100k paying job that would allow me to see my husband more every day but work 50 hour weeks with higher stress and new people, or stay in my low stress but boring job with people I like working 37-40 hours and make 30k a year rarely seeing my husband during the week.

1lgxxhy,"If you took a long career gap, why and how is your career and life now? Based in the USA.","I worked 9 years in tech industry, 7 years in IT and 2 years in software development. 7 of the 9 years I was going to school as well. I got my bachelors and masters with no student debt. I reached my goal of making 6 figures by mid 20s. I got super burnt out and decided to take a gap year to travel. 

What was supposed to a gap year turned to 6 years and counting still lol. After the gap year, covid happened. I decided I was not ready to return to the tech industry, so I have been working seasonal jobs and low paying jobs to live in the mountains or tourist destinations and traveling. Last year I turned down an IT job at my ski resort because I was not ready and wanted to continue ski patrolling. I was applying for jobs and doing interviews but I stopped once I got my first offer which I turned down. I have built a website for a non profit and am currently managing their website which I can say is freelance work and am working as a part time software developer intern for my friend’s company. I am not sure if these recent work will do much on my resume given my gap.

I am approaching my mid 30s soon. Lately I have been thinking “what is next?” or “how do I want my future to look like?”. I know the tech industry is not good right now from what I heard and read and I know it would be a challenge for me to get a job with the job market and the gap in my resume.

1lgxjjw,Should I stay if they counter offer?,"So I've posted about this before but my circumstances are evolving. Long story short: I have worked at this company for 18 years, 7 years as head of a department and loved it there. A few months ago, my boss's new boss started targeting me for reasons I still don't understand. He held some meetings where he called me incompetent and unprofessional (without providing a lot of evidence) and encouraged me to quit. The boss's boss, we'll call him G, doesn't even work in our office (he's in another country) and we barely ever see him. But we had two meetings where he invited HR and his boss, H, and the two of them berated me. My boss, Q, was not even invited. They told me ""if you took a sabbatical for six months and disappeared, no one would even notice.""

I work incredibly hard at this job: weekends, nights. I built software for other teams that the whole company relies upon. I have so many friends there. This was incredibly hurtful and it came only a few months after I had a major family medical emergency: my wife had a stroke.

Then G went on vacation and got busy doing other things for two months and I thought I was ok. My actual line manager boss was telling me every week how well I was doing. And my department usually beats KPIs.

Then, two weeks ago, I got called into another meeting with G, H and a lady from HR. They said ""we've been watching you and your performance is unacceptable (no explanation given) and so we need new leadership right away. you can't continue in this job. Then they paused for a minute and said ""but we're offering you a new job reporting to your replacement and doing the things you are good at"" and they offered to pay me 33% less. I have a family to feed; I accepted the demotion, but I'm having a hard time concentrating on work and I'm humiliated.

I immediately started sending out resumes and -- good news -- I got a response from another company. The job there is a little different; it's not what I'm used to and seems like it might be less ""fun."" But I interviewed three times with this other company and they seem pretty nice. They would pay about 8% more than I'm earning after the demotion and, when you take into account switching health insurances, it feels like a wash. They just checked my references so I think Company B may make me an offer this coming week.

I know my current company, company A, and they need me for some projects I'm working on right now that are urgent. They might well offer me $10K or $20K more than company B in order to keep me there. It's a devil I know; I have a lot of friends there and I like most of the work I do. But after the abusive way they demoted me, it seems like the smart move would be to leave even if I might extract more money from them to stay.

I was talking to a former boss who no longer works there who said ""emotions fade, but bills have to be paid."" OTOH, I was talking to my wife who said ""they targeted you. You can't trust that, even if they give you a raise now, they won't terminate you a few months down the road.""

What do you think? I'm nervous about what the new job would hold as it's a completely different skillset for me.

1lgv13i,Completely mentally drained with colleagues and work mentality - moving jobs just for the sake and lower salary/role or waiting for a better opportunity,"So a big text coming up.

I work as a store manager for a diamond boutique and I’ve been here for 9 years. Got quickly promoted, grown the revenue from like $300k per month to $2MIL, basically went from a family boutique ( which still it is, it’s the owner - me - 4 colleagues ) to a huge successful place and growing.

But the mental health has been extremely on the decline. It’s a 10-7job, six days a week, with most useless people I’ve ever known and the boss who doesn’t take any actions to change. No responsibilities, no self respect and respect for others, no initiative - and this is a known thing. I’ve spoken to my boss numerous times and the last one was when I basically told him that stuff has to be fixed or I am out - it’s been two weeks and stuff is still same, simply because there is absolutely no consequences to any of the actions that are being not done/evaded etc etc.

I am mentally and physically drained (to the point I get home and just go sleep. I used to compete in cycling - gone, gym motivation - gone, going out with wifey - gone, and the last one really hurts me as I always want to be best husband to her and after job energy is definitely getting in that way, even in bed) as pretty much everything gets back to me and it ends up my responsibility (and the fact that I was brought up in the way to even do other people jobs is fucking me badly in this context). I do get a paid a bit more in general than others on the side, approximate $1,500 on top of our commission based salaries but that’s it - and as much as I think that’s fine, it takes a toll on me when I have to do crappy little jobs that others could’ve done when I am not there in 10min and then they pile up.  
  
As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve tried talking to the owner but he’s just “don’t argue with them - fix it please” and he definitely doesn’t want to deal with things in person so it’s just a WhatsApp/call type and we are all happy - according to him.

I am aware that he also thinks I’ll be staying here forever because after 9 years do have a good relationship and I really respect him as a boss, but not as someone who should run business, because I am simply expected do to everyone’s job and that’s on me.
I am completely aware that when I leave he will offer me whatever money I want - but it’s not about the money generally. 

I’ve started searching for jobs and of course as people know it’s a difficult time, but my question stands.

Should I just try changing a job to something random, that will pay less just to get out of this (and that can be either a good place or a godawful place aswell) or just focus on getting a better paying job where I can actually grow and not spend hours mindlessly scrolling and wasting brain power",Kaprilicious994,4,0.7599999904632568,3,1750507657,2025-06-21 12:07:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lgv13i/completely_mentally_drained_with_colleagues_and/,6,2025

I want to immegrate to an English speaking European country. 

I have recently started to learn to code, with basic web development. I started off with freeCodeCamp and currently learning the Django framework and building some projects as a hobby. I still know I'm a long way off from being employable in the field.

I want to be able to immigrate in the next 2 years. And I've been thinking would it be wise to switch?
I was preparing for my CFA L1 exam, but have now just discovered that I like to code. I wish I knew this sooner. 

Would it be possible to get hired with a decent pay as a software dev just by self learning? And my bigger question is, will I be able to immigrate as a self though software dev? Or would I be better of sticking to studying finance?

I prioritise work-life balance and want a decent pay. After all my financial goals are met (which is basic housing + a rainy day fund) I rather give more importance to work life balance than higher pay. I also value work from home a lot, which is rare in finance/accounting due to the nature of the work. As far as software dev goes, I think they have more work from home opportunities at least when compared to finance/accounting.

I'm so confused if I have to shift or not. A part of me really like the problem solving and the ability to use tech to find solutions, however if I fail, I'd lose a lot of prescious time as I'm having dependents and also looking to get married and start a family in the coming years.

1lgt0jx,Looking for advice,"Hey Reddit,

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Bangalore University. Here's the catch — despite being in a tech-related degree, I don’t have strong technical skills. My coding and math background is weak, and honestly, I’ve been more drawn to the bigger picture: tech, management, and how things work together.

Lately, I’ve been exploring AI/ML, Data Science, and Data Analytics for my Master’s — both out of curiosity and because I see strong job opportunities in these fields. But I’m stuck on a few things and would love some honest advice:

My Situation:
Non-technical BCA background, limited exposure to real coding or advanced math.

Interested in Masters in AI/ML, Masters n Data Science, and Masters in Data Analytics.

I'm open to studying abroad (considering Australia) but only if it gives me strong job prospects post-graduation.

Willing to learn hard and fast if I know I can realistically get into the field.

Long-term, I want a high-paying job with growth, ideally at the intersection of tech, business, and strategy.

My Questions:
Can someone from my background realistically make it in AI/ML or Data Science?

Is Data Analytics a safer bet considering my skill set? How is the job market for it?

If I go for a Master’s abroad (e.g. in Australia), which of these paths offer the best return on investment?

What preparation should I start now (I have about 3–6 months before applying)?

Has anyone here made a similar switch? Would love to hear your story.

I’m really looking for practical, experience-based insights — what worked, what didn’t, and what you wish you knew before diving in.

1lgs9j8,"Feeling Lost: CA Foundation in Sept, Messed Up CUET, Thinking of Switching to ACCA/FRM/CFA — Need Real Guidance ..??","

Hey, 
I’m at a bit of a crossroads and need some real, no-BS advice from people who’ve been there or at least have perspective.

Here’s my situation:

I’m currently preparing for the CA Foundation exam in September, but honestly, I’m not enjoying it. It feels overwhelming and a bit misaligned with what I actually want to do.

Because I focused so much on CA prep, I didn’t really care about CUET, and as expected, my options for college now aren’t great.

I’m from the commerce stream without maths, which I now realize limits a lot of quant-based options.

People around me are saying ACCA is “easier” than CA, but the deeper truth is... I’m not even that into accounting to begin with.

I’m looking for something less hectic than CA, but still with great pay and future prospects.

Options like FRM or CFA seem appealing, but I’m still unsure — especially since I don't have a top-tier college backing me up.


The big questions on my mind

Is it even worth doing CA or ACCA if I’m not really into accounting? Or will that just be misery for 5 years?

Does not getting into a great college now mean my career options are screwed?

Are FRM or CFA good options for someone from commerce-without-maths who likes logic and systems but doesn’t want to drown in stress?

Are there career paths in finance/business/**tech** that are less “toxic” than CA and still pay well?


Right now, I feel like I’ve just been following what everyone else is doing — without stopping to think about whether I actually want it. I don’t want to waste years in the wrong field just because it’s considered “safe.”

Would genuinely appreciate guidance from people who’ve pivoted, figured things out, or even failed and learned from it. I want to hear real stories, not just the typical “beta CA karlo” advice.

Thanks in advance

1lgqih1,"Family, aspiration or ambition?","Job A (Family) - Stable, highest pay, close to family, close to nature. Least professional growth, possible red flag with a team member during interview.

Job B (Ambition) - Higher title, lower pay, 3 hours away from family, prime city for opportunities, medium professional growth and very friendly team.

Job C (Aspiration) - Similar pay to B but potentially lower title (in negotiation), highest professional growth, adequately friendly team. Completely remote. 

Hoping to have more opinions and bounce thoughts with. Skip below if context is not needed.

I (36F) love my family, love travelling but also love my field (IT) and want to be good at what I do.

Initially, my choice is B, but am hesitant with the pay difference (~17k) and relocation to an unfamiliar state with higher living cost. However, the team displayed the best culture - most positive, transparent and optimistic towards my growth and (future) addition to the team.

The draw with A is completely family, environment and ngl, money. We are very close-knit. My weekends will be filled with nature plans and cute pets. The interview raised a red flag however, as the manager corrected me twice with outdated information. A silver lining(?) is that I corrected them back and though it wasn't acknowledged, I'm still offered the role.

Job C is completely remote, so I can fulfill my travel itch and meet with family without needing to uproot my and my partner's life. Expertise-wise, it is the most challenging and will really stretch my capabilities.

1lgpcc1,"Recently found about ""quiet quitting"" and realized I've been doing that for about 5 years now. My career may be already over.","28M. Been working as a customer service support representative in Japan for about 5 years.  This is the only job I've worked in my like so far as a full time employee (Worked some side gigs like dishwashing at local restaurant and independent contractor stuff at Appen and Telus International and such).



Right now my job is pretty stagnated. No task takes more than a day. Each phone call/email handling takes about 10 minutes or so. Full remote. No overtime, each day starts exactly at 09:00 and ends at 18:00, no work at holiday at all. A typical 9-5 (it's 9-6 but you get the idea). Pay is decent, but no bonuses (300k JPY per month, 240k JPY after tax subtractions). Housing fee is not paid by the company.   
I graduated from an univ but this job is not demanding at all and could be handled by a high schooler easily I'd imagine.  Lifetime employment is guaranteed so I can just keep doing this forever if I really want to. 



Recently amount of inquiries I have to handle each day is getting fewer, and having a lot of free time to think about what I do, and I'm starting to question it.  

Here's reasons why.  



First of all: No raise/promotion. Our team is subcontractors who takes orders from other company that outsources the CS job to us, not from our direct bosses. So there's no ladder to climb in the first place (Maybe there is, but I don't see it. I've never seen someone in my team got promoted past team leader and move to different section in 5 years).  In other words, there is no point in putting hard work into it.

  
Second: No improvement/skill equipping outside this job. There is no certification needed for this job. No visible achievement (like a product I've worked on or contract I worked to establish or anything) either since all I do is just handling customer inquiries.  I got better at this particular job, but I'm not sure if it is applicable to anything else.  

  


Third: Boredom. First 4 years I had a lot to learn about operation. I've made mistakes, I had to adapt to changes, I had to improve. That room is now gone. I do just the same things everyday. Although maybe this is mostly the case for any non-creative job, I'm starting to get sick of routine tasks that no one really cares about unless you mess it up.  

  
And lastly: A shift in my priority. I didn't care about those three points because I was focused on my free time. Video game, book reading, spending times with my friends, indulging in stupid meme video or an hour long video essay or whatever.  

Those things doesn't distract me as much as it used to and I can't shake a feeling of ""am I really satisfied with this"" ""am I okay with this"" ""isn't there something I should start doing"" whenever I try to engage in those activities.  

Then again, I'm just a 28 years old guy with unimpressive pay and skill, and without clear vision or goal in his vision. Simply lost instead of working towards something. So I don't even know if career switch is possible at this point, or if I really, really want to with bottom of my heart.

My friends recommend me to pursue side gigs that I can work online, then again; I still have a skill issue. All I know outside my job is playing video games and English and just tiny bit of video editing experience (that is in no way can be monetized unless some miracle happen and I get bazillion view for my shitty Youtube videos). No coding or programming or that kind of IT stuffs.  

I feel like not only my job but my life is stagnated. Any recommendation could you guys give to me?

Fast-forward to now… and they’ve just posted a job ad to hire a new Assistant Manager — in the store I’ve been holding down since transferring. No one talked to me about the role. No suggestion that I could be considered, no heads-up, nothing.

It just feels like a complete slap in the face. I’ve taken on extra responsibility, helped train new staff, and kept things running smoothly with barely any recognition. I don’t expect to be handed promotions for showing up — but to be completely overlooked like this, especially after taking a pay cut to help them out, really stings.

1lgnj3x,Any advice on engineering vs Medicine vs spirituality?,"Hi everyone. So I'm basically a potential student for two prestigious universities in China but I also have some other challenges.

I got accepted into the global talents for science and engineering program at Tsinghua University (top 20-30 University in the world and top 10 for STEM fields especially Engineering) and also to the MBBS program at Zhejiang University (top 60 university in the world and renowned especially for Engineering and Tech).


Now, for a little backstory:


Basically I am a South African (19yr) who studied Electrical and Electronic engineering in 2023 for one semester and then dropped out due to being unmotivated to study and having a hard time finding what I wanted to do with myself. (not to mention failing nearly every module I took) 

I originally wanted to take a gap year after high school (but couldn't due to reasons) and travel to India to the Isha Yoga Center. I found that I want to spend my time doing something meaningful for myself and the world through yoga and meditation.( If you research what a 'yogi' is and yogic/Hindu texts and lore, I aspire for that kind of capability and understanding of the inner mechanisms of life and the self.) 

Anyway, I dropped out and was about to go to India when I got the opportunity to study in China 1 week before I was about to book my flights to India. I was given a scholarship to study 4 years via a certain program but I was required to take a year (2024-2025) for some cultural emersion, global immersion, conferences and pre-university learning. Anyway, I decided to take that opportunity and delay my plans to go to India. It turns out that they poorly planned the program being that it was a new program for them and for the Chinese government (in terms of what the program is exactly and Visa related concerns) . So at the end, I just had two months of 'g12/final year high school' in Shanghai which is not what I signed up for even though the program was supposed to be 10 months. I spent most of my time at home doing nothing or trying to sort out things for my Visa related issues to China. 

I still plan on staying at the isha yoga center and exploring spirituality and mysticism after graduating or after 1-2 yrs of work experience. As such, I may end of never again touching what I would have studied. 

Due to me being a South African I can only stay in India for 3 months at a time. I also don't have any money or any profitable skills as of yet and feel as though I spent nearly two years after high school seemingly wasting my time ( but also not really wasting my time). I feel like returning to studying would make this experience and sacrifice for naught as I already dropped out in 2023 but for some dumb reasons (like needing money, Visas or having sacrificed time in China - 10months at home/in china ) and may never use these skills again, I am at a crossroad. 

All I know is that my spiritual growth does not need stop even if I'm not in the isha yoga center but by being there without having to worry about money or Visa related problems, I may get closer to my goals quicker but that is not necessarily a given. 


Now for the degree issue:


I am naturally more inclined towards medicine and people have told me I should study medicine because I am always telling them stuff about the human body, food, exercise, mental health but I just see myself as being more into Indian yoga (which touches upon overall wellbeing). 

I dropped out of Engineering because I did not have the energy for it, nor the commitment. Now I have the energy and am committed to being 100% involved in my studies ( should I decide to continue studying, in which case I pass the degree with good grades).

I would have a better time studying medicine since I am better at rote memorization, am good with people and communication  and would thrive in a chaotic environment like a hospital. Basically if I were to follow a 'normal life' with no aspirations for spiritual growth or with the benefits of studying engineering (I will get to that), I would 100% be a doctor.

Engineering however is more attractive to me. I am not very good at maths, physics and engineering, but I have the intelligence to be decent at it. My passions don't lie there exactly (but somehow I find everything that deals with life, existence, philosophy, spirituality, mysticism interesting and can will myself to find nearly anything interesting - as long as it is challenging and/or creatively stimulating). I like engineering because it teaches problem solving and I have alswyas been the type to want to be good at things that have always been my weakness or limitation. Plus, rote memorization does not really develop me to be more well rounded. It just makes me better at something I am already decent at. I also like that engineering is only 4 years, it is more in demand, has a higher starting salary (especially from Tsinghua) and it has more felxibilty and potential to move into other fields/professions/careers. (this is why I chose it in the first place). 

Regarding medicine, I don't want to spend 7-10 years on a profession I may one day give up but at the same time I understand that I should do what suits me best even if it's long. But this is also an opportunity because in South Africa It is very difficult for an Indian, male (me) to study medicine and I was not able to do it with my marks so I have a second chance here. It just means that I would be 2 years behind the med students in SA. 

But if I graduate from engineering at tsinghua, I would actually be ahead (on a global stage) of my peers who are already 2 years ahead of me in their studies. 


Now, onto the universities:


I prefer Zhejiang as a university but I like the prestige from tsinghua and benefits from graduating from the 'MITof Asia'. I'm at a point where I don't want to be in an academically pressurising environment like Tsinghua can be. I also prefer the campus, student life, air quality (a huge problem for me in Beijing ) and natural beauty and relative peacefulness of Hangzhou (the city where Zhejiang is located). 


The future:

I can basically work for a few years to help the mission of the Isha Yoga Center in India regardless of my profession. I may still or may not still, be able to pursue spirituallity or mysticism at the same pace. 

I also want to end my studying ASAP which is why medicine is a hard option for me (even though it would make my grandmother happy). 

I also have read many other subreddits of engineering vs Medicine and have typed to ChatGPT regarding this decision extensively. So I know the general arguments and points of interests in these discussions. My situation is just a little different ( actually a lot). 

If you have made it this far into what is essentially my life story up until this point, I thank you and urge you to respond regarding my dilemma.

Based on the logic of previous checks where they just gave me a flat rate to match what i was making with OT,  shouldn't i be making $2808? What im confused about is on my stub it shows im salary but also shows a breakdown of hours worked and says 86.67. my time clock shows i clocked in for 96 hours during the pay period. Am i just overthinking it or does it sound like im being underpaid?

1lgn9te,Engineering vs Medicine vs spirituality,"Hi everyone. So I'm basically a potential student for two prestigious universities in China but I also have some other challenges.

I got accepted into the global talents for science and engineering program at Tsinghua University (top 20-30 University in the world and top 10 for STEM fields especially Engineering) and also to the MBBS program at Zhejiang University (top 60 university in the world and renowned especially for Engineering and Tech).


Now, for a little backstory:


Basically I am a South African (19yr) who studied Electrical and Electronic engineering in 2023 for one semester and then dropped out due to being unmotivated to study and having a hard time finding what I wanted to do with myself. (not to mention failing nearly every module I took) 

I originally wanted to take a gap year after high school (but couldn't due to reasons) and travel to India to the Isha Yoga Center. I found that I want to spend my time doing something meaningful for myself and the world through yoga and meditation.( If you research what a 'yogi' is and yogic/Hindu texts and lore, I aspire for that kind of capability and understanding of the inner mechanisms of life and the self.) 

Anyway, I dropped out and was about to go to India when I got the opportunity to study in China 1 week before I was about to book my flights to India. I was given a scholarship to study 4 years via a certain program but I was required to take a year (2024-2025) for some cultural emersion, global immersion, conferences and pre-university learning. Anyway, I decided to take that opportunity and delay my plans to go to India. It turns out that they poorly planned the program being that it was a new program for them and for the Chinese government (in terms of what the program is exactly and Visa related concerns) . So at the end, I just had two months of 'g12/final year high school' in Shanghai which is not what I signed up for even though the program was supposed to be 10 months. I spent most of my time at home doing nothing or trying to sort out things for my Visa related issues to China. 

I still plan on staying at the isha yoga center and exploring spirituality and mysticism after graduating or after 1-2 yrs of work experience. As such, I may end of never again touching what I would have studied. 

Due to me being a South African I can only stay in India for 3 months at a time. I also don't have any money or any profitable skills as of yet and feel as though I spent nearly two years after high school seemingly wasting my time ( but also not really wasting my time). I feel like returning to studying would make this experience and sacrifice for naught as I already dropped out in 2023 but for some dumb reasons (like needing money, Visas or having sacrificed time in China - 10months at home/in china ) and may never use these skills again, I am at a crossroad. 

All I know is that my spiritual growth does not need stop even if I'm not in the isha yoga center but by being there without having to worry about money or Visa related problems, I may get closer to my goals quicker but that is not necessarily a given. 


Now for the degree issue:


I am naturally more inclined towards medicine and people have told me I should study medicine because I am always telling them stuff about the human body, food, exercise, mental health but I just see myself as being more into Indian yoga (which touches upon overall wellbeing). 

I dropped out of Engineering because I did not have the energy for it, nor the commitment. Now I have the energy and am committed to being 100% involved in my studies ( should I decide to continue studying, in which case I pass the degree with good grades).

I would have a better time studying medicine since I am better at rote memorization, am good with people and communication  and would thrive in a chaotic environment like a hospital. Basically if I were to follow a 'normal life' with no aspirations for spiritual growth or with the benefits of studying engineering (I will get to that), I would 100% be a doctor.

Engineering however is more attractive to me. I am not very good at maths, physics and engineering, but I have the intelligence to be decent at it. My passions don't lie there exactly (but somehow I find everything that deals with life, existence, philosophy, spirituality, mysticism interesting and can will myself to find nearly anything interesting - as long as it is challenging and/or creatively stimulating). I like engineering because it teaches problem solving and I have alswyas been the type to want to be good at things that have always been my weakness or limitation. Plus, rote memorization does not really develop me to be more well rounded. It just makes me better at something I am already decent at. I also like that engineering is only 4 years, it is more in demand, has a higher starting salary (especially from Tsinghua) and it has more felxibilty and potential to move into other fields/professions/careers. (this is why I chose it in the first place). 

Regarding medicine, I don't want to spend 7-10 years on a profession I may one day give up but at the same time I understand that I should do what suits me best even if it's long. But this is also an opportunity because in South Africa It is very difficult for an Indian, male (me) to study medicine and I was not able to do it with my marks so I have a second chance here. It just means that I would be 2 years behind the med students in SA. 

But if I graduate from engineering at tsinghua, I would actually be ahead (on a global stage) of my peers who are already 2 years ahead of me in their studies. 


Now, onto the universities:


I prefer Zhejiang as a university but I like the prestige from tsinghua and benefits from graduating from the 'MITof Asia'. I'm at a point where I don't want to be in an academically pressurising environment like Tsinghua can be. I also prefer the campus, student life, air quality (a huge problem for me in Beijing ) and natural beauty and relative peacefulness of Hangzhou (the city where Zhejiang is located). 


The future:

I can basically work for a few years to help the mission of the Isha Yoga Center in India regardless of my profession. I may still or may not still, be able to pursue spirituallity or mysticism at the same pace. 

I also want end my studying ASAP which is why I medicine is a hard option for me (even though it would make my grandmother happy). 

I also have read many other subreddits of engineering vs Medicine and have typed to ChatGPT regarding this decision extensively. So I know the general arguments and points of interests in these discussions. My situation is just a little different ( actually a lot). 

If you have made it this far into what is essentially my life story up until this point, I thank you and urge you to respond regarding my dilemma.

1lgmwwa,Do you guys keep interviewing at other places even after immediately securing a decent job?,"After several rounds of brutal interviews over a few months, I managed to finally secure a job offer as an Associate Platform support specialist which was a **huge** sigh of relief considering that my current role (internal help desk) requires me to relocate 3 hours away to a higher COL area by early August. Relocation is thankfully out of the picture for now since this new company is fully remote.

But then just today, I get an email from EY (Ernst & Young - never heard of them until now, but apparently they're a consulting company?) for a Cyber Operations Engineer role that I applied to nearly a month ago asking to provide availability for an interview. I'm almost certain that if by some miracle I clear another round of 5-6 interviews, given their posted salary range of $73,000 to $132,000, they'll probably lowball me with a salary of around $72,000 to $75,000 which is what I'm set to make anyway at the new company that is fully remote. The Cyber position at the very worst would be 5 days in-office with a 40 minute roundtrip commute (which isn't too bad) and at the very best, probably hybrid (3 days in office and 2 days remote).

Considering the data, I'm leaning towards just passing up this interview, but part of me has hope to secure a higher salary (shooting for $85,000 to $100,000) with the Cyber role. At one point, I really really wanted to get into Cybersecurity, but right now, I'm not too sure. And well, a 40 minute roundtrip commute isn't too bad either. On the other hand, I'm really tired of the whole interview process - not looking forward to 2-3 months of investing in this stuff all to get ghosted in the end.

I'll also have to explain why I'm leaving my role as my job history is not looking the best. I got let go (RTO mandate) from my previous company and got my current internal help desk role just a month ago that I'm already set to leave by next week. Then, I'd have to explain why I'm leaving the new job that I'm set to start at the end of the month. They'll flag me as a job hopper for sure.

What would you guys do in my situation? Would you still try to attend the cyber interview in hopes of getting a higher salary? I'm about tapped out on interviews and I'm done trying to explain why I'm leaving my current position(s).

Do you guys keep interviewing despite having secured a decent job?",mulumboism,2,1.0,6,1750476521,2025-06-21 03:28:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lgmwwa/do_you_guys_keep_interviewing_at_other_places/,6,2025

1lglkp1,"Has anyone been ""transitioned"" from a full-time role to an internship?","This is my first job, and I joined as a fresher in a full-time role at a nonprofit/social sector organization.

And that he was ""skeptical"" of me in this role and I had under-delivered. That stung, because I really tried my best, even if I wasn't always visible or outspoken.
They offered me a new position as an intern, calling it a
""pathway"" to a redefined role that might suit me better.
The tasks would shift toward reporting, documentation, and internal comms(backend tasks).
I don't know how to feel. I'm grateful for the opportunity to stay, but it also feels like a quiet demotion. I can't help but wonder if this is all a reflection of me not good enough. In any case,
-Is this normal in nonprofits or startups? -Will this hurt my resume? -Should I take this as a sign to work harder on myself?

1lgjr83,Wondering about taking a pay cut for some career growth. Has anyone done this and been happy?,"Hey guys, looking for some advice here.

I'm in a specialized engineering role at a small company. I'll discuss the pros and cons here, but the gist is that after applying to roles for 1.5 years, it's clear that I'd have to take a drop in compensation to move to a different role, and I'm wondering if it's worth.

Pros of my current role:

* well-compensated (for context, 150k with 2 YOE + PhD in VHCOL)
* joined early so I'm the ""go-to"" for a lot of things and talk with the executives regularly. I love this
* role is pretty easy and schedule is flexible
* my manager is OK, and I enjoy working with the team. 

Cons of my current role:

* My role is very specialized, with no growth. My job is very common in the defense industry but not in medtech where I am currently (and love this industry). If I had to go on the job market today, I'd be screwed - and this company isn't even at series A yet, so that's not out of the question.
* Because of the lack of growth, I am pretty bored. I do what I can - manage projects (with me as the only engineer), implement quality/six sigma (as... the only engineer), etc. We are space-limited so won't be hiring more in the next couple of years in my position.

I'm really wondering whether it's worth taking a drop in compensation or changing to the defense industry in order to have more career growth. But when I think about leaving this startup and going to a company where I'm just a number, I shiver. But maybe it would be a jump that I'd look back on and wish I'd done it sooner.

So I built a lightweight tool that helps people generate clean, professional resignation letters using AI. It’s completely free and super straightforward, you just fill out a short form and it handles the rest.

You can even choose the **tone** of the letter like *Professional*, *Grateful*, or *Brief* depending on your situation.

1lgfr7b,I built a system that scrapes every company career page in real time.,"I realized most job openings aren't on LinkedIn or Indeed.   
  
Instead company quietly post them on internal career pages, and about 90% of them go through one of these ATS platforms: Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Taleo, SmartRecruiters, iCIMS, Recruitee, Breezy, Jobvite, SuccessFactors, JazzHR, BambooHR, and a few others. We are talking about more than 50M jobs posted annually.

So, I created a system that scans companies using these ATS every 6 hours and updates a massive job database. On top of that, I built a matching tool that reads your resume and shows you the most relevant jobs based on your skills, totally free ([You can try it here](https://laboro.co/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=scrape2)).

There’s also an auto-apply feature (currently paid, but I plan to make it free soon). In the meantime, feel free to try the matching tool.

One of the most important things when applying is being fast, being first. That’s why the system constantly monitors and updates the database, so you can catch fresh job postings before anyone else.

I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions, I’m constantly working to improve this.

P.S. If you're curious but don’t want to share personal info, feel free to use a fake CV, the system only looks at relevant experience for matching, not personal data.

1lge7r9,Fresh Master graduate career advice,"Hi all, 

Good morning/evening, I want to discuss my career options as I begin building my career.

Education / certificaiton : 

Bcs of Mechanical engineering  
Master of Engineering management & PMP certified 

Work experience : 

2 years of Management

2 years of MEP and continuing 

  
Now I'm in Italy working in the MEP field, the experience is not at its best due to language experience and I'm going a bit slowly in it.

I have 3 options :

1. To search for a New experience in the Netherlands   
2. To go to Saudi Arabia   
3. To continue in Italy 

  
The role that I'm looking for is a project engineer/ MEP. I don't know which one is good for me. Learning the Italian in the long term is not that useful for me that's why I'm not into it that much.

Your helpful view could help me to look into the area that I'm not seeing right now.   
Thanks in Advance

1lgdcs6,Please Be Brutally Honest: How to propose the creation of a new position for a long term career,"I (23F) am currently working as a team lead within the retail division of a fantastic company. I’ve only been with them for nearly a year but have made quite an impression on the business and higher up executives. Not only was I promoted around my 7th month mark, I am the top seller at the top retail location, and was apart of an executive dinner trip because of the progress that was made over the end of last year. The executives I’ve met have expressed their gratitude for our hard work, one even pointing out that she knows who I am because she sees my name daily under top seller. The company I work for is a bigger brand name but still trying to find their footing in the retail/apparel side. They only have a hand full locations and recently closed a few because of bad real-estate decisions. Therefore they are undergoing a deconstruction of the entire retail division and I think this would be a perfect opportunity to voice my long term goals and wants with work for the company. I’m one of the few who have a business degree, the only one at my location with a higher education. I’ve been very much drawn to product development and design, along with the marketing of those products. Right now that department is only one individual who is a 3rd party hire. How do I professionally showcase my interest in being apart of that division? I’ve spoken to my manager who misinterpreted the whole situation and ran with it, but I’m going to have an opportunity to see a higher up next week (who knows about my interest) and would like to really express my passion for the brand but in that very specific position. Open to questions as well!

Everything just seems pointless and not to mention I feel like a layoff in a role like this is bound to happen at some point in my career.

I think being behind a desk and digging through Excel all day just isn’t something I can do for 40 more years. I’ve owned my home for 1 year so I really don’t want to lose money by going Active Duty military and having to sell it already. I also have a wife and son and don’t want to force them to move around every 3-4 years.

1lgbla3,Need Career Advice || Feeling Stuck in Digital Marketing,"HELLO 👋 everyone. I want some advice, hope I could get it here. 

Currently in a job role at XYZ technologies as a digital marketer and Advertiser.   ( Mainly Seo + Ads )

Before the Job, 2024, built an online business went very well but after 2023 it drastically changed and become cash burning machine. 

Left the business and with my B.Com Graduation ( Current degree ) joined  the XYZ company, with the above role. 

Now everyone know that Digital Marketing is very mainstream and 

Looks easy but the reality is very different as marketing depends upon the various external  factors of market, positioning, product, price making a hard profession even if you know the principles and various tools. 

Also many limitations like not able to create professional images as not a graphic designer,
 
Not able to create videos as not a video editor

but the job role is to bring users and impressions and clicks to the online verticals from various digital channels. 

Now joining a new company means new product, new market, new strategies, new persona where again it takes time to explore and a/b test many many things that takes time, resources of both employer and employee that we are accounted for. 

Now i need serious advice and pathway towards where I could lead my career to. 

1. Upgrade to Digital marketing manager role at any big XYZ company after completing MBA - Would be somewhat easy and simple as currently following this path. But as said - not getting satisfied in work. 

2. Learn new skill like Front end development ( excites me )  Also because I have a steep learning curve, and would love to just deeply focus on this. 

3.  Learn Video editing ( all tools like abldobe premiere ) - because this may align with my digital marketing role as already spent 3 years in personal business and 2 years in a XYZ technologies. ( Also looks promising and interesting )

4. Build an Digital Marketing Agency - Leave everything and start hustling at the age of 30, unmarried?

5. Side hustle and Build an E Publication App like EduGorilla - App Half already made. Need more Funds for Admin and Instructors Dashboard.

1lgayw7,I am stuck in this overthinking loop making me depressed,"I am a software engineer by profession. 2 years ago I got a job at a company which was completely remote and i enjoyed that initially a lot but my work shifted from technical to non technical over the time making me disliking what I worked there through automated my work a lot have good amount of free time to watch Netflix. But over the time i started feeling lonely and also tried a lot to switch my role to tech but always false hopes.

I feel a lot lonely have no one to talk also my work didn't need much communication. Due to the depression of being alone I started looking for a new offline job and tried solo travelling. I enjoyed solo travelling a lot and my company gave a good 24 casual leaves a year and as i automated my work i had a good time to travel. Also they gave a full month leave to me when i wanted to travel thailand. But as my work was non technical as a technical background person i hated it and i was also worried about it career wise and i always got false hopes for role switch no matter what i tried. I tried to create internal tools for them to reduce and simply my teams work-life and all was my ideas but still only false hopes in role switch.


So i quit and joined a office. I thought i will be happy here but no. I feel alone even in the crowd here i am not able to interact with people much here. Also it's a purely no remote work policy here with only 12 casual leaves in a year. I miss the travel i was able to do in my past company exploring ai tools(as i had all pro access there over here i can only access free suff).

I regret my choice of quitting as i am 25 if i had the old company ignoring the work i could had travelled for a year got married at around 27-28 after which i will not have much trips for shure. I was able to travel easy in chunks without any huge work pressure there. Over here its not that case at all. Also my salary is same as my old company even after working there for 2 years. I took the job here cuz i was trying since 2 months and i was getting no jobs i was tired by the old company ignoring my efforts in getting involved in tech and ai part there even after they knowing my capabilities.

I am not shure if i made a correct choice or not but back the i feel it was correct but not just for the comfort and ya(one international trip a year at my old company) is what i am missing a lot. And the main purpose of shifting which was better work and not being lonely those are still the case infact loneliness has got worst here even after going to office everyday.

TL;DR: The modern hiring system is broken, but not by accident. It’s been *optimized* for revenue—especially by Microsoft via LinkedIn.

* Easy Apply floods recruiters with resumes they’ll never see
* 22% of LinkedIn job listings are “ghost jobs” (not real)
* ATS systems get overwhelmed and turn into black holes
* LinkedIn Premium gives you “insights” and tells you you’re in the top 10%—but that metric is meaningless
* The end result? Everyone’s paying. Microsoft’s winning.

1lg7atu,"44 and feeling stuck in IT support - Should I go into cloud, cybersecurity, or web development?","
Hi everyone,

I’m 44 and have been working in IT support for the past 4 years. While it’s been a steady role, I feel stuck and really want to move into something more rewarding both professionally and financially. I’m trying to figure out the best direction to take — cloud engineering, cybersecurity, or possibly going back into web development.

Here’s some context:

I used to do web development many years ago, but that was before modern tools like React and newer JavaScript frameworks. If I return to web dev, I’d need to start from scratch and relearn everything.

I passed the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) and considered going into cloud engineering. But I only have basic networking knowledge and limited experience with scripting or the command line. I’ve also thought about switching to AWS and doing the AWS Cloud Practitioner cert instead.

Cybersecurity also interests me, but I’m unsure how to get started or how steep the learning curve is.

On top of that, I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD. I’ve struggled with focus and learning retention, which makes it harder to study and stay consistent.

My questions:

Which of these paths (cloud, cyber, or web dev) would be most realistic and easier to get into at my age?

Would it make sense to return to programming and try web development again, or is that more difficult now than cloud or cyber?

Are there any certs, resources, or beginner-friendly paths you’d recommend for someone like me?

Has anyone here changed IT career paths later in life, especially while dealing with ADHD or similar challenges?

Any advice or experience would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks for reading.

1lg51vj,I’ve been left alone frequently at my job during my 3 month probationary period.,"I’m tempted to leave my job. I’ve noticed I lost a lot more hair and my partner has told me my head looks a little swollen from all the stress. I breakdown frequently when I’m left alone at work and I always tell myself to just push through the job and that it will be fine tomorrow. I usually tell my partner, and they’ve told me to just quit, but I feel guilty if I brought no income in. I’m using all this money to save up for a vehicle.

I work in an office. There are only two of us that work in the office/building which would be understandable about being left alone once a week or an occasional twice a week. We always get Sundays off (it’s a given) so any weekdays off is our second day we’re off. Mondays and Fridays however you can’t request off because those are the busiest days. But lately, I’ve been left alone for multiple days a week (often on Mondays and Fridays), I understand it’s summer time and people want to be with their families. And it seems like these days off were pre-approved before so I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it? I’ve tried to push through the best I can, but having my supervisor take multiple days off while I’m still in probation is stressing me out. The first day I was left alone was my first month of probation, my boss got sick which was understandable, and no one was able to fill in for them because apparently everyone else got sick too and called in (it was after Easter), so I was tasked with handling the office alone.

The only reason why I’m seriously considering it now, is because two weeks ago they were gone for 2 days (Friday & Saturday). A week ago, 3 days (Thursday, Friday, & Saturday). And this week for 3 days again, (scheduled day off Wednesday, Thursday - told me they were using a sick day, and Friday - notified me last minute they were going to be at a different office.) 

I’m trying to rationalize staying with this job, I’m currently trying to find another job, but I can’t tell if I’m being taken advantage of either? Or if it’s okay for me to quit straight up during my probationary period for the reason of being left alone multiple times a week? I want to stay for the sake of bringing income in, but I feel like it’s killing me. Everytime I’m going to work I have this dread of it being horrible.

1lg4g4a,To leave without increment or after or just abscond?,"🌪️ My Current Job Situation

Right now, I earn ₹X/month. 
I was promised a ₹15k hike during increment season which I did finally receive, but it came after a 3-month delay. So it'll come this 30th June.

I stayed patient all this while, even though I was mentally done, just so I could get what was owed to me.

The truth is: my plan was always to accept the hike and leave. I’ve been feeling completely drained and emotionally checked out for a while now. The WFO routine leaves me burnt out.

In the meantime, I’ve been offered another job
₹X + ₹37k/month, fully remote, a different role.
It feels like the right next step for me. But they need me to join in 10–15 days, or they’ll move forward with someone else.

That’s where the conflict kicks in:
	•	If I stay, I’ll earn an extra ₹45k over 3 months, but I’ll be stuck in a role that drains me - why bc he will ask me to serve a 3months notice.
	•	If I leave now, I lose that money but will get a better job, also confusing if he'll agree for a 10-15 days notice period. 

Where I stand now: I’m emotionally detached from this job. I know I deserve better, both in terms of money and mental space. I want to move on respectfully, with a short notice period if possible. But if I’m forced to drag this out unnecessarily, I know I’ll have to make a tough call.

I’m not someone who is selfish but man I am greedy towards the money I deserve. I’ve always been the sweet, reliable person and dont wanna leave on a bad note but what to do? Abscond? Will they file a case? wth",burnerasap,1,1.0,0,1750427306,2025-06-20 13:48:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lg4g4a/to_leave_without_increment_or_after_or_just/,6,2025

The new company is super niche, and I’m worried they don’t have anywhere near the customer base  (~500 ) my current company (1000s) does. It’s a very small team, and I’d be fully responsible for closing all the deals, so there’s definitely more pressure.

That said, one of the things I hate about my current job is the long sales cycles. I spend most of my time doing BD emails and chasing things that can take 12+ months and often go nowhere.

1lg3i3e,confused about career in medicine or ML/math/engineering,"(Not sure if this is the subreddit for this, if not ,please guide where to post) I apologise for the long post.

Hello, i just cleared my 12th std with PCMB

I am confused whether to persue medicine or engineering On one hand i started out inclined towards medicine because Firstly after 10th ,i was not sure what engineers did, and the idea of working at some random finance/software company 9-5 , without any clear purpose was not really appealling ...but now as I get more interested in AI and math , i feel like there are a lot of cool things you could do here.. I like maths , calculus was beautiful and now I am eager to learn linear algebra one day as I just finished the 3b1b series on it , but I also understand that the beauty of maths that i find in its applications and fundamentally it is only a short aspect of it, mostly it is going to be exhausting and just solving meaningless problems. But I would love to work at the forefront of AI , the actual workings of it. Explore the fundamental question of what is natural and what is consciousness? Also if i take up engineering not only will I get to learn maths , I will also get the freedom to explore my other interests like cinematography, dance, traveling..

But then there is medicine. Medicine is medicine. Once in a life time. It represents surrender and devotion.

theres the whole thing about well, if you are going to learn anything , u could learn it , but medicine is the only thing u cant really learn on ur own? it is also the most fundamentaal thing to learn considering how you are kinda learning about your own body? (maybe its math then but that feels too disconected from reality ) i used to think that but then i thought that it might be the most basic thing to learn , but then should i go for something beyond that? like electronics , is making star dust play my song that is cool right though maybe not universally fundamental? then theres is this whole thinng about pain being omnipresent and how it is the only thing u can be aware of when u are feeling it.. and if i can just give ppl more chance at there already limited time at consiousness , then i think thats neat... and i saw a lil bit of the textbooks and they are the coolest thing EVER like the way they describe it as an art and a science and the amount of respect they have for the practice itself is just... i thinkpersuing that will be an experience like no other ,idk i am very heavily influenced by that breath becomes air book and john green , and harrison ka preface (it starts out with ur role in society and duty to the patient and everything).., to be so cllose to pain and death... it is osmething .... i also think i like human centric careers , idk if i will like to be in a purely technical space...

i also think this is the higher education where you are garunteed to learn , like i know a lot of engineers who say their degree was useless. i also think this is the way of garunteed impact and also garunteed excellence, both of the thinks i value , or i think i do , but my actions really say otherwise.. and yea what u said about the set pathway , i think it has a different tradition and legacy all together..

i also feel like one of the most fundamental battle as a human is against death , the uncertainty of it all , how helpless and scary it is, i would like to be there with ppl in that uk... and even just for myself , i feell like it would be good to know

I feel like medicine demands a lot..you can either live life or understand it..and i am not really sure what i am ready to commit to.

Another thing is that I always enjoy deductive or less fact based , simplicity of maths I fear medicine is basically just cramming facts and I am not really good at nor interested in just memorising so much.. I usually enjoy maths physics more than Biology chemistry

I am also very emotionally and visually sensitive and fear i wont be able to handle it in medicine. There is also the problem that I lack the resilience for medicine school.

I know I am romanticizing both, and not being pragmatic.. I understand in the end that it is just a choice , and I can make the best out of anything. And yet I gotta choose . Any guidance is appreciated.

1lg0kzi,Social impact work - Career dead end? Advice on next steps + pivots,"I've been mulling over this for a while but I feel like I've hit a dead end in my career. I have 15 years of experience managing programs and leading stakeholder engagement work for several nonprofits. A few years ago, after becoming jaded with the nonprofit sector, I decided to work for a real estate development company to lead their community engagement work - the work wasn't too challenging and the pay was great.  It was the best work/life balance and pay that I've ever had. Earlier this year, the company decided to restructure and they let go of their 'CSR' team, which included me. 

  
I'm between a rock and a hard place since I've built a career focused on social impact work (including a masters degree), but I've grown very jaded about the space. Most of the nonprofits that I've worked at are poorly run and many of the ones that are able to get consistent funding lean heavily into tokenisms to secure grants. The nonprofit sector feels cyclical and like a charade of kind of good work that some times has one good story of success. Private companies that have 'CSR' departments I think end up being more effective since they actually have $$ that they can deploy, and they're also more honest about the work mostly being about optics. 

  
Now that I'm out of a job, I'm trying to figure out what the next career step for me will be. I've been applying to some CSR roles out of necessity, and I think landing a role at a financial institution or tech company would be one of the best outcomes for me right now. However, that feeling of the sector being bullshit still doesn't leave me, and I'm trying my best to not let it dominate my attitude because I really do need a job. The job market also sucks and I've applied to over 80 roles, which has included a ton of interviews but no success. 

  
I've also been looking into other fields like project management, but i'm just not sure where I can be competitive.

1lg0jbe,[Career change advice needed] How can a complete beginner transition into an Art Director career path?,"Hi everyone! I'm currently working as a tarot reader and language teacher, but after taking an Ikigai test, I was surprised to see that the role of Art Director came out as my ideal match.

🌀 I’ve also done some deep personal reflection (including astrological chart analysis – which I know isn’t everyone’s thing, but it’s helped me a lot) and I’ve consistently been drawn to paths involving art, healing, spirituality, coaching, and working behind the scenes (anonymous or supportive roles). I also deeply value independence, creativity, and meaningful impact.

🔮 My background:

\- No formal training in design or visual arts.

\- I’ve never worked in agencies, production, or visual content creation.

\- But I’ve always loved expressing myself through visuals, writing, and intuitive storytelling.

\- I enjoy working solo and on my own schedule.

💡What I need help with:

What exactly does an Art Director do on a day-to-day basis?

What kind of beginner-friendly skills, software, or projects should I start exploring?

Is it possible to transition into this field without a design degree or past experience?

Would freelancing or building a creative portfolio on platforms like Behance/Dribbble help?

Any courses, communities, or personal experiences you'd recommend for someone starting from scratch?

🎯 Ultimately, I want to blend art + healing + strategy in a creative way. I don’t need to become a traditional ad agency art director – I just want to find a path that lets me direct or curate beautiful, meaningful visual work.

Any advice from those who’ve made similar transitions or work in this field would be super appreciated. 🙏

1lfyxoh,Carrer advice or outside perspective needed,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently considering two very different job opportunities in Germany (Frankfurt area) and would really appreciate some outside perspective. Both options seem viable, but I’m struggling to figure out which makes more sense for my long-term well-being and career satisfaction.

# Option 1: Office-Based Commercial Role (Order Processing)

I have two offers for an office-based job in order processing / administrative commercial support. The work is relatively straightforward, Monday to Friday, no shifts, clear responsibilities. It’s the kind of job I already have a lot of experience in - I’ve spent over a decade in B2B sales and project management roles.

The issue is: in previous office jobs, I have always had performance reviews that met or exceeded expectations. 

For reasons out of my control I have seen how workload eventually dropped off and I have ended up in periods where I had little or nothing to do. This causes me to feel bored and miserable and unfulfilled.   
  
On one occasion I tried to talk with my manager about it to try finding a way to make better use of my time, but this led to me being let go, despite consistently strong performance. That has left me a bit scarred. I now realize I prefer having clear, active daily tasks: not sitting around trying to make myself look busy.

Option 2: Retraining as a Passenger Train Driver

I’m also in the application process for a career change and retraining program to become a passenger train driver (either for regional or long-distance routes). This is with the national railway company, and although I’ve only had the first interview, it’s looking quite promising.

Honestly, the idea of having clearly defined, structured work really appeals to me (like driving from A to B, following set procedures, and then going home). I enjoy routine and staying physically and mentally active during the day. I feel this kind of job could give me a stronger sense of purpose, rhythm, and structure.

But it is a major career shift. The training takes 12 months, and the job includes **shift work**, including nights and weekends. I’m in my late 30s, and a small part of me wonders:

* What if I don’t like it after 2–3 years?
* Would it be hard to return to office work if I change my mind later?
* Would I be too “off-track” by then?

Another factor (maybe irrational) is the fear of AI. I keep reading about how AI is affecting knowledge-based jobs, like software development, IT, customer support roles and a long etc....   
  
I constantly read advices on other posts from this subreddit that “hands-on” professions that are harder to automate like crafts jobs . Train driving, to me, seems like one of those jobs that might offer more long-term security (at least for the next decade). I'm aware that the technology for automatic trains exist but things in Germany move slowly in this regard. 

# Other context:

* Salary is fairly similar in both cases, at least at entry level: then as a train driver, with experience and working shifts and holidays the salary woud be substantially higher than the average office job. (50-60K € per year brutto)
* I have a family (wife and 2 kids in Kindergarten age), so work-life balance matters, but I could manage either job if I plan carefully.
* I’m not afraid of hard work, physically or mentally. I just want to avoid the emotional burnout of spending 8 hours a day at a desk, feeling like I’m doing nothing.



# TL;DR:

Experienced office worker feeling burned out from ""underload"" and meaningless downtime. I now have to choose between:

* another safe but potentially unfulfilling desk job
* or a big career change to train driving, which offers more routine and structure, but requires retraining and accepting shift work.

Would love to hear from people who’ve made similar pivots or maybe wish they had.

1lfyv8n,I think I’m being blackballed,"I’m in Texas.

Before I explain further, I’m not looking to be told “what do you expect?” given the industry I work in (public sector). People are shitty and shady no matter what industry and I recognize that politics and government attracts and even rewards the worst types of people. Unfortunately, I love what I do and I’m damn good at it. I can’t see myself doing anything else and remain fulfilled.

I have reason to believe I’m being blackballed by previous offices and colleagues I’ve worked for/with (I.e. cyber bullying me on social media, gossiping about my time at ___ agency/office to new staff, and making up rumors about my sexual orientation). I have screen shots of the online harassment and witness testimony for the gossip and rumors. However, how do you deal with being blackballed?? 

For context: I believe I’m being blackballed because I spoke out about abuse I was experiencing in a statewide office for almost two years. I was fired for not putting up with it but never pursued legal action because that’s career suicide unfortunately and even filing “under seal” would be risky for me in any sector. However,  I was a senior staff member and know “too much” which makes me think they’re trying to make sure I never work in the public sector again. Any advice? I refuse to leave the state that I love and let them “succeed” at keeping me out. I love this state and the line of work I do. It’s the most fulfilling thing in the world and I refuse to let them take it away from me but obviously I’m still struggling…

For additional context: I’ve tried applying to private sector but it’s been even more brutal than public. I feel like I’m at an impasse and I’m just so emotionally drained. Anything helps.

1lfyqfy,Am I making the right decision?,"Hello everyone.  
After taking three gap years after High School for NEET UG (A pre-medical entrance exam held in India), I'm considering switching to Engineering. IT or AI, possibly.

For the last one month , I have been learning Python, online.  
(P.S : Have done C++ and Java till Grade 10, ICSE. Did code occasionally in Grade 11 and 12 although my subject combo was PCMB, I did not want to ""just"" forget those coding skills!)

For the last whole month till now, I was checking out whether I still got it or not. (Else I had considered taking up Chemical Engineering, more aligned to my Grade 12 subjects and the traumatic NEET UG drop years)

....and I found out that I still got it. I still liked it. Even wondered at one point with horror why I even left this subject after grade 10 (peer and family pressure + I was good in bio).  
I caught up with the basic programming classes really quickly and now I'm well into learning Python.

Now, here are some of my questions:

A) Should I go ahead with this little green flag of hope?

B) Since I have a 3 year gap after Class 12 (2022-2025), is there any chance this record would cause a havoc during company placements later on? Even if I maintain a good CGPA? (Easier said than done I know)

C) How tough is it? Like overall? I've got a lot of [B.Tech](http://b.tech/) friends and classmates from school (in senior years now), but all they do is post aesthetic photos and travel pics, so I cannot exactly gauge what's the inside, actual life like. Medicos post about their hectic schedule and postings and all.......(still pains as I write it now, because I'll never get to do that anymore).

That's all.  
I just do not want to make any wrong decisions anymore. I have accepted my current situation and have come in peaceful terms with my past failures.  
I will be highly obliged for any genuine words of advice or views.",Ill-Career9180,1,1.0,0,1750407842,2025-06-20 08:24:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfyqfy/am_i_making_the_right_decision/,6,2025
1lfymxz,Need Career Advice | Serious Career Problem.,"Hi everyone,

I’m in a tough situation and need honest advice. Back in 2017, I got a UG degree through an agent — I didn’t realize how wrong it was at the time. I’ve been working in IT/cybersecurity for 8+ years since then and recently joined a PG course.

Now in 2025, I found out my UG is not verifiable — the university has been linked to past degree scams, and my record is gone from their site. I’m devastated.

I want to come clean and rebuild:
	•	I’m ready to drop my PG (since it’s based on that UG)
	•	Start a fresh valid UG online
	•	Continue building cybersecurity skills and get certified (e.g., OSCP, SC-200, eJPT)
	•	Switch jobs only when I have valid credentials

But mentally, I’m stuck. I overthink everything, worry about being exposed, and fear that employers won’t trust my experience when they see a recent UG.

My questions:
	•	Will employers understand and value skills + honesty over a degree timeline?
	•	Has anyone seen someone bounce back from this kind of mistake?
	•	Do skill-first companies in cybersecurity actually hire without obsessing over degrees?

I want to move forward without fear. Any guidance would help.

Thanks

i was thinking without really knowing anything about it may be r&d in a pharmaceutical company since we get bio and chem and ""pharmacy"" knowledge thats a good profile for them (may be?)

or may be get a pharmacology master after 

i also really like tech and i do homelabbing and programming a a hobby but i cant have a minor due to not enough electives they said to me.

so some sort of biotech is also an option.

1lfxssu,need advice on starting a science career,"Hey everyone,
I believe i posted here before with no replies but let me do it again.


I 26M and Egyptian.I have an old bachelor's in 2021 in biology education, reason for this is that, there was covernment hiring ""very soon"" at the time. So, at 18 years old with no other better choice, I did that degree first. In 2021 in graduation, I thought it would be a good idea to do another full science focused degree incase the covernment hiring flopped (and - -spoiler alert- in 2025, when the hiring finally hit, I was right. They didnt ask for teachers in my city, and it was locked geographically so yes it basically flopped) 


Now in current time I just graduated two weeks ago with my new bachelor's degrees in microbiology (3.7/5 GPA. It's excellent grade and = 3.7/4), I did that degree to work in scientific field, but through my years doing that degree i have not found a single science related job other than sales roles (which i did for 6 months before they found i am a student)


My goal was always to work in research one day, but yeah, I feel stuck.


I also applied to some scholarships abroad — all rejected. 


Currently thinking about doing a local master’s while gaining experience at random jobs, but I’m not sure if that’s the best move.


I’m open to anything science-related right now — even Lab or hospital work — but don’t know where to start or what to focus on.


Oh and IELTS is also on my list, but I can’t afford it yet.


Any advice at all ?


Tldr: I'm biologist cant find job because Egypt is hell. ",nep284,1,1.0,0,1750404096,2025-06-20 07:21:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfxssu/need_advice_on_starting_a_science_career/,6,2025

1lfxhkc,Internal Promotion Situation,"Hi all!  I’m currently going through the internal promotion process. I would be going from an independent hourly rate to salaried people manager role. The base salary would be an increase of 10%, which is great from my past salaried experiences. However, given my current pay, it would be the equivalent of 44 hours straight time (43 hours w/1.5x OT). On the average week I’m putting in at least this, meaning to take this offer would be a pay cut ultimately as the hours would remain the same as I am working now. In the time that I have been with this company, OT has never not been available although obviously not guaranteed.

1lfwoxa,AI in the way of my future path.,"Hi, I 16M, has always been interested in UI UX design. I loved how the colors came together and how users interact with objects. I worked on a couple of web design projects before and currently developing my portolio, choosing classes based around my desire in going to Interaction Design at Art Center, UX design in SCAD, or HCI tracks in Regular Universities. 

However, recently I've been seeing alot of AI tools online that include UI UX functionalities, such as Stitch for example. I know that curerntly AI design has alot of issuess and is not a full replacement just yet, but Im concened that AI would would progress far enough to fully replace UX design by the time I graduate. I'm unclear on whether or not if I should even pursue this path. 

I do have another career in mind though:  
 International Relations/Studies since I've been active in MUN and government diplomacy camps. I don't love this career as much as I love UX though, but I think I can work with it as long as it's reliable and pays relatively well. 

Or 

I can create a start-up myself and don't go to colelge at all. 

Honestly at this point I'm not really sure what to do with my future anymore, and I could really use some advice! Thanks for reading such a long message btw. 

TLDR:  I have no idea if I should continue pursuiing UX anymore based on the current trend in technology, and idk if international relations would be a safer option.

1lfvqko,Career options after completing psychology undergrad,"I am 22 from Australia and graduated last year with a Bachelors in Psychology. My plan was to either become a teacher (two year course after bachelors), or be a clinician / researcher. I decided to go with science teaching, and realised I get way too overstimulated trying to manage a class of kids who mostly aren't interested in what you're trying to teach them unless you make it competitive and gamified. And despite enjoying teaching, I kind of suck at explaining things to people, especially when I'm overstimulated. 

I still like the idea of educating people though, and my values are connection, curiosity and authenticity. I thought teaching aligned with those values. But I feel like ""the grass is greener"", and perhaps I should try something different. 

Seeing as I have a bachelors degree in psych already, it would take me another three years to become a psychologist. This option does appeal to me. I could educate people on therapeutic approaches, and work with them to develop solutions to concerns they're having. But the extra study, I don't know if I can afford.

Or I was thinking of getting qualified in accounting as it has a higher pay ceiling than most helping jobs and I don't have to deal with the emotional labour of having to manage behaviour or compassion fatigue.

I might just finish my teaching course and work casually as I'm almost done with it, but does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this situation?

1lftjbs,"Please help. Bad management, can’t quit yet.","I have created and implemented a counselling and wellness program for underserved communities at my place of employment. I am the only one in my department and I act as a counsellor and program manager.  My title is a counsellor, but I have program manager duties without manager authority… 

I ended up in this position because the “counsellor” who I was supposed to be working under turned out to be a fake, with fake credentials. Since this situation, I was promised workers to help with my programming, which never happened.

My counselling space is a room within a room. Despite regular warnings, management has given up on trying to stop maintenance from unlocking the door to my space to allow staff from other departments to use my space. This comprises the safety of my clients and has resulted in late sessions or me having to cancel sessions. I’ve heard maintenance and the staff say that they don’t give a F@$! about the counselling clients. While I reported this to management, nothing was done. 

Now they are running a summer and school program in my space, without telling me about it beforehand. 

Maintenance also refused to clean mouse droppings from my office or take my garbage out. 

Also, accounting is randomly making decisions on behalf of my programming, including responding to legal correspondence... Which resulted in me having to contact a lawyer.

I have also experienced lateral violence from other workers and the community. I had my character assassinated in front of the ED by the accountant when I asked him to stop his behaviour. The ED did nothing… Their response was “what do you want me to do?”

I report directly to the ED but she always sends someone else to talk to me about my concerns. This person doesn’t have the authority she does to address my concerns so it feels like a waste of time. I have written numerous work updates, and email requests that were direct but professional requesting support with addressing problems that directly impact my work. The ED never replies, but I see them responding to everyone else’s emails, including ones that aren’t work related. I have tried showing up to their office and they basically offer no response to anything. They say I am the counsellor so I should know what to do. 

Because nothing is being addressed, I shut down the programming because there is too much risk involved. I was thinking about keeping it shut down until management decides to address my concerns. I have pivoted to focus on my trainings and policy development, as I’m still employed. I don’t know what to do from here because it’s not so easy to just get another job right now. I have been applying for jobs but the market is slow.

I've bounced around in different job fields since graduating college. I have my bachelor's degree in Psychology, and throughout my 20s I worked part-time as a fitness trainer (got my fitness certification when I was 21) and had various marketing and sales roles, running the social media pages and websites of the local gyms I worked at. Coordinating fitness events, responding to emails, selling memberships, attending sales trainings, tracking KPIs, designing merchandise, things like that. 

My most recent job of 4 years was as a Sous Chef at a restaurant in the pastry department. I kind of fell into it after applying there as their marketing assistant, and then becoming interested in the kitchen side of it. It was fun, but low paying and physically draining.

I've spent the last 6 months applying to hundreds of jobs. Gotten rejected/ghosted from 99% of them. I've applied through Indeed, through the websites directly, and emailed countless recruiters directly. I've primarily only applied to jobs that I am perfectly qualified for. Administrative work, front desk receptionist jobs, entry level marketing for small companies, customer service, etc. Many entry level positions requiring only a HS education. I've only applied to jobs that make $22+/hr, because anything less and I cannot afford my rent.

I am so frustrated. I have a college degree, a history of longevity at jobs, a well tailored resume, and am more than capable of doing the jobs that I've applied for. I do not feel like I am over reaching at all. I constantly am tweaking my resume. I reach out to hiring people. I try to make connections with the people at the companies I'm applying for. I thoroughly research the companies I am interviewing with beforehand. I write cover letters. I practice interviewing at home. I genuinely don't feel like I do a bad job at interviews, emails, and phone calls. I. don't. understand.

Is this just... how it is now?? Is there some magical formula for finding a job? Are my skills/experience just not enough anymore in this job market? Is it the city I live in (Denver, CO)? I have NEVER struggled so much in finding a job.

1lfruxo,Can you help with job ideas for my 62 yr old Mom (SoCal)?,"My mom is 62 years old and has worked in sales for the last 30 years at one company. The company is close to shutting down and she has been slowly losing her income over the years. We've been helping her out financially for the last year. She is the kindest woman in the world and volunteers a lot in her free time at hospitals and churches. She has had so much stress in her life and now cannot afford to retire.

She needs a jobs that will pay her at least $55,000/yr. I would LOVE it if she could work remotely and do something with less stress. I worry about her stress a lot, as well as her gas money/commuting time. She doesn't have time to take care of herself and I'd love it if she could have some downtime for walks, home cooking, and exercise. 

Does anyone have any ideas for a career or job opportunities available for her? She lives in Southern California. IE/OC preferred for any in-person jobs.

1lfrsou,Is grad school my only hope?,"I'll be 30 this August. Graduated (2017) from a good state school on the US east coast with a ChemE degree, a math minor, honors, magna cum laude (3.8 gpa). Took the first job I was offered in the field of industrial optics just to get a start where I currently lived. I now live in a city with a lot of life sciences and biomedical industry and I love my city. There are also a few pharma companies outside of the city also. My family is nearby and I don't want to leave but I don’t mind traveling. Now that I have a few years of business/corporate experience under my belt, I feel more confident about what I want. However, I fear that at this point, with so many years between me and my degree, applying to companies in industries that are more closely aligned with my desires and my studies feels like a complete waste of time. My concern is that by taking the first job I was offered (and staying for almost 7 years), that I am no longer qualified for even entry level engineer/chemist positions and that my only chance to find a job that makes going to work interesting is to go into debt and go back to grad school.

1lfrap0,Navigating regret from declining job offer?,"I am in a state of massive agony. I hate my current job and finally found a role that would have given me a chance to pivot careers. The job had higher pay and better benefits; however, I felt uneasy about going from fully remote to an hour commute (one way) 4x/week.

I also got some vibes during the interview that made me feel there would be poor work-life balance, which conflicted with school and my personal life. I realize now that may have been a misjudgment and a thought that was based on anxiety.

The role has already been filled 😩 although the hiring manager said the team loved me and would reach out with additional opportunities.

I’m very sad. I feel this was my one chance and I wish I would have at least tried the job for 6 months-1 year for the experience. Maybe I would have adapted to the commute.

I can’t think of anything else throughout the day. I cry often and I feel like I messed up something that was perfect for my career growth.

Any advice on how navigate this regret? Any success stories from situations like this would be helpful.

TLDR: declined a good job opportunity, now I’m full of depression and regret. How do I cope with this?

Good evening! I hope all of you had a good day.

They called the role ‘DomBot Troubleshooter’ at the time, and it was only a six month project. But I can’t seem to find what the exact name for this type of role is. I thoroughly enjoyed the work I did and I would love to work towards going into something like this again.

- are resume templates okay to be used? if the job can tell you used a template, are you likely to not get the job? what about if you use a recognizable template?
- most templates that i’ve found, even for high schoolers, ask for experience… since this is my first job should i just remove that section off of the template? do school clubs count?? 😭
- in fact for anything that i don’t have should i just remove it from the template? is there anything i should replace it with to seem less bad? am i less likely to get the job LMAO
- can the “skills” i write be skills i got have personal hobbies/clubs?
- if i’m currently volunteering at a library this summer is that something i can put on my resume even tho i JUST started?
- are websites like indeed, ziprecruiter, etc. actually good for finding jobs near you? what are some good, maybe even underrated ways to find jobs?

i would appreciate if even just one of these questions could be answered. sorry to ask a lot of stupid questions, i’m just a nervous perfectionist LMAO. thank you so much to everyone who decides to help out!!",Puzzleheaded-Sky2459,1,1.0,0,1750377934,2025-06-20 00:05:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfq1mn/resumejob_questions_as_a_high_schooler/,6,2025

I'm really confused on What degree to pursue and what career to choose (advice from people in any of the degrees i mentioned),"I'm F (19)   just graduated 12th grade  2 months ago and   i don't have any one to give me advice or talk to    my brother left his college because he felt like he chose the wrong major and my father and mother didn't graduate  secondary  school . I have a few degrees in mind but I don't know which one to choose my options were
 1) psychology 
2) fashion designing 
3)social work 
4) law 
5) history 
 
1. The problem is that I hardly pass my statistics and maths exam and If I do masters and bachelors in psychology the maths will probably make me go mad .

2.and I'm someone that like sewing,crochet , and diy but its my hobby and If I pursued it as a career I don't think I would be able to excel at it and I don't have the drawing skills and the creativity 

 3.I love helping people and solving problems etc and one of my friends parents is a social worker after seeing her I really wanted to become one but the jobs are very less and the pay too  and I want to earn money to support me and my family 

4.I don't have a lawyer in my family but I heard its really difficult  but pays good but people are saying if law is not your passion don't pursue it  and I am an introvert and has anxiety  and my father suggested this degree 

 5.Idk about history I just like hearing about historic things and historical stories 

  The thing Is if I had money i would pursue 1 degree after another but since. My father lost his job we are barely making ends meet and my brother  dropped out of college  after 3rd year as an econ major and is starting college again   and the college admission have already started but i still have not decided on What major to choose 

Few things about me :-
I like reading anything that intresting and I am someone if I study something   really hard. I remember it for a long time . I like sewing , crocheting , hearing or reading stories, and I am an average student in my class and is an introvert and has social anxiety and stage fright  ",AdNecessary3636,1,1.0,3,1750377223,2025-06-19 23:53:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfpsm5/i_need_advice_im_really_confused_on_what_degree/,6,2025
1lfps42,Can someone help me understand equity?,"Been running my own department for almost 10 years, increasing responsibility and team size. While I report to the CEO and CFO, I really only talk to them for status updates and specific projects. Otherwise, it's me autonomously running my department and working cross departments to execute strategy and tasks. My frustration is that my peers are C-level, I'm well respected within the company and the industry, and I know I'm a high performer by how much I'm asked for advice and given responsibilities.

BUT I keep having to fight for promotions and get one small step at a time even though I'm doing the same job and there's noone above me. I don't necessarily need to be C-level, but I feel I should at least the same level as all the other senior leaders. 

So, this last year I've made it very clear that I need it all to make sense. I want my title and compensation to match the job I'm doing. We're in review cycle, and I was told I was recommended for promotion (not C-level) and 33% of the salary raise I asked for but maybe also an equity increase (not sure yet - my manager is a little untrustworthy with his words). The company is private and has a KSOP meaning I already own some stock. 

I just don't know enough about equity - would that be a worthwhile solution, or are they just trying to shut me up yet again? I may be mistaken, but if the company is private and has zero plans of going public, is it even really worth anything?

I was initially predicted AAA.

For my uni choice i've got to get BBC minimum for biomedical science but with chemistry i really feel like i haven't got in.

Initially i wanted to do Biomed so i could go into a graduate entry dental scheme but im not too sure now. Dentistry does seem like a really cool job that i would really enjoy which just makes this situation so unfortunate and depressing.

I've put so much work and thought into dentistry. I wrote a 5000 word project on dental anxiety and have done weeks of work experience.

I have been looking at other jobs and the ones that stick out to me are the ones where i'm physically doing things, like a therapist working directly with people or i've even been looking at becoming a detective constable (don't think ill do this due to the unsociable hours and i want to start a family at some point)

But the money i'm earning also means a lot. I want to be able to provide when i have kids, i want to be earning quite a lot and dont know what to do.

I currently live at home and want to move out so bad. Thats one of the main things i'm looking forward to at Uni - having privacy and independence. So i dont want to take a gap year. I'm probably going to have to go through clearing and just don't know what course to go down. All i know is that i want to move to newcastle so either go to Northumbria Uni or Newcastle Uni.

I have been looking into finance as that pays really well but i don't quite understand what they do. All i hear about are spreadsheets and zoom meeting and i don't get it. I don't get why they are paid so much too.

1lfnulg,Excited for job offer but unsure about offer details,"I am currently working for a large govt consulting firm. I have been job hunting for over 2 years now and I have work experience in two fields that are very contentious/losing funding in this political environment. I finally went through multiple rounds of interviews with a small law firm (I would be a HR-related professional staff) through a referral and finally received a job offer. I am truly excited for the opportunity and want to leave government contracting environment immediately.

Although the salary they offered is 10% more than what I am currently making, I am stepping into a new role where I would be building a team (I would be on my own for the first year). I love my current team so much, but I don't see much growth in my role. In addition, this new company does not do 401k matching (which my current company does) and all the premiums for insurance is a lot higher (my current employer covers my health insurance premium). 

I really liked the hiring manager, but the external recruiter has been the middle person to communicate between us. It was a little offputting when I asked if I could get a slightly later start date and she said she does not want to put that on her client (my hiring manager) and also said that nothing was negotiable. This was before I even received the written offer. 

I asked my hiring manager directly if I could speak with him on the phone and he was open to it. How do I go about negotiating for a slightly higher salary (still within the range they stated), especially knowing I am losing out on many benefits of my current company?

1lfn7kj,Stuck in a career dead end 3 years into working in Engineering (UK),"Hi everyone, I was hoping to get some advise as I feel very deflated and pessimistic at the moment with my career.

I’m a Mechanical Engineering graduate and have been working in engineering/manufacturing for 3 years now. My role is a mish mash of various responsibilities which when I started seemed great, but now I feel like a Jack of all trades, master of none (mostly feel like the latter). 

I work in the manufacturing industry, however my role is purely office based and not on the shop floor. 
I do estimating and sales (with none of the benefits a salesperson gets). So I’m a manufacturing engineer that can’t operate machinery (I had experience in school/university but that’s years ago now)

I create production plans and somewhat manage projects, but no proper training or desire to be a project manager (there’s even a completely seperate project management department).

I assist with PMFEAs, and 8D/NCR’s but don’t work in the quality department (nor want to elsewhere).

Our company is purely build to print (I.e. customer sends us a drawing of what they want and we make it) so I don’t have any experience in DFM, material selection, and no stress analysis/calculations. This was what I started my passion for engineering but now I have no real world experience for it.

I’m the best CAD designer in the company but I have no responsibility over CAM on the shop floor. As we’re solely build to print, my CAD skills rarely matter other than mocking up the odd drawing from the 1960s so that it’s legible for subcontractors. I also can’t show any proof of my design ability from what I’ve done at work because of NDAs etc. So im also not a design engineer (another passion).

I’ve specialised somewhat in learning about a very niche manufacturing method that we don’t do on site at our company but again, I don’t have experience in doing the process so it’s of very little use to any other company than ours. (And again, unsure if I can share my knowledge due to NDAs). 

It’s now been 3 years working at this company, coming straight out of university. I try to keep my passion alive through 3D printing but I lack ideas to create something new out of thin air, so I struggle to showcase my design skills (I work much better by being given a project/problem to solve, not look for one). I’ve been trying to argue to be put on a CAM course and work more directly with the shop floor but it’s been a year and a half of asking repeatedly. 

I can’t see how another company will want me, and the only roles that I might be accepted for I don’t want to do (as otherwise I’d just stay where I’m working). I can’t afford to get a badly paid entry role in the sectors I want to work in as I have a mortgage and dependents that I can barely afford as it is. 

I want to escape the rut I’m in, but I feel like it’s too late. That I’m trapped in a role that I can’t escape from. Please can someone offer any advice, whether it’s how to expand into a mechanical engineering role, or to stop feeling like I am trapped. I’m sorry for the rant and thank you for anyone that does read this…",trollingcousins17,2,1.0,0,1750370105,2025-06-19 21:55:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfn7kj/stuck_in_a_career_dead_end_3_years_into_working/,6,2025

1lflizv,I think my job is a front for something suspicious and I’m at a loss in what I should do.,"Okay, Reddit, I really need a gut check from literally anyone right now, because I'm either losing my mind or I’ve stumbled into managing a criminal front. I can’t talk to anyone in my life about this, and I feel like I'm going crazy.

I took a job managing what I thought was a cute children's clothing boutique.

Day one was… weird. Some random guy I've never seen before or since shows up, hands me a key, says basically nothing, and just leaves. I open the door and the store looks like a ghost town. It was filthy, disorganized, and felt like it hadn't been touched in months. First red flag.

Then there's the location, which makes ZERO sense. We are in one of the most expensive, high-end malls in America. I'm not exaggerating—our direct neighbors are Gucci, Hermes, and Louis Vuitton. And what are we selling? Mid-tier kids' clothes. Everything is under $40. The math just isn't mathing. The rent here must be astronomical; there is no way we are ever, ever making a profit.

The owner? Might as well be a ghost. I've tried to be a good manager. I've sent him super detailed, totally normal emails asking things like:

'Hey, what are our sales goals?'
'How do I order basic things, like shopping bags?'
'Could you explain my core responsibilities?'
His response? Either complete radio silence or he'll send back a single sentence of meaningless corporate buzzword salad that says absolutely nothing. It honestly feels like he's terrified of putting anything in writing.

And it just gets weirder:
The store was visibly abandoned for about a month.
There are no supplies. 
No cash in register 
I did some digging. The company's social media has been dead since 2022.
I found out the owner has a bunch of different LLCs. The company that pays me isn't even the same name as the store.
The store has a roach problem, we get sent boxes of random, low-quality clothes (that I've had to remove the logos from!), and my payday was just moved with no real explanation.
I’ve been texting with a manager at another one of his stores, and I thought she was my one lifeline. But now… I don't know. Every time I point out something insane, she just brushes it off or makes an excuse for the owner. Her 'advice' was that my store should just close and I should just… send her all our inventory? The suggestion felt so sketchy, like she's a gatekeeper, not a colleague.

Honestly, I’m starting to get scared. I'm documenting everything on my personal phone, but I'm in this store alone all day. What on earth do I do? Has anyone seen anything like this? Am I right to be thinking 'money laundering'? How do I get out of this safely without getting into trouble?

TL;DR: My new manager job at a kids' store next to Gucci feels like a front. The owner is a ghost, the store is a mess, the business model is impossible, and my gut is screaming that this is something illegal.""",daddytissues69,39,0.8999999761581421,65,1750365823,2025-06-19 20:43:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lflizv/i_think_my_job_is_a_front_for_something/,6,2025
1lflg8x,Barely started with my degree and I already hate it so much,"For context, I just cmpleted my first year as a CS engineering undergrad and I absolutely hate it. I hate coding so goddang much. I can't seem to remember why did I opt for this field of career at all. For as long as I can remember, I wanted to do something in the healthcare. 

I'm from a third world country where it is considered rather deemed to be going for an engineering major, whereas the other healthcare careers (like nursing, paramedics etc) are rather looked down upon. My parents followed the herd minds and left me no choice but either of being a doctor or an engineer. I could not pass the exam to enroll in med school (to study to be a doctor) and thus, engineering it was. I heavily and entirely rely on my parents to provide me with food, shelter and all the other necessities, even as a 19 year old. It's simply not possible for me to work part time (the parents wouldn't allow it and neither are there feasible options for my schedule as a full time student). They're constantly shouting and calling me names as a failure, or absolute silent treatments because I could not clear the med school exam. It's becming hard to breathe in this household, added on with the overbearing degree. All I can think about is the ways I can leave.

I had biology, physics, chemistry and mathematics in my high school and absolutely loved studying all those subjects. I wished to do a major with the involvement of biology and physics but could not find many in the niche. Neither did I have the liberty to go for it. 

I don't know what am I supposed to do at this point, I just feel stuck and helpless.

1lfl0m7,What is my company doing allowing the coworker who tired following me home back to work?,"I've been with my company for about a year and a half. I have no issues with any of my coworkers or managers. I've never been late, written up, nothing. In the beginning of this year my coworker started doing some odd behavior. Walking past me to force out a fart, I was sitting in my car during my lunch break and he parked next to me and almost hit my car. I told my supervisor about it who spoke to my coworkers supervisor. 

Back in May on my way home he had pulled along side me on the parkway and had motioned for me to pull over mouthing something. He did this for about 10 miles. I had to call 911. The trooper told me no crime was committed so they can't do much but file a report. I've been calling to ask about it and been getting the run around which makes me think they never followed a report. I told my supervisor about what happened and that I didn't feel safe working the following day . It led to a phone call with my supervisor, HR, the head of security and the plant director. 

Other people have reported his behavior. Him staring at them, he circled around my coworker in the company parking lot. It never went above his supervisor. 

HR and my supervisor sat me down yesterday to tell me he's returning to work. They had said they're upset about the situation but they don't know if he'll be in my area again. They had toId me if he does anything to immediately tell them. If he's staring at me or if he's escalating.  I asked my supervisor if I could transfer to another building and he had said he doesn't want to lose me in the area. 

I am so defeated, I am so desperate on what to do with this situation. I spent most of the night that day talking to 988. I'm afraid they're using me as bait to trap him and claim they spoke to him about his behavior and terminate him on harassment.

1lfkw44,"It's hard for me to build relationships at work. Nobody has the same interests, nobody is the same age, and I don't trust my coworkers. What can I do?","So I have had problems in the past keeping jobs. I have ADHD and I'm Neurodivergent. I can talk to people about something I'm not interested in for maybe 5 minutes max, but afterwards I get really drained and just want to stop talking.  
  
Additionally, I just flat out do not trust my coworkers to not screw me over at the top of the hat due to past experiences. 

Example 1:   
Being given the go ahead by my boss to make updates to the website in order to improve SEO, only to have them change their mind last minute and say ""we can't just change these things, it's the face of the company."" (If you didn't want me to make changes why did you give me the go ahead to do it? Why did you approve the page?)

Wrote a blog post as required, gave it to the boss to review, had it approved and posted it live, only for them to make the same excuse of ""This actually doesn't fit our messaging, please remove it"" 

Was tasked with updating search results, which requires creating interlinks within the website. Was asked by them ""why are these words bolded across all our blogs and case studies?"" Had to tell them they were links (yeah, the CMO and the Director of marketing didn't know what a link was, which is insane to think about). 

Then one day they then made up that I was ""Selling engineering  Services"" on the side based on a phone call I had and used that to fire me (I'm in marketing, if I knew how to do engineering why would I take a job making half as much that get's none of the respect?).   
  
The phone call wasn't even business related, someone from my past was asking me the best way to find marketing people to hire for their company (I did freelance work in the past, which this company new about) and I was talking to them on my lunch break about it. Thinking about it, I think they just wanted an excuse to fire me and just pulled something out of their ass instead of having to acknowledge that they just didn't fully understand what I did at their company. 

  
Example 2:  
Was told after 3 months I would be getting promoted up to a client management role, only for them to actually let me go the week after. They said it was because I didn't meet expectations for that client, but I was only given 1 event opportunity to work with them and instead of being allowed to learn from it and improve they just got rid of me. Also, if I wasn't meeting expectations why would you offer me a promotion instead of telling me there were areas I needed to improve on?

  
Example 3:  
I met all the required metrics in order to qualify for my end of the year bonus. However, they said that I wouldn't be getting ANY bonus at all. I asked them why, and they said that ""despite exceeding the required metrics needed, you don't talk as much as we would like in meetings. We were also excited to take you on the work trip but you weren't as communicative on that either, and we expect more from our employees."" To which my response was, if that was important for the bonus why was it not listed on there? If it was I would have spoken up more in order to get it. 

Looking back, they had financial trouble and I fully believe it wouldn't have mattered WHAT I did they would have made up any excuse they could have in order to not pay me my bonus, as that entire department was laid off only a few months later.

ETC.

\------------------------------

Long story short, I have a new position that I am working REALLY hard to keep. I'm even working on my days off to get additional work done. The problem is, I'm running into issues where the teams are asking me for things but they aren't communicating effectively, and I'm afraid IM going to be the one that get's the chopping block AGAIN simply because I'm bad at building up office politics and getting people on my side. 

Example:   
Team is asking me to build out post event emails using content, but they aren't providing me any content, so I have to find it myself. I then create the emails with the content I find, but then they say ""well this won't work"" and only THEN do they provide me with what I need, but by that point they just ""do it themselves"" instead of allowing me to do my job.  
  
Which I'm afraid will make me look bad because they ""had"" to do it, when the reality is they just aren't giving me what I need so I have to try my best to create something relevant because of the timelines we have to get things done.  But they will act like I'm bad at my job instead of just owning up to the fact that they are the ones keeping a project behind. 

  
TLDR: Is there anything I can do to help build work relationships to protect my job when upper management is looking for people to axe for projects not meeting expectations?

1lfk2cx,Advice needed: accidentally lied on my resume,"TL;DR: I applied to my dream job when I thought I was on track to graduate, but now I have to take a summer course to finish my degree. Should I get ahead of it and send an email explaining my situation? Or should I wait and see how it plays out, and just explain if/when confronted? I believe I will be able to get a temporary license by the time I am through training.

  
So, I am kinda a late bloomer/former college dropout. In my twenties, I’ve explored a lot of careers but nothing gave me more joy and fulfillment than working in human services-type roles. I accepted my fate, got my shit together, and went back to school for social work at 27. I have ADHD that was undiagnosed so I never did that hot in school when I was younger, but this time around I was medicated and I KILLED IT. I was so worried I wouldn’t be able to finish I wasn’t even checking my grades— but I graduated with honors!!! Or, I thought I did.

(not) To brag, I also did amazing at my practicum placement and worked my ass off for free for a full year in my dream role. I was very focused on my end goals, so I set myself up to volunteer there the year before my placement and make connections because I knew the placements at this site were competitive. During my placement, I worked to ingrain myself and took on as much work as I could complete efficiently and effectively. My supervisor was very impressed with my work there and to this day texts me about how useful I was and how they miss me. 

When a position opened up at this site a couple weeks before graduation, I immediately applied. I had already passed the ASWB, so I thought that by the time they hired someone I would be licensed. I put on my application that I would graduate in June, which is what I expected.

So, since I’m a non-traditional transfer student there had been a little confusion around my credits. I got an email before my final semester telling me that I was about to reach the maximum number of credits my grant would cover. I told my advisor I wanted to take the bare minimum amount of credits this final semester that would still allow me to graduate and she told me I would be good to just take the final three core classes with no electives. It made me technically a part-time student, but I didn’t want to go over the max amount of credits, right?

Should I have double-checked myself and made sure I was on track to graduate? Yeah, I definitely should have. Maybe I don’t fully understand how this stuff works, but I just thought my advisor would be the one to rely on. Lesson learned, always double check. 

Well, a couple weeks AFTER I walked in front of all my friends and family and got my placeholder diploma, I get an email from a different advisor in the department. I am missing a single credit for an elective, and it is now too late to sign up for the first round of summer classes that end in July. The only one available is a summer course that would have me graduate in August. 

I have a good relationship with the department head so I set up a meeting with her in person to explain my situation and see if there’s anything that can be done, as I now realize I have lied on my job application and will not be licensed until a month into the role. I asked if there’s any credits I’ve taken in the past that would fulfill the requirement, or maybe there’s a chance I could do an accelerated version of the course. No dice. She said if the organization wants me, they’ll find a way to work with me on this. I feel it’s relevant to mention that she’s Dutch, and has very optimistic views on American employers.

So, I have now been hired at my dream job (yay?) and they sent me a schedule that looks like I’ll be in training until the beginning of August. I believe I can get a temporary license before I start doing actual work, since you can apply two weeks before you graduate. Look, I’m low-key super embarrassed and have been hoping maybe it will magically all work out and no one will ever know I “lied“ in the hiring process, so I’ve kinda just been laying low and seeing how this plays out.

Except today I got an email asking for me to fill out some information for a background check which I obviously can’t lie on. I don’t even have the excuse of ignorance anymore, I am currently in week 2 of the summer course. I had to check the box that said I haven’t completed my degree, that I am currently enrolled. 

My question is, should I send my new boss an email explaining the situation so it doesn’t look like I purposefully lied on my initial application? Or should I wait to be asked about it and I can explain what happened in the moment. Is it totally delusional to think that as long as my background check goes through no one will notice? probably. It’s a big organization and I’ve heard stories about people lying about things like this ON PURPOSE and no one ever finding out.

This would be my first salaried job and I worked so hard to get this exact position, it just really sucks that the years of planning might all fall apart at the last second. Maybe my Dutch professor is right and they will work with me. But maybe I’m hard-core coping trying to figure out a way this will be ok lol.

1lfjf7q,How is Cross-Border (US-Canada) Tax Accounting as a Career?,"Sorry in advance for my ignorance.

I'm a freshman in university located in Calgary, Alberta with no clear direction on my career, but I've recently become interested in **Cross-Border Tax Accounting, specifically between Canada and the U.S.** From what I've gathered, this field involves assisting companies and high-net-worth individuals in complying with international tax laws. I've heard it's **growing** and **might not be as stressful as other areas of accounting**, **is that true?**

I'm also interest and like learning about investing and how different tax laws impact returns, if that's relevant to this career path.

I’d really appreciate any insights you have on the following:

* **What does an average day in international tax look like?**
* **How do you get into Cross-Border Tax Accounting during and after school? And does school matter?** I'm in Calgary, Alberta if that matters
* **Is working at a Big 4 firm beneficial for this career, or would a mid-size firm with tax-related experience be better?**
* **Where can I find reliable job expectations—salary, experience levels, growth prospects?**
* **How is the work-life balance?**
* **How common is remote work in these roles?**

I have other questions too, but I don't really know too much about this topic so anything helps. If anyone has insight, I would really appreciate it.

I started new job last year right about year ago. Made real good impression, got an title upgrade and pretty nice salary increase starting this years cycle, something not supposed to be offered to new comer. 

Now second company has approached me for interviews and possibly job offer. Second company should offer higher pay than what I will get after my title upgrade in current job. 

Now I kinda like my current job, and if I decide to stay don't want to rock boat too much as we get along with boss pretty well. But I work for money and if other company offers substantially higher pay, I might need to accept it. 

The question is, how could I approach asking for bigger raise, without coming off as too cocky or big for my shoes. I know my current company would be in trouble with the client I work with as I became the go to guy for that client in our team, but saying this point feels a bit mean to me. I suck at asking raises and after already one in the books I have no idea how to approach this situuation.

1lfj7yk,New firm is not budging on joining date and bonus+hike,"While negotiating an offer with a new firm (it's a Big 4), the HR agreed to offer me a small joining bonus and hike over the existing offer (both combined would be around 5.5% of initial base compensation) provided I joined by x date. Her reasoning was that there's a new project and if I join by this date then client and project team will have bandwidth to offer the increase. The initial offer had a system driven deadline, she asked me to accept that and later when my joining date is confirmed she agreed over email to make the changes in compensation if needed.

I later asked her if I could instead join by x+14, or at least x+7 days, due to some personal reasons (she didn't ask me for precise reasons here) after getting an early relieving from my last organisation and still be eligible for the increment and JB. For context I'm visiting my sister and her 8 month old niece abroad right now.

She said she'd let me know in a week, but after consistent reminders we finally spoke over WhatsApp after more than 3 weeks (from the day I asked for the late joining). She said the team can't offer the increment and JB as the client isn't agreeing, the joining date is critical etc and I can join later but I won't get the hike or JB. 

I'm abroad at my sister's right now, and the flight rescheduling/cancellation will cost me quite a lot, around 1/4 of the JB and increment. The entire episode has left a bad taste in the mouth, and I'm questioning the culture if the team has zero flexibility for accepting a small hike and a 7 days delay

1. Am I right to think this way, or am I being overly entitled? The ego driven and emotional part of me wants to tell off the HR for responding after 3 weeks and rescind the acceptance but I know that'd foolhardy in this market and scenario without a backup offer. 

2. Is it possible that HR is playing me, by deliberately not responding for 3 weeks and now resurfacing with a negative answer?

Tldr: New firm and HR agreed to offer small (5.5%) joining bonus and increment if I join by x date, I asked them if I could still get these if I join by x+7 or x+14, they denied.

I have an associates degree in business and 5 years of management t plus all the skills and Icar from here. This place has gotten so bad and each new higher up they add makes it worse our manager cannot manage anything and lets us get walked all over. The techs are allowed to speak to us and do whatever they want come and go and they blame me and the other service advisor for everything. I’m at my wits end we were told like a week ago our shop opens at 7:30 and we are now expected to be in 15 minutes early and to work Saturdays as they deem it necessary. We were already working 7:30-5:30 and when I asked if we would be compensated was laughed at and told “your exempt from overtime as a commissioned service advisor” my manager lies about us to protect the techs in the back and I’ve been flat told I won’t be getting any raises or a promotion. I’ve asked to swap to a lower position and been told no asked to transfer to a different location and told no. I’ve been written up for small little things while one of our techs got caught stealing and was given a write up and I was made to call and explain it and apologize.,dribbydrubbs-,1,1.0,0,1750359033,2025-06-19 18:50:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lfiron/collision_estimator/,6,2025
1lfiqdd,"I need a second job, but my boss at my current job will likely let me go if she finds out I’m trying to work two jobs.","I work part-time for a company I love. The job has been amazing for my mental health, and I plan to stay here for as long as I can. Unfortunately, they don't offer health insurance to part-time employees, and they have been unwilling to make me full-time. I've offered to take on additional roles if it meant FT status and they didn't budge. 

This means I'm paying for health insurance on the marketplace with an ACA subsidy. I make $33k/year (have made $11k/year so far), and I have already hit my $5k/year deductible. That's not even taking the premium into consideration (though honestly the $102/month premium is not the problem). I have multiple chronic health issues and I'm working through some acute ones, so I need comprehensive health insurance.

Since I want to continue working for this company, I figured I'd just find another part-time job at different hours at a company that offers health insurance to part-time employees. However, my boss has let people go for stating they don't make enough money with the company (""it would be unfair to the employee to continue employing them at a wage they can't live on, so we need to let them go so we're not taking advantage""). She has also let people go for looking for second jobs or learning they have one (""it's unfair that the employee is overworking themselves so they can afford to live. If they're not working for us, they can find a job that pays what they need""). She feels guilty that the company can't give them the life they need, so she sets them free.

This puts me in a bind. It took me years to find a job that didn't conflict with my mental health. This is the first time in my entire working history where I didn't have to take a 12-week-long FMLA to do intensive mental healthcare from stress brought on by work. Two jobs would be better than just this one, but this job is better than none. I also know that just because I ask employers not to contact my boss, doesn't mean they're going to listen. They may contact my boss anyway.

How do I approach this?

To relocate is impossible unless I would have a job lined up. IF I did relocate the there would be only one or two of those type of jobs in the area I would be relocacting to as those jobs are disappearing at an alaming rate.

I started high school determined to just get accepted to a good college and work at a company so that I at least have a decent stable income. However ever since high school I’ve mostly done science related things. For example, this year I took my first ever AP (cuz last year I gave up on myself) which was AP Bio. I ended up really really enjoying AP Bio and I’ve also gained an interest in statistics so I thought about going into biostats but it’s mostly a grad school thing which my parents don’t exactly support me doing. So i settled on business analytics or accounting for a bit but that was a bust cuz accounting sounds terrible. Recently i’ve had a big interest in public health and finally thought I found something I would srsly enjoy and wanna do but I scrolled through some posts abt it and everyone says it’s impossible to get a job and it’s a useless degree unless i do a masters in it. I’m so confused and lost rn cuz atp my only option is to be some type of company worker n work myself to death doing a job I don’t even enjoy. Can someone pls help me and give me any advice on basically anything, I really need it. 

If anyone wants to help me find a major these are the main things i’ve been taking into account when thinking of majors and future careers: 
- In AP Bio I liked learning the big concepts and how to apply them into situations and connect concepts together.
- My fav part of stats is finding patterns in results and essentially finding the mean 
- I’m the type of person who asks a lot of questions cuz I can’t do things without knowing 100% that what I’m doing is correct 
- I like doing the same thing everyday so I try to find work that won’t throw things at me or introduce sudden change, basically i like having a fixed schedule that i do everyday (Ex: I analyze charts, interpret them, go home)

Currently I'm finish a second semester in MSc cognitive science and switching to media informatics as the former one is just not as interesting and broad as I've hoped for (specifically in the uni's program sense). I'm going into the latter one simply because I have little idea as what to do, learned programming in my BA, and like doing creative stuff/working with people. But I just... don't know what I can actually do.

I know my interests. I like translating/interpreting, and even do it couple times a month, but the field is dying out, so getting a degree is foolish.

1lfewij,Looking for advice. Feeling (26M) very helpless and lost,"I believe we're all on the same boat. Massive company layoffs all across the globe, being replaced with AI, so on.

My story is a little different, and I'll try to summarize as much as possible.

I moved to Canada as an international student about 8 years ago. Finished a 2 year diploma in Digital Media, while working at my current company (first job I got when I moved) in retail. This company used to be fantastic when I started; lots of opportunities, lots of growth options, you could tell the CEO was incredibly people-first and people oriented. Nonetheless, I was focused on finding a job as a Graphic Designer or an Illustrator. I was very passionate about art back in the day. Once things started looking up, COVID hit.

Went back to in person work around 2021. I had gotten a great opportunity in the Merchandising department, but due to a company restructuring situation, that opportunity was lost. I was promoted into leadership the following year, only to be told that I wasn't ready and I should go back to my retail job 6 months later (I had 2 separate leaders in those 6 months because the former left for a regional training position). Both spoke negatively about me constantly, but my former leader—whom I had worked under for 5 years—was absolutely awestruck about that statement. He trained me, he knew I was ready, and he vouched for me constantly. I had a close to perfect record, so this was another punch in the gut.

Another company reorg and now there's layoffs happening company wide. Constantly. I make less than $52k a year, with no higher pay or wiggle room in the company whatsoever. I've had 3 separate interviews (1 in HR, 1 in analysis, 1 for a lead role) within the company, 2 at a different company under referral. All entry level. Rejected because someone else had a bit more tech. experience, or a bit more something than me. 

To say I'm burnt out is an understatement, and thankfully I'm in therapy or else I probably wouldn't be typing this.

I've lost 8 years already to this company, 6 years since I got my diploma. I'm considering going to  university again and potentially complete a program that would get me a Communications degree in 2 years, and potentially do a combined degree with either Economics or Psychology. But I am absolutely lost. I rarely draw anymore, I used to do show jumping and now I can't even afford to take lessons (which is something I've always been passionate about). I genuinely feel like I have no purpose and I'm falling behind. I've got a partner who's almost done with his science degree and is enjoying all these cool opportunities and I just hope I can do something like that too and not be a bum anymore. He doesn't mind, in fact he's the reason I'm even pursuing university at all—he's the healthiest relationship I've ever had (I've had abusive partners and emotionally immature partners before), so I want to be the best person I can be.

I've had my family do a couple intervention-esque sit downs with me, and they all say the same: ""we don't know how you're going to survive, because we know you can't unless we're helping you"". Now that my parents got their permanent residency, I moved back in with them and pay a lot less in rent and have cut most of my expenses. My brother (37m) is incredibly successful in finance, my sister (39f) is now becoming very successful in psychology, so now I'm left with a very deep sense of uselessness and nothingness. I'd rather be let go than quit, honestly, at least get some severance and take time off.

I have no savings, I can't just walk out, unfortunately.. I just want to be better and make my folks proud.

Tldr; I've given my current company 8 years of my life and every opportunity I get gets snubbed out of me, I have severe burnout, everyone around me is more successful than I am, and I'm at a genuine loss for where to go to next. I don't want to choose the wrong career, and the job market is absolutely atrocious. Advice would be welcome.

1lfeq0l,Going on a special assignment - how much of a raise is reasonable?,"Going on a special assignment - how much of a raise is reasonable?

For some quick context, I (21) have been working with a local (big, not small) grocery chain for 5 years now. I started as a cart pusher, and after 2 years, I became the front-end Manager (handling the entire financial side of the store, managing all 60+ cashiers, courtesy clerks, cart pushers, etc.....). I've gotten promoted 6 times, and I've built up a robust reputation across the company, often helping out at a dozen or so stores across the company as well as taking on much more responsibility than my current role requires. Currently I've been pushing for a store manager position, and although corporate really wants to promote me again, I've gotten to the point where we don't have anyone to take my current role.

  
Now we're in the process of buying a new store, and corporate asked if I wanted to open it (in my current role). It would be a temporary assignment (at most a year), the goal would be to train the previous owners' employees how we run things and just get it up and running. After I have it running smoothly, we would promote someone there, and then I would get my promotion.

  
They haven't specified any amount yet since we don't take over for a few months, but they did tell me I would get a salary increase - here comes my question:

  
How much should I ask for?

  
My current salary is as follows:

  
\- $56,135 annual salary 

\- Max $1,500 bonus per quarter ($6,000 yearly). At my current store, I max out every time, but this would be a lot harder at a brand new store...

  
Total: $62,135 (max)

  
The new store is an additional 20 miles per day, and since I'll have a major workload, it's safe to assume I'll be there at least 6 days a week.

  
What I think would be reasonable is this:

  
\+5% base salary ($2806/yr)

\+$3,338 for gas (5200 additional miles/yr times $0.0655)

\+ First two quarters' bonus guaranteed (I could live without this one but it would be nice)

  
Total increase: +$6,144

Final salary: $62,279

  
I would like to get as much as I can, especially because I only have two more promotions before I basically hit the top, but I also don't want to walk in and ask for way too much. Keeping in mind, this whole move is to set up a promotion for me.

1lfdz2n,Need Advice: Infosys vs LTIMindtree vs Wipro | Tier 3 College Student | Focused on Learning & Experience,"Hi everyone,
I'm a final-year student from a tier-3 engineering college and I’ve received placement offers from three companies:

Infosys – ₹3.9 LPA

LTIMindtree – ₹4 LPA

Wipro – ₹4.5 LPA

Honestly, I'm not very strong in DSA or competitive programming right now. At this stage, my main goal is to gain exposure to how the corporate world works, understand team dynamics, and see if this path suits me. I don’t want to risk a bad first experience just for a slightly higher package. I’d rather choose a company where the learning curve is solid, the environment is healthy, and I get the chance to grow gradually.

I’d truly appreciate any insights from those who have worked at or have knowledge about these companies – in terms of training, work culture, projects, and real career growth.

Also, if there are any other subreddits or platforms (other than r/cscareerquestionsIN) where I can post to get better advice, please do let me know. I’m trying to make a thoughtful decision, and any help would mean a lot.

1lfdy3y,Reason why i left my previous company,"Hi fellow friends. So I've got an interview tomorrow, kinda last minute but I just secured a spot.

And the question i've got to be most prepared on is ""Why did I leave my previous role?""

A little backstory, so my most recent role I quit shortly after just 3 weeks Reason being the company just wasn't good, the people were not that nice, asking questions about projects you will be labelled as incompetent, not proactive or asking for handout. Everything I do is a guess work. Other that that, i can't pin point anything else, just being there felt very wrong. 

So what do I tell my next employer? How do I avoid sounding like I'm just saying stuff and also to stay away from making my previous company look bad. Because the last thing i want is for people to think i bad mouth about other companies.

1lfdubb,How to be motivated to connect to people/your work?,"How do you find the motivation to connect with people/your work?

LONG RAMBLING TEXT!

As someone in a final graduate years of a logistics company, I’m often put into business units every x period where I’ll be learn in something again from scratch. 

In my honest opinion, I don’t often see the appeal or interest in the business units I’m exposed in so I often find the lack of motivation to delve deeper in my work e.g enquire about the strategy and long term affect of my operational duties etc. I, however, find myself interested in a specific concept (could be marketing/finance/data - not saying here), so I struggle to not pay incredibly specific attention to some of the unrelated workload team members push onto me as a graduate. 

I see these as ticking boxes and onto the next, and whilst I have received gratitude on the work relating to my concept interests/people asking me to replicate that work for their team as no one on their department can do it - I often find myself not talking much in the periodic meetings with stakeholders or I would initially write notes, but the information would be in such detail, I couldn’t really comprehend them as a team newcomer/have no part in them so I can’t give a comment when it turns to me as a “anything from you mr x?”

As an introvert, I often too get the feedback where I don’t seem to put my hand up for meetings or build connections with the team (which I understand is part of me treating uninteresting work as ticking off boxes)

How do you guys (especially those only 1 day in office people) build that team connection early on in a team? Would my uninterested consistent demeanour mean that the company/industry isnt for me or I should at least persue a role in the business unit of the job type I enjoy? 

I think I put myself into too much of a “victim hood” mindset where I don’t think a graduates opinion would be valued (on the topics not related to that one interest of mine) in addition to being demotivated to approach team members who would often respond in hours at a time to me/only have time for a catch-up meeting for 30 mins in the whole week. 

I ask a lot of questions when briefed on a task e.g output/stakeholders but I just complete those parameters with later feedback nearing my rotation end, that I didn’t fufil this vision or approach which wasnt initially provided in the brief e.g just build/map this model for x department with provided numbers but feedback months later on is that I should’ve also instructed on my interpretations of what I made rather than something the team could do themselves, which was instructed to me. 

I’m aware graduates are supposed to ask questions a lot etc but I simply find myself uninterested in the business units I’m put in/i want to develop my skill sets around that interest where I’m able to do the things I’ve done cause of my past role experience doing that stuff.

1lfcsx4,When to leave if things are OK but not great,"I manage a team of managers that I have built up as I've grown our department from 2 to 10 people. Base is $225k, fully remote. Been at the company for a little over 5 years. The job is stressful because of timelines and presentations and expectations, but also because of my own issues around stress that I know I put on myself. In other words, I *could* reduce my stress with some effort.

I have an opportunity to move to a slightly smaller (but still >2k employee) company, with a better title, and do literally the *exact same* thing again I've done the past 5 years. i.e. take over a small team and build the processes, managers, and grow the deliveries to match everything I do now. The job description is a literal mirror of my resume. In other words, I know I would be successful and that multi-year team/department building is something I really enjoy. But it would be a $20k pay cut (still fully remote).

I am leaning toward staying where I am and focusing on improving myself (which would likely also make me a better manager). I am worried I would bring my stress to the new job and would end up with less pay and the same amount of stress. On the other hand, I've been *really really* stressed the past 12 months, often working some version of 6am-6pm, and the grass looks nice and green on the other side of the fence.

My wife sees me as being miserable in my current job and thinks the move is worth it even for the chance it would be less stressful. I worry about walking away from a company that adores me, throws bonuses and stock at me (beyond the base salary), and I like my coworkers, and walking into an unknown situation even if the hiring manager seems like a decent person.

1lfcp63,"I'm 4 years into an SWE career, how do I stop feeling like such a failure?","I'm a bootcamp-educated software engineer. I have been working since late 2020, with a 7 month stint of unemployment last year after getting terminated from the startup I was working for with zero warning or explanation. Needless to say, that long of a stint, as well as the way I was treated upon termination, made me feel absolutely un-hireable and was a huge blow to my confidence. I finally landed a kickass job at another startup last November building a really cool platform that's set to launch this year. I was brought in as a contractor with the hope of getting hired on full time eventually.

I have felt underqualified for this job from the very start. It's an environment in which almost everyone is at at least a senior level, and I'm by far the weakest technically. My company really values people's integrity and overall vibes though, and I believe I was a personality hire. I do get along great with my coworkers and everyone likes me. But I have to work so much harder than everyone else just to stay afloat, and I feel like I'm a drain on the company's limited resources because of how much hand holding I need. This feeling has become even starker over the last month as they've moved me to a part of the code base that I have no prior experience with.

My coworkers are very invested in my growth. My manager and my manager's manager meet with me every week to discuss how I can improve. I'm really grateful for it, but I can't help but feel so incredibly inferior. I wish I didn't need so much coddling. It doesn't help that I'm a woman working with a bunch of men. Typical in the software engineering space but that doesn't mean I don't experience difficult feelings that come with being a minority when I'm at work, compounded with being the rookie. I have been questioning my aptitude for this career lately. I just want this feeling to end, to stop feeling like an impostor and to start really contributing instead of being a resource suck. It's been 7 months now of contract work. Part of the reason why they haven't hired me on full time yet has to do with venture capital hiring cycles, but I think if they really wanted to offer me that spot, they could have already.

Does anyone have advice for me? Can anyone relate? Will it all pay off eventually? Please help. I'm feeling so discouraged and undeserving of my place at my current job.

1lfcbqh,Need a “what’s next?” plan.. feeling extremely stuck in my career!,"So I graduated in graphic design, found the job market in this field to be extremely competitive, and now I’m an administrative assistant and I completely fucking hate it. It’s not for me, but I’m at a crossroads right now. I’m planning on quitting soon, even though the job market is absolute shit, just because I can’t take it anymore. But i’m lost on what to do next because of how competitive graphic design is. While i’d love to get back into my field of study, I know it won’t be easy and it could take months to years before I find something in that industry.

So now Im trying to figure out a plan for what’s next. Do I take a random part time job and follow my passion on the side (graphic design)? But what if that doesn’t pay the bills, and what if turning my passion into a job causes me to hate it?

I’ve also thought about learning web development because I think it could potentially be a more stable and lucrative career choice. But, I already spent 4 years getting a degree in design; I’m scared to learn something else and not be able to find a job in that either, wasting more time and money.

So what should I do? Should I take the risk and try to monetize my passions, or should I go the more stable route and try to get into something that will always have demand for work? 

At this point in my career, I just want to feel like I’m getting my life on track and building something that will get me far in life. My bf and I live in a HCOL area and we want to be able to get married soon and live together.. I just need some direction to get there.

1lf9xf4,"This little-known eBook changed how I think about work, purpose, and growth — here’s my honest reflection","I've been going through a lot of changes in my job, feeling burned out, and that strange feeling of doing everything ""right"" but still not feeling connected. I was really surprised when I found an eBook a few weeks ago. No fluff, no big promises—just useful ideas that work.

The name of the book is ""If Only Someone Had Told Me: Proven Secrets to Build a Successful Career and a Meaningful Life."" I didn't expect much, but it turned out to be the kind of book I wish I'd read years ago.

This is what I noticed:

1. Before you try to plan your future, get to know yourself.

A lot of us set goals without really knowing what makes us tick. One of the first things we did was figure out what our most important values and interests were. 

2. Don't just make plans. Make them fit with who you are.

There is a chapter on setting goals that goes beyond general tips for getting things done. It's more about making goals that are important to you based on who you are and where you want to go, not just what other people expect of you. That change made me rethink some plans I had that were on autopilot.

3. Skills are important, especially the ones that aren't hard.

People talk a lot about hard skills, but this book showed that communication, empathy, and time management are often what make people successful in the long run. I've started working on those on purpose, not just technical things.

4. Trust is more important than connections in networking.

There is a great part about real networking that isn't about ""getting ahead"" but about making connections with other people. The idea of giving something of value before asking for something stuck with me.

5. Being burnt out is not something to be proud of.

The part about stress and burnout was probably the most interesting. It went against the idea that working all the time makes you valuable. Since then, I've added nights of digital detox and real rest to my week. Changes that are easy to make can have a big effect.

6. People don't give communication enough credit.

The communication section talked about why so many talented people are missed and what to do about it, from body language to active listening. It made me more aware of how I talk and act when I talk to people.

7. No one teaches you how to be flexible.

The world changes quickly, and being able to look at problems in a new way and learn new things quickly is very valuable. The book offered frameworks that actually help build that adaptability muscle.

8. Life is more than just a job. Not the entire thing.

Perhaps the most significant realization is that something is wrong if your work takes up all of your identity. I was reminded by the book that meaning, balance, and alignment are more important for fulfillment than success.

Concluding thoughts

This book isn't popular or viral. And I think that's why I enjoyed it more. It sounds more like guidance from a real-life experience than a sales pitch. When I feel like I'm veering off course, I still return to specific sections.

It's worth reading if you're in a transitional stage or are simply unsure of your direction.

 Simply search for the e-book If Only Someone Had Told Me: Proven Secrets to Build a Successful Career and a Meaningful Life on Google.

Here's what I've done so far to build my DevOps profile:

 * I completed a Cloud Engineer Bootcamp (AWS, Azure, GCP) in June 2024 from Upgrad. 

 * I've focused heavily on hands-on application through two significant end-to-end DevOps projects:

  * CI/CD Pipeline for a 3-Tier LMS Web App: This involved designing and implementing a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline, containerizing with Docker, deploying to Amazon EKS, and managing infrastructure with Terraform. I even focused on quantifiable improvements like reducing manual deployment time by 80% (from 2 hours to 20 minutes), supporting over 100 daily builds, and establishing 3 distinct environments (dev, test, demo).

* AWS-Native CI/CD for a Real-time Chat App: Here, I used AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Terraform, EKS, and CloudWatch for automation and monitoring. I achieved consistent deployments (avg. 3 weekly) and ensured seamless rolling updates.

 *  My technical toolkit includes AWS, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Jenkins, Terraform, Git, Linux, Python, and Bash.

I understand that coming from a non-CS/IT background and lacking prior formal tech internships puts me at a disadvantage. I see many peers getting opportunities, often having prior tech internships or official cloud provider certifications. I feel like there's a significant experience and visibility gap I'm not closing effectively.

My questions to the community are:

 1. For someone transitioning from a non-CS/IT background like mine, what are the most impactful improvements I can make to my resume or overall job search strategy to get initial interview calls for DevOps internships?

 2. How can I best articulate my transferable skills (e.g., problem-solving from engineering) and my project experience to compensate for the lack of formal tech work history?

 3. Would investing in an official AWS Associate-level certification (e.g., Solutions Architect Associate) be a critical differentiator at this stage, specifically for career switchers? or any associate certificate for instance terraform would help me ?

 4. Are there particular types of personal projects or open-source contributions that are highly valued for demonstrating job-readiness for a DevOps intern, especially for someone transitioning?

 5.Any specific advice on networking or direct outreach strategies that have proven effective for career switchers in DevOps?

I'm incredibly determined and eager to learn and contribute to a real-world team. Any guidance, big or small, would be immensely helpful.
Thanks in advance for your time and insights!

- PPT skills 
- Research skills
- Excel and coding skills
- People skill (to be developed)

1lf5d6t,"please help, I’m unsure of the job offer I accepted","hello everyone, I recently received a job offer from a company I applied for and they only gave me less than a day of deadline to sign the acceptance form. So out of panic, I signed it and emailed it to them. (Not a wise move on my part, ig)

The job position they offered is what I always wanted but there are a few reasons why I’m so hesitant to push through with it.

First is during the interview process, the HR person that interviewed me was so unprofessional and kept disappearing on me for each question. They also had me take an examination that is not even related to the position I was applying for. Out of all the companies I applied to, they were the only one to give me such a complicated test. I thought it was weird and my other friends who work in the same position also find it weird.

I went to the office and I’m not feeling the environment and vibe as well. I don’t feel excited to work there at all.

Second, is the salary they offered is way below the range of what I gave them. There are several more reasons but I don’t want to make this post so long. 

There are pros as well like the location is close to where I live so commute is easy and I also like the industry they’re in and… that’s about it.

So, I’m not sure if these are just nerves that’s making me so hesitant to work for this company since this is also my first ever job or if my gut feeling is telling me that something is off.

Have you been in a situation like this? If so, how did you handle it? I can really use an advice right now :(( And also… can I withdraw the acceptance for the job offer?

1lf534j,Trying to Move Beyond – Anyone Made the Jump?,"Hey Everyone!

I wanted to share a bit about my journey and the challenge I’m currently facing in my career.

A few years ago, I started out as an Information Technology graduate working as an associate at a firm specializing in Odoo ERP services. Over time, I grew within that ecosystem — first moving into a Software Developer role focused entirely on Odoo's stack, and later transitioning into a Functional Consultant role, still working with Odoo.

While I’m grateful for the growth and experience, I now find myself wanting to explore other technologies and enterprise systems like SAP, Oracle, or Microsoft Dynamics. The issue is, I feel like being deeply specialized in Odoo has unintentionally limited me. I worry that recruiters see me as too niche — or even consider me an ""associate-level"" candidate again — just because my experience hasn’t extended beyond that specific ERP.

Has anyone been through something similar?
Any advice on how to bridge this gap or position myself in a way that companies would be open to giving me a shot in a new ERP or tech stack?

Would love to hear your thoughts!

I decided as I got in to my senior year of college that what I was studying wasn’t really something I see myself doing long term. The field is very saturated, many of my peers and friends that graduated in the field either couldn’t find a job after school or found one and got laid off after some time. I got married recently and started working full time so I put a pause on school for now. I am looking for something that is a more reliable long term career path so I can provide for my family. 

The reason I am considering the aviation field is because I currently work at an airline on the ramp level and find myself very fascinated by these machines that allow us to travel from one end of the world to the other. I like doing things that are more hands on and involve me actively working instead of siting at a computer all day. I also have an uncle that works in the aviation industry as an AMT and he’s spoken highly of the field. I don’t know too much about the mechanical side of aviation hence why I’m asking for advice. 

Is this something I should pursue or should I look in to another field?

I took this role for growth, better income potential, and a chance to break into sales. It seemed promising at first, but five months in, the company is a mess—disorganized, chaotic, and led by a CEO who is a egotistical A-hole who plays favorites and is very unreliable. He supports a select few while the rest of us are left to figure things out on our own, with little to no training.

Despite that, I’ve managed to close several deals, bringing in nearly $300K in revenue over the past two months. But I’ve only been paid $5,500 so far. They keep changing the rules—cutting commissions, giving us small draws upfront on sold jobs and delaying payments until months later and forcing unpaid work and ""mandatory"" meetings. It’s clear they’re financially unstable and possibly can’t pay what they owe.

Now they’re firing people for questionable reasons, pushing us to give up half our commissions to hourly estimators, and assigning only cold leads to the rest of us while favorites get the good ones. A few of us have started pushing back.

I’ve been offered a job back in the tree industry doing sales, but it’s hourly with no commission. Most other jobs I’m interested in require more experience or a degree and won’t give me a shot.

1lf0r5m,Promotion delayed. How should I frame my mindset?,"Looking for some outside perspective.

I’ve been working full-time at my current company for under a year (worked as a contractual consultant for a year before).  My manager is generally supportive, and some team leads have been advocating for my promotion. I was told a few times that it was coming soon, but it’s been delayed twice due to broader business reasons.

Now, someone who joined a couple months after me will be promoted at the same time. They’re a bit on the older side and handle a high-pressure market like me, so I get it — but I still feel a bit disheartened. I’ve been managing things quite independently and taking on extra responsibilities, so it’s hard not to feel like the delays undermined my efforts.

I’m trying to stay logical about it — I know promotions aren’t always based purely on merit and there are often bigger business factors at play. Still, I feel frustrated and a bit let down.

Here’s where I’m at now:
- Planning to start applying to external roles — even if the promotion happens soon, I want to test my market value and keep my options open.
- Pulling back a bit on all the “extra” work I was voluntarily doing. Still delivering, just not overextending myself anymore.

Would love input on two things:
- How do you stay composed at work when you’re feeling undervalued or stuck?
- How many external job applications should I aim for per week while working full-time?

Any insights from folks who’ve been through something similar would be super helpful.",Old_Singer9745,1,1.0,0,1750303760,2025-06-19 03:29:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lf0r5m/promotion_delayed_how_should_i_frame_my_mindset/,6,2025

1lezxjz,Just not feeling it,"Hi, 

Mainly looking to vent i guess.

I have been working with my current company since 4 months. For context, I have previously worked in M&A consulting for 3 years before moving to Canada. Landed my first interview for my current FP&A role within 6 weeks of me being here, and i decided to move forward with it given the job market + my goal of getting into corporate strategy.

There are so many things that are right here. Team? Amazing. Salary + benefits? Pretty good for Canadian entry-level standards. Commute? Nil. However, I am absolutely drained. I have a 50 hour work which I am more than comfortable with. However, 2 weeks into the role, I've been putting in 12+ hours nearly everyday. I have no time for hobbies or studies (pursuing CPA at the moment). I worked almost, if not more, hours in M&A but I enjoyed it immensely.

I think 2 of the biggest challenges that the company faces are constant restructuring (hence multiple rounds of layoffs in the recent years) and lack of established  processes. The company has literally been figuring things as it goes even though it has existed for like idk 60 years.

I feel ungrateful for whining about this because I clearly lucked out given the job market, but I'm not enjoying the role. I am trying to improve my skills through my mistakes and lack of dedication towards the role, but i don't think I'm going to stay here for more than a year. I know it's just a job and there's nothing personal, but my probation got over early, and I feel bad for not wanting to stick around despite my manager recognizing my potential. However, at the same time, I also have this constant worry that I might get fired any day, so idk how to reconcile these 2 things.

Has anyone been in a company where a lot of things were right but the work just didn't click? How long did you stay in the company for? TIA! ",PotentialCup0,1,1.0,2,1750301166,2025-06-19 02:46:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lezxjz/just_not_feeling_it/,6,2025
1lezpde,What kind education would I pursue surrounding my interests in building houses?,"This might be an odd question, but I’m really looking for some guidance in my education/career.

I’ve been building and designing houses in games for years now—it’s become a special interest of mine. I can spend hours working on layouts, decorating interiors, and carefully thinking through every little detail. It’s something I genuinely enjoy and get completely absorbed in.

I just finished my second year of university as a business student, but to be honest, I’m not really enjoying it. Im not the smartest person, and I’m autistic, which makes learning in a traditional academic setting more difficult for me. That said, when I am interested in something, I learn incredibly quickly and with a lot of motivation.

Looking ahead, I really want to build a life and career that I actually enjoy. I know no job will be perfect all the time, but if I end up in a field I’m not passionate about, I worry it’ll make my depression worse and affect my overall well-being. I truly believe that doing something I love is key to maintaining my mental health and living a more fulfilling life.

Given how much I enjoy building and design, do you think it would be a smart idea to explore a different educational path? If I were to switch majors, what kinds of programs or careers might align with those interests?

1leywea,Switching to conversational design FAST: Roast my plan (Need brutal feedback!),"I'm in a critical career transition and need your honest advice. 

Currently unemployed, I'm barely scraping by with freelance social media work (*low pay*). **I need a stable job ASAP**, but I want it to strategically align with my long-term goal: becoming a conversational design/Chatbot specialist.

I've drafted an ""accelerated ladder"" plan to balance financial survival with skill-building, leveraging my background in Digital Marketing, CX, and light Product Owner Junior experience.

My plan:

1. Foundation & immediate action (URGENT)

* Double down on Digital Marketing (copywriting, funnels, personas, SEO) for business context.
* Grind UX Writing + Conversational Design basics simultaneously.
* Build a portfolio NOW – microcopy rewrites, chatbot flows, writing samples (proof of skills).

2. Bridge roles (Priority for quick hire)

Ideal Target: Junior Product Content Designer / UX Writer roles (or PwD-inclusive roles).

Fallback Options:

* Tech-focused Copywriter (SaaS/Product)
* Digital Content Analyst
* Customer Success Analyst (if remote + well-paid)

3. Specialization (\~1 Year Later)

* Aim for Mid-Level UX Writer or direct conversational design roles.

# My Ask:

* **Does this plan make sense?**
* **What would you ADD/REMOVE to land a job faster?**
* **Any** ***crucial*** **tips for breaking into conversational design urgently?**

Be brutally honest.I need real talk, not sugarcoating.

1leyudm,Should I stay or leave?,"
Let me preface this post by saying, I understand it's ultimately my decision and no one knows me/my life better than myself. I'm just genuinely stuck in the middle and want opinions. 


About me: I'm in my early 20s, single mom. Currently in online school for nursing. 

I'm currently employed at an insurance company. I work M-F 8:30-5:00pm. I have a hybrid WFH schedule (Mon&Fri). This job is a 30-40 minute commute during the summer but with school traffic it's about 40-60 minutes. I actually enjoy being around my coworkers and the office is probably as enjoyable as any office could be (I think so anyways?) Tues-Thurs I'm waking up at 530am and getting home at 6pm. Hourly pay is $22, I have decent benefits and accrue 1.5 PTO days a month. 

I've been offered a new job with the following details: Fully WFH, M-F, 9am-6pm, also at an insurance company. They seem to have pretty good benefits and offer a little bit more PTO hours (don't remember exactly how many) and the pay is $22.31 plus a $50 internet service stipend. 

Although I would love to WFH to avoid commuting, gas, wear&tear, etc... I'm worried about regretting my decision to leave my current position because 
1. i might miss the social aspect of working in office 
2. not liking the culture/management style at the new job.

1lex2dv,Feeling Undervalued as a Finishing PhD—Anyone Else in the Same Boat?,"Hi everyone,

I'm finishing up my PhD in Food Science this summer. For background, I went straight from earning my B.S. in Chemistry into a Master’s in Food Science, then rolled straight into the PhD program—so I’ve had no industry experience until recently.

About a year ago, my advisor began prioritizing other students, and I was left running the lab, managing research projects, and mentoring newer students academically. It got to the point where I decided to start applying for jobs. I landed an interview at a major CPG company for an R&D scientist contractor role. Unbeknownst to me, the hiring manager was a close friend of my advisor, and they called my advisor behind the scenes (I hadn't listed them as a reference), which blew my cover. Ironically, that seemed to make my advisor finally start paying attention and push me toward graduating on time.

I’ve now been at this big CPG company for 7 months. I’ve had great performance—bringing in internal testing capabilities projected to save the company millions annually. Despite that, I’m still a contractor, and while I survived recent layoffs, the company isn’t doing well financially.

Recently, they opened up several Associate Scientist roles in my department. Although the title says “Associate,” the job responsibilities are equivalent to Scientist—HR downgraded the title due to FTE limits. Oddly enough, while I'm being offered this downgraded Associate role, technicians in the same department are being promoted to “Associate Scientist” titles but will remain in technician-level roles. For context, this company typically offers PhDs a Scientist or Senior Scientist position. HR admitted I’m overqualified but said I can still get the Associate role—just with a starting salary and no eligibility for promotion for 2–3 years.

So, I started applying externally. I got an interview and then an offer from another major CPG company nearby. Originally, I interviewed for a **Scientist** role with a $95K salary and 5% bonus. However, HR called and said I’m “severely underqualified” for the Scientist title but they still want to offer me the job—as an **Associate Scientist** at $75K. I pushed back, saying I don’t believe I’m underqualified and asked for $80K. They responded that even $80K was too high. I’m confused because this is the same role I was interviewed for with the same responsibilities and originally offered $95K.

I can’t tell if I’m being lowballed, or if this is just how things are right now due to the economy. I know other fresh PhDs who walked into Senior Scientist roles right out of grad school. I have strong analytical experience (GC, HPLC, method development, etc.) and have delivered measurable impact at my current job.

Is anyone else going through something similar? Am I missing something here? Would love to hear other perspectives—especially from folks in food science, chemistry, or related CPG roles.",Southern-Example-577,1,1.0,3,1750292623,2025-06-19 00:23:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lex2dv/feeling_undervalued_as_a_finishing_phdanyone_else/,6,2025

1lev754,CPA to Artist,"Hi! 24F. I entered the accounting field in a roundabout way. I was a design major for 3.5 years then switched to accounting (for a number of random reasons) but it was always my middle-term life plan and I do want to go back to art at some point. I recently started in public accounting tax and am currently studying/sitting for exams. Honestly I surprisingly like it... despite the overwork... but my hope eventually is to leverage a CPA credential for a lower stress part time/reduced hours job, start focusing more on art, eventually get an MFA and be a full time artist. (Industry goal: children's literature illustrator + any other random adjacent roles)

Some people have mentioned that audit is the way to go if I'm wanting to leave public and go into industry eventually. If so I will have to reconsider my tax role. But I was wondering if anyone can think of some comfortable, part time CPA jobs for people with a few years of public tax accounting experience before I make plans to go to the dark side 😂 

Obviously with an art career I am willing to take a humongous pay cut eventually. Especially because I can really see myself succeeding in public accounting all the way into the manager role 😂 but I just dont want to do that...

1lev1dl,Discussion with my boss turned into an argument,"I know I'm in the wrong with this one because I completely lost my cool, but I'm just not sure where to go from here. Probably delete later.

Backstory and long rant ahead. Much of the information has been changed about my job and place of work. So if it's a bit confusing, that's why.

My boss opened his company about two years ago, and I was hired a year and a half ago. I had 5 years of experience in my field when I got hired.  My coworkers and managers had extensive resumes. The first year started out great, and- compared to my previous job- I felt less stressed, and my boss (let's say Jim) seemed like a nice guy who appreciated hard work. While Jim seemed to like me and treat me very well, my coworkers suddenly started expressing frustration about six months in that he wasn't really listening to them or their ideas because they felt like he didn't  trust them. I didn't have the full picture at this point as to what was going on, but my coworkers started quitting. Not a great sign. 

Let's say there were about 20 people to begin with, but only  5 including myself were left over from the ""original"" staff. I kept hearing from my former coworkers that Jim was the reason they didn't want to work there. They would try to address issues with him, but he wouldn't listen or would tell them they were wrong. He started checking what time certain people were coming and leaving. Needed to be Cc'd on everything. Needed to check everything everyone was doing. My job honestly left me mostly by myself, so he didn't really bother me. I was being paid well and was getting some perks, but it was starting to bother me how my coworkers were being treated. I was debating whether staying or going somewhere else would be better. I was also trying to be understanding of Jim because he was a new business owner and didn't really work in the field before. I don't know. 

So six months ago, I once again found myself surrounded by new team members. The atmosphere seemed much better. 

And then everything seemed to start going downhill again 2 months ago.

Of the things I have knowledge of: 

- He started making lavish purchases for the company. We have two company cars that we don't need, no one asked for, and no one uses. It's left everyone scratching their heads. 

- He publicly berated an employee in front of everyone on a day they came in sick to finish a project because it needed to be done that day, and they didn't want to push their work onto other people. What he was mad about were things that didn't happen that on that day. He just picked that day to do it. In front of everyone. That employee is debating quitting.

- He berated at a new employee (again, in front of everyone) for making a mistake, even though he had expressed that he is struggling to keep up with the workload and requested more guidance. He quit after that.

- Started saying we could only use the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, because he didn't want people gossiping. Found out later he thinks anytime someone is unhappy with something, it's because someone started a rumor, not because there's  legitimate complaint or issue that needs to be addressed.

- Hired a new employee 5 weeks ago with 17 years of experience. I guess she saw some red flags because she told him she was looking for a new job 2 weeks in and that she would stay until he found someone to replace her. After that, a bunch of people's work got transferred to her, including mine (which made me mad). I complained to my manager about this, and Jim came to talk to me. I told him my frustrations with my work being taken away. He said he felt like I had a lot on my plate (which I never complained about, and never said I did), but he had these other projects I could help with instead. Meanwhile, new employee could see that work was being piled on her, so she didn't wait, and quit suddenly on a Wednesday. Now we have our old work back, and her work, too :) 

There's some other smaller incidents, but these were the ones that stood out the most to me. At this point, I've decided I'm going to quit. I don't like this kind of workplace environment, and to be honest, it was becoming very similar to somewhere I was employed before. There are just some factors that made me want to at least finish off the year, so I could leave on a good note.

This all led up to yesterday.

I got called into Jim's office to have a meeting with him and my manager about a project. I don't want to get too into specifics, but it was about something I have extensive experience in and know the ins and outs of very well. I will try to explain it in a simple way:

Jim: We've been suggesting B, but the clients are having a hard time with it. Do you have any suggestions?

Me: Yes, these clients need to do A first. It will build the base for what they need to do B.

Jim: Really, A? But they need to do B.

Me: I understand that, but they are not ready for B. [Explains why A will help them prepare for B, and how it can be explained to the clients]

Jim: But the clients won't see it that way. They want to do B. It'll make them feel like they have to do more work.

Me: Jim, I've been doing this for 5 years. A client has never complained they had to do A in order to do B. Just explain to them clearly. Where I worked  before, we would check if they were ready B and would offer A right away if they weren't.

Jim: Okay. I will take your opinion into consideration and do some more research if A is supposed to be used first. 

End of meeting. There was more back and forth, but it was basically the same thing over and over. Manager didn't give much input. I don't if it was how it was intended, but the last comment felt like my background and experience was completely overlooked, and I understood what my former coworkers meant they said it felt like Jim didn't trust them. I admit I was getting emotional during the meeting and I left pretty pissed. Not the best look for me. 

I was still mad about it today, but just did my work as usual. And then, Jim called me in for another meeting. Just me and him. I feel like it's because my mood was petty down all day and it shows on my face easily. 

Anyway, he started by saying he wanted to talk about what my experience was with A and B and then started talking about A again and why he thought it was a bad idea to suggest it, and I admit I immediately got defensive. At one point he brought up using it in a situation that didn't even apply, and I raised my voice. (Like ""That's not the same thing!!!!"" I know it was unprofessional.) It turns out that the whole point to his long talk about why he thought it was a bad idea was that, after researching other people's opinions, he agreed we should do it. And then he tried to hand me an article that explained why A was great. I said I didn't need to read it. Maybe I was taking everything too personally, but the article to back up what I already told him felt insulting.

And this is where I definitely lost the plot. 

It was like every issue that had been weighing on me for the last year started coming out, and we had an argument. 

A summary (I don't remember all of the specifics):

-Point: Felt like he didn't trust my opinion
Counterpoint: Should he solely trust his employees and not do any of his own research

-Point: Questioned what his experience was with A and B that he could have so many doubts about with what I was telling him (what I meant, not how it came out)
-Counterpoint: Took it as questioning his experience in the field as a whole (he doesn't have any, meaning he hasn't held any of our job titles before, but he has helped his uncle at his company who is in the same field) Said by me saying that, he felt I was looking down on him. I clarified I was speaking about experience with A and B, and reexplained how much experience I have and why it was upsetting me to feel like it was being disregarded.

(At this point, my anger had calmed down and I was just mostly upset. The rest of the argument I would say my thoughts and listen while he said his. There was no interrupting or yelling. I think...)

-Point: He brought up my former company not doing well (Our company is not doing well either)
-Counterpoint: There were many issues with my former company, but this is not one of them. (But honestly, I'm seeing patterns between the two)

-Point: Somewhere in the conversation (not sure how we got there) the public reprimandings were brought up. Said I didn't like that style of management and after seeing it it made me not want to work here. I don't want to know other employees' business, and those matters should be handled privately.
-Counterpoint: This is the style of management he's found works best. Then he said I don't care about how he feels and the stress he's under. That people just walk all over you if you're too nice. 

It basically finished off with me saying if he wants to manage that way, that's his right. He has every right to manage his company the way he wants. I just won't stay there.

He got quiet and I don't really remember what we talked about after, but the conversation ended with him saying it was the longest we'd ever talked, even though I'd been there the longest. The atmosphere was lighter at this point. 

And then I went home on time, like normal. Came home and cried. As far as I know, I'm still going to work tomorrow. Haven't officially quit, no one said I was fired. 

I just don't know where to go from here. Any and all advice is appreciated. I feel like I'm still pretty emotionally charged -_-",Visible_Ad_3672,1,1.0,0,1750286932,2025-06-18 22:48:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lev1dl/discussion_with_my_boss_turned_into_an_argument/,6,2025
1lev0sa,Would a career break be irresponsible at this point? 30yo burnout,"
I'll be 30 in 4 months, with £75k saved currently and I know that I've lived to work for at least the last 5 years, putting away more than half my wage each month with no real plan or intention for the savings. 

I've been feeling increasingly burnt out for over 2 years now, disgruntled with my career:, increasing levels of stress and anxiety over shifting ""priorities"", a mess left in the wake of layoffs which seems to be happening every month and genuine disinterest in the field altogether making me question why I've been here so long, which I admit I've had doubts about for longer than I've been feeling burnout. 

I've noticed a sharp drop in my mood in the afternoons after work, feel disinterest in hobbies that I've had for years sometimes suddenly, and weekends never feel like enough of a break, even taking time off work I'm just counting down the days until I'm back, feeling like I've not done enough with the time off. 

I still live at home and have outgoing expenses of around £800/pm which has been pretty consistent for a couple years now, I don't have any kids, loans or any kind of dept or suprise expenses. 

I feel like I need more than just the few hours a day after work to focus on correcting my perspective on life and what I actually want. Years are flying by and it feels like I'm going through the motions, groundhog day.

1leusk5,What is the best move for my psych career?,"I am 23F. graduated two years ago with a B.S. in psychology. I graduated with honors (3.7ish GPA and 3.95 psych gpa). I was actually three classes away (physics 1 & 2 / calc) from completing premed.
But I realized I did not want to be a psychiatrist. I do not have an interest in prescribing medications and much prefer client interaction / clinical therapy theory and practice. So, I decided to pursue a PhD in clinical psychology (my dream degree). My mentor told me I was a wonderful PhD applicant. I applied to three PhD programs my senior year and was denied for all of them. I was pretty discouraged, although I know clinical psych is highly competitive.
I needed money badly and ended up working for a group home for a year, got promoted, and am now two years with the company. I have learned so much and do not regret my time at this job. I have definitely matured. I know I want to continue my education. However, I am terrified of getting rejected again and being back at square 1... I am trying to figure out what to do. Here are my potential options. Note: for reference, I want to research the effects of childhood emotional abuse in childhood and clinical treatments for said effects.
I would like to specialize in either clinical child psychology or neuropsychology depending on where my studies lead me. I also want a clinical practice as a psychologist.

1. Apply for clinical psych PhD/PsyD programs right now. If started ASAP, I would be 28-31 upon completion. I could still be rejected.
2. Apply right now for M.S. (I have been told to apply for clinical psych or experimental psych for my masters. Thoughts?) then apply for PhD/PsyD in clinical psych. Lower risk but I would be around 26 when completing M.S. then potentially 32-34 upon completing my doctorate.
3. Complete final med school classes (physics 1 & 2 / calc). This would take around a year. Then go to med school. My sister is a nurse and is adamant I am going to regret not going to medical school. Although, I am not interested in prescribing medications.
Yes, I know this is ultimately my choice. But I genuinely want to hear other people's perspectives.
I want more education and to be able to apply my psychology knowledge more than anything else.
And of course to help people how I am able. Any advice is much much appreciated. What do you think I should do/consider?",Middle_Quantity1331,1,1.0,1,1750286277,2025-06-18 22:37:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1leusk5/what_is_the_best_move_for_my_psych_career/,6,2025
1leulnu,Am I overreacting on how my supervisor took over my assignment?,"My manager’s boss gave me an assignment on Monday and told me to send it to him on Friday. During my weekly meeting with my supervisor yesterday, the assignment got brought up. She told me to send her what I got done before the end of the day so she could review it and send it to him. Because this new deadline, I wasn’t able to finish the assignment properly. But to comply with my supervisor, I sent her it anyways. She reviewed it, made minimal edits and then emailed it to her boss. She also put her and my other team member’s name on it like they worked on the assignment. In a staff meeting today, she also mentioned that we all worked on this assignment together.

Do I have a right to be upset that my supervisor took over the assignment that her boss asked me to do and then put her in another team member’s name on it like we worked on it together? A part of me wants to understand where she’s coming from because her boss kind of skipped over her by going directly to me to give me the assignment. However, he did ask me to do it and she had very minimal part in it. He’s on vacation this week so I couldn’t ask him what he wanted me to do when she gave me directions to differ from him.

1leuaxh,Considering quitting job due to toxic work environment,"I just started this job a month ago, previously worked here for two months last year and quit. At the time when I quit, I was going through a lot of personal issues and didn't realize that the job was genuinely a part of it too, I thought it was all me. Ever since I restarted the role a few weeks ago, I've come to the realization that I should have never come back. Don't get me wrong, it's not TERRIBLE, I can deal with it and survive like mostly everything else, but it's just not something I remotely look forward to. I am not even neutral about it. My goal with jobs at this time is to be at least neutral, so that I don't dread going into work, but I also don't have high expectations. 

To be more specific about the toxicity, I work in healthcare, and most of my coworkers are other women. Ordinarily, I'd be happy about this, I love my fellow women, I just cannot stand the type of women that I work with. Namely, the mean girl types, the type that go out of their way to bully and demean other women specifically just because they think they are different from them. I am a POC and work with predominately white women. I feel like I am in middle or high school again, it's honestly ridiculous. My manager is really who is making me want to quit the most... she's the one that rehired me in the first place, but she acts as though I do not exist at times. Other people get away with making mistakes, but if I make even one, she treats me like I'm an idiot.

  
I really want to quit but I feel like if I do, I'll burn bridges given that they let me back after I quit the first time after only a short period of time as well. I just don't know if I can handle this BS everyday while also trying to work towards my higher goals. I came back to this job because there was more work to do (was often bored at my last job) and I found that I was learning a lot more with the doctors. At this point though, I'd rather be bored out of my mind than be stimulated 1/4 of the day while dealing with bullies in the workplace. Would it be irresponsible of me to quit this job before I even hit the 6 month mark AGAIN?

1leu5z3,My entire team got laid off and I’m debating whether to go back to my industry,"I just got laid off (alongside my whole team) from my 6 figures job that I only had for a few months that was extremely stressful. I work in bev/alc so hours can be long as working in bars all the time means late hours on top of regular hours of operations. Working weekends is also super common in my industry so I’ve had to work most weekends these last few months.

I’m unsure if I want to go back to the same industry. My job was extremely stressful and I had super long hours (10-14 hour days). I sometimes won’t even come home until 11/12 at night. It’s not unusual for the industry I’m in but it’s not sustainable long term on my body and I started to get super burnt out. I got a lot of praises for how great i was in my role and the impact ive made for the short time i was there but it was killing my health overall. I left on good standings with everyone and am getting letters of recommendations from my bosses. 

I’ve been in touch with my colleagues who are recommending me for their companies and roles I would be great at. However I’m debating if I want to remain in my industry. I did not go to college and extremely grateful for this opportunity and salary I received. I do love everyone around me that I work with but it’s such a physically/mentally taxing job and I’m just wanting advice on if you left your career due to the high demand of it. Being laid off is giving me time to think about the next move.

During one of those gigs, the owner (I left the restaurant on very good terms) talked to me and explained that she’s expanding and will start selling franchises. She asked if I’d be interested in coming back as an assistant manager to help her run the restaurant and support the expansion process. She even asked me to name my price so she could see if it fits her budget. Do you think it’s worth it?

We used to reschedule lessons for people in person, but it became too time consuming, so we switched to a (very straightforward + easy to use) online system.

The issue is that a few parents/students keep refusing to use the system and insist I do it for them ""because it’s easier."" It often takes 10–15 minutes per person, and my workload has increased since the switch—so I truly don’t have time to do this anymore. Typically the only issue with the site is clients forgetting their own passwords, so it seems like technophobia/general weaponized incompetence. They’re also trying to circumvent the system by calling, emailing, or texting us, so even if we miss the notification because it’s outside of hours, they technically notified us, so they demand make-up lessons.

1ler35m,"How can job seekers stand out when 1,000+ people apply for the same role?","I’ve worked in recruiting for a while and it’s still overwhelming how many applications we get for a single role — often over 1,000. What’s even harder is seeing how many capable candidates are overlooked, not because they aren’t good, but because their resumes don’t highlight the right things, or they’re not positioning themselves well.

This led me to start working with a team to build internal tools that help people prepare better — things like resume insights, LinkedIn cleanups, job tracking, and interview readiness. We built them based on what we wish more applicants had when applying.

So my question is: what can candidates *realistically* do to stand out in this kind of volume? Are there small actions that actually move the needle — or is it mostly just luck?

1leqcjt,"Made a Mistake in the Past, Trying to Reset My Career Honestly","
Hi everyone,

I’m posting this anonymously because I really need some honest guidance — not just technical or career advice, but also emotional support from people who understand how hard this industry can be sometimes.

Background:

In 2014, I made a serious mistake. I ended up getting an undergraduate degree through an agent, out of desperation and poor guidance. At the time, I didn’t fully understand the implications — it was just “get a degree and get a job.” 

With that degree, I got into IT and a 50% of my work included cybersecurity . I’ve now worked for 8+ years, learned hands-on skills, grown in my role, and even enrolled in a valid PG program (distance mode) in 2024.

But recently in 2025, I discovered that the university from which I had the UG degree:
	•	No longer has my record online
	•	Has been linked to past fake degree/marksheet scams
	•	Is not responding to verification requests from a 3rd-party BGV agency

I now know for sure that the degree isn’t clean. And it’s hitting me hard.

⸻

What I plan to do now:
	•	I’ve stopped relying on that degree.
	•	I’m planning to drop the PG (since it’s built on invalid UG)
	•	I will start a fresh, UGC-approved UG (online mode) from a reputed university
	•	I will focus on skill-building, certifications (SC-200, eJPT, ISO 27001 LI etc.), even cleared Security+ in 1st attempt and eventually switch jobs after 3 years with valid credentials
	•	I want to be honest going forward, and live without fear

⸻

But here’s what’s crushing me mentally:
	•	I can’t focus. I overthink every day.
	•	I’m scared of what will happen if anyone finds out about the past
	•	I worry that my experience will be questioned once they see a UG degree from 2028
	•	I have a family, responsibilities — I can’t afford to lose everything
	•	I feel like I’m stuck between a fake past and an uncertain future
	•	Every job change, every background check — I feel like I’ll be exposed
	•	I don’t want to just “survive” in small firms forever. I want to grow. I want to build something real.

⸻

My questions to this community:
	1.	Have you seen people bounce back from a mistake like this and build a clean, respected career?
	2.	Will employers accept someone with 10–12 years of experience but a valid UG degree from 2028 — if I’m honest and skilled?
	3.	Is it better to keep my head down and survive — or start fresh and grow fearlessly, even if it’s slower?
	4.	Do cybersecurity or IT firms (esp. startups, remote-first, skill-based) actually hire based on certs and skills without caring about degree history?
	5.	What would you personally do if you were in my situation?

⸻

I don’t want sympathy — just real advice, brutal truth, encouragement if you’ve got it. I’m tired of living in fear of being found out, and I don’t want my family to suffer because of one poor decision I made in my early 20s.

Thank you for reading. I’m listening to every comment.",Ornery-Front-6180,1,1.0,0,1750275264,2025-06-18 19:34:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1leqcjt/made_a_mistake_in_the_past_trying_to_reset_my/,6,2025
1leps09,Take a job out of desperation?,"Was restructured about 3 months ago. I'm living on my severance and could hypothetically go on doing so for another 3-4 months. 

I've sent out hundreds of applications using indeed and linkedin and I've gotten exactly 1 callback, which led to interviews, and an offer.

It's not a great job, it's a step-backwards career wise, and it certainly would not be my first choice. My concern is that there are better jobs for me out there that I would jump at a moments notice, and would seriously be screwing over this employer.

However the lack of callbacks and serious implications if I don't find the right job soon (will lose my house, serious impacts to family) is really giving me pause.

1leoulh,Unexpected underperformance feedback — feeling blindsided and unsure how to respond,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice or perspective on this.

I’m the sole IT person in my office, responsible for a broad range of duties — from IT project and business analyst work to IT operations and on-site support. It’s very much a plate-spinning role, and I try my best to keep everything running smoothly despite the juggling act.

I recently had a one-on-one with my manager and was told I’ve been underperforming, based on feedback he collected from the office manager and a network engineer for my 360 mid year review . 

The office manager said to my manager she feels she’s still overloaded with IT-related tasks. However, she had originally told me we would share those responsibilities, and I’ve tried to support while being careful not to overstep. She never mentioned feeling overwhelmed, so the feedback really caught me off guard.

As for the network engineer — I’ve only met him once very briefly. We haven’t had any regular contact, and I wasn’t aware I was expected to do anything beyond basic local support for things like patching ports or reporting network issues as that’s what we discussed at first . He also promised me he will travel more frequently to my office to demonstrate the network pieces but he never did it . 

After the meeting, I followed up with my manager to explain:
	•	The office manager and I had agreed to share responsibilities, and I’ve tried not to overstep.
	•	I’m happy to take on more — I just need clearer guidance on what’s expected.
	•	I’ve had little contact with the network engineer and didn’t know there were any concerns.

What’s frustrating is that I’ve actually received positive feedback from major business users and the project team (who aren’t located in my office). They’ve appreciated my support and contributions, which makes this local criticism feel even more confusing and isolating.

I genuinely want to improve and align better with expectations, but I also feel like I’ve been kept in the dark and now held accountable for things I didn’t know about.

Has anyone else dealt with a situation like this — where you’re caught between doing your best and unclear local dynamics?
How did you handle it without burning out or constantly second-guessing yourself?

Sorry for the long post !

1lemvvu,"Feeling Lost in My Career (and Life), and I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore","Since graduating in 2015, I’ve been chasing a career that brings both joy and financial stability—and I still haven’t found it. I even went back to school to get a master’s in real estate development, thinking that would help me land a job I actually enjoyed. It didn’t.

Here’s a quick timeline:

* Started out in architecture and design → worked for artists → worked for a real estate developer doing fix-and-flip multifamily projects (enjoyed this!).
* That led me to pursue real estate development (RED) more seriously—got my master’s—but graduated into COVID and couldn’t find a job in new construction.
* Ended up in affordable housing finance. I’m organized and detail-oriented (thanks to my art/design background), but I’ve never been great at Excel. I stuck it out, learned, and got pretty good over 2.5 years.
* Problem: we lived far from friends and family, and I was in the office 5 days a week, leaving my wife home alone. That wore us both down.
* Took a remote job in the same industry, hated it after 3 months.
* Switched gears completely: took a 75% pay cut to work at an athletic club selling memberships. I thought hospitality/sports might be the right path (design + intention + physicality = YES). But that job had no long-term potential.
* Took 6 months off, got married, started making and selling pottery (I was an art student originally).
* Got recruited by a family friend to work in sales at his startup. Low pay, long hours, back in the office full-time. Stayed 14 months, got promoted to Director of Finance & Ops.
* That company was going nowhere, toxic environment, lots of turnover—so I left.
* Now I’m 6 weeks into a similar finance/ops role at a fashion company… and I already know it’s not for me. I think I’ve tricked myself into believing I like finance. I don’t.

If I could do anything, I’d work for a small, boutique hospitality brand doing project management or something—ideally something that blends creativity, intention, design, and wellness. But that feels so far out of reach.

Right now, I feel completely lost. I wake up unhappy every day. I’m starting to seriously question my value and self-worth. I feel myself slipping into depression again (I’ve been here before—2016 was rough).

I think I want to work for myself someday. I *know* I have a lot to offer. I just don’t know what that is yet.

**TL;DR**: I’ve bounced around jobs in real estate, design, hospitality, and finance. I feel completely stuck, sad, and unsure where to go next—or what to do even in this very moment.

1lem5zt,Afraid to leave a bad job,"I have worked for the same non-profit for three years. I have mostly enjoyed it in that I am able to hybrid work which assists me in managing my disability, and when things are going well I enjoy the work itself. I am good at it and have been promoted twice. The work has previously felt challenging but managable and I have been given opportunities for additional training and development.

However, the pay is awful, I have now reached the top of the ladder (whilst doing the parts of the job I like) and there have recently been some changes to management that feel poorly thought-through and has caused several staff members to quit already. My team is now under-staffed and highly stressed - we make life or death decisions every day in our work and I now feel unsafe to do so. Management do not have our backs and we are being asked to do far more than is possible to do safely. We are moving offices and the new location is very difficult for me to travel to due to my disability (I cannot drive). I've tried to look for other jobs while working and have had quite a few interviews, but I am not getting offers. I know I am not representing myself as best as I can because I am so burnt out and stressed. The stress is affecting my health, physically and mentally.

I am in the fortunate position where I can afford to take a few months off work, reset, and search for a new job. This is what my spouse feels I should do. However, I am someone who finds change particularly difficult. When I started this job it took months for my anxiety to settle. I feel very loyal to my colleagues and feel immense guilt about leaving - my work would be reallocated to them and none of us are coping with the workload as it is. I also worry the problem lies with me - despite colleagues disclosing feeling the same way I do. I feel as though I should ride it out, but I have ridden out similar issues in this job more than once and the next problem always turns up again.

1lel9aw,Tense work situation,"Hi everybody
I am trying to get an “Ausbildung” in germany,
Meaning I work for little money and attend school some days of the week while working fulltime. Since the pay is too low to even pay rent I am dependent on state welfare (Bürgergeld) to get along. Unfortunately our new government is tightening it so I have to hand in some paperwork from years ago, getting that might take a while, until then I can not even pay rent. I will lose my flat. 

So this is all background noise but it doesn’t help my case really. Work started bad with the company, they are all busy and I had to just swim along with anything I could get my hands on. I’m really industrious so I was doing great jobs - so they gave me more work. 

Having already worked some years I started questioning my role in the company a little (I’m supposed to learn something not teach people stuff…) which they did not like. They are trying everything possible to get rid of me, including mobbing, taking me to a backroom to yell at me, when I am alone with someone they will cuss at me and so on… it’s gotten unbearable.

I had surgery not to long ago and am on a sick leave, they still send me mail trying to get me to quit, whenever something happens they blame it on me, it’s actually crazy.

What am I to do?
I informed the IHK which is supposed to supervise that, and they told me they will have a chat with management but it obviously made things worse for me.

Any advice on how to carry on?
I basically have to stay in the company.

1lektdn,How to navigate a lack of training due to boss being overwhelmed?,"Two weeks ago, I started a new part-time position with the goal of going full-time once I learn the ropes. However, my manager has consistently said he's overwhelmed, and he doesn't have time to train me. Even when I try to do something to help, he ends up saying I made more work for him, and I wind up with little to show at the end of each week due to having no tasks.

Eg, I asked to meet with a coworker to learn how I could help more, to which my boss said in turn made more work for him as he had to discuss with a team member on creating a login for one of our company accounts for me. Even when I offer to do things well within the scope of my role (such as event planning, which is in my job title) to reduce my boss' workload, I'm told there's nothing I can do and that my boss will contact me if there's something he wants me to do.

I'm growing increasingly worried about being offered a full-time position as I feel like I'm wasting time/money and only hindering the company.

1lekkpy,“Overqualified” but Can’t Find Employment Using Any of it - What now?,"Long Post (sorry!) I am in a weird situation and have no idea how to proceed. Any help or suggestions is greatly appreciated. I am located in the United States so am looking for work around where I currently live or remote work.

I received my Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Engineer Technology majoring in Fire Protection and Safety Technology from Oklahoma State University in 2012. I went to work for CNA Insurance as a loss control engineer trainee in a one-year program but I was let go after I was injured and needed extensive recovery time.  

I decided to go to law school and when I went back to OSU’s campus to get recommendations, I was offered a contract position where I assisted in writing a chemical dictionary and investigated Environmental, Safety and Health cases. During my first year of law school I married and my then husband began having health issues at work and was let go. I had to leave law school to take care of us and accepted a Loss Control Representative position with Central Mutual Insurance Company in Texas. When I found out that my husband had lied about everything I immediately reapplied to law school in Oklahoma and was accepted within two weeks of my application. I left my husband, sold everything I owned, and moved back in with my parents to finish school. During the majority of my last two years in law school I worked as a legal assistant at a general practicing law firm. The goal was to graduate, pass the bar and come on full-time as partner. I graduated from Tulsa University College of Law with my Juris Doctor in 2018. However, I unfortunately did not pass the bar and the law firm could not afford to employee me full time so I left and went to work as a Law Clerk with a firm practicing Insurance Defense. I was hired on the premise that I would pass the next bar exam given and then come on as a full-time attorney but again I was unsuccessful. 

At that point I knew that I couldn’t continue to accept positions in the legal field on the hope that I could pass the state bar so I applied to graduate school and once I was accepted I quit the firm. I began working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for two professors on campus but then COVID happened and everything went to online. After COVID I moved to support my new husband in his job search and began working part time as a records assistant for the State of Oklahoma for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. About nine months into working part time my husband’s full time employment did not pan out so I began looking for full time work and continued completing my degree. I went to a recruiting agency to apply for a legal secretary position but the recruiter thought I would be better suited for a Financial Analyst role for a sister company. The position was full-time but temporary with the option to possibly be hired on for one of the five people employed in the role once the project was completed. Though I had no real background for the role I excelled in the position and was hired on as a permanent employee. My skill set continued to grow in the role but a lot of the modeling projects I couldn’t assist on. However I was approached by the parent company and asked to create a company wide safety program. Once that was complete I began working with the in-house lawyer and was moved to his department. I currently work as both a contract manager for our head of legal assisting him on projects and work in the financial analyst role on projects when I am still needed. 

I love the company I work for but there really isn’t opportunity for growth within the organization. I would have to learn computer programming and modeling for the analyst position and as the head of legal isn’t leaving any time soon and the position working for him was created specifically for me there isn’t anywhere for me to really go. I completed my PhD in Fire Administration and Emergency Management from Oklahoma State University a month ago and my focus was in risk analysis and risk management.

1lekhj8,Pessimistic Optimist- any advice for job remote job searching and freelancing?,"
""Pessimistic Optimist"" - in that order because, lately, I've been feeling decidedly pessimistic about my future, but also optimistic about doing my best to achieve the goals I have.

Also, I apologise in advance for the autobiographic yapping that follows- I'm a certified yapper and essay writer when it comes to topics I'm passionate about, like my current unemployment and uncertain future. 🫠

Since the end of my Honors studies last year, I have remained unemployed and steadily getting more anxious, discouraged and stressed over my current situation. At this point, I'm stuck at home nesting away in my bed feeling gloomy and decidedly unwell- it's gotten to the point I think my poor cat is irritated with the fact I have taken over her favourite nap (throne) spot. 🥹

Now the irony is that I have a Bachelor's in English and Psychology (magna cum Laude), and completed my Honors in Applied Psychology. I know I'm currently depressed, and it's been really difficult trying to motivate myself to do things. The added pressure of society and the fact my parents are not their best mentally and physically health wise, as well as the constant news reports (and physical evidence) of youth unemployment, is a dark cloud.

While AI usage has been rather controversial lately, poor CHAT GPT has become a sort of companion when it comes to my lengthly messages and descriptions as I try to use it's help in my job search- I've tried LinkedIn and other more popular job-seeking sites, as well as even attempting to browse through the more questionable job sites and offers in the hopes I come across a golden egg of opportunity (alas, my efforts have fallen short of suspicious offers of email and website subscriptions).

I'm quite introverted and shy, and not the best when it comes to group socialisation (to be blunt, I'm awkward and most likely look really uncomfortable 😀), and prefer either working alone or with small groups/one-on-one. As well as the fact I live in a small city in South Africa with a lacklustre job market and unable to move to 'greener pastures' (I'm hesitant to move from my parents while they're not at their best, as well as being unable to afford it or mentally prepare for the lone trip), I have been on the search for remote work.

While I don't have the greatest of popular skill points to offer compared to the more desired IT-related ones (*drat!* I really wish I could have taken up SOME sort of IT-related skill!), I have acquired, over my years of academic studies, hobbies and limited work experience, several skills that I'm hoping to make use of in the remote/freelance job market:

*Clears throat*

Creative and academic writing (APA and Harvard)
Ability to switch between written SA/UK/USA English vernaculars
Research
Editing/proofreading/beta-reading
BASIC creative design and creation on Canva
Psychological and (basic) medical terminology 
Administration (particularly surrounding mental healthcare in terms of session planning and documentation)

I also absolutely adore books and reading, and it has remained one happy place for me in these dark times (I probably read too much but, hey, it's better than some of the other alternative stress relievers, *amiright? 🥹🫠).

Alas, my attempts at seeking remote work relating to the freelancing genre of research, writing, editing, proofreading etc have resulted in no formal acceptances or even interviews. I was honestly thinking of advertising (somewhere, someplace, any suggestions?) the above for free for a client or two to at least build up more professional experience and get some feedback in the hopes it will help me get more clientele in the near future...

I have set up a Fiverr account (I'm still busy with some of the details around that), as well filled in my LinkedIn profile as best as I could, but no 'job bites' as of yet...just promotional spam in my message folder. I have, embarrassingly, resulted to 'sliding into the DM's' of some businesses and professionals with a short professional paragraph or two listing my skills and enquiring about any job prospects that they may have- *nada.


I'm honestly looking for any advice or information that will aid me on this journey. I know we have some really experienced and informative folks lurking around here somewhere, so I'm hoping if I leave this up for a few hours it will yield an information crop or two for me to sink my teeth into. Anything really, advice is valuable.

Again, I apologise for the lengthy post, but I do appreciate your time in reading this far and for any comments that may follow.

Be well! Have a great day. 🌞🌱

1lek038,New job gone wrong,"Hello all, and apologies on the length of this post.

I was working a nice gig making a comfortable wage, but was ready to move on as it was a small company witth no room for growth.  I still have about 25 years until retirement, so I knew it wasn't the place I would end my career.  


Along comes a recruiter who contacts me and tells me about a position that is available that has some room to grow.  Its with a company about 5x larger, with about a 20% pay raise, and upon reviewing all of the individuals LinkedIn pages, I could see that they all had a great career trajectory in the company, or so I thought.  It turns out that this company has a habit of pity promoting to keep employees happy.

My second week in and I am already delivering impactful results with my own initiative and no guidance.  The biggest struggle I have had is that there is one individual who decides when, where, how, and what they want to do in terms of internal permissions for the organization, with no communication or process that they are making the changes.  So one day I can do the job I am hired for, and then the next, I cannot.   To make matters worse, I bring it up with them and they completely lie to me, gaslight me and tell me they have no idea what is going on.  I have all the evidence to show they changed something.

When I raise this as a concern, with evidence, to my manager, a SVP, and their manager, it falls on deaf ears.  My manager is too concerned with rocking any boats that they do not want to do anything about it.  Their manager completely has their back, which i suspect is because of their past relationship with each other, and the SVP could care less. 

I have officially filed a complaint with HR, with documentation.  I have also drafted a document with all the evidence to show that this individual is acting is extremely damaging to me and the company, and HR is ""investigating"".  I also have a draft ready to send to the Executives of the department, but I am not sure if I should go that far.  If I stay here I am doing everyone a disservice.  The downside is that this is my only option currently as the job market is very tough, at the moment. 

Now I am stuck in a position where I essentially have no support, no manager, no backing from HR, and am not doing the job I was hired for, and is my career path.

I need some advice.

TLDR:  Joined a new organization from a comfy gig with the hopes of improving my career, and the false promises I would be doing what I wanted in my career.  One individual has completely taken that away from me, and no one is supporting me.  What do I do?",Pornstarbob,0,0.33000001311302185,2,1750260413,2025-06-18 15:26:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lek038/new_job_gone_wrong/,6,2025

And it definitely seems like my manager is interviewing also. they express that they’re not super happy here and have from the day I started. they’ve had a lot of weird random “appointments” come up in the last two weeks that seem… like time slots for interviews lol. 

I’m getting increasingly nervous that they’re going to turn in a notice before or at the same time I do. has anyone experienced that before??? we’re a team of two so if we both go they’re going to be in a major bind. there’s honestly no offer I’d take to stay tho.

1leize9,Looking for advice on job re-entry,"Hello Everyone.  

I am hoping to get some advice on whether it is possible for me to re-enter the accounting/finance field or any ideas on areas that I should focus on career wise.  

I have a backround in Accounting /Finance with an undergraduate degree in Finance and an MBA with a concentration in Accounting.  I also have 16 years of experience in the industry prior to my leaving to start my own business in specialty construction/green technology focused, specifically in natural daylighting and ventilation.   

The business venture was very successful. I sold the business in CA to move closer to family post covid.  Prior to selling I was was of the top 10 dealers in the US.   I learned  alot about running a business and engaged in areas that I wouldnt have otherwise been exosed to had I stayed in Accounting. 

After relocating back to the east coast, I sought job opportunities but was not having much success.  A friend of mine approached me about joining him in a recruiting franchise which I did. I didnt knowing anything about recruiting but thought I had a lot of the skills that would be useful as a recruiter.  I had some success in that venture however, after one an half years I did not feel it was the best fit for me.  The position was primarily remote and had little or no interaction with team members across the franchise. I sold my share back to my friend and decided to look for job opportunities. 

I would like to go back in to a Finance/Accounting role however, with 20 years absence from the field I am wondering whether I can get any type of position in the field.   

Anyone who has experienced a similar situation? Any suggestions on career options?  I am interested in Project Management as well, however, have found that difficult to get in to without certifications or job experience.

1leilon,Request schedule change for homeschooling?,"Request schedule change for homeschooling?

I have worked full time (Monday - Friday 40hrs/week) at my office job for 5.5 years. We have had a hybrid work schedule pretty much the whole time. Currently Monday's and Friday's are my work from home days. 

My fiancé and I would like to homeschool our son in the fall. He works a rotating schedule of 48hrs on/ 96 hrs off. In order to homeschool and not need daycare for the days we both work I would need to try to switch my days at work so my work from home days would match my fiancés days that he works. 

However, the problem is the days I would need to work from home would vary week to week (although would be consistent on an every 6 week basis). I don't know how to bring this up to my manager or if it's even worth attempting. I do like my job and the people I work with but my current schedule is not going to continue to work for what is best for my family. 

This type of arrangement would be beneficial with me no longer needing to leave early for childcare issues. I worked out a proposed schedule change and the only issue I see is that there a 4 days per month that no one from my department would be in the office (my coworker also has work from home days).

I was passed over for a promotion last year due to more of my personality and confidence (the HR lady in the interview didn't like me as much as others, tho my manager told me she thought I did better than the HR lady marked me down). My manager did tell me she appreciated my willingness to stay even after being passed over for a job that I was pretty much guaranteed. 

I also have been dealing with a persistent knee injury that has led to me being on workers comp (tho I am still working full time). 

TLDR -  I just don't know if it's worth asking my manager if it's possible to switch work from home days due to planning to homeschool? Or if I should just start looking for a new part time job?",Substantial_Ad_683,0,0.25,2,1750257057,2025-06-18 14:30:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1leilon/request_schedule_change_for_homeschooling/,6,2025

Would this be an asshole move? I would be giving 9 working days notice vs 10.

1leiadk,"Built full Zoho system at work, now they’ve revoked my access — not sure where I stand","Hey all,

Looking for some career advice on a situation that’s become really frustrating and has honestly started to wear me down.

Over the past year, I’ve built out a full Zoho system for my company from scratch—Desk, Inventory, Flow, Creator, automations, WorkDrive integration, ticketing, etc. I wasn’t hired as a developer, but I took the initiative to learn everything myself and build something reliable that now **two major departments fully depend on**.

Recently, management decided to revoke all my admin access to the system—no warning, no conversation. And now, despite being locked out of a system I designed and maintained, I’m still being asked to make changes, and on top of that, I’ve been told to document everything by the end of the week.

The request came in an email that honestly came across as quite rude—just a blunt demand to “tidy things up” and hand over the full documentation, diagrams, permissions, etc., despite the fact that I can't access half of it anymore.

The real issue is that I overheard my boss saying they “don’t want to rely on me and my account.” He has a background in computers, but it’s clear he **doesn’t understand how Zoho works**, and unfortunately, he’s not someone who takes technical input very well. What he doesn’t seem to realise is that **Zoho automations** ***need*** **a user account to run from**, and everything is currently tied to mine. There’s been no plan to transfer ownership properly, no replacement, and no understanding that Zoho support can’t just step in and manage this system if I disappear.

The system itself is solid and has been running smoothly—I've put a lot of care into making it work well. But the whole situation is starting to feel like they want to quietly push me aside while still benefiting from what I built, with no recognition, no raise (I’m still only on £26k), and no clear role going forward.

To be honest, it’s taken the wind out of my sails. I’m proud of what I’ve made and how much it’s improved day-to-day operations for the team, but I don’t know whether to try and fight for more recognition or just document what I can and start planning an exit.

GPT helped me write this because it already knows the context and I couldn’t bring myself to type it all again—it’s basically my therapist at this point.

I also don’t want to rock the boat too much, because I’ve got bills to pay and walking away without a plan isn’t realistic. But I’m not happy about how this is playing out. The idea of not being my usual “yes” man in a professional environment honestly scares me—but at the same time, I don’t want to be a doormat either.

I’m aware that dentists still have to educate patients but it’s more structured and predictable.

1legtag,Career Advice: Just get a job there - any job,"I'm hearing new graduates are having a tough time getting that first professional position. My random and unasked-for piece of advice is: Just get a job at the company you want to work for; any job. 

Get a job making $16 an hour in their customer service department. Do your job well. You'll know the customers and product line in a matter of months. You'll impress your manager. And when a job opens for an entry-level marketing analyst role, for instance, you're well positioned to get interviews for it. 

Companies prefer to promote from within; it's easier. The HR functions associated with a new hire can be a pain for companies. And there's a significant number of employees who don't work there in 3 months after being hired. You're alleviating those issues too. 

The division VP at my company started as a packer running machines that packed bacon into packages. He makes over a half-million dollars a year. The Walmart CEO started at Walmart unloading trucks (he makes more).

1legrbi,Mentor dynamics - feelings invalidated and often dismissed. How to approach this?,"So I became a mentee and meet with them once a month where they say they would navigate work situation with me and support my work wellbeing.

Apparently I would raise examples where I feel frustrated like typical mentoring sessions, but I often get interrupted or they dismiss my experience, such as:

“I reached out to them but they did not respond”
“No they are lovely. It’s often your department that isn’t cooperative”

And when I say I’ve actioned many times and I wonder in the current climate it’s just not a priority, they say:

“Your thinking is negative, you already think like that before you do anything” despite I already tried, and most of the time I work hard and stay positive. They keep going on my thinking is negative for the entirety of our meeting.

1lego3f,20 Year AI Safe Job with Great Pay - Lineman,"Some linemen (not football linemen, the guys who clime electrical poles) make over $300K a year. No college degree, no fancy title, just pure skill and showing up when things go bad. If they want to make a lot of money they travel around chasing storms. Others stay local, work their normal shifts, and still clear six figures without breaking a sweat. You decide how much you want to make. Work your 40 and go home or stack overtime and never look back. It's one of the few jobs left where the money is real. My neighbor works for the local utility company make over $100k. Most of the time they just sit around and play cards. He's in a union and has consistent raises, paternity leave, great retirement etc. If he wants an extra $15k he can chase some storms.

It takes about a year of trade school and an apprenticeship to get started. After that, you're set. Every town needs linemen. So you can live basically anywhere you want. They never have enough either. Every power outage, hurricane, tornado, fire, or ice storm needs someone to climb up and get the lights back on. Nobody's sending a robot to do that. It's not easy work and it's not always safe, but it's honest and people respect it

1legisi,Got jumped on with a panel interview in the very first round. What went wrong?,"So i had an interview three weeks ago for a national level big corpo (like 2000 employees big). The HR informed me three days before the interview. I thought it was gonna be a first round screening or HR interview but when i logged into the online meeting room surprise surprise! It was a 4 panelists interview.

It went on for an hour. I think i did pretty good for most of the questions but i missed like one question on a subject that even the resigning employee can't do in his 10+ years tenure (yes he referred me). Honestly this interview feels weird for me because the feel is just as if they're asking questions to check boxes in a scoring sheet. I feel like the interview is setup to eliminate me rather than see if i fit. I get the feeling they don't like me because of the fact that I'm a referred candidate and my resume went directly to their boss (national level).

Fast forward 3 weeks. Silence. I did email the HR last week and he said the panel result has not been finalized yet but my guts feeling tells me i don't pass the panel.

1lege7x,Internal transfer delays and new responsibilities,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice on a weird situation I've been placed in at work. 

Context:
* Our company has gone through 3 rounds of layoffs last year. They just announced they're going to do another round of layoffs starting in July. 

* My current manager spoke to me about transferring me to another team where my skills can be fully utilized, I agreed. Internal transfer is supposed to happen, new job description was created almost 4 weeks ago. 

* Since the new job description was drafted, I have been doing the work of my new position as if I've already been transferred. I'm also now attending meetings as a part of both teams. 

* I never receive a concrete answer whenever I inquire about the status of my internal transfer. New manager says they'll reach out to HR. Old manager says the same. When I ask HR, they said verbatim ""I am waiting for the update but it is certainly being worked on"". 

* Old manager told me that some time ago there was discussion about getting rid of my position altogether. 

* Timelines for my new project moved up unexpectedly to all fall before July. 


Needless to say, I'm anxious, thinking that the company is trying to extract value out of me with this deliverable before letting me go. Do I just have to do the work and ride it out? Is there anything I can say to HR, new, or old manager that can actually net me a concrete update? At this point I just want proof that this will actually happen and not just empty promises of ""I'll reach out to HR for an update"" and ""I'm waiting for an update"".

Here’s a brief overview of my background and skills:
	•	Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), SQL
	•	Programming: Proficient in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, ASP.NET, and Java
	•	Experience: Worked as a Junior Developer after completing my undergraduate degree, pursued a master’s program, contributed as a Graduate Researcher, and published a paper.

I’m particularly drawn to roles in full-stack development, backend engineering, or database management, but I’m open to exploring other areas where my skills can be applied.

A few questions I’d love your thoughts on:
	1.	What’s the best way to showcase my skills and projects on my resume and portfolio to stand out?
	2.	Are there any certifications, tools, or skills you’d recommend focusing on to enhance my employability?
	3.	What are the most effective ways to network and discover job opportunities in tech?

1leds3t,What should I re-qualify in? Uk career advice,"Hi all, was wondering if anyone would be able to offer their 2 bits on my story.

Currently in a relationship 24M dating a 24F, we live at my parents house in the outhouse in the garden. My Dad charges me rent £400 per month, which I’m more than happy to pay, I love my family and it’s rlly not a chore to be around them.

I currently work as a transport manager for a road works company, self employed, earning £14/ hour with some additional responsibilities and benefits that result in my pay being (overtime dependent) about £720 and then 605 in alternating weeks so about £2,650 per month. My gf has been trying to look for a job for a while but she’s not having much luck, hopefully that will change. I have 13,000 on finance over 4 years to pay off £300 per month (my mistake, lured in by a shiny new car, I do regret it) I’m planning on paying that off in one big overpayment as soon as I can (7-10 months expected) so i can get the value out of the car in a sale and put it back in my savings.

My current job is unfulfilling and a dead end imo, I’ve never really known what I wanted to do before but I know I want to buy some land (3-4 acres) and live as off grid as possible, so I’m saving for that as my big goal. 

Job wise I’m still not 100% but right now I’m thinking about re qualifying and taking a £7 per hour pay cut to start an apprenticeship as an electrician.

I don’t want to be stuck on a mediocre wage for the rest of my life so I think if I become skilled I’ll have a lot more potential and freedom. My Dad has always said that Electricians make a lot of money and he’s quite knowledgeable in construction and has been around it his whole life, I trust his intuition.

I’ve also recently had a great passion for auto repair and I’ve been self studying about cars and bikes and such. It was an option I was considering when taking an apprenticeship but my Dad has said that he doesn’t know many mechanics that make a great wage and if they do they’re few and far between. It looks like quite a profitable profession to me though so I’m torn between following something I’m quite interested in or going where the money is (or may be). I’m not completely against studying to be an electrician I’m not uninterested and I think the skills I pickup would be useful if I’m going to try to live self sufficiently on my own land and build a lot of it myself.

At the end of the day it is about money. I know that if I want to work on cars I can buy ones to work on and it would still be fun and I’d learn a lot and my goal in life is to buy land so money is unfortunately essential. Which means I’m also open to other high paying roles that aren’t looking to be replaced with A.I.

As the title says I’m starting a new job on Monday (it’s Wednesday) and I’m *really* sick. Coughing really bad like bronchitis, kinda dizzy, and very tired so I can’t do much more than lay down all day. 

I get this type of sickness once every couple of years and it takes a long time for it to wear off so I doubt I’ll be anywhere near 100% on Monday and I need to be because this is my first real career job. It is also really far away like a 60km drive one way. 

My recruiter(s) have been really nice throughout and I’m wondering if I should email them and CC my manager (who I’ve never spoken to besides the interview) on Friday and ask to delay my start by a week by saying I have COVID or something (I haven’t tested but I’m just really sick). 

On the other hand since I’m a student I’ll only be working like 2 days a week so do I just suck it up and go even if I’m not well by then? 

Thanks for helping me out

1lecbq8,Should I pursue a PhD or stay in consulting?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently finishing my Master’s degree in systems engineering and doing an internship at an engineering consulting firm. Things are going well, and I’m fairly certain they’ll offer me a full-time position at the end of it.

Here’s my dilemma.

Option 1: 
Stay in the consulting firm
	•	I’d have a stable job right after graduation, which is reassuring.
	•	But project assignments are based on availability and client needs — meaning there’s a big element of luck involved.
	•	I’m worried that I’ll end up stuck in the firm for 2–3 years, cycling through projects that don’t really interest me or help me grow in the direction I want.
	•	The job market in my region isn’t great right now — most companies are asking for 2–3 years of experience, so this offer might be the only realistic option short-term.
	•	Compensation is okay, but growth seems slow and not very merit-based.

Option 2: 
Do a PhD
	•	There’s an opportunity to do a PhD with a supervisor I already worked with during my Master’s, continuing on a research topic I’m familiar with and genuinely interested in.
	•	It would give me the chance to specialize, work on something meaningful, and develop a more advanced and rare skill set.
	•	But I know a PhD is a big commitment  it could be isolating, the research might not go as planned, and it doesn’t guarantee a better job at the end.
	•	I’d also be delaying industry experience while most of my peers start working.


So I’m at a crossroads. Do I take the job now and risk getting stuck in a career path I’m not excited about? Or take the leap into a PhD, knowing it’s harder but might lead to more fulfilling opportunities later?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s faced a similar choice, or has insight into how these paths play out long-term.

Thanks in advance!

1lec87a,"My ex boss reached out for a position that opened which pays more, what should I do?","For context,

I just started my new job as a network technician, which is my first real job after finishing school. My ex boss reached out to me asking if I’m still interested in joining the team for a production support role because I was interning with them before I left. 

I’m not sure if I want to leave my new job just yet because I literally just started a month ago and I like it even though I’m pretty underpaid (45k). They do bump you up once you’re trained to 50k as a level 1 tech but that’s besides the point. 

The job offer is somewhere between 65k-70k (+45%) salary but I’m not even sure I want to accept either because I want to stay in the networking field and not too sure a production support role would align with my career goals since I don’t see where I can go from there. As with networking, I can probably end up as a network engineer or network security engineer in the future for example. Also the production support role is a bit boring in my opinion because I really didn’t do much but run programs on a mainframe system and make sure they ran successfully when I was interning which is basically the job. 

What would you guys do if you were in my position? Do you think it’s worth leaving my current job for more money even if I might dread working at the my old job there in the future ?

I have been on a career break of 5 months now and I wanted to choose a role ( preferably still in IT ) that isn't as horrible as QA.   
I have been thinking of getting into UX/UI designing since it would be a bit closer to something I love - art and designing, and it would be a little more fun, interacting with clients and making something of your own ( it's usually managers and senior QA who interact with the clients and we are not allowed to speak to them. We also are not allowed to bring in new ideas or suggest something better. We are mostly stuck with people who do the same 4 things they have been doing all their lives and are not ready to listen to anything )  
Coming back to the UX part, I have a good deal of experience in testing websites and worked closely with UI devs and UX designers and I have a strong feeling I'll be good at it. The only problem is AI seems to be taking over everything now. I am pretty sure QA roles have been eliminated in most product based companies and the quality assurance is being done by devs and nothing is too difficult with the help of AI , even UI designing. So I am afraid if this career switch is going to be futile as well.

Shall I go for a full stack dev role instead?  
Please suggest.

1leaw1s,"I can't decide on what to do after undergrad, how can anyone even know what they wanna do for the rest of their lives?","**Pre-info:** I'm a junior physics major.

I've so many possible career paths that I can not decide between. And I'm overwhelmed by the fact that what if I regret my choice? What if another path would be much better for me? What if, what if, what if... Thus, I just stress out and still can't decide what to do :D

I could apply for a PhD, which would take 5 more years in school. After that, I wanna work at the industry, cause I don't think academia is for me. Yet, I still wanna study nuclear physics, because I just really enjoy it. My GPA kind of says otherwise but anyways.

I could do a masters which would be 1-2 years which is much shorter and a plus. It would probably on engineering, but I didn't check masters in physics or I don't know what do people do after masters in physics, unless they are planning to do a PhD. Working in the industry looks good but a side of my wants to do the masters in engineering is to be an entrepreneur.

Our third option is the straight out of undergrad option. I'm gonna do any further studies. Well, I don't know much about what I can do with my BSc. Still an option though. And some people also strongly suggest it.

If I could decide whether I wanna do a PhD or work in the industry or try to become an entrepreneur, I could tailor my path according to that. However, I can't even even decide on what I want.

1le7tyb,"Career wise, is it a bad situation to be in a ""manager"" role without having those real responsibilities?","I'm a young professional. I have a manager level title, and I get paid as such. It's a bit of a long story in terms of how I got this 'role.' It's a smallish company with a weird structure. I've been here over 2 years, and worked with the 'executives' here beforehand. I just got a pay bump recently, a great bonus (which directly came out of my executives overall pot), and they are never on my ass in a negative way. I do get kernels of some extremely good training, and also get to lead most of our actual procurement negotiation. There's also some pretty good perks at this company. Just saying this to lay some context, it could certainly be worse, especially in this economy! 

With all that being said, I actually have a super negative attitude about it all. 

* Even though I have a 'team,' any leadership title I have is meaningless; the partners make all the real decisions. Not inherently bad, but I do have a vanity title. And I don't think it is ""me"" specific, more so just how our little business is structured. Overall, it just doesn't feel like a dignified role. 
* A lot of the tasks I have are blatantly outside of any job I ever agreed to, and a lot of them are very menial or 'junior work.' I do them, without complaint, but it feels more and more that I'm going backwards in my career. Sometimes I feel like my boss' secretary, which isn't what I want to do with 7 years' experience in my career. 
* I feel like I'm not building the relevant skills I want for my career aspirations. One day, I'd like to have an actual ""commercial"" role, but I'm not really learning this interesting stuff, building these contacts, etc. It just feels like a largely back office/execution role. 

I know I have a pretty good situation overall! 

But I'm feeling very defeated lately. Also because I've been working a while now (7 years), and my career is just turning out differently than I wanted. 

I guess my question is, should I run from this situation? I'd possibly be looking at a bit of a comp and title downgrade. 

Or should I try to ride it out, embrace the role a little bit more, and try to get into an actual title upgrade / promotion at another company over time? The other possibility is that some kind of shake up happens at my company over time.

1le7da3,trainer being really disrespectful,"My job makes me feel sick to my stomach. Just bc I am in training and don’t fully understand their software they treat me like I don’t understand life at all. For example: my trainer was making dumb jokes about me, another coworker said I was a rude person bc I got their name wrong, someone else explained to me how to drive down the road and if I get lost to use gps. It was really disturbing bc I drive to work everyday and am a full functioning adult I just started a new job and just bc I don’t grasp all the steps doesn’t mean I’m unable to function in life. My trainer also explained to me how to use a door lock , yet I clearly know how to lock and unlock doors since that’s how you open doors to your house and such. Just bc I don’t learn the way my trainer teaches (which has been to talk very fast or not talk and expect me to watch and grasp concepts) she thinks I’m not good at anything there. 


My relative told me to tell them my educational background and to me that’s a  way to gain potential respect by telling someone my certifications but I’m not interested. It could back fire and they could mock me more for being over qualified or something. Plus why tell people things about me when they don’t even respect me in the first place. 

Anyways I want to quit to do anything else. I am going to most likely go back to sales specifically in d2d. It’s the fastest way I can get hired and make money. I don’t want to work with uptight people that treat me like sh*t. 

They also treat me badly bc I’m not in a relationship or have kids. A weird way to judge people imo. My trainer explained to me that her and her bf have sex bc she wasn’t sure if I knew what that was bc I’m not dating?? Just bc I’m not dating doesn’t mean all of the sudden I don’t get life. Idk what I could even do to continue working here. I strongly dislike it. I cried in the bathroom for like 15 minutes the other day.

1le73c1,What should do?," How I should proceed with an issue I have with one of my charge nurses. I feel like I am being unfairly singled out and overworked through manipulation of patient assignments—specifically this role that we have in our department where we work on ""computer modules"". This role is suppose to be done in rotation. (look for the content in the first comment, filter keep removing this post, idkw)

When our department census is low rather cancel nurses they will make them do ""computer modules"" until there's an admission. (When a nurse is assigned modules you are in the unit on a computer working on modules until there's an admission, regardless if others are open nurse ""the module nurse"" will take the first admission... which is fair). I was assigned this role in the week prior and then I was assign the same role the following week. My first issue is when I saw I was assigned again, I brought it to my charge nurse I was told it was because I still had required modules to complete, while the other nurse who was previously assigned that role had already finished theirs. I responded that the other nurse could have been given elective modules, as is common practice when required ones are complete. Instead the charge nurse insisted I remain in the role that I was changed to due to my incomplete modules, without offering a consistent explanation for how the role rotation was being tracked or enforced. My second issue is that another nurse on a different day was given the ""computer module"" role and when NEW patient was being admitted my colleague who was open for admission got the assignment not the ""computer module"" nurse. Contradicting the rule that the module nurse takes the first admission.

Looking for the best course of action ensure accountability, do I go to management, HR, my union or just forget it? Anyone experience a similar situation and what did you do?

1le6xz3,Looking For Career Advice,"I'm a 38-year-old male with no idea what to do for a long-term career and just looking for some advice and a place to vent.

**Career Background:** I have a bachelor's degree in English teaching with a minor in School Library. I also have a master's degree in Creative Writing. I taught high school English for nine years. I left that job to move back to my hometown to be closer to my parents. I was burnt out and no longer healthy so I needed a change.

I started a job as a high school Librarian/Yearbook Adviser in my hometown. The position was cut for budgetary reasons after four years and they were forced to offer me a middle school English Teaching position since I had tenure. I turned it down as I didn't want to teach full-time and it was obvious they didn't want me to take the job.

I started working as an Advertising Director for a local newspaper. I was doing sales and a lot of operational things for the paper. I did that for 1.5 years but the sales goals got too outrageous as the company as a whole was struggling. There were things I liked about the job on the operational side but the sales stuff was a lot of pressure. I applied and got a job in procurement at the local University. They recruited people on the basis of hybrid work and good benefits. Well, both of those are disappearing on July 1st. Procurement is about as interesting as watching paint dry.

**Reasons I've Struggled With Jobs:** I think a huge reason I've struggled with jobs over the years is I'm not very social. I had a hard time connecting with students and lecturing all the time. I have a very hard time making small talk with colleagues, especially in the last three jobs I've had. I also feel exhausted all the time so I look miserable. I rarely feel happy because of my level of exhaustion. In my first teaching job, I did make some friends, but as I've aged and moved around with jobs, it's been very hard wanting to have conversations at work outside of stuff related to work. Just hard to relate to people at this point and everyone seems happier than I am and able to fake it if they aren't.

Also, it seems no matter what, after a certain amount of time, I lose interest in a job. The current Procurement job is a pretty soulless position. It's okay. It's stable. But I mostly applied for the benefits and just the fact that I needed a job. It kind of seems like once I learn a lot of what I'll need to know to do the job and that honeymoon period ends, I start kind of losing interest. I'm also feeling a bit upset as they hired me with the promise of hybrid work with one day required in the office. Now we have to start going in five days per week and it's quite the commute.

I'm working with a therapist now and wondering if maybe a career counselor would be the next step. If I could have kept any job I've had, it would have been the high school Library position because I had summers off and was working toward a retirement. However, you have to want to teach to remain in a position like that. And there are no jobs at local libraries here. The job market locally is not good for the things I have my degrees and experience in.

Just looking to vent here. Don't skewer me. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",scootermcgroover,1,1.0,0,1750216969,2025-06-18 03:22:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1le6xz3/looking_for_career_advice/,6,2025

1le5fle,how to address dissatisfaction with performance review?,"I (24F) have been working my current job for about a year and half now, and just had my second ever performance review.

At my job, you typically receive an increase of 3-5 pay increments. Last year, I received 4 despite only being there for 4 months. This year, I received 4 as well. To be honest, I was expecting 5 as we had a coworker pass away and had absorbed most of her job responsibilities in addition to my own, and now train her replacement. 

So, I asked my boss what would qualify me for 5 increments. She stated it’s whether she comes to me for questions she has (basically if she is leaning on me for advice/knowledge/expertise).

So I left this review feeling a little cheated. This seems like that 5th increment is based on an external factor I can’t really control? Especially where there are two other people in my position who have worked here longer than me (who are also physically closer to her office).

These reviews consist of her handing me the rubric and letting me read it over, and asking if I have questions. It doesn’t feel very thorough but I can admit I am not exactly taking charge and driving conversation. 

Any advice on how I can address my dissatisfaction with how these reviews are done, and how this 5th increment is assessed would be great!",short_and_sweett,1,1.0,1,1750212312,2025-06-18 02:05:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1le5fle/how_to_address_dissatisfaction_with_performance/,6,2025
1le52eg,First formal corporate performance review today,"\[23M\]

Reviews were done in-person with the CEO in which we would review our self-evaluation, our manager's valuation, and go over logistics such as bonuses and raises.

Good news: I got ""Exceeds all expectations"" for all of the categories. Manager's feedback was thoughtful and mostly glowing (""\[Me\] demonstrates exceptional breadth; eagerly dives into new languages, SDKs, and frameworks, often delivering functional features very quickly."", ""\[Me\] is exemplary in client follow-ups; responding within four business hours and documenting decisions clearly.""). Criticisms were small things, presumably because they have to write something down for that (""Make sure every demo and screen-share is up and running before the guest joins"", ""Sometimes shows visible frustration when stakeholders pivot"" \[who doesn't lol\]).

Bad news: did not get a bonus, or a salary increase. CEO explains that usually X% of profit is reserved for the employee bonus pool, but it was a bad year for company so this year the bonus pool was 0. Salary increases were only for promotions.

Although this technically means I'm being paid less, it could be worse. My understanding is that not doing bonuses or salary increases is just one of the ways companies use to avoid having to fire people. Sucks because I was already being paid below market rate, but oh well.

1le3wfe,Think I Made a Bad Career Move?," **Think I Made a Bad Career Move**

Yes, I did have chat gpt help me polish my post.

I’ll try to keep this short but would appreciate any Insite.

I started in construction equipment rentals, worked the counter, did deliveries (I could operate equipment and drive rollback truck), and eventually took on a role seeing customers and handling used equipment sales. Did that for 6 years. The job had variety, and I liked dealing with customers, but the equipment was old and unreliable. We were selling machines like 15-year-old skid steers with 7,000+ hours that the company expected top dollar for. I only got paid commission when the company got paid in full, and sometimes I’d lose the whole thing if there was a dispute or payment delay. That wore me down as many units I sold would break down and customers would stop paying.

I moved to a forklift dealership and helped run their rental department across 4 locations. Inside sales, operations, reporting, customer jobs, fleet management, a lot of responsibility. After 3 years, I became the assistant rental manager (basically the rental manager) and was told long-term they wanted me in outside sales, but the guy in that role wasn’t going anywhere for a while. Salary was $120K plus bonuses. I liked the customer-facing side of things but hated being in an office 50+ hours a week, getting home late every night. With a toddler at home, I felt like I was missing everything.

That’s when a generator rental company came calling again. I had spoken with them a few times over the years, but this time they had a new manager and a serious offer: $80K base, guaranteed commission bringing it to about $125K in year one, plus a car allowance. Full-time outside sales, work from home, small territory, home every night

Now I’m 6 months in, and I’m realizing it’s not what I thought.

The rental department is small. The outside sales role is extremely operational. I’m constantly dealing with logistics, chasing service calls, and managing equipment failures. Instead of selling, I’m mostly apologizing to customers and putting out fires.

To make it worse, most of my day is spent sending quotes to electrical contractors and whether I get the job depends entirely on if they win the bid or not. My actual sales skills, relationship-building, and effort don’t really move the needle. It's a waiting game, and it’s draining not having more control over the outcome. The company hired a marketing company to help with leads but as of now that part is stale. I sell more jobs being reactive to electrical contractors and getting them quotes as fast as I can, which isn't possible if I am out on the road. I cold call as much as I can but without direction cold calling rental generators that can power hospitals are far and in between and these sort of end users only need my product with the power goes out which is not very often.

I’m not sure what to do. I like working from home and being home in the evenings, but this role feels like a dead end. I’m questioning if I made a huge mistake leaving the forklift job, even though I was burned out there too.

1le3w4e,PIP,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently a first-year at a Big 4 firm in Canada and recently had my year-end performance review. I had four reviews in total, and three of them were positive — each rated as a “3,” which reflects meeting expectations and is considered standard performance for someone at my level.

However, one engagement significantly impacted my overall assessment. I worked under a senior who I struggled to connect with professionally. Whenever I asked her questions, she would respond with, “What do you think?” — which I initially understood as a coaching technique, but it often felt dismissive. I genuinely tried to adjust my approach and become more independent, but she continued to be critical of my work and micromanaged me throughout the entire engagement.

I communicated this to the engagement manager at the time. However, when I received my review from that engagement, it was a “4” (on a scale where 1 is excellent and 5 is poor). The comments from the manager seemed to mirror exactly what the senior said, with no acknowledgment of the full context or my efforts. It felt like my voice was completely dismissed.

Fast forward to my performance calibration: I found out I was not promoted, even though every single one of my peers was. On top of that, I’ve now been placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) — which I haven’t signed yet — despite the fact that the majority of my reviews were solid and reflected meeting expectations.

I’m at a complete loss. I’ve worked incredibly hard, taken on responsibilities, adjusted based on feedback, and tried to grow. Now, I feel like everything I’ve built is on shaky ground because of one engagement. I’m seriously considering quitting, but I’m scared — because my CPA experience is tied to this job, and I don’t want to risk my designation.

Has anyone gone through something similar? Would it be a mistake to walk away? How should I navigate this situation — especially with the PIP hanging over me?

Any advice would mean a lot. I’m trying to stay grounded, but this has been incredibly discouraging.",lovegirlish2023,1,1.0,1,1750207638,2025-06-18 00:47:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1le3w4e/pip/,6,2025

• Are there companies within Metro Manila that you know of which accept junior or entry-level BAs? What are their benefits, growth opportunities, and work culture? 
• What other advice would you give to someone trying to land their first BA role?

1le1vox,Marketing the same as Communications?,"I am a recruiter for undergraduate students in a humanities and social sciences college at a big university. I create events, give tours and info sessions etc. Our university has a specific visual marketing language and our own college has a variation of that, but it's very sporty and corporate. Our enrollment has taken a hit when some bad narratives about our majors and jobs, politics etc. I have been in the role for two years and do a lot of research on marketing and young people. I like to play with our branding, sticking to the fonts and colors, but using fun designs and images (think a sticker of an open door, with our colors and icons of our majors swirling around). Our college has an internal communications team that HATES when I deviate from the brand (i.e the swirls in my sticker design are not ""on brand""). I see them as internal communications experts for our college, not marketing experts, and not my managers. The dean has really liked the stuff I send, but communications keeps trying to stop my projects. I am good at it, but don't always adhere to the brand in the strictest way (but get sign off on big things). Where can we go from here? I love my job working with young people and love being creative. For context, I am the only employee other than my team of student ambassadors on the recruitment team.

1le0g0k,How to handle the optics of always being at the scene of problems?,"I’m one of only a couple coders in an organization that is not tech. 

As a result, any time there is a problem, I am the one who has to fix it. Because I am relatively new, I don’t feel like all my nontechnical coworkers always believe me or find me credible when I explain the causes of problems or solutions.

For example, if there is an external outage causing issues with our product, and I relay this information with linked proof, most people are happy with my explanation, but a handful seem to doubt me and think I caused the outage or don’t know how to fix it.

This specific industry is very anti-AI, which is part of what I was hired to do. My background is a mix of technical and nontechnical and instilled in me a lot of ethics, so I would classify myself as one of the most careful around AI products and always highlighting potential concerns to leadership. But at the end of the day, I would not deem myself anti-AI for smart, responsible applications. I always advocate for my team members to get a seat at the table to voice concerns and ideas as well. I try my best to be ethical and do my job responsibilities. My track record for AI work demonstrates this.

I suspect this is why a few of our most anti-AI workers try to publicly highlight any technical issues they believe I’ve caused or criticize any work I do publicly (meanwhile receiving glowing praise from the rest of the team). We are remote and some of them I have barely interacted with so I cannot find some personal offense I may have caused them. I don’t know that it is directly related to AI but it’s the best theory I have.

My technical boss has no issues with me, and most of my coworkers seem to like me and appreciate when I help them fix things or automate parts of their job they hate. But I feel politics going on with these other workers who criticize every move I make publicly.

I am not worried about my manager, but some of these workers are high up in the organization so I worry about their animosity toward me.

Thoughts and advice? My friends tell me there’s always someone like this at an org and to just keep my head up and focus on working with my technical manager and keeping them happy.

Is there anything I can do to protect my public reputation or even to smooth over whatever issues these few people have with me?

I remember in my last office job, if one of our technically illiterate workers ran into an issue, they’d almost always instantly blame our tech team even if they very comically had nothing to do with it (why won’t this email send in Gmail type thing). The tech team would help fix it but they never stopped getting blamed for things and these people never publicly admitted they were wrong or apologized for damaging their image.

Sometimes it is clear to others the tech team wasn’t to blame and almost funny but other times less so and it is more damaging.

My situation is reminding me of that. It sucks because this has otherwise been a dream job.

I’m 20 years old, and I’ve completed my 12th with commerce and maths.

I feel grateful to even have a second interview this quick in this bad market, but I have a really bad feeling about it, example my HR interview is tonight at 9pm bc they’re based out of Singapore.

1ldxw33,What To Do With My Life,"Hello,

I am feeling a bit lost about the direction I should take with my life. I have been feeling a bit stuck but have felt some more motivation recently and have been trying to take advantage of my momentum and some actionable steps.

Here is where I am at. I have graduated with a Bachelor's in Psychology. I have a degree with distinction which is along the lines of a senior thesis. This means I worked on my own research with a mentor and produced a manuscript as well as presented at conferences( I was awarded a grant for this). I worked as a teaching assistant for a semester for a research statistics course. I won the best senior in psychology award in my year.

When I graduated I knew I was going to take a year break. In this time I wanted to do some research assistant work and had started hard-applying to jobs, reached out to connections through my professors, and followed up etc. I did not get a position. As such, I am currently a barista.

My idea post-graduation was to go to graduate school- mainly a PhD. My professors have said that with my experience I would be ready for a program but I worry I need a masters. I still apply to jobs to here and there when I feel motivation but as time has gone by I am starting to feel more and more discouraged if Psychology was the right direction for me. I loved the subject matter and I enjoyed research, but as time has gone by I worry if I will get a job after all this time in school.

SO I am telling myself that I should go for the PhD. That my discouragement is because of the time that has gone by. I have done some travelling in Europe and I am considering looking for programs there. I have EU citizenship as well so it may be free or at least less expensive? I need to look into this. However, thoughts have crossed my mind that maybe I should go back to school for something more career lucrative? Should I not go back to school at all and start looking for ANY job that pays better and helps me start a life?

I wanted to hear what people's experiences and suggestions are.

**TLDR:** Graduated in psychology with no job in field after graduation. Considering going back to school if worth it to have a career afterwards or if I should change directions?",torpymagnet,1,1.0,1,1750191959,2025-06-17 20:25:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldxw33/what_to_do_with_my_life/,6,2025
1ldx4gq,Looking for Job Search Advice - Social Anxiety Making Everything Harder,"I'm a creative professional dealing with worsening social anxiety, and it's making job searching feel impossible. I'm great with people I already know, but meeting new people fills me with dread - which makes interviews and networking terrifying.

Throughout my career, I've been lucky to transition from job to job through connections, but now I'm actively job hunting for the first time in years and struggling badly. I know I'm capable of doing the work (people who know me constantly tell me I'm a hard worker), but I keep psyching myself out during applications.

My brain fixates on every skill I don't have perfectly, convinced they'll reject me no matter how good my experience looks on paper. When I don't hear back from the dozens of applications I've sent out, it just reinforces that voice telling me I'm not good enough.

I'm stuck in a cycle of self-doubt and could really use advice from others who've dealt with social anxiety during job searches. How do you push through the fear? Any tips for building confidence when your brain is working against you?

I will be graduating college with a CS degree in Dec 2026, so hopefully I have some time to get somewhere before that. I recently realized that I am not too interested or passionate about software engineering. I do know that I like numbers and think that I think very analytical so I thought that it would be an interesting career. Over the past few months I have been thinking about this career path, and recently started thinking that healthcare analytics would be a good fit. I could be wrong but I feel like it would be a good way to help people. I am in the process of learning SQL and Power BI, and I plan on learning more advanced excel after that. Now here are my questions: 
1. I hear that there are no such thing as entry level data analytics, from other posts, so what would be the best way to get into it?
2. What would be a good projects to demonstrate that I am competent and give me a chance? Also how big are the projects( how long do they take and )? 
3. What are the key concepts that you would say are the most important for me to master?
4. I know the job market is bad right now but would you say this is a viable career choice?

1ldv1id,What should I do to upskill myself to get a good job?,"Basically the title, but a bit complicated because of my overall career trajectory. I live in India and I am currently doing an MBA (in my second year, will graduate by 2026).

My undergraduate was in engineering, then I took care of operations for an NGO (strange choice I know but I was attracted by the vision of the NGO that was into improving the lives of the marginalized like elderly and children, so I thought I will give it my time). This was a full-time job that I did for 2 years but NGOs in India pay peanuts and I made just less than 2 lakh rupees in a year. After this I got struck by a few medical emergencies (self), which made me take two years off the job market.

Then I passed the exam for MBA in India and joined this college, completed a year. Quite an average student with strengths in subjects like Marketing, Organizational Functioning etc but really struggle with the so-called ""hard subjects"" like operations, finance etc.

Now it will be hiring season in a few months on campus but I want to put my best foot forward - I know it's too much of an ask (given my really low salary in the one previous job I had) but I would like to get into a job that pays me at least 16 to 20 lakh per annum (because i have paid a similar amount to fund this MBA). Is there anything I can do here? Any certifications, prep for applying outside campus etc? I have one (perhaps my only) strength which is excellent communication: I can write and convey my points orally accurately, confidently and without any hesitation.

1lds0ew,"Confused, and looking for career advice.","I struggle with keeping a job depending on the work environment. 
I’ve learned retail isn’t for me as it causes some unresolved anger issues to come out of me that isn’t very pleasant, 
And custodial work (working for public schools) was one of the best jobs I had for pay, and being able to work alone, 
And be most affective for me, but it’s summer and no public schools are looking for custodians. 
Caregiving I could only do at night because no driver licenses at the moment, and although I could handle that it got very lonely over a year of being in that field. 
I’ve tried housekeeping but its to fast pace for me personally. 

So, working with customers in retail isn’t for me, and jobs I’m not dealing with customers is more ideal.
Just for some explanation on my personal experience I’ve had so far. 

I always wanted to do remote work, but I’m Entirely sure where to start with gaining skills and what would be best suited for me to be able to handle and actually enjoy doing. 
I’m a creative person, that also loves ticking around on computers, figuring out if something not working and fixing etc. 
my grammar sucks but I love typing with a passion. 

I struggle with adhd, and always had a learning disability where I don’t understand specific information unless prevented me in away it catches my interest enough for my mind to click in. Not to say I’m not the smartest bean in the pot, but 
I just naturally struggle with understanding some information but I want to learn how to fix it or find away for me to understand, so I can get a career in something I can do remote eventually as I prefer being by myself and the idea of being able to work from home seems most ideal for me.

Thing is, I’m still confused on what I can do for a career, and how to gain enough experience to get into a job that I can do from home. 

I considered boot camps but not internally sure which are legit and which are not. 
And or if I should try to do a collage course to gain the experience to get into something I could eventually do remote. 

But not sure what job I can get right now that I know I could handle for a year or 2 is tricky for me. 
so I came to Reddit to seek others advice on my experiences I’ve dealt with, and figured maybe you guys can give me some idea’s on
Either jobs I could do remote even if they don’t pay much but its a starting point for remote work at least, 
Or if others were in the same boat, and know some in person job idea’s you think someone like me who prefers to work alone, 
And is running out of idea’s for lone work I could possibly check around in my area for to see if there any available.

this may not be the smartest way to ask for advice but I figured if I give enough information about my struggles, and things I’m looking into, 
Maybe a few of you lovely individuals will or can help me out with some idea’s I could look into for work.

Even if its advice for temporary work for a year or 2 till I get a degree if I must till I can get into the field I’d prefer anything will help. 

Basically need a job I can handle right now, and then work towards maybe going remote after I get an enough experience or a degree or something.

I’m only asking because I can’t think of any other jobs I never thought about before, I never consider caregiving till I tried it, never considered custodian work till I tried it and they both where jobs ex’s helped me get into that I generally could handle. 
So not being the smartest cookie on the block, I figured ya’ll could give me some idea’s for either a cleaning job or something that’s more alone work.
I’d prefer a 1st or 2nd shift over 3rd which is why I haven’t tried to get back into caregiving. 
But lack of a licenses, I’d have to find a rides thru my mom, or use the bus system which isn’t very big (surprisingly) for the town I’m in.
At least compared to where I lived before when I had the custodian job. 
(Without giving details where I lived/ currently live for privacy reasons)

1ldrpy4,Are You Employed? Sweet...I'm Not! Looking for Advice,"Hello reader, 19M here, **looking for advice from seniors who're doing great in life financially/mentally** in every shape, form, and type.

I have a combat sport background, and I thought it would be a great idea if I could learn to *just* market stuff.

Yeah..It's been more than 3 years haven't even breakthrough ₹50k/month remote mark.

I'm a direct response copywriter for financial, healthcare, and professional coaches and a generalist marketer.

For those who don't know what DR-Copy is: It's a style of content you see that requires an immediate action, i.e., purchase now, click here now, etc. (You'll see DR-Copy mostly in sales letters, Sales email copy, ad copy, and other e-commerce product pages)...and NO, Ai is nowhere near writing good copy that drives good results.

And yes, unlike content writing/marketing, DR-copywriting is somewhat different, mainly the goal is always to make a user buy, if that makes sense to you.

Now...

For the past 4+ months, I'm unemployed (that's another story itself), moved back to my hometown, can't train for what I love the most, MMA (and no I didn't start after this worst wave of MMA here in India, I've been doing it for some time)

As we speak, I'm writing this post after sending my daily 10-20 hyper-personalized emails and WhatsApp messages (to U.S and Indian prospects, respectively)and applying to jobs daily on LinkedIn, Naukri, and other job portals.

Unfortunately...This wave of AI is the germ, I believe.

I even spent my last savings on paid ads for freelance work, burned it all (around 10k, I know it's not a lot, but for me it is.)

The only mistake I made was: I targeted Indian professional info-product sellers, not international ones. (Because they don't want to spend a dime and want work worth lakhs and revenue of crores.)

**My point of this post is whether should I continue refining my copywriting skills or do something else on top of that?**

I seriously need to get employed.

That's it for my side, I'd truly appreciate any advice/help to earn me consistent money, to be very honest.

Thank you for reading.

**P.S.** You may hate me on this, but I can only be comfortable in remote work, I have a shrinking personality when I'm around ladies and gentlemen whom I've never met before, and right now I'm in a Tier-3 city far from metro cities as I've told you earlier I'm moved back to my hometown.

**TL;DR** I'm an unemployed copywriter looking for advice to get employed in this dry job market.",bakchodimeter104paar,1,1.0,1,1750177772,2025-06-17 16:29:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldrpy4/are_you_employed_sweetim_not_looking_for_advice/,6,2025

1ldr4nr,Manager is usually great but isn't actually listening in calls and it's causing more meetings and an assumption that their not being engaged is the same as me not being prepared.,"I usually have a slide deck with the big questions answered because we're busy, lots going on, nobody wants to hear a paragraph of audio to get to the point. I answer the big questions like how I propose solving an issue, get feedback, adjust the deck with responses for the follow up and we move on.

Every single call lately I'll say something like ""When 2 records have the same score we use last activity date to determine which one is the one we keep"" without fail moments later she tunes in after we've moved on and asks ""what happens when 2 records have the same score? we need to resolve that, it's going to happen."" I repeat it, she likes the concept, signs off on the solution, then she asks the same question 10 minutes later. Today she scheduled another call to make sure I understood the requirement and provided a list of questions that were all answered a few minutes earlier. 

She is smart, motivated, always has our back, but we're now having multiple meetings to cover the same material over and over, and I don't know what to do with that. Confluence pages don't seem to matter, notes don't matter, follow up emails don't matter, chat records don't matter.

She does not owe me her undivided attention, I am not so bold, she has a lot of responsibility, but I am starting to feel like my performance has begun being judged based on her inability to pay attention to the highest level details I can condense work done on our obnoxiously complicated business processes. That's where I have to draw a line and find a solution before this becomes a problem.

Is this something I can help remedy on my end or just a manager issue that I can either take it or leave? ",throwawaythepoopies,1,1.0,0,1750176408,2025-06-17 16:06:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldr4nr/manager_is_usually_great_but_isnt_actually/,6,2025

1ldquk8,Working in HFC (HybridFiberCoax) system but director says Fiber is the next big thing,"Hello all I am 28 Male, working in a telecom industry with a big name service provider in Louisiana. 

We have been rolling out fiber to more rural areas (which is pretty much most of this state) but some areas are still coax with fiber mixed in to the system for redundancy. My director claims that fiber is going to be the future it’s been slow as far as getting people trained and acquiring tools, which I understand takes time and money but I’ve been in this job for almost 5 years now and honestly I feel stuck. 

My pay is 24.76 as Broadband Tech Lvl 3 and I assume with fiber training comes more pay. 

I guess what I’m trying to inquire about is should I wait around and get trained or should I just move on to something different?

1ldqsz0,"Started a new job, exactly 1 month later, I was told my job would be changing, and my pay would be reduced. Advice needed.","I live in an area that was severely impacted by Hurricane Helene, which caused me to lose my job last October. A month ago, I started what I thought was a perfect job in marketing as a manager for a new team and department. I have been so excited to get back to work and threw myself into my new role, jumping at any chance I had to learn as much as possible. I even dropped everything to attend a conference at the last minute, in order to network and bring ideas back to the team on how we can set ourselves apart from the competition. Everything seemed perfect. I had been getting along really well with my boss, and I was thrilled to be a part of the company. 

Until the day after the conference last week, when my manager called me to let me know they had decided to restructure the team and I would no longer be a manager. My team would be reporting directly to my new manager, and I would become an individual contributor on the team. My pay was also reduced, and I no longer have the responsibilities of my role that I was most excited for. 

Out of nowhere, my entire role changed to one I know I won't be happy in and will not utilize any of my skillset. I learned of this change late Wednesday evening, and it took effect yesterday. To say I'm gutted is an understatement. My boss assured me that they want to keep me on and that they have seen me working very hard and see a lot of potential in me. However, there is no flexibility in the responsibilities of my new role. I was very open that I did not feel like my skill set aligned with this new role, and that I did not see myself being successful long-term in it. I need more. I don't mind being an individual contributor, but not being able to use my brain to strategize or analyze metrics is not going to be fulfilling to me in any way. 

I have no idea what to do. The current job market is terrible, and it took me so long to find a job; I have zero negotiating power. I asked if they could at least allow me to keep my original pay, but they said no. I feel so defeated and hopeless. I've been looking at job openings, and nothing pays the same as what I'm making at my reduced rate, which is okay, but the role itself is a front-line role that involves a lot of community interaction. I am not an extroverted person, and can do front-facing things in very limited amounts. I prefer to be behind the scenes, and I thought that was the role I was accepting. 

I don't really know what I'm looking for as far as advice. I just feel so depressed and needed to talk about it to someone.

1ldojtr,I just found out the Coworker I am training makes more than I do. How do I address this?,"I started working at this company 5 years ago and I have always considered myself lucky to work here. The pay is fine, PTO is okay, my co-workers are nice, and the benefits are great. I get to work with big name brands and I love the style of work. The company is HUGE on loyalty to the employees (at least they claim to be) and I thought I was getting a pretty fair deal. I have a specialized design job where I work with 3d models and physical objects, that takes a lot more than just a graphic design degree. My wife is a graphic designer, and makes more than I do, which is what initially lead to me to start thinking I might be underpaid.  Last year, I brought up that I feel a bit underpaid, and my manager agreed and said he wanted to give me a bigger raise than usual, saying that combined with my raise this year, I would catch up to where I am ""supposed to be"". This made me feel good at first, thinking he had my back and that I really would be getting better raises and was going to get paid what I was worth since I have taken on bigger and bigger projects. I now am the lead designer for our biggest customer, and am working on extra projects this year that will make the company TONS of money (I don't want to give specifics, but we are talking tens of millions of dollars.) on top of all the things I have done to speed our process as a team, and training, etc. I am making/saving the company a ton of money. (I did the math and have the numbers... It's wild.) Because the customer we work with is... Difficult... We have had a lot of turn over of designers (not leaving the company, but refusing to work with this customer after about a year of putting up with their crap.) I have been working with this customer for 3.5ish years and am now the last designer on this team we specifically created for this customer. We hired a few new people recently to help with this since the other designers refused to join the team. One of these new hires complained that she wasn't making enough (she is single, living in her parents basement, and generally does not have expenses because her parents pay for food, car, and phone. She basically buys gas. 😑) and I said something like, ""Oh yeah. I get it, 48k isn't a lot, but the work is rewarding."" And she replied with, ""Do you mean 58k?"" 👀 WHAT? I was flabbergasted. (And I did confirm, she makes 10k more than I do, and I am literally training her to join this team.) She agreed with me that it's shady the company is telling me that they know I am underpaid, but that it would take me another 5 years of raises just to get to where she is now. (This doesn't even include the fact that she got a raise after 90 days, and I did not receive one until the end of year one.) The problem I am having is that I am coming up on my yearly review where raises are brought up, and I feel like now is the time to strike so to speak. I am the last line of defense on our biggest client. If I were to quit, they would be in a REALLY rough spot because I am the only one who knows all the changes our customer made to this project and I crank out the designs in the same quantity as when we had 3 designers all working on this project. (Which is partly why I am upset that the raises havent been great working here. I always go above and beyond and I have the numbers to prove it... If I were slacking, I would understand, but I am literally leading a small team of people...) If that suddenly went away they would start missing deadlines for AT LEAST the first 3 months which would cost them millions of dollars. It doesn't seem crazy for me to ask to make AT THE VERY LEAST 58k, (right? 😅) but I feel like I should be making more than my co-worker since I am training her. But at this point, getting to 58k would be huge. All this to say, how do I bring this up to my manager without coming across unprofessional? Should I bring up the fact she is making more than me? I really don't want to look for a different job because this place works with huge company names and I get to work with the biggest of those clients on a daily basis. It is gold for a future resume (on top of the company itself being a big name). 

TLDR: The person I am training makes 10k more than me. How do I ask my company to pay me what I am worth professionally?

1ldocc4,What are my realistic career options after a CSE degree if I'm not at all good at coding?,"Hi everyone,

I hope I'm in the right place to ask this question.

I’ve completed my BTech in Computer Science from a decent college in India, with a CGPA of 8.52. But to be brutally honest, the four years took a toll on me due to a variety of circumstances. I don’t feel like I learned anything substantial. I mostly did the bare minimum, and now I seriously feel like I can't compete with others in terms of skills.

I'm not confident in DSA—I go blank when I stare at LeetCode hards, and I still struggle with >50% of the LeetCode mediums. I am not even going to speak of my pathetic attempts in Competitive Programming.

Because of this, I’m starting to think that I might not be suited for tech-related roles. That brings me to my question: **realistically, what are my options**?

Are there career paths where there’s less intense competition, and you don’t have to be a prodigy to get a job?

I understand that I’m in no position to expect high, competitive salaries. What I’m really looking for is something stable where I can make a modest living and hopefully rebuild my confidence over time.

I told him I had spoken to the other team members but wanted to ask about joining. He let me know about the software they use. He said SQL is the most important thing. Mentioned snowflake. And also they do a lot of analysis. He said there might be a space open in the data governance side of things. He invited me to email him to chat more about the timeline since I’m in school.

I’m in school for accounting, and he mentioned that would be a good fire . However, I’m just starting my accounting classes (WGU, so it’s self paced). I spent a lot of time studying computer science theory when I was unemployed, and I have a pretty solid understanding of the principles of programming and computational thinking since my dad was a developer. I don’t think SQL will be hard to learn but I’m not sure how to sell it to him? I mean I’m barely into my degree at all, and I don’t have any projects to show. What can I say to the guy to sell myself?

1ldldqq,Would you take a job with added responsibility for the experience?,"

Cross posted. 

TL/DR on the bottom but the context is helpful! 

For context, I am currently a teacher going into my 9th year. At the start of next year I will be making around 82k. I am getting tired of being in the classroom, but it’s consistent, I am good at it, and I like my building and coworkers enough- I am just not really happy. 

  
Yesterday I had an interview to be an administrator at a special education preschool And I think I have a fairly chance at being called back but I have a lot to think about. The school year is 30 days longer and their starting pay is 85,000 (which I assume is where I will be as I am not done with my program) 

This position would likely be the only one to hire me with an incomplete degree unless I can find someone who is willing to take a chance on someone midway through the program (the state can give an internship certificate but that is few and far in between because the state enjoys being difficult ) 

  
There are pros and cons but the biggest con I see is that it is more days, more hours and more responsibility. I DO have experience as a daycare director which I LOVE and based on what they have said it would be similar to this- almost identical responsibilities (the daycare doesn’t pay enough though) 

Pros are: It’s about 10/15 minutes closer to home, the people seem great- they have great reviews from families and the owners take a very holistic and collaborative approach- It seems I would be happy there. 



Public school administrators start at 100+ in my area But as someone out of college I might be at a disadvantage when that time comes 

  
So my question is, what would you do.

1ldks2n,Throwing in the towel on my renovation business to work equipment rental sales?,"Not much to it. I’m a dad of 2 young kids. I currently run a 1 man Reno business for the last 4 years. It’s been good. I’m making a profit of about 70k a year. My wife’s got a good government job so we have good benefits that way. I don’t plan on growing or expanding the business. I just like to work alone.

But I’m getting sick of the cancerous dust (yes I wear a mask but you’re still exposed) and the toll it’s taking on my body. And all the headaches (taxes, insurance, bookkeeping, annoying customers.. you get the point.) 

I usually take between 5-8 weeks vacation a year which is really awesome and I have so much free time but I have 0 retirement plans or funds. It’s tough to charge a super high amount in my area for carpentry work. I charge a fair price and make an honest living. 



Now 

I have an offer for an outside sales position with a very good equipment rental company in my country 

(85k a year plus a company truck and gas card, and full pension benefits and investment matching etc) 

I would have only 3 weeks vacation to start and have way less freedom than what I’m currently doing but no more breathing MDF and asbestos and killing my back. Also tons of room for improvement and growth within the company. No more vehicle expenses at all. I’m about $1200 a month for my work truck and gas and maintenance right now.

I’m a software developer (Java) with about 5 years of experience. I worked only for local companies in my country — never remote or for international clients.

Almost 3 years ago, I stopped working due to some personal reasons. At first, I thought it would be a short break, but I slowly lost motivation and didn’t return. Now I really want to get back into the industry.

The biggest challenge I see is the career gap. During these 3 years, I mostly watched tutorials and read some books, but I didn’t really code or build anything serious. I'm thinking of saying I did some freelance work for about a year to cover part of the gap.

I feel I can prepare well enough for interviews, but I’m afraid companies will ignore me because of the long break. The market looks tough and competitive.

1ldj1bl,Should I stay or should I go?,"Hi everyone, looking for some advice and would really appreciate any perspectives.

I'm 31 and based in Singapore. I've been working in the media/film industry since graduation, and I’m currently facing a dilemma about my future.

After university, I joined my relative’s small film/media company (less than 10 staff). She is the founder and director, and everyone works directly under her. While I enjoyed my role, I found the environment difficult. 

After speaking to my colleagues, many felt the company lacked structure and unclear instructions. Many also felt constantly on edge due to my relative's temperament. It wasn't uncommon to see someone getting shouted at. Thus, the company had a very high turnover rate. After 3 years, I left because I wanted to experience what it was like working in a different environment, one that wasn't tied to family.

I joined a larger company and worked there for another 3 years. The job scopes were clear, there was a better work-life balance, and superiors I could go to for advice. Each person had defined roles, unlike in the small company where everyone was expected to cover everything.

This experience showed me what structure and professionalism could look like, and I felt more confident and supported in my day-to-day work.

Recently, during a dinner, my relative invited me back to her company, with the intention of grooming me as her successor. I agreed, hoping things had improved and thinking that maybe I could learn how to be a better leader and how to manage a business.

Now that I’m back (for a few months), the atmosphere is slightly better, but I still sense many of the same patterns: lack of structure, poor communication, and proper guidance. I’m starting to question if this was the right move.

Am I too shortsighted or give up too easily for thinking about leaving? How do I know if I'm walking away too soon vs saving myself from staying in a place that's not suited for me?

1ldhham,Internship at Infotact solutions,"Hello, people.. I'm in my 7th sem in a tier 3 engg college pursuing b tech in CSE. So, since the start of May, that happens to be our sem break, I started applying for internships from wherever I find one(the ones placement cell provides and the ones from social media and job portals). Got rejected for a few and few of them are still ongoing..

Now the thing is, I recently applied for a company through facebook ig, Infotact solutions, offering internships (applied for Py dev). The mail I got after I applied said that I'd go through the process of resume screening, coding assessment, proof verif and interview, if I get shortlisted in each round.
But, I just got an offer letter saying that I'm selected and I should accept this by 25th of this month or I'm gonna lose it AND I didn't give any exam all the way. They did mention about the stipend (5k max) but I'm not sure whether to take it or not because if I take this up, idt I'll be eligible for the companies that our placement cell brings to us which are much better offers. Also they didn't conduct any exam and that makes it sound a little unreliable...

Yes I might get an offer through college and then better and bigger opportunities might flood in after I accept whatever I get.

1ldhah8,Need Advice: Asking for Temporary Help Without Looking Incompetent,"Hi everyone,

I was recently promoted to *Operations Manager* at my job—though truthfully, my responsibilities haven’t changed. I just advocated for a title that actually reflects what I’ve been doing all along. I did get a solid raise with it, which I’m grateful for.

For context, I work at a residential mental health facility. I’m responsible for all things compliance related to *The Joint Commission*—which, as many of you probably know, means keeping up with *thousands* of standards. On top of that, I handle onboarding, interviewing, staff training development, and basically anything else the Executive Director or COO needs from me. It’s a lot.

Here’s the honest part: I’m drowning. I’ve fallen way behind, and I’m terrified that if we got audited tomorrow, we would fail—badly.

I’ve asked for support twice already and was told I just need to manage my time better and “work harder.” But this job is simply not a one-person role anymore. It’s grown too large, and leadership won’t acknowledge that.

I want to ask for a temporary assistant—someone who can help me get organized, triage the backlog, and divide and conquer so we can get *survey ready*. But every person I’ve floated this idea to has warned me it would backfire. They say it’ll make me look like I can’t handle my job or that leadership shouldn’t have to “pay someone else to clean up my mess.”

But here’s the thing: I wasn’t set up for success in this role. I’ve been with this organization for five years and have given so much of myself. I just want us to pass our survey. The anxiety of knowing we aren’t ready is eating me alive—and no matter how hard I work, I can’t make a big enough dent in my never-ending to-do list.

So I’m turning to you all:  
**Would asking for a temp assistant make me look incompetent? Or is it worth advocating for the support I clearly need—even if leadership might not like the optics?**

1ldgng2,How to Keep Ex-Coworker from Ruining My Work Reputation,"I just got a call today at 1:30am from an ex-coworker(32f) asking me(30f) if I’ve ever been with her now boyfriend. And it’s a long story. 

So at my job about three years ago, a new man(30m) started working with me and my then coworker let’s call her Sarah. And him Mike. When Mike starts working he did start flirting with me and ask me on a date. I waited a few months and eventually we did get closer and got physical, not sex but who cares it was not PG, twice. After that I realized he seemed a little off to me. So I in my nicest least ego-shattering way stopped his advances and stopped seeing him.  It’s important to note that in my industry it’s very hard to get into, and I work with my brother who did not get along with Mike. It just felt like bad news. 

During the lets say month that we had been speaking, I noticed he had a strong relationship with Sarah. And Sarah I’d worked with at least a year before him. I had asked him whether or not he was dating Sarah. I honestly didn’t care if he was seeing other people, but someone in the same department would be absolutely off limits. He assured me that he wasn’t and that he saw her as family. After ending things he would still ask me out and flirt with me in front of the entire office. I again to keep him from acting out, would try to turn him down nicely and ask that he not do that with other coworkers around. This would happen in front of Sarah too. 

Me, Sarah, and Mike continue to work together for two more years. Then when my brother, who doesn’t get along with Mike, gets a job that Mike applied for, Mike quits. That wasn’t surprising. At this time majority of people in and out of our department didn’t like him and had called HR on him. So while I wouldn’t tell any other coworkers in general that I had been seeing him, I definitely didn’t want to when he is literally the loser of the office. I thought it would make the great relationships and connections I built look at me differently. Especially my judgement. But what was surprising is that Sarah quits that day as well. No notice or anything. And she has been building relationships with people for years too. I can not emphasize enough how difficult it is to get into this field and she quit on moments notice when he did. That’s when it became clear to me that they must not just be dating but in a serious relationship. 

I have no idea when they started dating and for how long. My stint with Mike was about a month of actual talking and physicality. I wasn’t sure if that was something I should tell her but decided against it. Because for one she had already quit, and two I wanted to keep my job safe. It felt like she was in that relationship very deeply. And of course I could tell it was toxic. She had no reason to quit her job and he would flirt with me in front of the entire office and her up until he left. HR was called on him on my behalf and I have no idea who did it. 

It’s been about 5 months since Sarah quit. I get a call literally right now at 1AM from her and I answer because I jumped out of bed and wasn’t even thinking. Morning calls like that make me jittery. She is yelling and saying “Did you sleep with my boyfriend. FRIEND” And while I didn’t, we did everything but that and in the moment I don’t think she’d care. I ask her what’s going on and she says that Mike is next to her and that he gave her Earth shattering news and the phone is on speaker. Mike is silent the entire 5 minutes of the conversation. I tell her that while I won’t go into physical specifics that we did have a fling years prior. I ask her how long have they been in a relationship and she tells me years. At this time she’s being extremely rude to me but I understand. I tell her that not only during our fling but throughout the years afterward, Mike would tell me that he was not dating Sarah and that I had no idea until she quit. At some point she said “Mike isn’t talking, he’s just going to take this out on me later.” I ask her if she needs a ride or help at all and she says “So now you want to help me?” She eventually hangs up the phone. I don’t feel comfortable saying anything else and with my silence the call ends. 

So now there’s two big things on my mind. One is that I hope she’s okay. I want to reach out and give her a more in depth conversation but I don’t think that’s best. But at the same time, I want to see how she’s planning on moving forward. I’m afraid that she’s going to be upset with me and send like a ten page email to our coworkers about how I’m a slut who slept with her boyfriend. Honestly I just wish he wasn’t such a loserrr. It’s just embarrassing to say that he was ever even with me. Then I’d have no worries. I know I didn’t do anything wrong, except maybe not telling her once she quit. Or asking before that point since I had my suspicions? But it was the first time I dated someone I worked with and immediately regretted it and just wanted to move on like it never happened. Which I will still be doing regardless! Deny deny deny if it comes to it. 

But is there any advice someone can give on the situation? Any next steps to not ruin the work I’ve done to get to where I’m at. I’ve been promoted twice since I first met Mike and don’t want someone like that to ruin two women’s careers.

I’ve been in a product management role in the BFSI space for ~2 years now. While it’s been a great learning experience, I’ve realized my real interest lies in brand building and marketing—something more consumer-focused and creative.

I’ve started upskilling (courses, reaching out to folks in the space), but honestly feeling a bit lost on how to realistically make the switch—especially since most brand roles seem to want FMCG or core marketing experience.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar pivot or has advice:
-How realistic is the transition from PM (in BFSI) to brand management?
- What kind of upskilling or portfolio work would actually move the needle?
- What actually helps in getting noticed by brand teams?

I was always passionate about beauty and wanted to turn what I loved into a career which unfortunately didn’t work out too well for me. I spent 6 months working for a huge laser hair removal chain and burnt out because of the long hours and repetitive nature of laser hair removal, finding it wasn’t challenging enough. I then ended up in a customer support/admin role for a skin needling company which I loved, but ultimately wanted to be doing hands on treatments. Someone I knew in the industry reached out after 6 months of me being in that role offering me the perfect job as a dermal therapist to which I said yes, and then unfortunately within a month she let me go as I wasn’t really confident enough/the right fit for her. I’m now working as pretty much a cleaner for an aged care company which I absolutely hate and have been applying for jobs relentlessly for the past 3 months. I don’t really know what I’m looking to do long term but I seem to do well in admin based customer service roles. I’m having zero luck searching for new jobs even applying to just basic administrative jobs, I’ve probably only had 2 interviews out of the 150+ jobs I’ve applied to. Any advice on what I could get into?",goldenlouis26,1,1.0,0,1750139794,2025-06-17 05:56:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldfjyi/23_and_no_idea_what_im_doing_seeking_suggestions/,6,2025
1ldfilz,"Struggling salesman trying to make a career switch, but employers only want me to do sales.","As the title says. 24M worked 3 different sales related jobs since graduating college, never stayed with any of them more than a year. Worked 50/60 hours a week at my most recent job. I was really good at prospecting and could uncover a lot of deals but had a really poor close rate. I don’t enjoy this sort of work and I’ve been wanting to make a change.

I’ve been looking around at companies big and small throughout my area and any callbacks I get for applications I submit are just redirecting me to their open sales positions or minimum wage customer service jobs.

I feel like I’m at a real loss for where to go next. A lot of connections I have from college are already really established in their careers of choice and even getting promotions and I feel like I’m falling behind. I’ve considered law school but after working like a dog during college I really don’t have the energy to go back.

I’m really not sure where I can put my skill set. I like working with people and I don’t want to sit in a cubicle and look at spreadsheets all day. I’ve had an interest in marketing and have done about 3 years worth of internships and project work related to marketing in college but that keeps getting brushed off when I try to make relevance of it in interviews.

  i think having mental illness was the biggest factor that contributed to my failure besides i get tired very easily.

whenever i learn something i get bored an try to find alternative i was learning accounting then i stopped and started to learn something new i went into this vicious cycle and have not accomplished anything.

- I like systems and processes, but I’m not into spreadsheets all day.  
- I like talking to people, but I’m not super outgoing either.

I’ve been doing interview prep with GPT interview coach and Beyz interview assistant. The 90-second prep in Beyz has actually helped me think more clearly: Not just about how to explain myself in interviews, but *what kind of problems I want to solve*. 

It’s made me realize that “career direction” isn’t always about one skill, maybe it’s about figuring out where you want to grow.

1ldecgx,30 is coming fast: Should I trade health for a title?,"I’m 29, single, and currently in a marketing role at a fmcg company. The culture is decent, and the work-life balance is manageable, but there’s little room for growth. My manager has told me directly that I’m not being considered for promotion due to perceived “gaps in fundamentals.”

For context, my previous role lasted just about a year due to a mismatch. I’ve been in my current role for a little over a year now, trying to stabilize my CV and rebuild career momentum.

Recently, I received an offer from another major company with 25–30% higher pay, broader scope, and a stronger title. But it comes with a known toxic culture — long hours, difficult leadership, and very little work-life balance. I’ve worked in a similar environment before, and it seriously impacted my mental health.

Long-term, I want to pivot into a more meaningful industry — ideally healthcare, pharma, or beauty — by around 2026. If I stay where I am, I plan to upskill on weekends and gradually build my portfolio to make that shift.

The dilemma:

Do I take the higher-paying job and endure 1–2 years of a toxic setup for short-term gains?
Or do I stay in a slower-moving role that protects my health and gives me space to build for a better long-term move?

Being single, I do feel pressure that these are my “prime years” — both for career and life — and I don’t want to waste them by playing it too safe. But I also don’t want to burn out just to chase a title.

Would love to hear from others who’ve faced similar trade-offs — especially if you’ve pivoted industries or had a non-linear career path.",Usual-Chart-1916,1,1.0,2,1750135353,2025-06-17 04:42:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldecgx/30_is_coming_fast_should_i_trade_health_for_a/,6,2025

1ldbq1l,Awful career and financial decisions,"Hey everyone,

Just needed to get this off my chest because it’s been eating at me lately.

I’m 22M. Up until a few months ago, I was working as a baggage handler at the airport. The money was actually really good — way more than most people my age were earning. But to be honest, I wasn’t enjoying the job. I kept thinking I wanted to do something I actually cared about, something that felt more “me.”

So I quit, did a course to try and move into something I thought I’d enjoy more… but after the course ended, I couldn’t find a job for nearly 3 months. Those 3 months were rough — just sitting at home, applying for things and getting nowhere. My savings took a hit and so did my mental health.

I eventually landed a job at a gym, which is something I like in theory — I’m into fitness and thought it would be a great fit. But the pay is crap compared to what I was making before. I still have about £18k in my account, but I can’t stop thinking about how much more I could’ve had if I’d stayed at the airport. With the cost of living being what it is right now, I feel like I made a huge mistake.

I’m angry with myself. I feel like I threw away financial stability for nothing. It’s really starting to mess with my head — the regret, the frustration, the fear about the future. I feel like I made the wrong move and now I’m stuck, and I don’t know how to stop spiraling about it.

Just needed to vent. Thanks for reading if you made it this ",Dry_Let4803,4,0.8399999737739563,3,1750127006,2025-06-17 02:23:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ldbq1l/awful_career_and_financial_decisions/,6,2025

I just defended my MSc in an environmental field, and am trying to figure out my next move. I would love to do research, but environmental research is really not in demand right now in my country, and jobs that do exist are as underpaid as ever. As such, I'm considering what adjacent career paths I might look into. I'm looking for career suggestions for someone who:

\- Loves writing and is supposedly very good at it (ex. research proposals, manuscripts, reports, presentations)

\- Really enjoys coding, particularly coding for GIS (wrangling/integration and analysis, not anything advanced like package development)

\- Gets bored and checks out when work gets slow or doesn't require continuous challenge

\- Loves troubleshooting and problem-solving

\- Likes to interact with different project stakeholders and work in a team. I found my MSc draining because I didn't interact with research partners other than my advisors, and so felt totally isolated :D

\- Is interested in ecology, environment, public health, geography, and a little bit by software development

\- Is introverted, but still enjoys being social

\- Ideally would like to make a living wage, and also do something somewhat positive for the world

1lda24b,How do I lead finance at a startup as a 21-year-old with no real experience & what career advice would you give me?,"Hi everyone, so to give a little context on the title—I'm currently 21, recently graduated from college this past December, and have been leading finance at a bootstrapped startup that's making \~300k in MRR. During college, I interned in investment banking and unfortunately did not get a return offer (due to headcount issues); otherwise, I probably would've started my career there. Therefore, since I had been working at this startup throughout the school year, I decided to join FT as that was really the only option left on the table for me.

This company is practically unknown, and the work I've been doing has been pretty interesting but also very unstructured. So far, my main responsibilities include monthly billing/invoicing (a pretty nuanced and time-consuming process), reconciling bank statements, data analytics work to optimize certain business segments, and pretty much any ad hoc project under the sun that our C-suite comes up with.

With this in mind, I want to know how I can make the most of my time at this company. What initiatives should I be working towards? Are there any finance must-dos/must-haves that we should implement? I honestly don't know where to start my line of questioning because I have so little industry experience and therefore have no clue what we're missing. Please feel free to ask about the nature of my role and our business, as I'm sure that context would be helpful for you guys.

Lastly, I just want to know what I should be gearing towards career-wise. Is it worth it to ride it out at this startup in the hopes that we continue to scale steadily? Our CEO/founder has mentioned that he does not want to grow the company past \~35 people, take any funding, or sell the company, as that will corporatize the environment. However, he also mentioned that he wants to make sure all of our current employees are compensated well enough to buy a house in our HCOL area at a reasonable age. I know we have some kind of advantage in our niche as we recently received interest to be bought out by a $500MM ARR company. If it does seem more beneficial for me to jump ship to a well-established company, what skills/experiences should I be looking to gain to best position myself for that? I'd most likely be interested in strategic finance or FP&A roles.

I know this has been a long post, but thank you to those who read this far. Any advice is appreciated, and please feel free to ask any questions that might fill in the holes I've missed.

I received an offer from one company last Friday after a week or so of waiting post-final interview. I had another final round interview on June 5th - I received an email from the recruiter I've been working with stating essentially that, ""The team really enjoyed meeting with you and expects to have an update by the end of the week once key members return to office."" 

With that last message, I was expecting to hear a response back on Friday of last week, but now that it's EOD Monday and I still haven't heard anything, I'm thinking of checking back in. For the first offer, I have until Wednesday to accept, so my questions are this: 

1. Should I accept the offer for Job 1 and not follow up with Job 2 (since I have to believe that if they were going to make an offer, they would've reached out by now since they said they would)?

2. Should I follow up with Job 2 at all? (Job 2 is a company I would love to work with in the future so I want to keep the connection warm and end on a positive note).

1ld9rj6,Just lost my first job to AI and feel like I’m spiraling,"Just like the title says. I won’t go into details, but I’m 23F, this was my first job out of college. It’s what my degree is in, it’s pretty much all I’m explicitly qualified for, and I got the notice on Friday that I was being let go because they were going to use generative AI to do my job instead. It can do roughly what they want, and it can do it faster. I wasn’t the only one let go, but I’d only been at this job for about ~8 months. I’m not really sure what to do. My family has been trying to be sympathetic, but I really don’t think they understand. I had a bit of a breakdown last night because like l said, this is all I’m qualified for. It’s what I’d planned to do a career in. 

I’m young, I know it shouldn’t be hard to pivot and go into another field, technically I took some supplemental courses in school that would aid in that, but it all feels so pointless. 4 years of college, all that debt and so many sleepless nights, months of job hunting and applying, all to get laid off from a job in a field that’s rapidly shrinking, and the shrinkage only started roughly when I graduated. Everyone keeps telling me to relax and just keep applying elsewhere, but I just keep feeling like a failure. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know where to start. The field I was in isn’t one I even loved, it was just one I could tolerate, and I genuinely don’t think I’m passionate about anything that can pay me. I just keep thinking “This is supposed to be 40 hours of my life, every week, for the rest of my life, so how can I do something I don’t like?” and I just feel paralyzed.

I’ve always been anxious and an overthinker, but this is another level. I’ve felt numb all day, and I hate feeling like this. I want to succeed and I know I can, I just don’t know where to start.

1ld96ub,Looking for advice on the future,"Hi, this is going to be a decently long post, so apologies in advance.

I am 25 years old. I went to college for Digital Media Arts and am currently a news producer, but always wanted to be in the games industry. I never really wanted to be a news producer, but I am sticking with it because I knew it would be a good experience, and I have been working here for two years. I have tried to get into making games with tutorials, but haven't stuck with it because this job has massive burnout, and I have very little free time.

This weekend, I have had some personal life changes, and I decided to spend a lot of my time focusing on getting into the industry and doing something I am passionate about. I decided to make a schedule and commit to spending the majority of my free time making a portfolio, doing game jams, and learning coding.

Here’s the plan:

* Specialize in game design by making small-polished games with a clear mechanic.
* Do game jams 1-2x a month and network as much as
* I was thinking Unreal because most professionals use it, but people also suggest Godot.
* Have a social media presence and a portfolio website with a blog that I can use to showcase my journey and work.
* Do Harvard’s CS50 Course on computer science, but continue to have my focus be on game design.
* Going to look for jobs that use my experience (community manager, social media coord, QA tester, associate producer, or marketing assistant) in parallel to design jobs.
* Going to remain at my current job (maybe find a higher-paying one) until I get a new job in the industry.

I have done several work packages on game design, AI, and esports that I can use. I have also written hundreds of web articles and social media posts.

I was told by some people that getting into software testing/engineering and doing game design on the side is the way to go. I also was told to get some certificates for like SCUM and apply for a Game Producer.  I also think that with my experience as a news producer, I can get a job in marketing or content creation, maybe as a good foot in the door.

I know the game industry is really tough to get into right now, especially in my position. I realize that I am going to be on this journey for a while before I get a job, but I am excited to try. As far as I can tell, the biggest tip I've seen is simply to make games. I will keep you all updated with my progress!

Lots of comments under his breath about my body, how a child who passed out on my lap was ""in heaven"", how he hates that he even has to consider thinking about if a young girl has underwear or shorts on or not on the playground bc he is a man, that he's automatically seen as creepy bc most child SA are men, that he fails NNN, etc.

All of this just made me feel uneasy, while all in joking non-direct format, to adults and not children, felt weird. He's very socially challenged and others have complained about him before. I didn't want to say anything before today as I was afraid to be in the same room as he is passive aggressive and I don't know how unstable, and idk if he would make the rest of my time there more difficult. He also mentions frequently his pew pew in his car, so.

Basically, before I left I quickly sat down with the principal of the school clinic. I didnt phrase it correctly as I wanted to mention that moreso than the innapropriate innuendos towards me, im more concerned about that language/mindset being used around children. He was very annoyed the whole time asking why I didnt say anything earlier, that now he has to open an investigation and I have to write something. I was taken back by his tone and didnt write anything down or specific examples as I was scared the second they read an example to this man, he would know it was me who reported him and as he seems very unstable, I just wanted to be safe. Although now I feel like that was a waste and didnt really do anything, he seemed annoyed and even had to audacity to ask if I was returning next year, to which I said no.

AIO that this complaint was all for nothing? Will this do any good and AIO feeling so uneasy about reporting him? Should I send an email to a higher direction or leave it alone? Other providers told me it was the right thing to do, Ive never done this before so its all new to me.",Livid-Restaurant-608,0,0.5,1,1750119076,2025-06-17 00:11:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld91lw/reported_coworker_with_nothing_in_writing/,6,2025

1ld8iyj,Job Interview advice,"Hi, 
I’m a recent college graduate with a BS in chemistry. I applied to a position for a medical technologist role at a hospital on 5/19. The role lists those with a medical technology degree as preferred, however those with a degree in physical sciences are eligible. I ended up getting an interview at the hospital, and I thought it went well. During it the panel seemed to like my answers and also said that roughly half of their employees are “non-traditional” and have physical science degrees. They said I should hopefully hear back after a week or two. Two weeks comes around and nothing so I email the hiring manager. They reply that they were just wrapping up interviews, and she would reach out to the team for an update and lmk when he heard back. It has been a week since I received that email saying they would check with the team and lmk. Should I email again? I don’t want to come off as entitled or desperate but this is my #1 prospective job and it has now been almost a month since applying, and will be 3 weeks since my interview.

1ld8csr,Looking for interesting career transitions!,"I have been running a small consulting business for about 10 years but it's time to move on. I no longer want to be the only one in charge and I am looking for something less stressful but still fulfilling. 

I have lots of experience in HR consulting, writing, public speaking, academic research, educational design, facilitation, social media, content design and all the things that come with being a CEO of a successful small business (20-30 employees). I have a BA in history and a diploma in Journalism. I'd rather not go back to school at this point but maybe in future.

Things I dislike about my current career (a lot of these are due to late diagnosed autism and feeling very burnt out): too many meetings, sales and marketing, having a highly public profile/being the face of the company. 

I'm pretty nerdy and I love history and genealogy. I would love to do something that allows me to research, read, write, educate AND/OR something that allows me to get out of my peraonal brain (current career is very emotionally taxing) and switch off at the end of the day.

1ld8618,"22 y/o, 1 year post-grad. Still failing to get a job in my related field and it’s really getting to me. Parents are getting fed up, I feel like a failure. Where to go next?","Hello all. Gonna try to make this quick.


Like title states, I’m 1 year post-grad. I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in kinesiology in May of 2024. I originally planned on becoming a physical therapist but after interning for a while, I decided that wasn’t for me. After researching for some time and interning, I finally decided on working my way to becoming an anesthesiologist assistant. I took some pre-reqs I needed, got my phlebotomy certification to get healthcare hours in February. But I’m losing hope once again.

I am still working a job at a hotel I got last year. I’ve been looking for a phlebotomy job since February when I got certified. I have been looking for months. I’ve applied to other positions—sterile processing (uncertified), anesthesia tech, physical therapy tech. Even got interviewed but never selected, even in interviews I thought I did good in. 

I feel like a failure. I see other kids my age already in nursing or their respective fields. Then there’s me. In debt. Still no good job. With aspirations of traveling and living my life. But i can’t if i don’t make career strides. My parents keeps looking down on me like some failure. Like I’m not trying to fix my resume and apply for jobs everyday and it’s very upsetting, demoralizing, and just downright depressing. Which leads me to my next point—

To become an Anesthesiologist assistant, I’d have to take 4-5 more prereqs, find some health care experience to get hours. Get shadowing hours, take the MCAT or GRE, go to an interview, amongst other small factors—and even if I got in (as it’s very selective), I wouldn’t be able to start until 2027, and i wouldn’t graduate until 2029, which seems rather extreme and late for me. Too late to get the ball going on my life, which sounds ridiculous, I know. But im getting impatient at this point. 

I’ve looked into other options—such as becoming an ultrasound tech. Salary is drastically lower, but still well off. I’d be able to start school next year and even skip a semester (if i were to get in as these programs are selective as well), however, it’s still my 2nd option to anesthesia. If i cant find a healthcare job, I feel like ultrasound is the only way I can go. I’d want to get my feet wet and work for about 2 years before moving to become a travel ultrasound tech, which pays higher and involves travel, which I enjoy. 


However, I’m not sure what to do as I’d have to sign up for fall classes now to continue my anesthesia path. I don’t know if I want to risk paying for 4/5 more classes when I may not even get into my desired program when I apply next year, which would push me back even further and continue to discourage me. Not to mention, my classes may expire (some programs require classes on their prerequisite list to be taken within a certain time frame. If I keep waiting too long, they may expire). I can’t take that expensive of a gamble with the way the economy currently is alongside my current debt. Not to mention my parents wanting me to “get a move on” career wise, not understanding a bachelors degree is not enough in today’s world compared to when they grew up.  

So—my final question is, what should i do with my current dilemma? ",parameparaplease,1,1.0,7,1750116662,2025-06-16 23:31:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld8618/22_yo_1_year_postgrad_still_failing_to_get_a_job/,6,2025

1ld7ok1,Career Decision - Take the counter offer or not?,"I have worked for a company for just over 4 years. Within that time, I’ve been promoted twice. However, It’s been 2 years since my last promotion/pay increase.

I have consistently outperformed and can handle work above my level. My managers advocated for me each cycle but have been denied by higher-ups for reasons like “slow business” or “still needs more time in that role to move up.” I was disappointed, but I stuck around because I like the work and my team.

Fast forward to now, after an acquisition and rounds of layoffs, my team has been cut in half with me taking on 50% more work with the same pay. New company changed a lot of old culture I loved, mostly for the worst lol. Though there is glimmers of our old company starting to emerge.

Meanwhile, the new promotion cycles are grindingly slow and found out I couldn’t be entered into the q1 round for “business” and to wait til the fall. New policy also says merit based increases can’t be no more than 4%. 

I decided to look and got an offer letter with a 25% bump. I presented it to my boss, and they came back with a match and a title bump. My boss assures me this means they are serious about keeping me and that it was long over do. My boss said it will not be held against me if I accepted and said they themselves took a counter offer themselves & have been fine. 

Now I feel torn. I didn’t expect them to match. Should I take the counter offer? Or is it better to take a chance with a devil I don’t know (that was eager to hire me and pay me highest of the range I gave). Is it naive to believe their intentions here?

1ld78u6,I need a boost of positivity,"
I’m currently working under a leader who consistently displays patterns of disorganization, poor communication, and erratic decision-making. Meetings are often canceled or rescheduled with little notice, priorities shift constantly, and accountability is routinely deflected. They exude executive dysfunction daily. Much of the workload is assigned with vague direction, yet the same leader takes full credit with senior leadership, creating confusion and resentment across the team.

Then, a personal connection was brought into a leadership role from a former company, despite an active non-compete that delayed hiring by six months. We desperately needed help yet we chose this person and were forced to wait for them. Since joining, this person has struggled to adapt, and instead of alleviating pressure, has added to the dysfunction. It also adds to my frustration!! Of all people to wait six months for, you choose the person who is struggling to adapt! 😩

Team morale is low. Several of us share similar concerns but are hesitant to raise them due to fear of retaliation. We actually haven’t talked about it directly; but the indirect comments have made it clear we all feel similarly. The culture rewards chaos over clarity, connections over competence. I’ve been quietly documenting the ongoing issues, but it’s taking a toll.

I’ve tried everything: networking, working with a coach, tailoring my resume, applying strategically… but I haven’t landed a single interview. I’m burnt out, and it’s crushing my spirit. I’m coming to terms with the fact that this company’s culture doesn’t align with my values… but with this job market, I feel completely stuck. I’ve applied with no interviews for almost a year now.

I can’t tell if I’m just reacting to bad management or if this is the right move. Would love insight from anyone who’s made a similar leap/ any input. I know the state of the world is insane right now and financially this would set me back, but nurses make way more than what I am right now so I know I can pay back my loans eventually.

Yesterday she planned lunch with the rest of the team and didn’t invite me. The other two seemed kind of sheepish and guilty about it when they came back and asked if I’d gotten anything to eat. They said I should come along next time, and I said “I’m sorry I didn’t realize you all were going out, I would have come if I’d known.” I’m making my interest clear I like spending time with them. 

She’s the type of person to latch onto others and try to form a bestie kind of relationship to the point where it feels cliquey. She tends to monopolize that person’s time and attention so I find it hard to get to know them. I wish she had any interest in talking to me, but I constantly get the cold shoulder. I went out of my way to talk to her and make her feel included when she was new, but her friendliness didn’t really last beyond a few weeks.

I'm from Illinois and the best offer l've gotten is a school in Southern California where it is $6,000 a year (tuition, food, dorm all included). It will take me 3 more years to graduate so I would take my federal loans and be in total debt of $13,500 while paying 4.5k out of pocket. I would graduate with a Mathematics degree and go into secondary instruction most likely in California.

My other option is to stay in the Chicago area in my parent's house and accept a job offer I just got for $50,000 a year plus commission. Although this route would be the more ""boring"" route l'd be able to save up big time for a few years while working the job, hopefully enough to get a car + a down payment on some property.

I already have about $12,000 in savings. Which route do you think is better? I have a lot of reservations with college now due to the rise of Al and the fact that I could start making some decent money right now.

1ld6axh,Walking On Thin Ice,"About a year ago, I took on a leadership position with an Asia-based airline, managing the contract between the airline and its ground handler. My role involves overseeing all the administrative tasks and ensuring operational performance standards are met.

Before this, I held several management and leadership roles across different parts of the aviation industry, mostly with Western companies, and by all accounts, I excelled in them.

However, this current role has been very different. Despite putting in a lot of effort, I’ve recently been told that I’m not meeting expectations. There are a few reasons I think this might be happening.

I was brought in to lead a team of over 50 people, but I’ve struggled to get full buy-in or build strong cohesion with the team.

My management style, which worked well in previous Western environments, hasn’t translated well here. The work culture is completely different, more hierarchical and nuanced in ways I didn’t fully anticipate.

I’ve genuinely tried to adapt, changing my approach multiple times, adjusting communication styles, and putting in long hours, often unpaid overtime, to keep the operation running smoothly. But nothing seems to stick.

The airline, my client, has started putting my performance under a microscope, which only adds pressure and makes it harder to perform. A lot of the feedback I receive feels surface-level and doesn’t always reflect the full scope of what I contribute.

Most recently, management has placed me on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP). While I understand the intent behind it, many of the expectations laid out in the plan feel unrealistic or one-sided. It seems more like a box-checking exercise rather than a genuine effort to support my development.

Now, I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, and my day-to-day experience at the office has become extremely awkward and stressful.

I’d really appreciate any advice, especially from others who’ve worked in cross-cultural environments or had a tough transition into a new work culture. How did you get through it? What worked?

So, I'm going to take a four-month Clinical Medical Assistant course in the fall so that I can get out of my food service job and work something reliable and (hopefully) with benefits.

Then after that, if I'm still interested, I will continue my education with EMS and become a Paramedic.

I was thinking of skipping the CMA course and going straight to EMS, but my food service job is really killing me and I'm itching to get out of it as soon as possible. I figured the CMA course would also be a good introduction into the medical field.

1ld511f,Any advice on how to deal with a toxic manager?,"I’m three years into my HR career and was promoted to a supervisor role around nine months ago at a leading luxury hotel brand. I was later transferred to one of our flagship properties because the Director of HR — my manager’s manager — saw strong potential in me. He even created a Talent Acquisition Manager-in-Training (TA MIT) program scheduled for September or October — designed specifically for me which now I'm not even sure if it's going to happen.

My manager, however, is known across the hotel for being extremely difficult to work with. She’s toxic, offers zero recognition (rarely does really, a thank you from her is like an annual party), and often reacts with blame & critique disguised as coaching & honesty. Before I joined, she had already driven out the person I replaced—he’s now thriving in another department. It's worth noting that she wanted me to come  in the first place to clean the previous person's ""mess"", and she actively called my dad (not myself, still to this day dunno why) but she wanted me to come as a coordinator/entry level which I had been doing anyway for one year & a half. My director who's her manager was the one who got me on a promotion to Supervisor. She also received an “approached expectations” rating during her probation and was removed from our Top Talent pipeline before me & my director came. P.S me, my manager & the director all used to work with each other at one property but my manager transferred first, then my director joined & also brought me. 

Since then, I’ve been delivering results—filling roles quickly, improving the Talent Acquisition function, and gaining praise inside & outside my department. Leaders from other teams regularly mention my name in meetings for effectiveness and impact. Yet inside my own department (specifically only my manager really, the rest of HR all rate me highly), my work feels invisible.

A week ago, she said I’d lead operations during her leave. I was excited because I saw it as an opportunity to grow especially as I was going to handle key positions which is something above my level. But three days later, she reversed course without notice or feedback, citing that my job postings/job ads were inconsistent. It felt a bit like a punishment, especially since she had told me a few days before that I’d handle all key positions, but then when she gave the handover she said I’d merely continue with current tasks.

I messaged her on whatsapp respectfully, saying I respected the decision but was disappointed. I admitted the posting issues and shared that I’m already working on them. I also expressed that my broader contributions feel overlooked and undervalued, which has been demotivating.

She replied respectfully but emotionally distant.

To be fair, I have room to grow—especially in employer branding, which I’m actively working on. But it feels like one area of inconsistency is outweighing all my other achievements and efforts. It’s making me question whether the TA MIT program is still happening or if I’m being subtly sidelined. Also, what's really worrying me is the change of decisions in an instant, it feels like I can't trust her word at all which is causing me a lot of anxiety at the moment.

1ld50x4,I have two options out of my job - what do I do?,"So, I have been with my current job for 8 months now. I was with this organization prior and after a compelling offer I decided to return; however, my short time back has proven this place has not changed (surprise!). Currently, I am a Director and in graduate school part time. We are under capacity to do the work, I am contacted by my boss on evenings/weekends, and do a ton of high-stress work in a toxic work environment. I need a change.

Now, I have two possible opportunities for my next move, but I am hoping for some advice. Here are the options: 

1. An entry level career with likely start date as soon as possible. I would take a bit of a pay cut, my job would have limited responsibility, shift work, but an opportunity to eventually move up the chain if I wish. 
- Pro: work will stay at work, shift work means random week days off for appointments, manageable pay cut, more time to focus on school and my young family, and benefits 
- Con: the job doesn’t apply to my prior education or experience, shift work means weekends/night shifts, and isn’t very “meaningful work”

2. Multi-year contract work, start date TBD dependent on proposal response however, it is forecasted for an October start.
- Pro: pay raise, work applies to my prior education/experience, would be a good resume builder, 4 day work week, work from home, my supervisor is a known colleague, I have the opportunity to help write the proposal and make my own position 
- Con: position doesn’t exist yet, no benefits, contract work, start date is undetermined, work load is underdetermined

Now, I am a bit conflicted because if I pass up option 1 then I don’t know how long I’ll need to wait for another opportunity if option 2 doesn’t work out. However, I am also reminded of the saying that “good things come to those who wait” and am also trying not to make an impulsive decision to choose number 1 just because I am pissed off about where I currently work and need to “get out now”.

I was leaning toward option 2, but this week’s family events have made option 1 sound more appealing since I could choose to shift my focus on family and prioritize them over my career. My spouse has been very sweet and will support whichever I choose.

I am looking for some additional perspectives or advice, please. ",fr0gprincess_,1,1.0,2,1750108654,2025-06-16 21:17:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld50x4/i_have_two_options_out_of_my_job_what_do_i_do/,6,2025
1ld4s0t,I don’t know what to pursue in life,"Right now, I'm just a high school student. Thing is, I have to tailor my courses and education to what I want to do in life. I know a lot about what I dont want to do, but have no idea what I want to do. For example, I don't want to do medicine (blood and being responsible for someone's life isn't smth I want to deal with) computer related stuff (just not interested to be honest) law (I don't want to be responsible for putting someone in jail and having people hate me and out for my blood) and labor work (pay isn't that high and the family disappointment would be way too much). I've thought about finance, but according to other people it involves a lot of problem solving and what not, which just frustrates me a lot. I'm a person that can really do anything as long as I try hard enough, get pretty good grades, likes numbers but not the problem solving aspect. I prefer when there's set instructions, but I don't leading a team and helping people. I'm good with public speaking too. My only real requirements are I need to be good at the job and at least interested enough to be able to do my job without hating my life, still be a good job in the next coming decades, and have a good pay.

1ld3iqi,Alternative role for an engineer?,"Hi, 
Sorry for possibly long post.

I'm UK based. 32M.

I'm currently a design engineer in the field of my username, I have been for a few years now and I think now I hate it. I've fallen out of love, or have I?

In the beginning I was really into it, it felt interesting and engaging in the right ways and I was involved in some relatively high profile projects, keeping them out of a hole with some laser focus and attention to detail, and I made a name for myself in my department. I was on track for good things. Until I left the company due to layers of different reasons, but all my reasons, left on good terms.

I was mainly getting wound up by ""the process"". It felt like I'm doing admin half the time instead of actual designs, and if anyone here works in project delivery, you might know what I mean. All of the admin and reporting PMO rubbish. Plus I was always anxious about being measured on how long things take me vs how much is in the budget, I was always going over in the ""doing"" tasks, but often excelled at the checking and reviewing of other people's work, pointing out their problems, and solving them, getting actual results. This always was fulfilling and it felt good to be a bit more ""hands on"" in the role. I've always loved that kind of working, no measuring, no tracking of time booking, just get shit done within your constraints that you need to work to.

I was at my next job for almost a year, they got rid of me due to not meeting expectations. At that point I was in two minds about Design, full of tedious nonsense most of the time as above, but I didn't know what to go for in another role, as it would just feel like the same old thing if I'm a designer elsewhere.

A few months unemployment, I didn't really know what I wanted, then found another similar role which seemed a good fit, I would have taken anything at that point I guess. 

Over a year in and I'm at that point again. Fed up with the nonsense admin. I don't feel fulfilled, I don't get to see the fruit of my labour, the design work I'm doing is fairly tedious not engaging or interesting, and the company is run on ""we'll work it out"" meaning everyone is always trying to figure out a process or procedure, as it isn't standard anywhere in the company in different projects.

I don't know what other roles to look into, and to be honest the pay is good so I don't want to throw it away if I can help it.

Any ideas?",TelecomsApprentice,1,1.0,0,1750105142,2025-06-16 20:19:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld3iqi/alternative_role_for_an_engineer/,6,2025

1ld2s10,"Doing full cycle sales for 2 years, but was told I am still 'entry level'","I'm in a full-time sales role at a marketing and branding agency. I've been here about 2 years, and despite being hired as an ""Account Manager"", I've been expected to cold call all day, source my own leads, create my own presentations, and close deals solo. I am given maybe 5 shitty leads a month, all the rest is outbound.

Recently pushed for a change to my comp structure, and my sales manager told me that I am still considered ""entry level"", while our top-performing rep(been with company for 20 years and is the only other sales guy in my territory) and I do the exact same job. He also previously had SDRs calling for him, so never sourced his own deals, and doesn't do the same amount of heavy lifting. I've opened multiple high-value accounts including big names, I have continually exceeded my quota, and bring in new business, but I'm told that I can't be paid more because I'm ""entry-level"".

I literally build my own prospecting list, and cadences, I go from the first cold call all the way to the close, the only support I have is a 'product specialist' to build presentations. But she is overseas, takes forever, and her presentations usually fall flat, so I just started building them myself.

This is in Vancouver, Canada, and I have two kids. Base is $60K and 10% commission on Gross Profit (did about $100k Gross Profit over the last 12 calendar months) . I have no marketing support, no additional sales training, no SDR, no nothing. I am the only sales rep in the office making cold calls, and I sit in the office 5 days a week and have to make minimum 200 calls, and 2 conversations. I also have a monthly Gross Profit target.

1ld2jsh,Canadian Banking Jobs,"I am currently in my mid twenties and have been working at a bank for roughly 5 years, started as a teller and worked my way up to a financial advisor. I have an accounting and finance degree as well. I feel stuck and burnt out.  I have mentally checked out of my current job and barely make it through the days. I dread every Monday and look forward to every Friday. It seems like to get any farther in this branch you have to kiss up to upper management. Recently there was a promotion that myself and a few other colleagues thought was bizarre and that there was much more qualified people to put in there instead. I am sick of feeling like a salesman and want to actually help people. The banks don’t award you for helping people ever only by how many extra’s you can give to the clients. On top of all of this my new manager and I don’t get along super well, if you try to explain yourself to them they just think you are making excuses. The banks is also dialling in on their compliance and is asking you to do everything previous as well as multilple additional small task each time. It’s just not a job I enjoy anymore

I am curious if there is any back office jobs that don’t feel super salesy. I love working in finance and finance as a whole but I hate being salesman as I don’t always believe in the product or solution that we are required to provide for our clients.

I have also considered going into accounting as well. I just feel I am currently at a point where I can’t see myself growing anymore and the only to move up anymore is by who you know and not what you know. 

I guess I am asking what people who also have worked in the banking or accounting industries think I should look at doing.

1ld1m1t,Fired with shady explanations,"Just got fired during my probation period at my new job (6 Months in germany). My boss called me in, said I didn't meet expectations and didn't fit with the team and the company.

My first question was of course to give me details, and he did't give me any: first he said the colleagues did't get along with me (i do get along with them) and second that I don't fit in the company (whatever that means). He didn't mention practical stuff, since i was able to do all tasks way ahead of training schedule. All my colleagues after mentioned that they were never asked in details from my director about any of this (i would rather believe my team members with whom i interact daily, than my director with whom i talked 3 times and wants to fire me based on what he heard from other people)

All of this seems damn sketchy to me. Either i got canned due to my bad german (i have a high level, and never had the impression it was an issue) or the company is cutting costs, and they took the chance to cut a guy in his training (i know for a fact they are having issues financially, i work in sales).

1ld11wp,Feeling stuck – go back to product or stick it out in innovation?,"Tl;dr: Left product to broaden my skillset in a growth/innovation role, hoping it’d help me eventually start my own business. But the lack of support, constant stakeholder wrangling, and emotional drain are burning me out. Wondering if I should stick it out or return to product where I felt more effective and energised.

—————

I moved from a product role into a commercial innovation and growth role because I wanted to broaden my skillset and eventually build something of my own. Long-term, I’d love to run a startup or a small business with solid cashflow — something I can own and shape. I figured stepping out of product and closer to strategy and commercial decision-making would help me get there.

Now I’m not so sure.

The role is ambiguous, but not in a way that energises me. I’m constantly trying to push initiatives forward without the resources or support to do them properly. A lot of the job is stakeholder management and building business cases to win buy-in, which leaves me feeling anxious and depleted. I don’t feel set up to succeed, and by the end of the day I have no capacity left to work on my own ideas — which is the whole reason I made this move in the first place.

Ironically, I’m comfortable with ambiguity when building a product. I like experimenting and iterating. The difference is that in product you usually have a team, a process, and some shared understanding of the goal. In this role, the ambiguity feels political and misaligned. I spend more time navigating org dynamics than actually solving problems.

I also manage a small team. I’ve had success — a few of my reports have become high performers — but people management doesn’t come naturally to me, and it adds another layer of emotional overhead.

I’m starting to wonder if I should go back to product. I miss having a rhythm to the work. I miss building things. But I also wonder if I’d be giving up on the longer-term growth I was aiming for.

Has anyone else navigated this kind of decision? How do you tell the difference between a stretch role worth pushing through and one that’s just the wrong fit?",mountainspring32,1,1.0,0,1750099421,2025-06-16 18:43:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld11wp/feeling_stuck_go_back_to_product_or_stick_it_out/,6,2025

1ld0pmr,"Leaving new role, 4 weeks in","I left a great role at a great company to join a much smaller + earlier stage startup, in a different but adjacent space.

I started said new role 4 weeks ago and honestly just have not enjoyed it at all. The team dynamic just feels a little off, even though they’re all generally really nice/good people. I’m in sales and the quotas that are set are not even close to attainable. While I could have a conversation with the CEO about lowering the goals, I just genuinely think it might be a product issue- as in there isn’t enough demand and also the space is way too crowded with bigger + better funded companies. 

They told me up front that this is a really early stage startup environment, but the lack of organization has been a little surprising. I don’t think they intentionally mislead me in the interview process, but I’m feeling a little bit like I bought into a vision that’s just not the current reality. Long term, I genuinely just don’t see this as a fit for me, or that the company will even succeed + secure much needed funding in the near term. 

I really like my boss, the CEO, who I worked with in the previous role. I’m considering having a convo with him to let him know how I’m feeling and essentially tell him that I’ve decided to leave. 

I don’t have another full time role lined up, although I do have a 3 month consulting contract that I can take (which could very easily turn into full time). This company is much farther along and also sells a product I genuinely love and actually believe in (making my job easier).

I’m gutted thinking about talking to my current boss and really don’t know how to approach it. We have a lot of mutual connections and I’m worried that this will dent my reputation in our network. Any tips or advice here as to what I should or how I should approach this convo?

I’m a broke as fuck 19 y/o high school graduate single female, I’ve just moved out of my abusive father’s place into a pretty shitty but cheap-ish tiny home. When I say tiny I mean literally 400 square feet. It’s $850/month, utilities are around $300. I’m locked into a one year lease at this place and I’m working a shitty job at Wendy’s barely scraping by. I don’t have a car, I walk to my job. The reason why I’m not attending college is because I don’t want to go into massive debt and I don’t have a very good support network to handle that. 

My concern is how the absolute fuck do I get out of this situation? How do I get out of the rat race? I’m slowly saving but I don’t want this to be my life. I guess I’m looking for advice on how I can get my life started at home. Any certifications or courses that are cheap? Hustles?

1ld0dnn,Toxic Workplaces vs. Job Hopping – Looking for Advice,"Hey everyone,

I’d really appreciate some perspective from fellow engineers or professionals who’ve been in similar situations.

Over the past few years, I’ve switched jobs more often than I’d like. I had a solid start with 3.5 years at my first job, but since then, I haven’t been able to find a clean or supportive environment. My last two roles each lasted less than a year, and I’m now at 11 months in my current position.

Unfortunately, my current workplace is also turning out to be toxic. There is poor communication, no respect among team members, and a constant sense of tension. I try to give every job a fair shot, but it’s draining to keep ending up in environments like this.

These decisions were never about chasing titles or money. I just haven’t been able to land in a healthy and respectful work culture. Now I’m concerned that this pattern might reflect poorly on my resume, even though I feel my reasons for leaving have always been valid.

How do you balance protecting your mental health with the risk of being seen as a job hopper?  
Do hiring managers ever take context into account, or is frequent job movement always viewed as a red flag?

Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading.",SciDz,2,1.0,1,1750097887,2025-06-16 18:18:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ld0dnn/toxic_workplaces_vs_job_hopping_looking_for_advice/,6,2025
1lczqie,Potentially quitting my internship after one month.,"Hello everyone,

Hope everyone is doing well. So as the title reveals already, I’ve gotten my internship in a real estate company. Where I got a role of an administrative intern. I graduated last year with a course in BBA. This role didn’t align with my main goals, but did it to gain experience as I never had an opportunity to have an internship before.

Anyways, the manger told me that instead of working in HQ, I’d work in multiple hotels. In which, they will rotate monthly. In the beginning of the internship, I told my manager that I live in the outskirts of the city and I could mainly commute by metro and I even paid for a Carlift service to reach my location at an earliest. Basically this has put me in a lot of financial stress and even my pay is very minimal and a lot of extra payment went through my wallets. Reaching to $100 of dollars weekly and my salary barely covers it. But I tried to manage it within a month and strategically analyzed how to optimally save my expenditure.

Now the main part arises, today my manger told me that he is placing me into another branch. Which is in a middle of nowhere and barely any transport services available in that area. So I kindly sent him a message requesting that if it’s possible on your end, if in the meantime I could relocate to one of the other hotels, which has public transportation available or even my Carlift could reach there. But he said that it’s none of my issues and fix the commute thing yourself, I don’t care about your issues or your costs. Which seemed so negative on his end. I even asked him to provide a transport from the head office, as they have multiple cars that roam around the area and he said it’s not available for you interns not even for full time employees.

This has taken a lot of financial stress on me and it’s completely unsustainable to go there for 6 days straight. Even the salary I got on 1st June. It’s complete finished today and I barely spent that money on my interest or as such, majority went to public transportation and my Carlift. Even the Carlift doesn’t travel to that area, that means my money got wasted in that and during my first day of work, reminded my manager about my commuting issues in advance, to avoid issues in the future. Instead of letting me place in other hotels in the meantime. He’s asking me to just go there without regarding the expenditure there and give me the tasks is seniors with the same pay. Even in the contract, it never stated that I’ll work in hotels but in the head office.

So I need your guys advice, should I just leave the internship due to the lack of understanding of my manager of the situation or I can share this issue with the HR if they could resolve which I doubt it?

Would really appreciate your responses.

Thank you.",Ok_Cartographer5954,1,1.0,0,1750096484,2025-06-16 17:54:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lczqie/potentially_quitting_my_internship_after_one_month/,6,2025
1lczpke,Considering a higher-paying offer but is it a step down? Looking for outside perspective,"Hi everyone,

I'm 42 years old and currently working as an engineering manager in a well-established company. I've been enjoying the role overall, but things have started to shift lately: internal reorganizations, increasing budget pressure, and a general push for more accountability around team resources.

Recently, I received an offer for another manager position with a €20k bump in gross annual salary. The company is well-known nationally, but it's smaller in scale and more locally focused. The scope is structured and stable, but I would be giving up the international dimension I currently have, no more English day-to-day, and no more managing people across countries.

Meanwhile, some of my former colleagues are moving on to much more prestigious international companies. I've tried interviewing for similar roles myself, but I’ve never landed an offer, which naturally makes me question whether I'm aiming too high, or not high enough.

So I'm torn: should I go for the safer, well-paying opportunity even if it’s less “elite,” or keep pushing (and maybe risking) for a more ambitious role?

I'd really appreciate any outside perspective, especially from people who've faced similar crossroads.

1lcz5kx,"Marketing Assistant @ Nonprofit, need wage advice","TLDR at the bottom. Thanks, in advance, for reading all this! 

Background:
F23, graduated in 2023, currently at my dream job for 18 months so far. Working 24 hours a week for the last 17 months at a take-home pay of $15/hour ($1400/month) which is acceptable for my current set-up. I like the freedom of my week and am paying reduced rent with a roommate. I work most closely with our Senior Manager of Design. Fantastic and small team of extremely intelligent, compassionate people who share the same humor and values as me. Leaving is not in the cards. It is an arts non-profit who had a grant impacted by the IMLS cuts, but has not impacted anyone’s roles or pay. My performance review was back in January and went extremely well. I am about to explain why I feel slightly exploited from the last month of work.


Senior Manager of Design was out for a month on medical leave right before our most important event of the year. I was bumped up to 40 hours/week and I shared all duties and responsibilities of coworker with our Deputy Director and a freelance designer, but ended up taking on more than originally planned. Responsibilities that were supposed to fall on a contracted designer to help with the aforementioned event got passed to me, not out of emergency, but because the DD believed that I could do it better ""in house"", to put it plainly. For last year's event, it required both SM and I to successfully execute the design and content for the event; this year I basically did two people's jobs for the price of one. I was naive to not ask for some form of additional compensation beforehand. Post-event, I have continued to do my coworker's tasks successfully, in addition to a few other things I would already need to be doing for my own position. I am starting to feel resentful because of the wage gap between our directors and the rest of us, in addition to the fundraising event being the most successful it has been in recent history. 

Senior Manager is returning to full-time WFH today and the question came up about what my schedule will go back to. SM had previously encouraged me to ask for more pay when I reached the 2 year mark, but this was before she knew she would be absent in such an extreme way (again, two weeks that turned into four). 


I really want to make around the same amount as I was during this time that SM has been away, so the math comes to these options, ranging from fantasy-land to down-in-the-dumps:

A. Get bumped a 20-25% increase + stay at 24 hours/week: This would put me in bliss. I don't think this will happen. $2,000/month.

B. 10-15% pay increase: I assume this would be my most reasonable compromise. It would take me from on-paper $20/hour to on-paper $23/hour, which would put me at about $1,900/month.

C. 10-15% pay increase + 32 hours/week: This would yield the most pay but, again, not sure how reasonable. $2,400/month.

D. 32 hours/week at current pay: Not ideal, but would accept, I guess??? Idk. $2,000/month.

E. No raise: Damn, that would suck, but I wouldn't leave. $1,400/month.


I proved my worth by completing the tasks of a Senior Manager for a month straight. My responsibilities will go back to semi-normal now, but I feel justified in asking for more. What do you all think is my best bet? What would you do in my position? I need all the perspective that I can get.


TL,DR: Took on my Senior Manager's role for a month on emergency surgery and now want to negotiate higher pay because I proved my worth and invested extra time and energy.

1lcyppp,"I’ve reached a breaking point - mental and physical health issues, on a PIP","I don’t know where to go from here. Do I wait for termination and try to get unemployment or take a leave of absence? I had a suicide attempt last week. 

I’ve been on a PIP for over a month. It was a 30 day plan that got extended an additional 30 days because I haven’t met expectations. My last performance review had an HR member present. I fully expect to be fired at this point. 

I have a myriad of health issues. I broke my ankle in 3 places a few years ago and have had continued issues and multiple surgeries since. I’m diabetic. I had bariatric surgery a year ago and have had complications since. My biggest concern however is mental health. I have ADHD, anxiety and panic disorder, and depression. 

I started fully remote for the first couple years because of the pandemic. I now work a hybrid schedule and in January, they extended the in office days from 2 to 3. I haven’t adjusted well. I’m constantly sick. 

My mental health has been rapidly declining especially because of the PIP and I’ve reached a breaking point. Last week I had a breakdown and reached out to the suicide hotline. A couple hours later, 4 cops were at my door to escort me to the ER (involuntary). 

I don’t think I can even make it through the week. I just don’t know what to do. If I quit, I can’t get unemployment. I’m sure I could qualify for some kind of leave benefit but what’s the point if I’m going to get fired after anyway. I also don’t know if I even have it in me to go through the process of getting proper documentation. I have a lot of debt so I can’t have zero income but I need a break. What do I do?

1lcypkn,"Need Advice: H1B visa transfer, promotion timing, and how to resign gracefully","Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a tricky spot and would love your advice.

I’m currently on an H1B visa (since last October) and have been with my current company for over three years. I’ve been thinking about switching jobs for a while now due to long hours, low pay, and limited growth, but just this week, I was told I’m finally getting promoted.

This is a big deal because promotions are rare in my office, and it feels like long-overdue recognition for my hard work. I was genuinely happy… until last week, when I got headhunted and received an offer for a much better job, higher pay, better role, and overall a more promising opportunity.

Now I’m torn. I’m leaning toward accepting the new job, but I don’t want to burn bridges at my current workplace. Ideally, I’d like to inform them I’m leaving before the promotions are publicly announced, but the new employer still needs time to file for the H1B transfer, and I’m nervous about timing, risks, and what happens if the transfer hits a snag in the current political climate.

Would it be terrible to stay quiet, let the promotion go through, and then give notice a week or two later once things are confirmed on the new job front? I feel really guilty thinking about that, but I also want to protect myself.

Should I be prioritizing scoring an internship during my first summer break? I know my friends from the same major are not, but my friends in other majors are already  scoring internships. I am also unsure what kind of internship I need to take, what would a graphic designer shoot for?

Is double majoring really worth it? I know that in theory it sounds like I'd have a wider range of jobs to pick from. However, I am also worried that I am not specializing in one thing enough, and jobs wouldn't like that.

I won't bore with all the details (see my other post) but my job title and salary were cut significantly due to what I believe was a combination of ageism, anti-semitism and the fact that my wife is very ill.

I took the new, lower paying job because I need to keep bringing income in. As it happened, last week (before the title change), I sent out a resume with my much fancier job title that was current at the time. I got a first interview that went really well and I did not tell the interviewer that things aren't going well at my current job. When they asked why I wanted to leave my current job, I said ""I don't want to leave. I'm just really excited about the possibility of joining your company."" (this is true as I don't have to leave even my new, lesser job and I am really stoked if i get the new job).

Now, as of today, my job title is different (not horrible but not as good) but I have follow-up interviews with the new employer whose job I desperately want. Is it my responsibility to send them some kind of note and say ""my job title just changed. I thought you should know that"" or should I not say anything unless it comes up again in conversation. I haven't changed my title on LinkedIn yet, but it's always possible they would see my replacement post he got the job I formally had, leading my old dept.

I never lied to them, but I don't want them to think that I did. OTOH, I don't want to throw a wrench into the process. They seemed to really like me and scheduled not one but two follow-up interviews for me.",Necessary-Cup9400,1,1.0,1,1750087916,2025-06-16 15:31:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcvwy0/job_title_change_in_the_middle_of_an_interview/,6,2025

1lcuxsv,I need some advice,"I’m 31 and have been feeling really stuck in my career. After graduating with a degree in Business Management, I went straight into management roles—but I quickly realized it wasn’t for me. I worked at a grocery store for two years, ran my own food truck business for another two, and then returned to a management position for about nine months.

To be honest, I’ve hated almost everything about management—the long hours, the stress, and especially the lack of meaningful growth and fair pay. My first job paid little over six figures, but it came at the cost of 70–80 hour weeks. The food truck did well, earning anywhere from $500 to $2,000 a night in just a few nights a week. I closed my business to go to culinary school but couldn’t pursue it due to personal reasons.

Now, I’ve been out of work for almost a year. My wife has a great job and supports us, but I feel lost. I know I don’t want to go back to management—I’d be miserable—but I also don’t know what to do next.

I’ve always had a passion for investing and have been trading since college. I just started this year to really start investing and double my account ( I know it was all luck) but I love looking at numbers and that made me so excited. I enjoy helping people and am interested in finance, but I don’t know where to begin. Should I pursue the Series 65, CFA, or CFP? I’m trying to figure out what role would be the right fit and how to break in.

If anyone has made a similar transition—or works in finance—I’d really appreciate your guidance. I just want to build a future I can be proud of.

1lcuvqw,I'm lost.,"So, I'm completely lost here. I don't want to do medicine anymore. But now that I'm saying this, they're asking me that if I didn't want to do this then why I took a drop year to repeat the exam. I took it to prove to those two people who said that I'm accepting defeat without properly fighting the war. I took it to prove that I'm not accepting defeat, I simply don't want to pursue this career anymore and that I didn't want to waste another year after school when I didn't get accepted on my first try. 

Now coming to the point, I want to pursue biotechnology but not everyone in my small town thinks there's much scope in it. They think medicine should be my career choice but I AM NOT DOING IT, I WILL ONLY  DO WHAT I WANT TO. But now the problem is if i do the bachelors in the university of my town, I might not get very good placements. But going to another town will cost too much and I don't want to put that burden on my parents, they're already struggling to make ends meet, I just don't want to add more to their plate. 

So can someone guide me , what should I do??

P.S. - Please don't talk about how just to prove a point I wasted a whole damn year. I know it's not good but I've always been the obedient type and I felt like by doing what they want me to, maybe they'll be happy with me and not disappointed.

1lcufqu,(Europe) Which IT areas are worth specialising in?,"Hej!
No tl;dr because i feel like the whole picture is important.

In general, 3 years ago I moved to Scandinavia, and a year ago I got a MSc in a construction engineering related industry, which is seriously struggling right now. I spent a year applying to over 150 places around Scandinavia and my home country, but no effect. I'm young, but don't want to waste time. I want to move to an industry that will provide me with a more secure job prospects. And please, dont say that IT is oversaturated, because compared to my situation - it's not, and i dont have another choice.

I speak the local language at B1 level and actively learning, im an engineer, high logic and analytical skills etc. Right now im applying to a local type of ""college"" (2 years) that provides a job specialiaation certificate and includes half a year of internship, so that youre not left with empty CV after.

As of now, i have ZERO knowledge in IT, apart from some html and c at school.

From my long research, my aims are the programs named below (in order of priority):
1. Data Scientist - however they expect native level local language proficiency (beyond basic eligibility) so i might not be even eligible as they already make problems
2. System developer specializing in .NET - considered generally quite safe, manageable  future-proof
3. Backend Developer Cloud focus - from my research, its harder for a beginner
4. Web developer / front end dev - seems the easiest, but so many of them around nowadays
5. Cloud focused .NET dev - they also make problems with language

(The college offering positions 4. and 5. messaged me that they offer a free 4-week course in Programming resulting in being eligible.)

Questions:
1. Which one between 4 and 5 is more worth it to pursue?
2. Which areas are the most worth it in general?
3. Which areas are the most risky in a way that i might not handle it?

1lcu2q2,"26 years old. Had dreams, reached them and changed my mind. Now full of grief and no motivation to do anything while feeling like I have to grow up right now. Any tips?","Hi!

I am 26 years old, living in an European country and the last couple of years have been turbulent in different ways but I guess ill start from the most relevant point.

3-4 years ago I was studying IT in my 2nd year and managed to get a summer internship a lot of people within tech would consider the ""dream"". This was during covid so the entire thing was remote and I absolutely hated it. Looking back on it I think I got a bit burnt out studying from home and then transitioning to the exact same daily life, just with the pressure of a huge workplace and feeling impostor syndrome.

I decided to take a gap year after the internship since at that time I thought I would never want to work with IT again. I worked and went for a language trip which was dope. While I was there I was considering my options and landed on the possibility of switching universities back to my hometown, going into IT + engineering just to get a ""fresh start"". This became more important as when I got home from my language trip, our family found out that my Dad had been diagnosed with a terminal illness.

Jumping a bit in time, my Dad passed away and I have currently ""completed"" my studies in regards to that I can either start on a IT Masters or work at the moment this upcoming autumn. I have also applied to a game design school as it has been something I have thought about doing for along time.

I think the issue is that I dont feel motivation for doing anything and haven't really felt it since my dad passed away around a year and a half ago. I just feel like I get up every morning and do the things I ""need to do"" such as studies, work and social activities. Most of these things are stuff I am ""keeping alive"" because I did them before my Dad passed away even though I dont like most of it now.  

The grief of my father has gotten better but I guess im struggling  really hard to be a real adult when I wake up most days with no motivation to do anything, existential questions about who I am and what I want to do with my life while at the same time also feeling  scared of changing my circumstances.

I have seen a therapist and doctor where things havent really progressed much. I also went to a grief group for a semester which definitiely helped but I still feel every day that I am stuck.

Some days I hate myself for being lazy, not taking action for my life and for putting myself in the situation I am in currently. I feel like I am trying to do the things you are supposed to do in my position but things just arent getting better.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do or think in a situation like this where I have no motivation and dont feel like there is an obvious next step? I dont know if I want to work with IT, change direction and do game design or continue studying while waiting for my motivation for living comes back.

1lctj2d,"Based on my contract, am I required to extend my notice period?","
I’m employed in Singapore and have just placed my 1-month notice of resignation on 13 June 2025 with my last working day being 11 July 2025. My boss who is also HR because we are a very small company told me that I’ll have to serve a 4-month notice. Here is what my contract says:

—-

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT
The employee is bound to fulfil the minimum contractual term of 1.5 years with the employer.

Either party can terminate this agreement with 4 months writtten notice, after the contractual term of 1.5 years is up. If early termination is required, up to maximum 1 month can be paid salary in lieu of notice for the relevant period, subject to management approval.

—-

I started my employment on 2 Jan 2024 so I would have fulfilled my 1.5 years of service on 2 July 2025. Given that I placed my notices before the 1.5 years is up, the 4-months notice period notice would apply am I right? In Singapore, if there is no noticed period stated, it’s regulation that I just need to give a 1 week notice. Since there is no noticed period stated prior to 1.5 years, I thought a 1-month notice would be reasonable. Is my interpretation correct? Do I really need to serve a 4-month notice based on the way my contract is worded? 


TLDR: my employment contract states that I need to serve a 4 months notice after 1.5 years, but I submitted a 1-month noticed before 1.5 years is up. Do I need to do the 4 months?

Hey everyone,

I’m currently studying in the healthcare field, and while I’m interested in the work, I’ve recently come to realise that my passion lies in teaching. I genuinely enjoy the idea of being in a classroom and connecting with students.

That said, I’m not ready to let go of healthcare completely, especially since I’ve already invested time into it.  I am considering doing a PGCE after graduation. I’m wondering if there’s anyone here who’s managed to combine both paths? Like working as a teacher (even part-time or at a college) while also working in healthcare
particularly something based on appointments, like being a health practitioner with your own practice or similar setup.

Alternatively, if you’re a teacher juggling two jobs, I’d love to hear how you manage it and whether it’s sustainable.

Would really appreciate any advice, stories, or just general perspective on this.

1lcp72k,"My job is too easy, asks very little of me and I feel like there is no room for improvement or growth. Should I switch my career or is it too risky?","28M. Wanting to switch career but I don’t know if it’s the right call. Residing in Japan. A native Japanese.  


Initially wanted to be a video game dev, but got rejected left and right when I was job hunting in 2019 and 2020. 


There was still a Covid thing going on and everyone was paranoid. I was too. As my job hunting starts dragging on I kinda panicking and took the very first job that offered. At the time it seemed that was the only choice.


It is a customer service job where I mostly handle phone calls and emails. Full remote. My boss said I would be summoned in Tokyo to work in an office few years ago, but I suspect both my boss and his boss either forgot and/or kinda accepted that full remote works so they’re still going with it. Pay is decent (360k JPY a year).

I enjoyed the remote environment and how “easy” it is to handle customer inquiries, and constant 9-6 (1 hour of break included) cycle that rarely gets disturbed. 
However, recently I’m starting to think that after 5 and a half years, I haven’t worked a single “real” job. No skill, no achievement, no certifications, no responsibility. I haven’t even stepped into an office once.
I can’t expect raise or promotion either; it’s fairly a small team (team of 12. 2 are leaders but we’re mostly just following protocol made by project managers who’re above us) and I haven’t seen any one of them gets promoted to higher position other than one of my coworker becoming a leader (still not out of the CS team). 


I feel like there’s no way to improve myself, and that if I keep working this job I would be living off a minimum wage. 


Recently I’m starting to want to switch career and dive into other fields, such as localization, IT, engineering, programming, coding, and web designing are my current interests.


However I’m already 28 with no applicable experiences. Might be tough to get hired in the first place. Might be get hired by sweatshop and putting in a same/similar position where I just keep doing routine work with no improvements, with worse pay. There’s also AI stuffs that’s going on that making even harder for newcomers to get into new positions.

1lcogus,Career Options After 10th In India,"Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom.

(Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam)

dosto Pichle kuch saalon mein India mein science stream ka craze kaafi badh gaya hai. 2012 mein jahan lagbhag 31% students science stream choose karte the, wahi 2022 tak yeh number badh kar 42% ho gaya hai. Science in students ke liye ek popular choice ban gayi hai jo technology, aerospace, medicine, aur computers jaise fields mein career banana chahte hain. Ismein physics, chemistry, biology, maths, aur computer science jaise subjects padhe jaate hain, jo in fields mein aage badhne mein madad karte hain.

Student science stream kyun choose karte hain, iske peeche kai factors hote hain jaise unke area ki literacy rate, parents ki padhai-likhai ka level, job ki availability, aur foreign universities mein padhne ka trend.

Ek aur interesting baat ye hai ki ab science stream choose karne wali ladkiyon ki sankhya bhi badh rahi hai. 2010 mein lagbhag 37.91% ladkiyan science leti thi, aur 2023 tak ye percentage badh kar 42.64% ho gaya hai.

Ye sari chize mai bs sirf google pe jake nahi balki har ek us jagah jake collect kari hai research kari hai jnha se tumhe facts and galat information na mile jaise National Portal of India,

EducationInfo.se,Education.com And ground level pe jake apne dosto se bhi batein kari hai.. And maine khud ki bhi 10th ke baad ki Journey jo rahi hai wo bhi is video me ache se bataya hai…,

Kai baar suna hoga ki arts ya commerce lene ka matlab kam scope, ya sirf science hi sahi choice hai. Par ye ek myth hai.. Arts mein bhi law, design, psychology jaise careers hai jis mein aaj kaafi growth hai. Commerce mein business, CA, aur finance jaise strong career options hain jo stable aur rewarding hain.

To mai baat karu.. 2023 ke deta k according to har koi 10th ke baad chahta hai ki wo Science le

Ya mai kahu mummy papa k pressure me aake science lene ke liye majbur ho raha hai,

Agr aap google pe jake search bhi kare ki best stream after 10th to google ki taraf se jawab aayega science, same tum agar Google pe search karte ho best Career options after 10th to across the web tumhe milega , computer science, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and electrical engineering Ya Tum thoda upper middle class ho to JEE, NEET Ki tyari ke liye tumhe parents dwara force bhi kiya jata hai.. Lekin kya ye sahi hai.?

Kya humare pass or koi aisa other career option nahi hai.?

Jaise kayi log CBSE board se apni 10th krte hai, unhe bhi yeh faisla karne ka pressure hota hai ki kaunse academic stream ko chun na hai jo zindagi ka ek bahut zaroori daur hota hai. Aksar yeh mana jata hai ki science, arts aur commerce ke muqable behtareen choice hoti hai, aur sabhi students yeh pressure mehsoos karte hai. Lekin, mujhe lagta hai ki asli samasya yeh nahi hai ki students confused hain, balki yeh hai ki ek supportive environment ki kami hai jahan students apni pareshaaniyon ko apne maa-baap aur teachers ke saath khulkar discuss kar sakein.

Career ke faisle bahut mayne rakhte hain, aur guidance ki kami aksar ahem maukon ko chhin leti hai. Kuch students ke maa-baap unhe hamesha support karte hai, kuch nahi bhi karte, mai jo krte hai apne baccho ko support unka khud ka educational background itna strong nahi hota, jis wajah se un students ko unse salah lena mushkil lagta.wo doosron ke paas jane se bhi jhijhakte hain, dar hota ki log judge karenge.

Ek kaala sach ye hai ki hamara education system zyada tar role learning pe zor deta hai, na ki students ki individual talent ko nikharta hai.

Lekin fir bhi mai chahunga

Career ke decisions par family se khul kar baat karna bhi bahut zaroori hai. Aapko ye sochna chahiye ki unka experience aur aapke interest ko mila kar kaise ek behtar decision liya ja sakta hai. Agar aap family ko apne interests aur goals ko explain karenge, toh bohot chances hain ki wo bhi aapko samajh payenge aur support karenge.

Mai baat karu un middle class bachho ke parents ki, wo bhale hi zyada shikshit nahi hote, lekin unhone hamesha apne baccho ko support karte hain. par society aur rishtedaron ka pressure.. and ek soch ki agar science mein safal nahi huye, toh career khatam ho jayega, har taraf faili hui thi.

Tum isko Agr Apne Role model ki story se compare karo to dekh paoge jaise..

Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam ke paas initial resources nahi the, lekin unhone apne interest ko follow kiya aur aerospace mein apna naam banaya. Unka safar hume sikhata hai ki agar aapka mann kisi cheez mein lage toh chahe shuruaat kitni bhi mushkil ho, aapka dedication aapko manzil tak zaroor le jaayega.

Ya Tum baat karo Virat Kohli ki to Unhone bhi ek traditional career path nahi chuna. Unhone cricket mein apni maharat banayi aur apne passion ko follow kiya. Woh aaj ek inspiration hain, aur yeh dikhata hai ki jab hum apni pasand ka kaam karte hain, toh hum usmein apna best de sakte hain.

Tumhe Apne level pe baat karni hai to tum Un

Same students se jake baat karoge to wo ye zarur bolenge ki

Kaash kisi ne us samay mujhe samjhaya hota ki academic failure zindagi ka ek hissa hai aur yeh humari kshamata ko define nahin karta. Kaash mujhe pata hota ki rona hume kamzor nahi banata, ki arts bhi ek accha option ho sakta hai, aur har failure ke baad ek naya avsar humare liye intezaar kar raha hota hai. Hamara education system hume kabhi yeh nahi sikhata ki kaise failures ko positively accept karein.

India ko education system employment producing me focus krti hai employment generation pe nahi …. aur isme education bahut bada role play karta hai kyunki agar sex education nahi diya jaaega toh population badhegi .jisse creative employment ka scope aur bhi nahi hoga … bus employment dene mein lage rhenge badhi abaadi ko per youth ke talent se kaise naye fields generate kre yeh nahi ho payega.

Aaj ke time mein digital marketing, content creation, data science jaise naye fields bhi hain jo kaafi rewarding hain aur creativity aur skills pe focus karte hain. Yeh woh fields hain jo kuch saalon pehle tak mainstream nahi the, par aaj successful careers bana rahe hain. Agar aapko traditional streams main interest nahi hai, toh aap yeh naye options bhi explore kar sakte hain.

agr aap actually pressure me aake science le lete hain and usme mehnat karte hai , to success to milgi kyon ki mehnat kahi zaya nhi hoti but kya aap jo work karoge usme khush rahoge.

1lcodvf,Should I do a BSc in Computer Science even though I want to be a pilot?,"Hey everyone,
I’m currently in high school and trying to figure out what path to take after graduation. I’d really appreciate some advice on this.

The only subject I’m genuinely good at is Computer Science — it makes sense to me, I enjoy it, and I tend to score well. That said, I have no real interest in becoming a programmer or working in tech.

What I really want to do is become a commercial pilot. That’s the dream — but I also know that flight school is expensive, and the aviation industry can be unstable depending on the economy, job market, etc. So I want to make a realistic backup plan in case things don’t go as expected.

I’m considering doing a BSc in Computer Science as a fallback — not because I want a career in tech, but simply because it’s the subject I’m most comfortable with. If becoming a pilot doesn’t work out, I’m open to doing an MS in CS later and then properly entering the tech field if needed.

But here’s my concern:
	•	The current tech job market looks shaky — layoffs, hiring freezes, over-saturation in some areas.
	•	I’m worried that even as a backup, a CS degree might not be as reliable as it once was.
	•	I’m also unsure if a general BSc in CS is worth it if I don’t plan to use it immediately.

Would love to hear your thoughts:
	•	Is a CS degree still a good safety net even if it’s not Plan A?
	•	Are there better or more versatile degrees I should consider?
	•	Would having a CS degree (and maybe later an MS) give me enough security if aviation doesn’t work out?

Any advice from CS grads, pilots, or anyone who’s been in a similar position would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!

1lcnqm6,Gmail might have screwed me and I really need some advice.,"I have had a very frustrating month. I'm about to complete a writing degree at uni, and, through some official channels, I was lucky enough to happen across a massive opportunity for someone who is essentially just starting their career. When I put my hand up for it, the editor responded, and was very eager for me to take part, gave me a deadline, some parameters to work within, and it was pretty much a perfect setup on my end. The next day, I sent off my response, telling him that I was keen and very prepared to take it on while I wrap up my final assignments.

Cut to two weeks later, and I go into the gmail app on my phone (I normally use the Outlook app on my laptop) and discover that my response has been sitting in my outbox the entire time, having never sent. I immediately followed up apologising for such a delayed response, still making sure my enthusiasm was clear. At the same time, I was just thinking ""he's given me the information he needed to, if he doesn't reply, it isn't necessary.""

And last week, I completed my draft. I'm super proud of it, got a couple of really positive second opinions, and I sent it to him at the very start of the work week. But since his initial email to me last month, I still haven't received anything back, and obviously, I am super stressed about it. 

It could be that he's busy, but considering how quickly he first replied, I'd assume this isn't it. I followed up once late last week, just saying I'm looking forward to hearing his thoughts, but I'm frankly really not sure what exactly the issue is, and if/how I follow up again. Because it could have definitely been the outbox delay, or that he absolutely hated my piece, or that due to the outbox delay, he managed to find someone else to write about my topic, or maybe he just didn't want to publish the work of someone who doesn't have much in the way of official works.  
  
Regardless, this would have been my first paid work as a writer, and it would have been so incredibly beneficial to have for my CV/portfolio. If it turns out that my piece is not going to get published, I will be so devastated. I'm just trying to figure out if it is worth emailing him again, to get the 411 and make sure it's clear that I wasn't at all ignoring him. What should I do?",sssuspecttt,1,1.0,5,1750063490,2025-06-16 08:44:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcnqm6/gmail_might_have_screwed_me_and_i_really_need/,6,2025

1lcn60h,"I'm going to be 25 this year. I dropped out of college, I have no job, no connections, and no social skills. What do I need to do to start a career at this point in my life?","I am a 24 year old male. I ""finished"" two years of college. Dropped it. A year later I went back but dropped again. It's been 5 years and I've been spiraling down ever since. I've forgotten why I did that, I only remember that I was scared and felt helpless.

In those 5 years, I've been holed up in my room, either stuck on a desktop or on my phone, gaming or watching videos. I help my parents occasionally, but I've never done anything meaningful in those 5 years. I don't drink, I don't party, I don't engage with anyone, I don't have any friends.

3 years ago, my parents built a resort. It was something new for all of us. They did not hire professional help to clean the pool and so that fell upon me. I browsed the web for information for some time and, with some mistakes here and there, I can now maintain a crystal clear pool. I've been in charge of maintenance ever since. As of now, I receive ₱10,000 php / $179 usd a month from my parents and I still live with them. Although, I am an integral part of their business, after my responsibilities, I go back to my room and hole up for the rest of the day, until the guests have left and I need to clean the pool again. They have confronted me about this, and I could not disagree. I am still a burden. What I'm doing right now is not enough for my family or for myself. I thought about starting a  pool cleaning service, but I quickly realized that I don't know nearly enough to service differnet pools and the specific maintenance equipment tied to them.

With no degree or higher education, I am looking to the trades. I like to think I'm rssourceful enough; I'm the one to fix small problems within our house and whenever something breaks during routine maintenance of the pool, I'm the one to either fix them or find an alternative solution. With that in mind, I'd like to try my hand as a welder or an electrician. I'm a quick learner and a resourceful problem solver and no stranger to hard work. But how do I start? I'm shit at talking, I have no wittiness or nuance, I'm prone to make conversations awkward and often embarrass myself whenever I open my mouth. It's why I am determined not to talk or open up, because I often get met with silence and strange looks. 

I've wasted 5 years and potentially my entire educational life, and now that I'm getting older and feeling the weight of the world upon seeing my father's declining health, I'm looking to clean up my act for the sake of my family. 

I will take any advice or criticism, no matter how harsh. ",SpinningPancake2331,1,1.0,0,1750061098,2025-06-16 08:04:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcn60h/im_going_to_be_25_this_year_i_dropped_out_of/,6,2025

I’m looking for some HR-related advice and perspective from this community.

I work at a well-known multinational company in a technical role. Recently, I was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) — but what concerns me is the way it was initiated:
	•	My direct team lead had no idea about the PIP. He only came to know after I informed him, and he was surprised.
	•	There was no prior feedback, no documentation, and no performance conversation before this step.
	•	I have since escalated the matter to Compliance/HR, and an internal investigation is now underway.
	•	I have recorded proof (with consent) of my team lead stating he was never consulted and that my performance wasn’t an issue from his side.

This feels like retaliation or a personal agenda, not a standard performance process. I still have about two months left in my notice period, and I’m unsure how to navigate this professionally and legally.

My questions:
	1.	Is it normal or acceptable for a manager to initiate a PIP without any input from the team lead or documented performance issues?

How can I protect my reputation and future employment opportunities, especially if I’m applying elsewhere while on a PIP?",Fast-Combination9507,1,0.6600000262260437,6,1750057405,2025-06-16 07:03:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcm9v5/need_hr_advice_manager_put_me_on_pip_without_team/,6,2025

1lcm1wa,Career advice needed - Data Analyst role,"Hey everyone  
  
I am a 2018 CS graduate. Took some time to try my luck at GATE and some govt exams, didn't get through. Later I joined as a data analyst in a Mumbai startup. Learnt a lot of stuff - data projects, training people, hiring interns, project management etc - Jackof all trades. 

I Had to come out of the city due to family issues. Later I joined Isha as a social media analyst and worked for an year. Great place to work and learn. Again project management, analytics, creativity etc. Worked for an year; At the end of this year, I got married. My wife unfortunately had a terrible food poisoning phase and I had to quit my job to take care of her. Later for 6 months, I did some freelancing to keep the bills going on. Family issues, taking care of the home, and eventually burn out left me helpless at home. So summary - a career break. 

I have good skills in Excel, SQL, Power BI, project management, and some graphic design. I’m good at using tools like ChatGPT and have a systematic approach to problem-solving. Now, I’m eager to get back into a full-time data analyst role, preferably remote, from Coimbatore.

But I have no clue as to where the market is.

My plan to make a strong comeback is to revisit key concepts, build a solid portfolio with projects, and document everything on LinkedIn—sharing my learning journey openly. Hopefully, this will help me attract the right recruiters.

I’m also really open to mentorship or someone to study with. I feel that would accelerate my progress and keep me accountable.

I’d love to hear from you about:

1. How is the current job market for data analysts?
2. What salary range is realistic for my background and break?
3. Any tips for landing remote roles and standing out?
4. Any one who successfully sailed the same storms?

Background: I (27) recently graduated with a Master of Urban and Regional Planning, I earned a non-stem BA in 2020 and currently have 3 years of related transportation planning experience. I have some time (2 weeks), but eventually, I must choose the next step in my career. 

I have an idea of what job I would like to take. Still, I would like to hear from other professionals, especially since I find the temporary transportation position better aligned with my goals and skill set. Still, I am enticed by the entry-level engineering position's work-life balance, baseline salary, and the fact that it is a permanent position.  

  
**Option 1:** 

Temporary Transportation Planner - County Level 

* Pay Grade: $65,478.40 - $81,827.20 - $98,176.00
* Status: Waiting for compensation details but feel comfortable negotiating for 85-90k

Pro: 

* Aligns with long-term career goals 
* Higher promotion potential in the agency (larger agency) 
* Lead agency in upcoming global events 
* Hybrid (3x a week) 

Con: 

* Temporary position (3 years)
* 40 min commute by car or 1 Hour by train (subsidized transit) 
* Will not have my own cubicle 

  
**Option 2:** 

Entry-Level Engineer - City Level 

* Pay Grade: 85-104k
* Status: Do not feel comfortable negotiating since I do not have a bachelor or master in engineering  

Pro: 

* Permanent Position 
* Recently moved so my commute is a 10 minute drive 
* Incredible work life balance (9/80 work schedule) with every other Friday off 
* Have my own cubicle 
* Learn “how to speak engineering”

Con: 

* No career progression…practically zero promotion without a bachelor/engineering degree unless I’m supervised for several years + take a test
* Work on city level transportation engineering tasks but not necessarily transportation planning projects 
* Does not align with my long term career goals ",transit_98,1,1.0,0,1750053118,2025-06-16 05:51:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcl7bx/deciding_between_jobs/,6,2025

1lckxvt,I get treated differently,"I’m f21 and I get mistaken for an intern, get mistaken that I don’t know things and people mansplain it to me. My mistakes get overly highlighted. 

People can smell ambition and care off me and notice the work I put into my job. ( it’s been pointed out to me before. I’m not just gassing myself up here on reddit )

I’ve also been told I think too much or scramble sometimes but it’s definetly a mix of people holding me to a higher standard and also mansplaining basic things to me coz it seems like they don’t trust me . I get targeted by managers and coworkers and they pick on little things but a lot of others just give me tough love and want me to improve.

I’m someone that respects honesty coz I wana grow in this industry and do better. I want to learn and do things despite how pressured and isolated I feel when I see intern after intern being coddled and praised for the bare minimum. Sometimes certain things come back to bite my coworkers in the ass but other things are accepted and taken as is whereas I’d be scrutinised.

I’m currently at a good place. But I still deal with some of these things and want to see if others can too. It almost feels like there’s this unwritten rule that I should do more and work harder.

1lcj5sa,Hands off leadership during major infrastructure upgrade,"Hey everyone — I’m currently working as an Assistant Superintendent at a course that’s undergoing an irrigation upgrade on the back 9, and I wanted to get some perspective from others in the industry.

We’re replacing all the existing heads with Hunter TTS-800s and converting the system to a new 2-wire setup. It was supposed to start in March but didn’t actually begin until May, pushing us straight into the hotter part of the season. The contractor gave us a 6-week timeline from start to finish.

We ran into some early complications:
	•	Inconsistent swing joint sizes.
	•	Not enough couplers on hand.
	•	Needed to retrofit our current solenoids into the new heads so they’d work temporarily before the new wiring and decoders are installed.

All of that is pretty typical, but what’s been frustrating is how the leadership handled it. Both my Superintendent and Director of Agronomy were clearly annoyed with the contractor, mostly because he’d pause progress over solvable problems instead of pushing forward. But instead of having productive conversations with him, they kind of disengaged.

That’s when I stepped up:
	•	I’ve been flagging and locating all the heads.
	•	Directing the contractor on where to work next.
	•	Managing water shutoffs, hole closures, and coordinating with the pro shop to keep play moving smoothly.

We’re 4 weeks in now and just a few greens away from completing the head replacements. Next step is laying wire.

Here’s where I’m stuck: I’m 22, been working on golf courses for about 2.5 years, and this is my first time managing a project of this scale. I work for a management company that oversees 14 courses, and I took this job because I wanted to grow quickly in the industry. This project could’ve been an incredible learning experience, but instead I feel like I’m just blindly figuring it out on my own, with very little input, support, or mentorship from my Super or DoA.

So my question is this:
Is this normal? Do other assistants get thrown into the deep end like this when it comes to big infrastructure projects? Or should I be concerned that the leadership here is more reactive than proactive when it comes to development?

Would appreciate any advice — especially from superintendents, directors, or assistants who’ve been through similar situations. Just trying to learn and understand what’s typical in the industry and what’s not.",Future_development1,1,1.0,0,1750045786,2025-06-16 03:49:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcj5sa/hands_off_leadership_during_major_infrastructure/,6,2025

I’ve been working in Production Support/SysOps roles for the past few years, primarily becoming the go-to SME for whatever infrastructure or applications the company relies on. The work is broad and cross-functional ranging from infrastructure troubleshooting and supporting devs on production features to light scripting, bug fixes, configuring/changing our applications for  new clients, some QA, and SysAdmin tasks.  
 It’s a mixed bag, and while it's hard to fully capture on a resume, I know I’m operating well above typical entry-level roles.

That said, I’m at a bit of a crossroads. Much of my work has been highly proprietary, which makes it tough to translate into broader, specialized expertise that many mid-level roles look for. I’m definitely too experienced for most L1 or even L2 positions, but not always qualified (on paper) for roles that demand deep specialization.

I'm currently earning $80K + 10% bonus, working remotely. It’s a comfortable role, but feels like a financial and career dead end. Ideally, I’d like to break into the $110K+ range remote is a plus, but not a must. Career-wise, I’m open-minded, but I’d really like to escape the tunnel of proprietary systems unless there's a clear path to grow within it that I’m missing.

I’ve worked at some strong companies, including a major stock exchange, so I’m considering fintech as a logical next step. Open to any feedback, ideas, or even role recommendations my goal is to land something new in the next 6 months.

My resume is a bit of a rough draft, I think it's good enough to get my foot in a door, but bleh I don't know

1lcgatu,Open Source Ashby Job Search Tool,"Hey,

A friend of mine is looking for a job (wants to come to the US) and I want to help them out. I know applying **as soon as a posting is listed** is the best move so I made an ashby scraper to scrape all the jobs on each careers page.

Then periodically I'm running a script to generate a list of any new jobs added. That way if you check the google sheet you'll see the newest jobs listed - that you can then filter to see jobs related to your field, location, etc

This is only for ashby jobs because they have a consistent format, are pretty popular, and was the quickest one I can rip out. One hard part is finding all the company career pages.

I made a pretty decent list so far \~350 companies.  
This will be a super valuable resource - and if it ends up growing I'd like to expand to other job boards (greenhouse, lever, etc)

**What I need help with is the reddit community to send over some ashby career page links** (e.g [https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ramp](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/ramp)) - with more companies tracked we'll have better results.

1lcfmiw,"Burned out from covering for others, got a mediocre review, and now I think someone just hurt my chances at an internal transfer. What do I do?","I’m a tech lead work with ~20 clients and 6 PMs, but 4 of them consistently don’t pull their weight. I’m constantly cleaning up sloppy work, chasing down missing info, and joining calls that shouldn’t involve me just to keep things moving. One of them only has one of the clients, which happens to be our largest. 

On top of my own workload, I end up covering for others daily. The stress is nonstop. My boss is fully aware of how bad these coworkers are — she’s seen the work quality and even acknowledged it — but she hasn’t done anything to fix it. There’s been no accountability or support. It’s all falling on me.

In my performance review, I got a 3.5 out of 5. She accidentally flashed the team’s scores as she was trying to share during our Teams meeting, and no one got below a 3. The people I’m covering for got similar or equal scores as I did. It was disheartening and made me wonder why I even bother going above and beyond.

I also recently applied to two roles on our Product team. We were recently asked by Product to pilot a new enhancement for our largest client. I did the configuration and documented it clearly in chat that had all involved parties. I asked who was testing, and my director said the PM. Two days went by and that PM asked — even though we’d had three recorded calls on it — on how to test the new functionality and I tagged the product lead to explain again.

I went on PTO this week, and everyone knew I was out. Our system refresh wiped the changes I had made, which is normal. But while I was out, the team met without me — and in the meeting recording, this PM implied I hadn’t done the setup or communicated properly. It felt like I was thrown under the bus, and now I’m worried that it’s hurt my chances with the team I applied to join.

I’ll be honest — I’ve started to lash out a bit at work. I’m exhausted, frustrated, and tired of pretending everything’s fine while I absorb the fallout of other people not doing their jobs. I don’t want to be that person, but I’m at my limit.

What do I even do at this point?
	•	Do I talk to my manager about all of this? How?
	•	Should I defend myself to the other team?
	•	Is it time to stop covering for people and let the chips fall?
	•	Or do I just start job hunting?

I’ve tried to be a team player, but I’m getting nothing back for it — not even protection. If you’ve been in this kind of situation, I’d really appreciate your advice.

1lcenl5,Unemployed for over a year as a software engineer,"Hey all,

For background, I have been a software engineer for the past 5 years (2 years FE, 3 years BE) with a B.S in IT and CyberSecurity. I was laid off year and now have been unemployed for a year plus. Before I had the year gap on my resume I was consistently getting interviews and had actually landed an offer that was unfortunately rescinded so I'm back to square one.

  
It now seems harder for me to land interviews in this current market with the year-ish gap on my resume and I have used up almost all of my savings outside of my 401k. 

  
I am wondering what advice you would have for a person in my shoes? I am being told that software engineering is not a stable field now with the rise of AI and I should consider a career switch which I don't wholeheartedly believe. Also don't even know how I would pay for schooling / housing at this point. 

  
I am just feeling a bit lost at this point and would love to hear any advice yall might have, I'm open to out of the box solutions here.

1lcegaa,Should I Go to Law School After Getting My CPA? (Need Advice),"Hey y’all,

I’m considering going to law school in Fall 2027 and would really appreciate any advice from this community — especially from people who’ve made the jump from accounting to law or who’ve gone the non-traditional route.

Background:
• Graduated in May 2024 with a BBA in Accounting & Economics (3.67 GPA)
• Currently working as a Staff Accountant in Austin, TX making $75K
• Planning to pass the CPA exam by early 2026
• Will apply to law school in Fall 2026 and hopefully start in Fall 2027
• Long-term interest in corporate law or tax law (Big Law if possible)
• I’ve wanted to go to law school since I was a kid, but took a practical route through accounting first
• I’m aiming to have ~$150K saved between Roth IRA and 401(k) before starting law school
• The idea is to finish law school with less debt than my savings so I’m not starting life post-JD financially behind

I know law school isn’t always a smart financial decision, but I’ve intentionally given myself a few years to get experience, save aggressively, and make sure this is really what I want. I still feel drawn to it and I’ve always seen it as the final goal.

My questions for y’all:
1. Will my CPA and professional experience give me a meaningful edge in admissions, or is it just a small bonus?

2. Is a 3.67 GPA strong enough for T20 or T14 if I do well on the LSAT? What LSAT score should I aim for?

3. Realistically, could I break into Big Law (corporate) if I go to a school like University of Houston or SMU?

4. Is it worth going to law school if I’m leaving a stable $75K/yr job and have already built momentum in accounting?

5. How would you assess the risk/reward of law school if I have $150K saved going in?

6. Are there other career paths where a CPA + JD combo would give me an advantage, even outside traditional law firms?

7. For those who’ve done it: was going to law school after CPA/public/private accounting worth it for you?

8. What’s the maximum amount of loans you’d personally take out for law school, assuming I already have $150K saved?

Would really appreciate any insights from folks who’ve made similar moves, or from anyone with perspective on Big Law, tax law, or regional school outcomes.

1lcd8iw,Tempted to Leave My Desk Job for a Cruise Ship—Is It Worth It?,"Hi all,
I’m a 23-year-old American woman currently working in accounting. I have an associate’s degree and three years of work experience in the field. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering working on a cruise ship and wanted to get some insight—ideally from people who’ve actually done it.

Here are some of the questions I’m hoping to get answers on:
	•	How do taxes work when you’re employed by a cruise line? Do I pay U.S. taxes only, or do I owe anything to countries where the ship docks?
	•	Are there any roles onboard that align with accounting or administrative experience, or would I need to switch fields completely?
	•	Which cruise lines are generally considered the best to work for in terms of work environment and treatment of staff?
	•	What’s the pay and benefits like for someone coming in with a few years of professional experience?
	•	What does a typical work schedule look like? How many hours/days a week are expected?
	•	What’s the living situation like onboard (e.g., cabins, roommates, privacy, internet access)?
	•	Is there onboard training or certification required before you can start?
	•	How long are contracts typically, and is there downtime between them?
	•	Are crew members usually allowed to get off the ship during port stops, or are you mostly confined onboard?
	•	How does medical care work if you get sick or injured while working on the ship?
	•	Are there opportunities for career growth within the cruise line?
	•	What are the biggest downsides or things you wish you knew before starting?
	•	Is there anything you did to stand out during the application or hiring process?

If you’ve worked on a cruise ship and can speak from firsthand experience, I’d be super grateful to hear your honest thoughts.

1lcd79w,Made a big career pivot move—revamped my resume for a job outside my current field. What are my chances?,"I just applied for a job in a field that’s completely different from my current one. I’ve spent the last several years in more administrative and education-focused roles, but I’ve always had a creative/technical side—doing soundboard work for live events, helping with audio setups, and recently starting my own podcast.

The job I applied for is in audiovisual production. It’s not a studio or entertainment role—it’s more of a university-based position supporting media needs (recording, editing, event AV setup, etc.). Still, it feels like a solid entry point and a chance to finally move toward something that excites me. My long-term goal is to eventually work full-time as a sound engineer.

To apply, I completely rewrote my resume—highlighted my hands-on AV experience, volunteer work, and personal creative projects. I also framed my professional background in a way that emphasizes transferable skills like event logistics, tech troubleshooting, and content creation. I submitted a tailored cover letter explaining the career pivot and my commitment to learning and growing in this new direction.

So I’m wondering:

* What are my chances of landing an interview with this kind of application?
* Any advice from folks who’ve made a similar career switch into AV, media, or tech-based roles?
* How can I keep building momentum if I don’t get this job?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar—or who has insight into how hiring managers might view a career transition like this.

1lcax5q,Is my career going to be over if I do this?,"23M. 

I will start this off by saying since I graduated, I have job-hopped. Since May 2022, I have had 3 jobs:

* Category Merchandising Specialist I, 9 months, $48k salary
* Business Analyst, 18 months, $55k salary first year, last six months made $58k
* Sr. Business Analyst, 6 months, $76k salary

I recognize that job hopping is bad. I do recognize how it looks on my resume. However, here is where the problem lies: I am dealing with severe mental health issues and considering going into an IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program)/Day Treatment program to attempt to work on my issues. Because I have only been at my current job for 6 months, I am not eligible for FMLA. I can go on short-term disability. It has been made clear to me through my research that I may end up getting fired if I attempt to go on unprotected leave.

If that happens, is my career over due to 3 short stints + a resume gap? Finances aren't a worry, I live at home with my mom and stepdad and my mom supports me doing whatever I need to do to prioritize my mental health (she said I could quit if I really wanted to, but as much as I would like to, I think that would be a poor decision). I did live by myself from January 2024 - January 2025 but that was when my mental health began to go downhill due to loneliness.

Will I ever be able to find a job again if I do end up going on unprotected leave and getting fired?",J3ezyTheSnowman,2,1.0,8,1750021227,2025-06-15 21:00:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lcax5q/is_my_career_going_to_be_over_if_i_do_this/,6,2025

1lcapsm,My job is a crappy zoo with no enrichment- what do I do?,"Not a literal zoo, but pretty close. 

I currently work in a medical billing setting as a refund clerk. I make a laughable amount of money- I got the job through a temp agency and got hired on with no raise. At the time I was just grateful for a job and that they liked me. The longer I’ve been here I realized they don’t like me at all- just the work they don’t have to do because I’ve picked it up. 

When I first started I was in-office. I cleaned up their list of refunds that needed to be done (they hadn’t had a refund clerk in at least a year is what it looked like.) Once they saw I finished the refunds, they started coming up with stuff to keep me “busy.”

It started with sorting the mail. Literally sorting the mail into separate piles. That’s it. It never took me long to do and it wasn’t hard, so I didn’t say anything. 

Since then they’ve taught me several other things to do that they ask me to work on at different times. I stay on top of my refund clerk duties and still have time to complete their side projects.

No one is particularly friendly except for the receptionist- in fact, everyone else has been very pointedly rude to me. My first manager almost made me walk out, it was the COO that stopped me and asked me to say- and assured me I wouldn’t have to deal with her again (a promise that wasn’t kept.)

This job is an underpaid insult. I have a degree in mathematics and a very strong (almost to a fault) work ethic. My boyfriend tells me to work my wage, but I just don’t work slow. I am grossly underpaid and hardly even appreciated for the amount of work I do, especially the work not even remotely related to my title. 

The only thing the job has going for it is that they have let me work from home. That’s it. That’s the only reason I’m staying for the time being- but they’re adding more work and not coughing up the coin. 

I worked in food service my entire way through college and a little bit after, with a little experimentation as an inventory control clerk and a cashier. 

My resumé would look like trash for anything relevant to my degree. The only thing that’s going for me is that it shows loyalty, as I worked for the same company for 7 years. 

I just don’t know how to get out of this or fix it. I’d ask for a raise, but I just got hired on full time in April. I’ve been working for them since January. 

Any help or advice is appreciated, I think I mostly needed to complain.

1lca5gt,Business + CS double major w/ Marketing minor vs Business Major (Data Analytics Track) w/ CS and Marketing double minor — worth the GPA hit for job security + salary?,"I’m a rising junior trying to decide between two paths. My goal is strong job security, $75K+ starting salary, and a role that blends business strategy + data/tech (not just coding or pure number crunching).

The dilemma:

👉 Business + CS double major + Marketing minor
	•	Requires an extra class every semester (all advanced classes) to graduate on time
	•	GPA would likely drop (currently 3.77, realistically would dip to ~3.5)
	•	I’d still keep my leadership role in the Entrepreneurship Club + part-time marketing work for a nonprofit
	•	No room for electives, limited breathing room

👉 Business Major (Data Analytics Track) + CS minor + Marketing minor
	•	More manageable workload
	•	More time for internships, leadership, certifications (SQL, Python, Tableau), and work experience
	•	Less formal CS depth

Context:
Clark University is shifting focus—investing less in the business school and prioritizing tech programs (CS, game design, media arts/technology). I’m concerned about the business school’s long-term value and want to align myself more with Clark’s stronger areas while positioning for good career options.

💡 The question:
Is the CS double major worth the GPA hit + added stress for better job security + salary? Or would the CS minor + experience + analytics track get me most of the way there without burning out?

Would love input from people in business, data, tech, or recruiting — thanks!

1lc8eou,My colleague is upset I didn’t share confidential news with her. Was I wrong?,"I found out recently that the CFO of the company I work at is resigning. This information came directly from my boss and another senior leader and I was specifically told that it had to remain confidential until the official announcement.

A few days later, after the news became public, a colleague of mine - who I'm friendly with but I would not go as far as saying she's a friend of mine - found out I had known earlier. She got upset and told me she was disappointed that I didn't tell her in advance. She said it showed what kind of consideration I have for her and our team and made it sound like I had let her down.

I tried to explain that I was told explicitly not to share the news and that it wasn’t personal. To me it was just a professional obligation. But she still seemed hurt and distant afterward.

1lc80v2,"21 and finally facing reality: no job, no skills, and trying to fix my mess","Hey everyone, I’m 21, and I’m not sure if I should keep going with school or just focus on getting a job as soon as possible. I wanted to share a bit about myself and how I ended up in this situation where I feel like I don’t know anything about the real world.

I didn’t grow up with my parents my grandparents and aunt raised me. Because of that, I never really had a father figure to teach me stuff like discipline or hard work. On top of that, my family wasn’t exactly functional, which left me with anxiety something that is unacceptable as a man. I know I need to toughen up.

Back home, we were middle class, so I was lucky enough not to have to work as a teenager to help out financially. My family gave me everything I wanted, and honestly, that spoiled me. I got so used to a comfortable life that it ended up making me soft.

When we moved to Canada, I had just turned 18, and life completely flipped. Financially, we weren’t doing as well as we did back home, and it was a tough adjustment. I finished the last two years of high school here and noticed that most of my peers were already working and gaining experience. At the time, I didn’t think it was a big deal. I figured if I went to college or university, I’d be set for a good job afterward.

Now that I’ve grown up a bit and seen how things actually work, I realize how unprepared I am. It’s honestly embarrassing to admit, but I’ve never worked a job not even something part-time like fast food.

Here’s where I’m at: I just dropped out of my old program and am about to start a new one, Electrical Engineering Technology. But I’m torn. Should I try to jump into the trades and get an apprenticeship, even though I don’t have any connections? Or should I stick with school and try to get a part-time job while studying?

I’m worried that not having any work experience is going to hurt me no matter what I do. Even if I finish school and do internships and networking, will employers still see me as someone who doesn’t have any real-world experience?

I’d really appreciate any advice or insight you all have.

1lc66r1,"Feel like I'm being hazed/bullied, don't know what to do.","Hi everyone,

As the title of this post says, I don't know if I'm being hazed or bullied by this senior coworker.

For some context, I recently made a career change. Not to bore with the details but I (late 20s F) am a compliance officer by trade and recently switched over to wealth management. During the interview process with everyone, including this coworker, I made it clear I don't have a wealth management background but I am determined and willing to learn. I also got my required series exams on my own time. 

I am two months into this role and I sit between two senior coworkers. They know their stuff in and out because they've been here like 15 years. This past week kind of broke me.

I've made silly dumb mistakes and coworker railed me by not only telling me over email about this mistake I should've known about (again, genuine mistake on my end) but then proceeded to call me in an aggressive angry tone about their disappointment/frustration. 

Also, they quiz me on things over an email chain and it's got me stressed out. I'm genuinely scared of sitting next to this person and it's taking a toll on my mental health. I constantly have knots in my stomach and heart is racing. I am beginning to wonder if I'm just too stupid for this job and I made a big mistake coming over.

The other day they told me in person that I was being aggressive or combative in an email chain to them. My stomach dropped and I was stunned because I wasn't. I took a screenshot and sent it to my coworker and was like ""please keep me in check, am I being XYZ?"". They said I wasn't. 

I spoke to management about it and they basically gave me two options: either they can talk to them about it or I can. I feel like it would be better I do but I just wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this and how do I navigate?",Ok-Combination-7314,2,0.7599999904632568,3,1750009272,2025-06-15 17:41:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lc66r1/feel_like_im_being_hazedbullied_dont_know_what_to/,6,2025
1lc5git,Internal offer rescinded right before start date — advice? (Texas),"I’m hoping to get some advice or hear from others who’ve experienced something similar.

I’m an internal employee at a large health system in Texas. About a month ago, I signed an offer for a new role, with a start date set for this week. I gave notice to my current team, wrapped up my work, and was ready to move into the new position.

But just a week before my start date, I was informed that the offer was being rescinded. Leadership said the executive team didn’t give final approval for an organizational reorganization, and as a result, the role I was hired for was eliminated.

What’s confusing is that there is now only one position in the department — and it’s already filled. They told me I could either stay in my current job (which I was already preparing to leave) or apply for other openings, but I’d have to re-interview, even for roles related to what I was originally offered.

I feel like I was left in the dark. No one has explained when this decision was made or why the offer was extended in the first place if it hadn’t been approved.

Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Would you apply for a different role under the same manager, even if it’s not what you wanted? What would you do next?

Thanks in advance for your advice.

1lc4kuy,I fear I will be fired SOON,"I (27M) would appreciate some advice regarding a challenging situation I’ve been facing in my current HR role.

I’ve worked in Human Resources since 2019 (6 years) across three different environments: military, operational, and now corporate. Throughout my career, I’ve held generalist roles and received strong performance feedback. In my previous roles, I was recognized with awards, positive reviews, and no formal corrective actions.

Two years ago, I transitioned into a corporate HR position to gain flexibility and work a hybrid schedule. I was excited to join, especially with the initial agreement of a 3-day in-office/2-day WFH schedule (following a 3-month onsite training period). However, early red flags began to surface.

Just six weeks in, I received documented coaching for two minor issues—one being a delay in updating a tracker and another for sending a non-sensitive email to the wrong recipient. This felt over the top, especially during my training period. 1 month after this, I learned the WFH policy was changing, reducing the remote day to just one. Around the same time, my initial manager—who I sensed had issues with me—left, and I was reassigned to a new, more supportive manager.

Still, issues continued. An IT ticket I submitted one day late resulted in my WFH privilege being revoked by my director for a month, even though I received no additional training during that time. After 4 months in the role, I received a ""Needs Improvement"" review from my previous manager (who had already left the company). My new manager admitted he disagreed with it and confirmed that my predecessor had made unfavorable comments about me before leaving.

Just before reaching on year with this company, I was placed on a 90-day PIP for quality issues. While I had made a few errors, I hadn’t received coaching or feedback on them beforehand. I completed the PIP 1 month early due to not having any similar errors and resumed normal duties, eventually receiving a ""Meets Expectations"" on my next annual review. However, after making 8 minor errors over 7 months (all corrected before submission or publication), I was placed on a second PIP.

Now, two months into this new PIP, I’m facing another potential issue. My manager informed me that badge records were pulled after someone (I suspect my director) noticed I had been leaving for lunch about 15 minutes early to let my dog out. I’m salaried/exempt and had previously informed my manager of this, and he expressed no concerns at the time as long as work was completed. However, now he’s frustrated because he feels it reflects poorly on his oversight of me.

Given this context, I’m concerned I may be terminated soon—either immediately or at the end of this PIP. Luckily since being placed on this second PIP I’ve started actively applying elsewhere and am currently in later stage interviews with three other companies. I would greatly appreciate advice on the following:

1. **If I’m terminated, do I have to disclose that in future job applications?**
2. **Am I at fault here, or is this more reflective of a toxic environment?**
3. **Do I need to change how I approach my work, or is a change in environment the better solution?**
4. **Would this situation reflect poorly on me to future employers—even if I’m not formally terminated?**

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",Lanky-Astronomer-871,0,0.5,5,1750005301,2025-06-15 16:35:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lc4kuy/i_fear_i_will_be_fired_soon/,6,2025
1lc3xad,Am I too loyal? Anxious about a job opportunity.,"I need some perspective and advice.

I was planning to join a startup in August but all of a sudden I got headhunted to a position that is very tempting and something that I feel I should take. The opportunity just makes sense in many levels. Better pay, a good role, good company etc.

But I am feeling very anxious about turning down the startup since I already agreed joining. 

We started talks with them already on March. They have been patiently waiting me to join as there has been delays from my side. Now when they expect eagerly that I join them in August, how could I say no and let them down. Feel like a bad person to do that for them. 

I am not sure if I can do that but on the other hand I know I should be selfish here. I’m just too loyal by nature. “When I say something I am a man of my word.”

Any perspective or wise words my friends? Would it be a massive dick move now to turn the startup down after they have waited me to join an launch their sales for many months.

1lc3ior,"Thinking of switching from electrical to becoming a chef, raw advice wanted.","Just as a little introduction, I’m 18 years old and I was considering the cooking industry, though I’m still not 100% on it. As of right now, I’m about to graduate high school and I have about 8 months of experience as a unregistered electrical apprentice. Through my high school, I have completed a dual credit program where I had completed my level 1. I know there is a lot of money that can be made in this trade but honestly I’m not entirely fond of the rep the meat head rep this trade has. On top of that, based on my experience with working with other some of the older electricians, they all seem to hate their lives. I started this trade as a COOP student, so really no time lost, and honestly I don’t wanna end up like them. They all just seem so miserable.

Anyways, I have been going through a bit of a career crisis. I’ve always had this floating thought to become a chef and to delve into culinary school but never full on committed. I’ve always loved to cook food, I love eating food, and overall I find it pretty cool to serve people food that they can love. If I were to pursue this path, I’d love to open up a restaurant where people would love to eat and you know just be that place that people think about when they want a good bite, yk like the type to earn a michelin star or to be on BlogTO’s top 10 best restaurants. However, I also love to work at a high-end fine dinning restaurant aswell.

Long story short, how’s the food scene in Toronto. I’ve read around a bit and heard it’s really not that great, so I figured that If were to pursue this(to make a decent living at least), I’d definitely need to move to the states. For the older electricians out there, do you think I’d be making a mistake by switching? Is it really that miserable? I know that you can make upwards of $80k CAD / Year, which sounds amazing but if it’s really that bad, I don’t know if I should pursue. For the chefs, I’ve heard a lot of mixed opinions about the industry - “if you like cooking, don’t get into it”. I know the pay isn’t really that great sitting around ($50k - $60k / year), nor the hours, added with the toxic and stressful environment.

1lc1qoi,Potential PhD (CS) in a lab that feels like it’s going nowhere or starting over…,"I'm a first year Computer Science PhD (PhD, Computer Science, United States) at a US R1, not a PhD candidate yet.
The Uni is pretty great, the place is beautiful as well, but there's something about this whole program that just genuinely feels like a bad fit for me, To be clear, I come from a different undergrad field so the language here, the goals in this department are quite different from what I'm used to.
My lab is at an odd state, we're probably the only lab that hasn't really gotten a grant yet, and the PI has made it really clear to me specifically that they are tight on funding and has even talked to me about how much it costs to have me in front of other people, I've been told this multiple times, it's not comfortable. I think the most significant part here is that I genuinely don't fit in with my current lab and I can't imagine being with them for 5 more years.
Now it's summer, I have no concrete research direction, and I don't feel very confident about the upcoming candidacy exam in the fall, and I am cautious about spending more time/hope on something that doesn't align with me. I really do want to do a PhD, but my PI is someone who wants results quickly, Even before I'd arrived here, like BEFORE I stepped foot in the US, while I was spending the ONLY 3 month period most people get after graduation where they're totally free, he'd been asking me for progress!!! I understand this haste because he's only recently become a professor, but this was just ridiculous and I seriously think I should've realised this earlier itself. personally, I have found better mentors with whom my working style has gelled better with.
which brings me to my other option. During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to intern under a researcher in Switzerland, the Uni is not too famous but does have a better ranking than my current place, and it's in the bio-medical field which is again, quite different from my undergrad, but more importantly, looking back, I found my advisor over there to be a great mentor, even though it was only 2.5 months, we actually managed to finish a project from start to finish very smoothly, and the whole experience was really lively, We had really nice discussions, I (think) had fitted in really well with the rest of the group, lots of dinners and outings, even went to a concert lol.
I mean sometimes it really seems like a no-brainer, I'll be getting my masters in a year here and the Swiss group actually has a pretty big grant right now, and becoming a PhD candidate there requires no letters of recommendation so that's a relief, I need to have research proposal and the PI decides whether I'm in or not, plus he only has 1 PhD student at the moment so he's probably got the capability to have me and he did tell me that he'd love to have me as his PhD student. The stipend there is also really nice (50k) although with higher costs, But this is also important, I've already lived there so I know how to adjust to that place, AND it's much more closer to my home country which makes things so much more simpler.
What's more, I'd recently gotten an abstract presented at the best conference in that field, so I think I'm quite tuned for it.
What is certain is that I don't see a future for myself in my current department, If the work itself doesn't align with me I don't see a clear path.

I'm also in a long distance relationship with my fiancée and she's planning to move to Europe in about 2 years, so I don't have any long-term vision to stay in the US, I could however, wrap up this PhD and move to Europe in-lieu of an American PhD's apparent ""higher worth"" (I really don't believe this, I think it's really about my connections that will help me with my career)

But I am wondering if, amidst all this thought, I'm simply in an echo chamber and I don't know what I'm doing. I've always heard that an American PhD is more prestigious than a European PhD, Hell, The people who are in my lab are really competent and those who have previously been in this department have been extremely successful in their field, So I need a good op here.
Now even if I quit, I'll have to master out and begin the whole process right now, But my dilemma is how do I even go about doing this? I've never heard of anyone with a situation like mine and quitting grad school is really taboo here.
The thing is, All this talk and politics about funding has made me feel extremely guilty about working and getting a stipend while not really contributing much, About not having a paper yet, or being very useful tbh, although other people in my department have much more experience than me, either through a masters or researcher jobs. To the point where I would find it more comfortable if I was somehow ""let-go"" and be allowed to finish my masters even if it meant I had to pay! I mean I really want to work on something else, I'm already working on a journal paper in another field.
But I don't want to do anything stupid and rash which will cause me regret.

TL;DR
The paths before me are:

1. suffering through a gruelling PhD at a (supposedly) prestigious place in a (used to be) hot field with a (not so charming) lab
2. suffering through a gruelling PhD at a nice place in a not-so-hot field with a fitting lab environment
3. Search for other PhD's in Europe and use the remaining time I have (1 year) to find professors and do relevant work with them for this

1lc0mlz,Should I buy into a struggling agency or move on to a higher-paying corporate job?,"I’ve been with a small advertising agency for 12 years, serving as Director of the Development Department for the past 6. The agency’s been around for about 25 years, and I genuinely enjoy the people I work with – and most of the clients.

Historically, everyone received raises on the same day each year. That practice has fizzled, but I’ve still gotten modest raises annually. Over the past 3 years, I’ve created detailed internal improvement plans to make the company more efficient, profitable, and employee-focused. The owner liked the ideas—but hasn’t implemented most due to a lack of focus and follow-through.

Now, the owner is floating the idea of a partner buy-in for senior team members, which I'd be the first. It’d likely be around 10% ownership, and structured so that I wouldn't pay upfront—just reinvest my share of year-end earnings until the buy-in is covered. The catch is:

* The company’s profits have been weak for the past couple of years (good for buy-in / bad for future projections).
* There are serious red flags: an underperforming employee who’s been around for 3+ years but hasn’t been let go, no accountability on deadlines, and an owner who struggles with business development.
* If I joined as a minority partner, I’d likely be responsible for driving business growth without full authority to make needed changes or grow my department.

I’m concerned that I’ll end up sinking 5–7 years of hard work into this investment with no guaranteed return—and limited decision-making power. At the same time, I’m established here and have influence (though not control). On the flip side, I could likely move into a corporate role at a much larger company, take a short-term step down in title, and get a sizable pay bump and career stability.

Am I just wearing golden handcuffs? Should I gamble on a piece of the pie, or walk away and prioritize growth elsewhere?

Appreciate any thoughts from others who’ve been in similar spots—especially those who’ve faced the “partner buy-in” crossroads at smaller firms.",Ahybridslife4me,2,1.0,13,1749994947,2025-06-15 13:42:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lc0mlz/should_i_buy_into_a_struggling_agency_or_move_on/,6,2025

1lbzdsp,"27y female hopping on retail jobs? I don't enjoy it, not sure of what to do and can't afford paying for college.","If I could choose to work away from customers and just do my own thing all day long it would lower my stress levels and anxiety significantly.

 It's just the part of dealing with customer service I really don't like, specially at retail stores because a lot of people purposely look for reasons to act rude and you're forced to give them customer service (sometimes I'm the only one in the store so I also have to be the cashier and I don't like it because sometimes it ends up taking way longer than just checking someone out for a few seconds and they're gone and you won't see them ever again). 


I can't quit my current job because I have bills to pay and I can't study full-time. I live in north FL, I've been applying for a bunch of different job areas but I'm more than likely only going to get interviews for jobs that either involve retail or customer service because that's the only experience I have. I do not have anything other than high school completion. 

I always hear nursing gets well paid and this is what I'm thinking about but I'm going to have to apply for some sort of program so I can get ""free schooling"" or whatever it's called because there's no way I can pay for school since I don't have any extra money. 


Other than nursing I have no idea of any other area that I could easily get a job when I get certified. I hear realtors make a lot of bank here but it's more of a solo job where I'd have to work on my own and have my own business which are skills I'm not very great at specially if I don't have experience.

I'm better at being told to do a certain task than having to think of something on my own, I'm more task focused than ""people focused"". 

I even thought of modeling but I'd have to get in touch with agencies but so far I've only spoken with one and they want me to go through a course they offer but I have to pay them for the classes monthly for it until it's done.

I'm likely going to have to move because this city I'm at doesn't have many opportunities for modeling but I'm only here because rent is the lowest in the area. I'm also pretty sure it's not a consistent income which is what I really need right now.


Other than that I'm somewhat familiar with working with computers and I like cars but have no experience working with anything to do with cars. As long as I don't have to deal with rude people on the daily basis and be paid full-time and at least 18hr I'm happy, but of course I want something I can progressively make more or get promoted, retail definitely won't get me there.",Ok_State4416,3,0.7200000286102295,8,1749991212,2025-06-15 12:40:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lbzdsp/27y_female_hopping_on_retail_jobs_i_dont_enjoy_it/,6,2025
1lbyq0q,"Burnt out, but need advice.","So, i work in road side service company. for the most part there very huge in the US, many may know them. I was full time when i started and then went part time as i was quickly getting burnt out from the entitlement and people constantly screaming because they have to be a member to receive service. starting on the end of this month will be my 3rd year. i usually am always top performer.

So, i applied for Sup, and WorkForce management and did not get them. people who were there with the company less time then me got the Workforce Management position twice that i interview for them. And most of the management team are mostly women. So, i don't think i will get any lead/SUP position. they have programs in place that pushes for movement up in the company which i am in one of the programs that last 6 months. it helps work on self confidence, and give you info about each business line, and also does mock interviews for each business line and give you one on one feedback for the real thing. which i think is great. but i still don't feel confident enough that i would be able to move and my manager may just be gas lighting me as they just want to not cause any issues.

I recently did another interview a week ago and was suppose to hear back if i can switch departments and still didn't hear from the recruiter i had to email them and ask for update and they stated there still working on it. im not to confident on that either as how long it's taking and the people that interview me told me when training starts, and it getting close which is next month. My company also has a program that will pay for any certification or class we take i am thinking of taking my IT Certs and having them pay and then moving my career back to IT. i can't just deal with the back to back of people yelling at you and then yelling at you cause they don't know there own car or the street there on.

has anyone going this late into there role in 3 year and then decided u were burnt out and needed a change? i only really stayed because i like the co workers, and the money, but the customers are a pain.

1lbyi13,"Lost a Job offer after trying to negotiate, Feeling Crushed","Hi everyone,
I’m currently living abroad and putting a lot of effort into finding an opportunity to move back to Italy. So far, I’ve only received one serious offer: I liked the company, the role seemed a good fit, and the offer was solid, maybe not incredible, but definitely interesting.

When I received the offer, I asked for a small adjustment, first a review of the gross annual salary, then a contribution for fuel costs. For some context: I currently have a company car and fuel card as part of my benefits. In Italy, I wouldn’t have had the car, so I thought it was reasonable to at least ask for something to cover fuel expenses.

However, after my request, the company decided to withdraw the offer. Technically, the offer was still valid for few days, so this really left a bitter taste in my mouth.

To make things harder, there was a recruiter acting as an intermediary, which made the negotiation even more difficult. If I’d been able to speak directly with the company, maybe I would have understood how much flexibility there actually was and honestly, I might have just signed the initial offer as it was.

This whole situation is taking a big emotional toll on me. I feel guilty even for trying to negotiate I now see it as a mistake. Unfortunately, negotiating in Italy isn’t always seen in the best light. It can come across as ungrateful or pushy, even if you’re being polite and reasonable. That adds to the frustration, especially coming from a work culture abroad where negotiating is expected and often encouraged.

The thing is, I’m in a hurry to return to Italy: my family is there, and so is my girlfriend who’s waiting for me. And now I feel like I’ve let not only myself down, but also her.

All I wanted was the best possible compensation package, because I’m looking for stability. I don’t want to have to change jobs just to grow professionally.

What do you guys think? I haven’t been able to sleep for days because of how bad I feel. Have you ever been through something similar? How did you get through it?
Right now, my head keeps telling me I’ll never find another opportunity I actually like.

I’m not looking for judgment, i already have plenty of that in my own thoughts.

1lbxy24,Imposters Syndrome involving retail,"Hi! 

I recently just got promoted from part time Team Lead to a full time Store Lead after having so many people in the company vouch for me due to our store closing. However, I am switching to a much smaller store rather than staying at the same one, and it'd just be me overseeing the daily operations of said store. Specifically, things like seeing what departments sell well/are in the red, in charge of replying to emails/returning calls, having a checklist of things to talk to my boss about on a weekly check in basis, visualizing my store, talking to the contacts I was given to ensure there's a streamlined process for our customers/students involving textbooks, etc. I never had to do much as a Team Lead as it was a MUCH bigger store with 5 managers, and as a result I truly feel like I am suffering from Imposter's Syndrome. My new boss has already taken a liking to me and I feel like I am doing well for the most part, but it feels like I skipped steps to get to this position lol. I don't have a degree at the moment and I am in my early 20's, and most other people that I've met within the company are 5-10+ years older than I am and look very surprised to meet me sometimes.

1lbvk2i,help me please,"I am currently employed at a nonprofit organization making about 53k. the org’s grant funding has been a bit worrisome (we are in refugee support services)  but in spite of the uncertainty i’ve been paid every single pay period without fail and have no reason to believe that’ll change.

That being said, in an abundance of caution, I opened myself to recruitment and applied to a few jobs a couple months ago (at the height of the US federal grant debacle). my father-in-law flagged my resume to a his buddy at an emergency management state agency and i am now deep in the interview process for the role.

here’s the situation. i’m in my mid twenties, my fiance and I have a combined income of around 110k, we aren’t planning on having a kid anytime in the next 10 years. my current job is incredibly chill, has great work life balance, unlimited pto, fully employer covered health insurance, enables me to be able to do music stuff outside of work hours, is hybrid (3 days in the office), and is generally just low stakes low stress. my fiancee’s and my combined income puts food on the table and then some.

the role i am interviewing for pays around 75k, but it is essentially a crisis comms role, where i was basically told in the interview that i shouldn’t just “expect to have certain days (read: weekends) off” due to the nature of the organization (sharing critical information to the population during natural disasters, weather emergencies, etc). also, im getting married in november and wont have any pto to to take since they dont allow for pto within the first 6 months.

another consideration is that i really want to keep my family life and work life separate, and the fact that my father in law is a good friend of the director of the org im interviewing at stresses me out. don’t want the dynamics of my work life to reflect on me as the person marrying this man’s daughter, even though i know I’m a hard worker. its the classic “sh*tting where you eat” thing.

generally speaking, i highly value the time in my life not spent at work. my heart is in music and i value having the time outside of work to do that, since it’s not really one of those rare passions one can have with a degree of a definite and secure career path. i also value flexibility and general work life balance, which is not something the new role can offer. it was pitched to me in the interview as a very uncompromisingly busy and relentless degree of work to be done at all times (including nights weekends and holidays). i like knowing for certain that i can spend my evenings with my fiancee and our friends, or that on any given day i can chose to work from the cozy coffee shop down the street, sue me! anyways, i feel crazy for not really wanting to take the 20k pay raise, and my parents definitely think its a stupid decision, but my mom in law had even advised me against taking the job even before i interviewed, before i even had any concerns about it.

fwiw, i read on glassdoor that the turnover at the agency is pretty crazy high, considering both terminations and people quitting within 6 months of being hired.

anyway, idk what to do, I’m still uncertain. help me!

But job B had told me 2 weeks before job A, so i chose job B because i was scared i would be jobless (i did not know at the time i chose job B, that job A would want me).

🏘Job A (the one i did not choose) is a more niche job let's say. The salary was also better. They said i would get trained and thought the programme they worked with. Did not seem like a very hard job once being trained but i thought that there might be no opportunity to evolve if that makes sense. Like i thought that maybe at some point i would just get stuck.

🏗Job B (the one i chose) is a more general job where i thought i had lots of things to learn that would have also looked great in my CV if i ever decided to leave. They promised me that there would be someone more experienced which i could ask questions to. They promised i would get a working pc. The salary was lower than the one from job A, but the ""growth potential"" seemed bigger. 

So i started working at job B. The ""supervisor"" is only 1 year older than me and having some conversations i got to the conclusion that i might just know more things than him.

Post-COVID, worked at a district court, High Court and later at an arbitration law firm. 
Simultaneously started a real estate venture with my family (unregistered), where I handled the financials, legal work, and overall operations
Strong interest in personal finance and investing — I’ve also offered mutual fund consultancy to individuals

Now that I’m relocating, I’m trying to figure out my next steps. I want to pivot to a more globally flexible and location-independent career, which is why I’ve decided not to pursue law in Canada (given the time and regional limitations involved).

I’m currently considering:

MBA: I’m interested but unsure how much weight my diverse (and somewhat unconventional) work experience would carry in the Canadian/US post-MBA job market. I haven’t worked in large corporates or held conventional roles, so I’m wondering if that would be a barrier. 

CPA: Seems like a more direct pathway with clear credentialing and demand, especially given my finance background — but I’m not sure if it will open the kind of flexible/global opportunities especially as I’m looking for and I more interested in management roles instead of strictly technical accounting roles. 

Would love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar switch, especially women or immigrants. Is an MBA worth it at this stage, or would CPA be more strategic given my profile? Are there other pathways I should explore — like CFA, financial planning, business analytics, etc.? 

Edit: I might later in life want to move to UK or Europe if US visa issues persist. ",Litt-The-Hell-Up,1,1.0,0,1749971444,2025-06-15 07:10:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lbu9o8/career_advice_needed_mba_or_cpa_diverse/,6,2025

1lbsyyt,Difficulty in finding HR jobs and need suggestions for a long gap.,"Hi Guys, posting this on behalf of a friend.

So she has done engineering and MBA as well. Worked in 2016-18 in 2 different companies. She worked as HR. The experience is 1 year and she absconded the second one, she has the offer letter for second company but not the experience letter.

Currently she’s searching for a job and has gap of 8 years.
Gap reasons:
1. Her father has serious illness which led her to leave her job as she’s the only child.
2. It took her dad 2 years to recover.
3. Then covid hit and she could not find a job.
4. In 2022, her father lost vision in one eye and had to undergo a surgery which was not a success.
5. She couldn’t find a job so she started taking home tuitions.

Now as she’s searching for jobs she’s facing rejections solely on the basis of gap.
She is skilled but unable to get a job. Most probably because interviewers are not convinced about the gap and are not comfortable with it.

1. Please suggest ways to cover up this gap and how can she get a decent job as she’s in dire need of it.
2. Do you anyone with such long gap and still got the job? Please share it here and give me suggestions as to what can be done.
3. Also what can be done for the second job where she absconded? I know there will be BGV and without experience letter it will be difficult, also the team and manager might not be same after a these years.


She thinks that health reasons of family is not a good reason and not convincing enough.
She’s kind of slipping into depression. 
She’s currently searching for jobs in Bangalore.
So it will be a great help if you guys can help.

Thank you so much!",Madara__007,1,1.0,0,1749966285,2025-06-15 05:44:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lbsyyt/difficulty_in_finding_hr_jobs_and_need/,6,2025
1lbsgth,CFA or CFP for front office Sr Analyst looking to progress further up the ladder in the front office / client facing space,"Hi all, I am coming up on 23 years old and have been a Sr Analyst in the Front-Office of a tier one bank for about a year now. Looking to go for certification as opposed to the MBA but have been recommended both the CFP and the CFA by senior members of my company.

My understanding is the CFP is much wider in scope, but the CFA is much more detailed and challenging. I am looking to get an added cert to make myself stand out while also not brutalizing myself because this will be on top of the 50+ hours I work per week. My bank offers reimbursement for passed tests / classes only, so if I need to retake any of it I will be eating the cost.

1lbrjly,I hate my first job out of college. What should I do?,"
For context, I graduated this year with a Bachelor’s degree in CS. Towards the end of my degree I was already having some doubts about working in tech, but I decided to finish it out since I was already so close to graduating and still had some interest. Cut to now, and I’ve picked up a job as a Test Engineering Technician and I hate it. I’m trying to be realistic and understand that it’s my first job out of school, but I’ve had internships where the job and environment didn’t suck nearly as bad. When I got hired on, I was supposed to be working 4 days a week for 10 hours a day. Then, the first day they pulled the rug and said that I’ll be working 5 days a week for 10 hours. Now, they’re telling me it’s “obligated” that I work Monday-Saturday, 10 hours a day. Not to mention that I’m in a factory where it’s loud, some of the people are rude, everyone is too busy to actually train me, etc. I just can’t stand it and it makes me legitimately miserable. I have some other interviews in the process already and I’ve got money saved in case I just can’t take it anymore but I’m not sure how long I should hold out and am just seeking any sort of advice.

1lbqb0n,You Don't Need to Blow Up Your Whole Career,"Had a conversation with a friend last week who's been beating himself up because he's not getting the response he wants in his field. Dude's got 8 years of experience, knows his stuff inside and out, but feels like he's invisible.

Here's the thing that hit me while we were talking. He kept saying ""maybe I picked the wrong career"" or ""maybe I'm just not cut out for this."" But that's not it at all.

The guy's talented. He's solved real problems for real companies. But when he talks about what he does, it's like he's speaking a different language than what people actually need to hear.

We spend so much time trying to sound professional and impressive that we forget people just want to know if we can help them sleep better at night. They don't care about your methodology or your fancy certifications. They care about results.

Your resume might say ""data analysis and strategic consulting"" but what you really do is help people make decisions without second-guessing themselves for weeks. That's completely different.

Same skills, same experience, but now people actually get it.

Most of us are way closer to success than we think. We just need to stop hiding behind jargon and start talking like humans to other humans.

1lbpfk1,Need help deciding if i should get my masters!,"**Context:** I'm currently working at a public B2B SaaS company as a sales engineer making \~$200k. I'm very fortunate to have gotten here but feel like if I don't level up I'm going to be stuck as an IC for quite a long time. I have a background in IT and a little bit of Data Science (did a coding bootcamp a while back). I have 7 YOE and feel like the expensive masters programs won't give me the ROI since i am doing pretty well in my career already. I know i'll need to come in as an IC wherever and hope to move to leadership/strat within a few years. I feel like this masters will help in that but idk.

**Goals & Interests:** I want to move into more of a strategic role here in the next few years whether at my current company or elsewhere. If i stay put education-wise or just get some certifications like AWS I don't think it would move the needle all the much and would likely keep me in an individual contributor role. I don't want to be in a heavy coding role but rather apply my technical background to create business value ideally in ai/data strategy (I used to work at an ai tech startup).

**Programs:** I'm looking at BU Masters in Applied Business Analytics, USD Masters in Applied AI, and a few other similar schools that are under $30k total cost and can be done part time while I work my current job.

**Ask**: Is it worth it to get a masters at a program like these? Will it help tech companies see that I can be in a strategic position i.e. Head of...? Are there other programs I should consider? Even if i go for ""personal growth"" will a masters be beneficial in the long run?

1lbozm0,Leaving management for a clinical role — will it hurt my career?,"Looking for some advice.

I work in the healthcare industry on the operations side now, but I started out clinically and later earned a business degree to move into leadership. I really liked my last admin role—great team, good environment—but the pay wasn’t sustainable.

About a year ago, I took a higher-paying job that I’ve come to hate. I report directly to C-Suite, and the experience has completely tanked my confidence. The culture is rough, and I’m constantly second-guessing myself.

There’s a clinical role available within the company that I’m confident I could move into if I wanted. The pay would be about the same (maybe a bit more), and while it’s a shift from what I’ve been doing, I’m seriously considering it just to get out of the toxic situation.

My hesitation is how this move might look on my resume. Would stepping back into a clinical role after being in management raise red flags later if I want to pursue another admin role?

Should I ride this out while looking for something better in ops, or is it okay to take a step sideways (or backwards, depending on how it’s seen) and get out of a bad situation?

I have done well and surpassed many goals, been trusted with more tasks, and really grown in the role I feel like along with personal growth. I got this position a few months out of college so it’s my first professional job, and I’m barely getting by financially despite a slight raise.

The main issues have been the social dynamics at work. I have some coworkers who really don’t like me and make it apparent. I had one coworker attack my character this week for a respectful disagreement on how something should be done and tell me that other people talk about me too. Also, not too long ago I had a coworker yell at me and go around telling everyone they don’t like me when we were working on a task together. The coworkers who don’t like me are cliqued up and they are older and have been there longer so I feel powerless. Lately it’s felt like I’m walking on eggshells every day and no matter what I say or do it will be perceived negatively. 

The other part of the job that’s stressful is the constantly changing expectations without clear communication. I’ve been crying almost daily for months and I’m at a really low point mentally. I feel stuck and keep questioning things like if I’m a bad person or if I’m worthy of better. I want to try to make this work, potentially talk to management about these things but I’m not sure how to bring it up. A large part of me is feeling like it would be best to start fresh somewhere else. I’m not feeling hopeful things will get better there, is there anything I could try?

1lbmdhr,Career Advice Needed: Pivoting Back to Data Science After Computer Vision Burnout,"

During my Bachelor's, I set my sights on becoming a Data Scientist. I invested a lot of time learning Python, and R, and working on data analytics projects. After my fifth semester, I landed a few internships, which eventually led to a full-time Data Scientist role at a SaaS startup after graduation. There, I built data pipelines, dashboards, and analytics models to predict trends, allocate resources, and support business decisions. I loved the work, especially collaborating with different teams and seeing my work directly influence company decisions.

My CEO was pleased with my contributions and brought me on as a consultant for his EdTech company as well. I built dashboards and reports using RShiny, Looker Studio, and PowerBI, depending on the project. I even helped analyze and monitor the launch of a new product, building KPIs for client onboarding. The role offered good pay, valuable learning, and a great work-life balance.

However, I wanted to do a Master's, so after 2.5 years of working, I moved to Germany for my Master’s. I secured an internship in computer vision, where I developed a face detection & recognition system for surveillance. Later, I landed another computer vision internship at a Health tech startup, working on a complex edge case with tight resource constraints project. Despite months of research, I struggled to find a viable solution and eventually continued the project as my Master’s thesis. After 3.5 months, I’ve found a partial solution, but it’s still far from ideal with 2.5 months left.

This experience made me realise that computer vision might not be for me. The constant research, rapid developments, and slow progress have been exhausting and frustrating. I don't enjoy repeatedly saying, ""I’m still working on it"" with little to show, even if my supervisor is understanding, it feels personally discouraging.

Now, with only a few months left until graduation, I’m trying to figure out my next step. I’m leaning towards returning to Data Analytics or Data Science, where I have prior experience and where job opportunities seem broader compared to niche CV roles. That said, I’m still uncertain which domain within data science to focus on. My past experience spans ridesharing, NGOs, SaaS, and EdTech, but I feel I haven’t developed deep expertise in any one sector.

If I stay in data science, I want to fully commit for the next 5+ years. I'm also considering pivoting into the finance sector for Data Science/Analytics roles — but I'm unsure where to focus my efforts given my mixed background.

Any advice or perspective would be really appreciated.

1lbkwox,Confused about my options after graduation.,"Greetings everyone, hope you're all doing well. I expect to graduate with a honours in Economics next year, while I do really enjoy my degree because of various reasons, the quant part of it makes it a slight bore for me( I know I know how vital maths is to this degree). 

Having said that, I'm super confused as to what I should do next, if I do a ma/msc in economics ill have to do more of the quantitative bits, the other options in masters like development, public economics would not necessarily leave me as secure job wise as compared to if ive got more maths stuff in my degree, or maybe im wrong about this. 

I really like the creative side of things, so stuff like brand strategy/growth strategy/brand marketing etc sound a lot of fun to me as I believe id do well in something like this. Other than this I could do a masters in some business major, but I fear most of them are a waste (like marketing, IB) especially considering id be competing in a foreign economy and competing with all the immigrants aswell as the locals, i could be wrong about this aswell. I like business analytics too, but I fear that's kind of saturated now aswell.

Should I try developing an interest in thw quant side of things, and do a msc/ma in economics (ideally from a foreign uni) or i do a shift to some other things like business etc? 

Id love to get suggestions and ideas.

I have had a couple jobs in my career but I’m still very early on in my career considering those jobs have been seasonal or temporary / internships mostly but they were big name companies for a couple of them. the most recent one I had laid me off and I had to unfortunately move back to my hometown which is another huge trigger for me. I’m very grateful I can live with my parents and they can financially support me as I find a new role, but it’s been months now and this job market is very rough- so I am thinking maybe I need to go back to school (like grad school) I finished undergrad to get a degree in something (short term schooling) else (not sure what) that could ensure me a job like phlebotomy for example. 

I am very careful with who is in my circle now, but it does make it hard for me to meet new people/socialize when I don’t have a solid job and hate where I live. I just feel like I’m stuck and don’t have direction in my life, and the years are just passing me by without me having accomplished more even though I am constantly trying to find a job for one. 

I know that my mood would improve if I moved out of my hometown (and honestly house because my parents and I fight often) + find a job away from here but I’m not securing as many interviews as I’d like + the ones I do ended up saying they decided to hire internally instead so that wasted my time as well.

1lbhgxa,How to stand out and succeed with an underperforming team?,"Took a new role, where most of my team is weak. I have no one to delegate to, so I ended up doing a lot of work myself. So instead of being a strategic executive I ended up being a contributor and lost some points with management in the process.

How was I supposed to handle all this differently? I came into numerous deadlines and did what I had to, to get through them, but seems like my reputation suffered in the process. 

Is it only possible to be an executive if you have a team to delegate to?

I've passed 12th this year from science because i genuinely had intrest in science, i also attempted neet as i had a dream of becoming master in surgery which required mbbs but I couldn't qualify neet, i also got very less percentage in boards as i was not focusing on it. 

now i dont see my future in science stream or any such degree possible, i want to run bussiness that im already working on and i have many future plans and visions in entrepreneurship but my parents wants me to pursue pharmacy or homeopathy which i genuinely hate because they have lots of hard study that is like hell for me and i don't have any intrest in them because they will take all my time and Will divert me from my bussinesses.

im constantly telling them to let me pursue BBA from physics wallah IOI scholarship ( i know the degeee don't holds much value ) but atleast it aligns with bussiness that genuinely interests me and I'll love studying it, but as you parents are just not even listening to me because they think im a loser now because of my 12th and they wont even listen to my thoughts now.



i really dont want to pursue homeopathy or Pharma

1lbguia,Is this abnormal or am I just taking things too seriously:,"Stats: 24M, BSc in mechanical engineering. Employed by a large chemical manufacturer. Salary is 87k, MCOL area. Been here for 1.5years. 

I am the lead process/production engineer for a chemical unit. When I started, there was another engineer who trained me and worked together with me. He has since moved to another site, and the company made the decision to not backfill his role. 

While this job has certainly improved my self-reliance and confidence in decision making, it is also taking a toll on my mental health. 

I am 24/7 on call for technical problems in the unit. There are other folks who are also on call, but they are not equivalent roles to me. I am called for any more technical issues, which arise frequently. It’s not abnormal for me to have 3+ nights a week where I’m woken up by a phone call and need to jump online to figure something out, sometimes multiple times in a night. I am not OT eligible. 

The unit I’m in charge of has a high number of reliability issues, most of which are chronic equipment design problems that are not easily fixable without the company writing a large check. The end result is I am tasked with a significant amount of small improvement tasks to try and combat said issues. A lot of it is process automation based, which was not something I had experience with prior to coming to this job. This is on top of normal day to day tasks. 

The reason I’m writing this post now is that the last month it has become significantly worse. The unit is undergoing a large ($7MM) capital project to replace a packaging line. Explaining technicalities is challenging in a Reddit post, but the project requires a large amount of coordination between many different work groups. I have been working hard to keep things pulled together, but I have very little support from my own work group. A lot of aloofness and lack of accountability. 

The combination of all of the above has led me to become incredibly anxious all of the time, even outside of work. I do my best to commit to self care (seeing friends, exercise, etc) but I find it challenging to stop thinking about work, as there is always some new issue that I am responsible for. 

This past weekend, I took half of Thursday and Friday off for a family event in my hometown. Within 3 hours of leaving on Thursday, I had received multiple texts and phone calls about new issues that had arisen, even though I communicated to the group in advance that I was going on a short vacation. 

I’m making this post largely in order to hear feedback on if this is normal and to be expected in this industry and I just need to cope, or if something is truly wrong here. 

TLDR: overworked, lots of off-hours phone calls. Taking a toll on my mental, need feedback. Thanks. ",BasketExtreme,3,0.800000011920929,12,1749929117,2025-06-14 19:25:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lbguia/is_this_abnormal_or_am_i_just_taking_things_too/,6,2025
1lbgu23,Got a full-time offer after 2+ years of job hunting but the pay is low. Worth it for the stability or should I hold out?,"Hi Reddit, I’m looking for some input on a career decision that I’m struggling with.

**TLDR:**42M with PMP and eight years of experience managing MarCom and AI projects. I just got a full-time Project Coordinator offer after over two years of job hunting. Great team, but compensation is well below market. Should I accept for the stability or hold out?

42M living in a HCOL in Canada. Grew up here, graduated from the local Uni but spent much of my career abroad. My background is non-linear. I’ve worked in education, customer service, logistics and technical writing before moving into project management. I’ve spent eight years managing marketing communications and AI projects

I earned my PMP before returning to Canada a few years ago, thinking it would help with my job search, but it didn't quite play out that way. 

After many months and hundreds of applications, I landed a remote contract PM job, project based, no benefits, but market rate. Unfortunately the client ended that project abruptly. While I was continuously job hunting, I did return to the same company twice for other project work over the next year, but all were temporary with the last project ending last Dec.

I’ve applied to hundreds of PM/PC and MarCom related jobs, revamped my resume several times, networked, reached out to recruiters, and volunteered. I’ve made it to a few second and final round interviews, but until now, no permanent offers.

Today, I received a full-time offer at a small boutique agency. Their offer is:

* The title is Project Coordinator, which I’m okay with  
* The role is full-time with benefits  
* Hybrid, one or two days in the office. Easy commute  
* Great team, company mission and vision  

But here’s my problem:

* The salary is low. Even with the performance-based bonus, it’s about 40% less than what I made in the contract roles  
* From my research on 4 or 5 different sources, the compensation is below the average median salary for Project Coordinators in my city  
* The vacation policy is limited. Ten days total, and the company is closed 1 week in the winter and 1 week in the summer and those 2 weeks count as paid vacation days. So basically I don’t get to choose when to use my vacation days  

I wasn’t given the full compensation details until today. They did tell me there would be a base salary + performance based bonus. I was still interested after they told me the base salary because they didn’t say how much the bonus was. Once I saw the total package today, I was disappointed.

I’m not financially desperate. I have a roof over my head and some savings, but after two and a half years of rejections (has anyone else also gotten auto-rejection emails sent to you in the middle of the night?), it has definitely shattered my confidence. I’ve started over a few times before in my life because I wanted to try new industries and different jobs and I was okay doing that when I was younger. But now, I’m wondering whether this will move my career forward or hold it back. I am planning to negotiate, but if they won’t meet at least the local median, I’m unsure what to do.

**Looking for some advice on:**

1. Is accepting a low-paying Project Coordinator role at 42 likely to hurt my long-term career prospects more than help?  
2. How can I approach negotiating this offer without burning any bridges?  

Any advice would be appreciated. TIA

They offered me a position but I decided to turn it down because of the shift times. I have a fucked up sleeping pattern anyway I don’t go to sleep till like 6am most days and I wanted to fix it. 
I didn’t know if this would interfere with training my clients as well if my sleep pattern was destroyed 
I now regret declining this cos I don’t have many clients at the moment and the money was quite good and I’m panicking over this cos I don’t think I’ll have enough money

1lbfqyw,GM is asking if I want his position. I'm conflicted.,"I've been working at my place for 2+ years now. Worked my way from an entry position and became a manager a little after he became our new GM. Me and my GM have been very tight and I've basically been the assistant GM here with how much responsibility I take on here compared to our other manager. Well, my GM is basically exhausted with the job and needs to move on. He hasn't announced it yet, but he was bringing it up because he wanted to know if he should throw my name out there when he resigns.

This is a very tough call for me. Things have been a mess lately at my job for me. We're understaffed, and not offering pay rates that make people want to work here either, so it's been an extra load on all of us managers to pick up the slack AND also try and get our standard manager tasks done as well. 

When my GM brought it up, he said, ""if you want to have a life don't take this job"" and that's been also a big factor in how I feel here. I was close with our other GM prior and she seemed exhausted and fed up just like him. Without getting too into it, I got a lot of stuff going on outside of work at the moment. It makes me feel like I'm not reliable and flexible enough to take on such a massive responsibility. If I had a bit more faith in corporate, I might believe they're not gonna leave me helpless here. I'm already concerned that they're gonna take their sweet time getting us a GM replacement anyways. 

I don't know. I'm not sure what the smartest choice is here. I like it here, despite the issues. I like the staff. On some level, I think the staff overall would feel better if it was someone they liked taking over the spot and not some new person, but that can't ultimately be a deciding factor here.

1lbfppo,Choosing Between Two Education Paths: Project Management A.A.S. vs. B.S. in Industrial Technology,"I am 19 and will soon graduate with an A.A.S. in Welding Technology. I started in high school and fell in love with it, so I continued it through my high school graduation at my local community college. Last year at this time, I was hired as a stainless steel fabricator at a small welding shop (about 20 people), and a few months ago, I realized my body (mostly my lungs) didn't like welding, even though I thoroughly enjoyed it. Last week, the owner moved me to the front office so I can modernize the way we do CAD for our laser cutter using SolidWorks, as I'm 'young and motivated' with a knack for CAD-related tasks. I enjoy this industry a lot, and I don't see myself moving very far outside of it, since there are a lot of shops like this nearby, and I live near a pharmaceutical plant hotspot (RTP). I won't have any issues finding another place if I don't like working here anymore. While talking to the owner about my future aspirations and education, he told me that if I want, once I have a year or two of experience using SolidWorks and learning this side of fabrication, he will take me to job sites so I can shadow and learn project management with him. He wants to move more into a business development position to grow the company, and plans on putting me in his spot once I get enough experience.

  
This is great, and I'm in a very good spot for a career; however, I am very stubborn about my education, and I don't want to leave Welding Technology to be the only postsecondary education I have. At my local community college, there is a fully online Associate's Degree for project management, but it's more generalized and doesn't go into any useful detail about my industry. With my WT A.A.S., I have the option to transfer to ECU and spend 2 years to get a B.S. in Industrial Technology (BSIT) online, which is more related to this industry, but focuses more on industrial manufacturing administration and only lightly covers project management. The A.A.S. is about three times cheaper than the B.S., and I plan on paying out of pocket since I live at home and make decent money.

  
The third angle to this situation is that I'm not 100% sure if I want to do project management as a career just yet. It seems interesting, and it is an amalgamation of what I enjoy most (building things, creativity, technology, and traveling), but it's also a career I had never thought about choosing until a few months ago, whereas CAD and welding have been long-time interests of mine. I don't have much time to decide since I am graduating soon, and if I take any time off from school, I know I won't go back. The BSIT is a much broader degree within my industry, so I can always choose a different type of position to make a career out of, but the A.A.S. dives deeper into project management while being much, much cheaper.

**TL;DR:**  
I’m 19, finishing an A.A.S. in Welding Technology. I had to leave welding due to health issues, but moved into a CAD role using SolidWorks at my fabrication shop. The owner wants to mentor me into a project management role long-term.

I'm torn between two education options:

* A.A.S. in Project Management (cheaper, job-specific)
* B.S. in Industrial Technology (more expensive, broader, more flexible)

Not fully sure if project management is the right long-term fit, but it aligns with what I enjoy. **How should I navigate this fork in the road? Is there another A.A.S.

1lbf7ty,Need perspective on whether I should take this job offer or stay put,"Hey folks,

I’m at a bit of a crossroads and could use some perspective.

I’ve been wanting to move out of my current job for a while now, mostly because I haven’t been enjoying the kind of work I’ve been staffed on recently and I don’t particularly get along with my manager. That said, my overall experience at the company has been quite positive: I’ve learned a lot, had great exposure, and met some genuinely amazing people here.

Most of my close friends at work have moved on in the past few months, and I guess that added to the feeling of wanting something new. I recently got an offer from a smaller firm. It’s not a bad role, I’d get more responsibility, but the compensation is basically the same as what I’d be getting in my next role here anyway (due 6 months from now). On top of that, it’s 5 days WFO, and I’d need to relocate to a more expensive part of the city to make the commute feasible.

At my current job, I have a hybrid setup, and I’ve built a good rhythm. I also know how to navigate the system, which helps. In the coming months, my role here is likely to get more challenging and visible with more erratic hours which could be a good or bad thing. 

The bigger picture: I’m planning to pursue an MBA in the near future, so I’m not sure if this move (and the associated upheaval) makes sense at this point. It feels like I’d be trading comfort and familiarity for change that might not materially benefit me long-term.

I'm 21y from Brazil, i'm one ex it student but i just found out that my actual career desire is the medicine.

I'm facing one real trouble on choosing university and that kind of thing. As you know, medicine in Brazil can be pretty expensive, with very little options of affordable courses across the country.

Many brazilians go to neighbors countries in latam for studying medicine, and many go without know any spanish and can do well in university, because the languages are pretty similar.

I'm facing a huge challenge because i think that italian could be a little bit (if not a lot harder) harder, and i heared a lot saying that the educational system in italy is heavily intense and really exigent.

I'm afraid on that journey because i would have to dedicate one exclusive year just to learn italian so i could begin my course, and i definetly don't know what to expect about the educational system and the possible overload?

In my place what would you do guys? Goes just through the easiest way, that would be studying in latam, with the language (spanish) being relatively quite easy and with a lot of sucesfull examples, or try to do different and go for italy, even with everything being unknown?

I'm quite stressed with all of that. But you guys know that the italy degree is automatically acknowledged in the whole EU, what would mean a lot for immigration in the future.

1lbd4e2,MSCS: Need Brutally Honest Opinion,"Hey guys, here’s my situation. I’m a full stack software engineer at a midsize non-tech company (but still well known) with 4.5 YOE (1.5 YOE in data analysis before that, so I guess 6 YOE total). I’ve been cold applying for remote software engineering roles but I’m not really getting any bites. I know the remote market is insanely competitive right now, but I’d really like one and I’m only considering switching roles if the new one is remote.

For some more background, I have an unrelated bachelors from an Ivy League school. I have a feeling that this is one of the main reasons I’m not getting much traction - I’m probably being filtered out immediately at a lot of places for not having a CS degree, especially in this market. I was getting a good chunk more interviews 2-3 years ago.

Lately, I’ve been contemplating doing a MSCS to make up for that shortcoming. Last year, I got accepted into GT OMSCS but I decided to not attend after thinking heavily about the time commitment. It would’ve taken me about 3 years and I would’ve completely had to sacrifice my quality of life due to the programs rigor. I have a wife and now a baby on the way, and my wife and I are ready to expand our family even further in the short term future, so I just didn’t think it was worth the sacrifice. Plus, now it’s been a year so my offer of admission is no longer valid anyway.

Here’s the thing. WGU just came out with an MSCS that I think I can get done in 6 months, if not a year. That time horizon and day-to-day commitment is a lot more palatable to be honest. Also, my employer is willing to pay for it 100%.

All that said, do you think it’s worth it for me to do the WGU MSCS so that I can meet the CS degree requirement at a lot of places/avoid getting filtered out early in the process? The way that I’m thinking about it is that I can always take it off my resume if I feel it’s causing a negative impact on my profile. What do you guys think? Would it be beneficial to my profile or make it worse? At this point, it’s either WGU MSCS or nothing - I’m just at a point in my life where I’m done with higher education otherwise and want to focus on life itself, so I’m not considering any other masters programs.

I do have 3 YOE working remotely due to COVID and I’ve reflected that on my resume, plus some promotions, so I don’t think it’s a track record issue.",YMMVwithme,2,0.7599999904632568,2,1749919512,2025-06-14 16:45:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lbd4e2/mscs_need_brutally_honest_opinion/,6,2025

1lbc84d,Career help,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads in choosing my first degree. I was initially considering medicine, but after doing extensive research and speaking with professionals in the field, I’ve decided to explore other options. Right now, I’m looking into dentistry or pharmacy, as I’m passionate about healthcare and truly see myself building a future in it.

That being said, I’m also taking into consideration the local job market and how competitive it can be to find employment, especially in healthcare.

So I’d love some insight:
	•	Are dentistry or pharmacy lucrative and stable career options?
	•	What’s the job market like for new graduates?
	•	Are these degrees harder to get into than medicine?
	•	Would you recommend either field to someone who values work-life balance?
	•	Is financial freedom achievable before 15+ years of experience?
	•	What’s the typical lifestyle/hours/demand like in these careers?

I’m also open to furthering my studies if that improves my opportunities or earning potential.

At times, I’ve even considered switching paths entirely and going into business, since the job outlook for science degrees seems so uncertain here. But I keep being drawn back to health care.

1lbbxaq,Where should I begin if I want to switch careers into cybersecurity but don’t have much computer experience?,"Hey everyone,

I could really use some help and guidance right now.

I’m a U.S. Air Force veteran, currently still serving in the National Guard. I initially joined the military for the educational benefits, but over time I ended up taking a full-time job at a correctional facility. Honestly, working in a prison has taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel like I’m stuck in a dead-end career.

I don’t want to leave the military because the benefits are incredibly important for me and my family. But I finally decided it’s time to go back to school and take control of my future-I’ve started taking a few classes again and am trying to figure out the best direction to go.

My college offers Computer Science and Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics. I’m leaning heavily toward Cybersecurity because it feels more aligned with my background and interests- but the truth is, I’m not very computer savvy and I feel totally lost on where to start.

If anyone can share beginner-friendly resources, free courses, or even just solid advice on how to start building basic tech and cybersecurity skills, I’d really appreciate it. Even better if you can drop some links. I want to do this right and build a better future for myself and my family, but I just need a little push in the right direction.

I’ve recently quit my job after 3 years of working in a core engineering R&D role. I felt stagnant, with little to no alignment to what I actually wanted to do long-term (leaning more towards management/strategy/product-oriented roles).

Now I’m at a crossroads:
	1.	Option 1: I have an admit for the Master’s in Engineering Management (MEM) program at Tufts University, USA. It’s a 1.5-year course focused on technical + managerial skills.
	2.	Option 2: Stay back in India, prepare for CAT/XAT and other MBA entrance exams (aiming for Tier 1 or 2 colleges), and look for a new job or Internship's (relevant to the roles I'm looking for) on the side to stay financially afloat and gain exposure.

I’m 24,

What's the best route at this point?

Any insights would be hugely appreciated!

After an exhausting 8-month job hunt, I finally landed my first role as a Web Developer Trainee at a small XYZ company this month! While I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity, I’ve noticed two things:  
1. The team is **very small (only 6 employees total)**, with no other juniors/trainees.  
2. The culture is **extremely quiet/low-interaction** – minimal chatting, meetings, or collaboration.  

As my first job, I’m anxious about how to grow professionally here. I don’t want to seem needy, but I also don’t want to stagnate. Has anyone been in a similar situation?  

**My key questions:**  
- How can I proactively learn in an environment with little mentorship/spontaneous interaction?  
- Are there unique growth opportunities in tiny companies that I might be overlooking?  
- Should I focus more on self-learning (courses, projects) while treating this as a resume booster?  
- How do I politely ask for feedback/guidance without disrupting their workflow?

I am looking for a career advice on what to do next — I’ve had 4 years of IT experience from support analyst role to project/business analyst role but still no undergrad degree. I have bad credit score (500+), fafsa only gave me $2k for this year, no money saved up(helping parents[both in their 70s - working but slowly deteriorating] pay parents mortgage, no car loans, I live very cheap, no job. 

College is just so damn expensive — done with community college but i still need to get my bachelor’s degree for consulting.

I would like to join USAF for GI Bill, VA loan, and 100% healthcare insurance. And my plan is to join 4 years active and then Finish my degree(I already have 58 college credits[once I go to basic training + 30 college credits] then the rest of the credits will be taken while on deployment[2-3 classes per sem]) and then go into technology solutions consulting(data-warehouse)  after then become a pre-sales solutions architect(Databricks/AWS/Snowflake) 

Or 

PATH B 

Loan using parents(but I really feel bad that they are already old) credit then finish college and work part time then get my connections at consulting(Capgemini, Cognizant, IBM) then pivot to Tech sales. While staying home. But will be in debt so bad and who knows what will the economy be in this age — AI wont disrupt consulting but economy might crash that even nurses, doctors, blue collar will be out of jobs.

1lb95ze,My boss fired me over text. Help me get my job back.,"I just started my first position in public accounting at a small firm about 11 months ago. Last month a grandparent went severely ill and I have been out of work since then taking care of them and taking them to hospital visits because the only family members we have are each other (my immediate family all moved states away.)

I had enough savings to last me until about now and I just wanted to make sure they were able to look after themselves before I went back to work. I feel horrible because I prioritized my family and my own mental health over this entry level job. 

The text from my boss reads as:

“After much thought, I believe that we must terminate our work relationship. After reviewing your progress in (the audit I had to leave in the middle of) I think we need to move forward in another direction. We thank you for your time and assistance, but we need someone that will be available and growing in their knowledge and ability to learn and master new tasks. Thank you for your assistance over the past year and I wish you well moving forward in your career.“

I wasn’t the perfect employee (I was late by a few minutes here and there) but at this time the 3 original staff accountants that trained me have all quit so it was just me, a new hire of 4 months, and two interns that started last week. 

Admittedly, although I communicated everyday of if I was coming back that day or not, it was over text and I think the you’re fired text matches that energy and it is my boss’s way of saying fuck you too. 

At around the 2nd week into my absence, I completed a job training course they signed us up for and he was receptive and understanding to me having to take It virtually. It seemed like this was me absolutely verifying that I wasn’t just bullshitting him and leading them on or “quiet quitting”. 

They asked me to come back for my last check and I don’t know if I should call right now or just wait till Monday with a plan to beg for my job back and spill the details on why I felt the need to prioritize my grandparent most likely at the tail end of their life for what I feel is a blip of time in the business world. 

I understand completely that this is a fireable offense any day of the week, but what are the odds of changing my boss’s mind and what would you guys do in this situation.

Backstory: 2023 Management Information Systems graduate with a focus on Technology and Management. Post graduation I didn’t have anything lined up, so during the summer I worked as a bag boy at a local golf course, then eventually went back to a broker I interned for to work as an office assistant part time all while I continued to job search. Countless applications sent and a handful of job interviews that didn’t go well I was losing my mind until I somehow landed a project management job starting at 75k in May of 2024, which was a little over a year since I had graduated.

Fast forward to now, next month will mark a year at my first ‘big boy’ job and I am happy to say that everything has gone super well. I walked into this job with absolutely no skills in the field/industry and have grown into a respectable employee. I can’t say I look forward to coming into work because work is work, but I do enjoy it and the time flies on most days. Lots of positives about the job including a work from home day, great boss, great coworkers, and good benefits. I have no plans of leaving anytime in the near future and can see myself being here atleast a few more years, but I do feel as though I am gaining more leverage in the market with experience under my belt.

Obviously everyone wants to get paid more, but at what point in my career do I try to get promoted, or look elsewhere? I do think my pay is fair since I am still relatively very new and they took a chance on hiring me because they saw potential, but the more time that goes by I seem to be picking up more responsibilities which should translate to higher pay. One thing to note is that there is no career ladder at my facility, so the next step up isn’t that clear.

1lb89b6,Start building a music career on the side at 34yo?,"Hi everyone,

first off, apologies for 1) The long post and 2) the fact that I am using a throwaway account, but I am about to share something personal and I don't want it linked to my main account.

I am a 34yo man, from some country in Europe. I was born in a small town in the middle of nowhere, without almost any cultural stimuli. I have a decent career, got 2 masters degrees and overall I am doing well in life, much better than most people my age in my country. Especially considering the fact that I grew up poor.

When I was a teenager I started to play the guitar, and it was love at first sight. It didn't take me long to realize that in life, I wanted to become a professional musician. I became good really fast. However, my parent's did not support me in my choice.

When I was 14, my dad lost his job, and never got another one back. He opened a small business, which went terribly badly, wasted all my family's money, we lost our house and had to move in with my grandma in her small apartment. My family was under extreme financial stress, and the situation was bad to the point that my parents threatened suicide multiple times. I worked hard to support them, still playing on the side. I even tried attending private classes for a sort of professional, non-university-level, music school, but I dropped out because even that was not sustainable financially and my responsibilities left me, in the very best case scenario, a few hours every week to practice. Also I was not doing well psychologically, had panic attacks, felt very sad in general. Playing with other people was so painful, because every time I had to confront myself with the fact that 1) they had resources I didn't have (for gear, a car to go to practice, and to keep a general level of safety without financial stress) and 2) most important, they had time to practice.

I ended up putting my dream away and went to university, as it was much easier to get some scholarships and it was also less demanding in terms of time and resources. But my dream was still there, and I confronted my parents about it. In the meantime their financial situation was slightly more stable, and I told them I wanted to study music, go to a good school, in a context that could put me in contact with more musicians, in a country where it could've been more remunerative, and in general in environment that could've allowed me to flourish and to make a living out of music. I was aiming higher because I had to: only by getting to study to a high level and in the right place I could boost my chances to make a living out of it, without having to rely on them financially in the future. I couldn't have ""I will life off my parents"" type of plan b, nor could I ask for their support in finding an alternative career if music failed, so my ""music plan"" HAD to be good.

They'd been seeing me suffer a lot because of this throughout the years and reluctantly started to agree with supporting me, even though they would try to undermine my confidence with passive-aggressive remarks at every occasion. When we finally had a conversation about the level of financial support, my mum was like ""don't tell me you need up to xyz euro per month"", as if it was a lot. In my mind, I knew that 1) that was a lot *for them* and 2) it was completely unrealistic to pursue my plan, considering tuition, rent, food, pocket money, equipment etc., not even if I found a job compatible with the study load.

In that moment, I finally decided to stop playing at all, as it was too painful.

I went on, pursued a master's degree thanks to a scholarship, found a job and had a good career. It's been 10 years but I still feel bad, I feel my whole life is a shitty plan b. I think all the time about the moments where I played or the moments where I decided / realized I could not pursue it to the level I wanted. I daydream about playing with people and in front of people. I think about all the what ifs, if I had the support I needed.

Over the last days, I started reconsidering buying a guitar and starting plying again, I still have some of my old songs in mind, maybe find someone to record it with in a year or so...but I am still torn. Over the past years, every time I picked up a guitar, it was soooo painful. I am afraid that I will start getting sad again about the fact that I cannot be on the path I envisioned, that I will just be a wannabe. Also, it's impossible for me to see music as just a hobby.

What should I do?

**TL;DR:**  
I'm a 34-year-old man who once dreamed of being a professional guitarist, but growing up poor with financially and emotionally unstable parents forced me to abandon that path. Despite building a solid academic and professional career, I still feel like I’m living a “plan B” life. Music was never just a hobby—it was my true calling, but lack of support made it impossible to pursue seriously. I think about it constantly, and while I’ve considered picking up the guitar again, I’m scared it will only bring back the pain of what I lost. I don’t know if it’s worth trying again, or if I’m just clinging to a dream that can’t happen anymore.

I wanted to share what I’ve been feeling lately and get some thoughts or advice from others who may have been in a similar place.

I’ve been working for the past six months at a tech company in a role that’s a mix of sales and technical work. Overall, I’m doing well , I’m getting great feedback, people appreciate my work, and I’m even in the process of being promoted to a management position with a salary increase.

But… I’m feeling burnt out.

My typical day starts at 7:00 AM so I can get ready and commute, and I usually get back home around 7:00 PM. By the time I’m home, I’m completely drained. I don’t have the energy to do things I care about, hobbies, fitness, learning, catching up on the world, seeing friends, or personal growth in general.

And what’s strange is that the job isn’t even physical, yet I feel more exhausted than I did back when I used to do physical labor.

At first, I told myself it’s just a phase, that I’d get used to it, or that over time the job would get easier or allow more balance. But six months in, I’m looking at my managers and colleagues (most of whom also have kids), and realizing this lifestyle probably won’t change much. If anything, taking a managerial role will likely make it more intense.

And it’s not that I hate my job. On the contrary, my boss is great, the work environment is really positive, and I feel like I’m providing value to the company.
But I feel like I’m completely stuck. I’m not learning, not growing, and not doing anything for myself. It feels like I’m living to work, not working to live.

I think a big part of this is that there’s always something to do at work. There’s never a true ""break"" where I feel free to focus on personal goals. And now that I’m moving toward a management role, I expect that pressure to only grow.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how much I want to invest more in myself, in my education, interests, and well-being.

I’m starting to wonder if a better fit for me would be a different kind of job, something where the main responsibility is to be present and available and respond when needed, rather than being constantly active. A role where, in between those moments, I could use the downtime to study, read, listen to podcasts, or work on a side project.

I’m not looking for a fake job with hidden unemployment, I want to do meaningful work and actually provide value. But I do want a role where, when there’s nothing urgent, I can use the time to grow personally and not feel constantly on edge.

I’m still young, no kids, and not tied down, so now is probably the best time to explore other directions. I’m not afraid of learning something new or starting fresh in a different field if that’s what it takes.

Even though on paper I’m in a good place right now, I have this growing feeling that if I stay on this path, I won’t end up with the kind of life I want.

So I’d really appreciate it if anyone has ideas for career paths or jobs that align with what I described. I’m open to studying, training, or putting in the work, I just want to make sure I’m building toward the kind of life I actually want to live.

Thanks so much for reading. I’d love to hear your experiences or suggestions.

1lb7peb,New career or school?,"Backstory: 35 yo female who currently works as a remote financial analyst at Crowe who is severely underpaid, and although I’m sincerely happy to have a job in this economy, it barely pays the bills. I’m happy to have a union working fiance who can help out quite a bit.

I’m looking for my forever career. I’ve worked at PNC as a bank teller, SSC as a reimbursement specialist, PPG office as a non-certified medical assistant, ProFed as a mortgage processor, NewRez as a mortgage processor, PartsTown as a warranty specialist and currently a financial analyst.

I’m debating on going back to school for something in the medical field but would prefer not to do bedside nursing. I don’t qualify for the Pell grant so it’s all out of pocket and I’ve been researching and trying to figure out what would be the best option. Either try to get a better job in the financial world, or continue my low paying job while taking courses at ivy tech for something medical.

Reddit has been a haven for advice so I thought I would ask all of you folks for any direction, thoughts, etc. I’m a native so I know the low wages, rise in cost of living, and how crazy things have gotten in the last couple of years, but I still have hope that I can find a field in demand that pays decent.

1lb7drj,Need advice on how to negotiate salary!,"Hi, I’m looking for some advice on how to negotiate my potential salary with a new employer. I made the mistake of disclosing what I currently make, and I think that will jeopardize the official offer I’m currently waiting on. Someone I know reached out to me and offered me the job. I did not apply or anything, she just knew I was a potential candidate that would be a good fit for the position. 

I later met with her superior (the guy who will be giving me the official offer); during our conversation/interview he mentioned he knew what I made, and said I would be making more than that. He refused to speak on what that looks like, salary ranges, etc. He said this in a really condescending tone and that really threw me off. I told the person I would be working under, not him. Yea I know, huge mistake and I’ll never do it again. I just thought I could trust her. Anyway, any tips or advice would be appreciated. 

P.S.: she told me what her employee currently makes (the position I would be filing); and they have hinted that I would making less than that. My current employer has also already made a counter offer. 


* For clarity, I work in the restaurant/ food service industry. I’ve never negotiated anything really and I’m pretty advanced for my age (already in management roles); So I don’t have any experience dealing with this stuff. I’m used to working in small kitchens that give you what they can afford and you can take it or not. The company I would be potentially working for is very corporate and a huge group in the US.

1lb75s9,My managers dislike me and I have no idea why,"Forgive me for this being so long. I just need some advice and opinions. 

I’m 21 and I just got hired at a clothing store about 3 months ago. I’m quiet for the most part, but I’ll chit chat here and there with my coworkers and I get along with them pretty well. Now, the issue that I’m having rn is with two managers that seemingly dislike me. 

The first one got hired at the same time as me so she’s new as well. Since the beginning, she has always come off as passive aggressive and condescending. It shows through her tone of voice, body language, and her facial expressions. At first I thought that maybe it wasn’t intentional and that’s just the way she was, so I was giving her the benefit of the doubt. Then there was the criticisms, which I also had no issues with for a while because I was new and I was obviously gonna be given some direction, but it was always served with a condescending and sharp tone. Same thing was happening when she was giving me instructions. It started irking me when she started discrediting my work and claiming that I wasn’t doing it after I was busting my ass for 3hrs straight (she has been witness to me going above and beyond for customers on multiple occasions and them saying good things about me), questioning why I was doing something a certain way and then immediately start walking away when I would try to offer an explanation, never greeted me and when I tried to greet her she would just give me a dismissive ‘hello’, she has conversations with the rest of my coworkers and seems to like them but she won’t talk to me unless she has to or when she wants to question my work ethic. At first I figured this was because I was new and quiet and she questioned my capabilities because of that, which still isn’t great, but I found out yesterday that that isn’t the case. We just hired this girl who is also quiet, and my manager absolutely loves her. She had the biggest smile on her face talking to the new hire and it threw me off guard. Now I have no idea what it is. 

The issue has gotten worse because I feel like another manager is also having an issue with me, which is making me question everything more. This manager has definitely gave me more criticisms but she delivers it in a much nicer tone, although it is a lot. Again, I’m new and I wasn’t taking it personally for a while. However, she keeps reminding me to do the same thing over and over again even though I’ve actively been doing it already. I keep getting told basic things consistently that I remember and I’ve shown that I’ve been doing, but it doesn’t stop the reinforcement. This doesn’t happen to anyone else. 
Yesterday was the tipping point for me though. For half of the day I was on and off pulling clothes from the back stock so they could go out on the floor. It was busy for the majority of the day so like an hour and a half before close I had to pull about 40-50+ units. Given that, I didn’t have a ton of time to clean up the store. I finally was able to get started on it and about 2mins in, I hear over the walkie “okay (my name) you need to start being faster or we’re gonna be here all night”, and then she comes over and shows me how to fold the clothes. She had emphasized that it didn’t need to be perfect, it just had to be presentable. So I quickly put my section together, which was half the store, in the most presentable way I could. I still made sure that everything was folded neatly and aligned. Apparently I wasn’t supposed to do that, because she wasn’t happy with some parts and told me that I need to be thorough and make sure that every single piece looks good. This confused me a lot. 

I really have no idea what they want from me or if it’s just a personal issue they have. None of my other managers or coworkers seem to have an issue with me at all either. I’ve also been working in customer service for about 3 years now and I’ve never experienced this before. I try my best but it’s been slowly bringing down my work performance and I don’t know what to do.",Unlucky_Ambassador,3,0.8100000023841858,1,1749902850,2025-06-14 12:07:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lb75s9/my_managers_dislike_me_and_i_have_no_idea_why/,6,2025

1lb4fik,"Choosing Between AI/ML, Data Science, and Full Stack Development","**Hi everyone!**  
I'm currently a second-year Computer Science student, and I’m on a summer break that lasts for about 4 months. Until now, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++. Based on my experience so far, I’ve found that I’m most interested in **Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning**, followed by **Data Science**, and then **Full Stack Web Development**.

Among these, AI/ML stands out as my top priority because it excites me the most. Data science also seems very interesting, and I'm genuinely curious about web development too. I thought learning multiple tech stacks would help me build a broader skill set and create a stronger CV, especially through hands-on projects.

However, I’m a bit confused about where to start and how to best use these 4 months. Should I focus on AI/ML alone, or should I try to study Python, JavaScript, and AI/ML concepts together in a structured daily routine? I want to make the most out of this time, especially considering how competitive the tech field is nowadays.

I’d really appreciate some guidance or advice from people who’ve gone through this stage—what path did you follow, and what worked best for you?

1lb40oa,Considering a career in urban planning. Is it too late?,"Im 32 M and my undergraduate was a business management degree with a major in real estate and development. I wanted to work in property development or valuation and I had a solid start working part time for a developer in uni and graduating into a full time residential valuation role.

1lb3nfk,"24M, what to do next?","Hey. Just joined this subreddit because I have been up all night thinking what to do with my situation, and thought I’d post this.

Lil’ background.
I live in Hungary, I’m 24 years old (M), about to be 25 in September.
I have attended University (2019-2022), I have a degree in English (Philologist in English and American Studies, with a specialisation of English Translation Skills)

I have tried to look for a job after Uni,but because I’ve had zero experience at that point, my applications were refused everywhere. My best friend got me a job in Austria, where he worked at the time. It was a construction job, I did it for 8 months but then I left because it really wasn’t for me.

Currently, I am working for a German corp (with a smaller “site” in Hungary), where I essentially do Data Capturing (we have to “capture”/“record” data from invoices, like cost, date, invoice number, etc.
They are mostly car service/leasing invoices)

It’s a montonous, boring job, but it’s also nice because we have the option to work from home and I live very close to the office if I do have to go in.
The other problem that I have with this job is the fact that I use German, everyday. My German is not the best, although I did study it early in school. Maybe it’s around B level (mid-level).
Also, because my German is considered best out of our group of 5 people, I have other responsibilities, like maintaining daily contact with German colleagues (IT, other Data Capture colleagues, etc.)

I have studied English though, at the highest level, and would be really happy if I could make use of that knowledge, but I also do not shy away from the idea of learning more German and utilise those two languages in the future.
However, this job will be taken away from the company in October, due to various reasons between other corps and their contracts.
My problem is, I have no idea where to go next. With almost 2 years of non-cohesive experience, in Hungary, wanting to start my own life, I have no idea what kind of career I could actually build. I know, 24 is still young, but it’d be nice to get ahead of things and establish myself as early as possible. 
I would be happy to work abroad as well, I don’t think limiting myself to Hungary would be a great idea.
As for the type of work I am looking for, I have always been interested in IT, I know my way around Office apps, computers, and I feel like working with people is also something I enjoy, which is why I think I excelled at my current job.

What do you guys think? What direction should I take with this whole situation?

Thank you for your thoughts in advance!

1lb37se,Need advice on what Masters to study,"Unfortunately my BA in Graphic Design and nearly 10 years of experience doesn't cut it anymore - I barely get any freelance projects and I also moved to Switzerland because, well, love. He has a great job, but for the last two years I cannot find anything here, it is super competitive and learning the language didn't help. So the plan is to study a Masters, preferably in Switzerland, so I can be more competitive in the job market.

So far I've been admitted to:  
\- MSc in Data Visualization and UX Design (in Chur, FHGR) - 1500CHF/Semester  
\- MSc in Human-Centered Digital Innovation (in Olten, FHNW) - 1000 CHF / Semester  
\- MA in Data-Driven Design (Utrecht) - 1500CHF/Semester - but only 1 year!  
\- MSc in Creative Leadership (Austria) - free  
\- BSc Informatics and Digital Innovation (Austria) - free

1lb2118,Looking for input on a school job,"I’ve been at my current job for 5 years. My plan was to stay another 7, which gives me enough time in the system to retire. That plus retirement from a previous job and I should be ok financially. Anyway, we get paid a flat rate to work sporting events. We work more now than we did when I started..they’ve steadily added more work with no pay increases. This coming school year, even more will be added..not only will we be required to work home games, but they’re adding away games as well which will at least double the work load. More than I’m concerned about added work for no extra pay, I’m not really interested in spending that much time away from my kids. One of my kids was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer last year. He has two younger siblings as well. There is no cure for the cancer and I’d prefer to spend as much time as possible with him while keeping in mind that I still have to pay my bills. 

We have a new boss, and he’s the one who decided that we will be working these extra sporting events. I’ve tried talking to him and explaining my situation, and asked to be excused from at least some of the games where they interfere with spending time with my kids. All I was told was it’s not possible. 

I spent a lot of time away when my kids were younger..watched my youngest daughter take her first steps over FaceTime because I was working away. I did it for my family so I don’t regret that part, but now the dynamic has changed..I don’t want to lose a kid and look back having had to put work ahead of making the most of every moment with him. 

Is it unrealistic of me to expect understanding from my employer? The old boss didn’t bat an eye when I needed off to be with my son through his first surgery, chemo and radiation appointments, or just to spend time with him when he needed me-“Go be a dad, we’ve got this” were her only words to me when I needed to take off.

I felt like ang 8080 ko palagi pag nagtatanong. May urge sakin na gusto ko nang umalis sa work ko, and find another company for fresh start. I'm in this company for 3 years na and this is also my first job right after graduating. I know lahat naman ng workplace may stress at problem.

1lb1jjo,Is the nepotism worth it?,"I’ve been in my current job (I work in an office as a risk manager ) for three years. It’s a family business, extended family. I got the job with barely any experience because at the time it was a startup company and I’ve gotten to a point where I feel pretty confident in what I do and could use the skills at another job (except I don’t have the education) . 

The job itself is easy, but the politics surrounding it is not and It’s getting really difficult to work with family. I could go on and on about how unfairly i’m treated, how rampant sexism is there, how poorly everything is run. It’s not worth the 95k salary. 

I want to move on, but I want to keep making the same about of money. What other fields should I go into? Or should I even leave?

1lb1hqv,Coworkers view everything I do with bad intentions,"I am at my breaking point today after months of trying to better myself reflecting on every interaction, meditating and journaling before work, not reacting when someone is screaming at me, etc. For so long I have felt like I was the problem in why people at work weren’t liking me, and yes I do take some accountability, but no matter how much I try to change my approach there’s a new issue.

Today when I respectfully disagreed with a coworker they told me I do whatever I want and don’t care about other people. I apologized if I come off that way but looking back now it feels really unfair. I try to delegate tasks to people (which I’m instructed to do by management) and most of the time I get attitude or resistance from people but I try to let it go for the sake of not being in work drama or being more disliked than I already am. I have let a lot of disrespect go for those reasons.

I’m younger than a lot of my coworkers and part of my role is supervising, some of my coworkers who have been there a lot longer than me give me advice which I appreciate and listen to, although sometimes I make my own judgement calls. There’s times when I ask for advice and I’m told “idk you’re a supervisor you should know this” then other times when I make a decision I’m immediately told it’s wrong even if it’s what has always been done before. I understand that things are circumstantial, but I can’t keep up with the constantly changing expectations. 

I’m feeling stuck because it wasn’t as much of a me problem as I thought, it’s people having a negative perception of me and probably talking shit which is out of my control.",TermApprehensive2378,1,1.0,1,1749880677,2025-06-14 05:57:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lb1hqv/coworkers_view_everything_i_do_with_bad_intentions/,6,2025
1lb0uyu,Why I’m Off the Market for Startup Jobs,"After working in two different startups—one that went bankrupt and one that’s currently stalling my salary and full & final settlement—I’ve finally decided to take a break from the startup ecosystem.

In both cases, I gave my full energy, worked beyond hours, built and shipped core features, and stayed committed through the ups and downs. But when it came to something as basic as timely salary payments, things fell apart.

At my most recent job, I’m still waiting for 3 months of pending salary. I’ve followed up professionally over email, phone, and even offered flexible solutions like post-dated cheques — but all I’ve received in return is silence or shifting timelines.

I get that startups are hard. Fundraising is uncertain. Burn is real. But basic professionalism and accountability towards employees shouldn’t be optional.

So until further notice, I’m off the market for startup roles — especially early-stage ones with no financial safety net. I’ll focus on stability, transparency, and companies that treat their people like people.

Would love to hear if others have been through similar situations — or how they navigated this.

1lb0ng7,Career Change - How do I get out of hospitality,"Hey all,  
I’ve been working in the hospitality industry for about 3 years since graduating college, and I also have a hospitality degree, so it made sense at the time. I have been in most departments: F&B, HSKP, Front Desk, and now in Sales as a coordinator in my current hotel, which on paper is great, but honestly... I’m just not feeling it anymore. The excitement I used to have for the industry is pretty much gone. I don’t hate what I do, but I don’t find it fulfilling either. I’m starting to realize that hospitality might not be something I want to stick with long term.

I really don’t want to go back to school at the moment because I just finished one not long ago and can't imagine jumping into another degree right now. So I'm looking for ideas or suggestions for industries I can pivot into that won’t require another diploma but still make use of my existing skills.

I'd love to hear from people who’ve successfully transitioned out of hospitality. What roles or industries did you move into? What helped the most during your switch? Any advice, suggestions, or even job titles to look into would be super appreciated. 🙏

Right now, I’m thinking of going for FRM because:

I have decent financial modeling skills already.

I didn’t learn much in my bachelor's degree (not very strong academically), so I want to build a solid foundation now.

FRM seems more affordable compared to CFA, which is also a big factor for me right now.

I feel like FRM can help me get a decent finance job, especially in banks or risk roles.


I’m not considering CFA at this moment mainly because of the cost and the time commitment. Also, I’m more inclined towards risk and analysis rather than investment research.

But I’m still confused.

1layljf,Feeling stuck! Does anyone have some insight on what I should do?,"Hi everyone,

I hope to get honest advice from folks who have been through career transitions or found clarity after feeling stuck. I am in my late 20s with a Master's in Psychology and a mix of experience in research and sales. I have worked in pharmaceutical sales, rare disease outreach, and academic research, but I am still unsure what path to commit to long-term.

Here is a quick breakdown of my background:

* Master's in Psychology
* 4+ years of combined experience in:
   * Clinical and academic research at my local University
   * Pharmaceutical sales (including wound care and OR-focused devices)
   * surgical experiences and physician engagement
* Passion about fast-paced, people-facing work in healthcare, but I am also drawn to mission-driven roles and translational science.

That said, I am struggling financially. I am carrying student debt (around $73K), and my current research job pays \~$46K, barely enough to move out or build savings. I have hit a ceiling, but I am unsure what my next move should be.

I have interviewed extensively for pharmaceutical sales roles over the past year. However, despite my relevant experience and solid connections in the industry, I have not been able to land anything. I know how competitive the field is, but it is frustrating to keep getting so close without breaking through.

I have also explored medical device sales and various positions in psychology, but I keep running into roadblocks like licensing requirements. I will preface by saying I started my Master's at a local University, but they closed down due to financial reasons when I had two classes left, and I was forced to start my Master's over. Unfortunately, after being denied the forgiveness, I still have to repay those loans for a degree I do not have. Taking out more loans would not be ideal.

If anyone has advice or insight, whether it is alternate roles I should consider, how to break into higher-paying clinical or industry positions or even personal stories of pivoting into fulfilling work, I would appreciate it. I have a love for neuroscience and the brain, if that helps! I am willing to try anything and would appreciate some help.

1laxy9a,Thinking about an MS in Finance with no prior finance background,"Hi all, currently am about to turn 30 and want to go back to school to study finance. At first, I thought about getting a 2nd degree but then I was given advice to just get my masters. For context, I have a film production BA from a public college. However, after 6 years in advertising and on the post-production side of commercials (video editing), I am uncertain if this is a viable career in the future with the rise of AI taking over the creative industry to a degree. I also am growing unhappy in my current position in general. The job market right now in the field are not the best, so I am looking to course-correct.

With a BA in film, I do not have a finance background. I took only 1 math class in college during my freshman year, but passed with a decent grade. I never took calculus, statistics, etc or any advanced math above algebra and geometry/trigonometry. However, I know that if I applied myself, I could do it.

The MS program I am looking at currently has a 3 semester curriculum in which I could possibly get my masters by 32. I am not trying to be a consultant or anything crazy, but I would like a career as an analyst. The pay would almost be double what I am getting paid now, and I’ve always wanted a reason to get a masters in something.

I have completed Azure and Databricks certifications, so I do understand the basics. But I am not good at remembering code or solving random coding questions, especially in interviews. I tend to freeze up, and that is one of my biggest fears right now.

I am also currently pursuing an MBA, hoping it might lead to more management-oriented roles. But I am starting to wonder if those roles are rare or hard to land without strong technical credibility.

1lavi28,170K Far Away vs 100K Close to Family,"I was lucky enough to get a new offer for new grad and I'm not sure what to pick and what impacts the choice would have on my career.

Option 1:

* Defense company
* 100k TC
* Hybrid
* Stay with family, friends, girlfriend of 4 years
* I know what team I'm on and the language/tech stack is what I wanted to specialize in (Backend).
* Will be commuting and saving on rent

Option 2:

* Amazon
* 170K TC + Relocation
* Far away in HCOL city and would be living alone until I would try to transfer closer
* Don't know the team or the work I'll be doing

Amazon pays a lot better and I'm sure it will look better on my resume for the future, but I also was looking forward to the work I'd be doing for the first company and don't really want to move away from everyone. I think paying rent would also reduce a lot of the impact of the higher pay.

I also was wondering how Amazon worked with assigning teams, and if you would be able to choose more frontend or backend work eventually.

Another thing is girlfriend would graduate in another year or two and would most likely be able to move wherever I would be.

My main question is should I stick out a year or two at Amazon before trying to transfer to a closer location, and if Amazon's larger resume impact would make it worth it to go long distance and far away from my family and girlfriend for a year or two.

Overall, would Amazon on my resume make it that much easier to get a higher paying job in any location after a year or two?",Brysk2Time,0,0.5,6,1749860761,2025-06-14 00:26:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lavi28/170k_far_away_vs_100k_close_to_family/,6,2025
1lav104,Question - How do I respond in an interview when asked about why I’m leaving/left my former position?,"I was let go from my former position a week ago, and have interviews lined up for this coming week. In my former position I was a laboratory manager for a subsidiary of a large national company. I made an error - summary being I made a call to hold one part of sample testing until we received more kits from the vender a few days later, instead of a sending it to a third party costing us thousands but still receiving results the same day we would have done them internally. HR/my director gave me the option of resigning or being terminated, and I chose termination (I have never been terminated before in over a decade of professional working experience). In talking with some people, they prodded and started asking about my duties and such. On top of normal managerial lab duties, I was being given duties that normally belonged to my director. Furthermore, I was being tasked to hold meetings/presentations with leadership and executives over data and potential implementations. From what I gathered, corporate was impressed and the VP was having private conversations with me in making operations more robust and ""up-to-date."" Anyways, it was brought up that more than likely the underlying reason for letting me go was that the director was threatened that her position might be given to me. I feel incredibly idiotic for being naive in not seeing that and incredibly hurt because that is something I would have not expected from the upper echelon of leadership. In retrospect, there was red flags from my director from eliminating one of my technicians because of his ""colorful"" legal history (phenomenal worker who had not done anything questionable on the job), throwing me in the deep end of the pool and expecting me to swim (learned all compliance, audits, regulations without much guidance), and refusing in purchasing equipment for the biological safety of my technicians.

And I don’t mean I’m burned out or physically exhausted (though yeah, that happens too sometimes), but more like… I don’t know how to explain it.

It’s this inner conflict: I want to give a lot. I care. I take initiative. I spot problems and want to fix them. I make suggestions. I push for better. I show up. I want to grow. But then sometimes, I stop and wonder… am I doing too much? Too much initiative? Too many ideas? Too much effort for a role that doesn’t officially require it? Too much “go-getter” energy for people who are okay just coasting?

And it’s tough to explain. It’s not about praise. It’s not even about promotion (but yes, I want to grow lol). It’s about this drive to make things better, even when no one’s asking for it.

So here’s my honest question: How do you know when you’re giving too much at work? not in terms of burnout, but in terms of energy, ideas, emotional investment, etc.? And what do you do when you feel like “too much” in a workplace that might be “just enough”?",Nadzzzzzzzzzzzzz,10,1.0,7,1749857762,2025-06-13 23:36:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lauheh/how_much_is_too_much_when_youre_trying_to_stand/,6,2025

This past touchbase with my manger, he asked me to provide him a day to day what my tasks look like so that we can advocate for more staff and I said that was no problem, but now that im thinking of it I have a lot of questions because I am not a production analyst so why would this matter for me?

Additionally, I found out other members of my team don't need to do this either (production staff), so now Im a bit concerned.

If im being honest, there are a lot of days where I don't do anything, and I really don't get direction from anybody in management on what to do.

I've never been asked to do this before, so im not just sure what to make of this. In the past my manager told me he doesn't think Im being utilized to my full potential, and when I came to this company (over 3 years ago) my role wasn't really defined and it was always up in the air of what im responsible for / not responsible for since I am not a production analyst.

Im a little stressed after finding out im the only one who needs to do this.

Any insights would be appreciated.

1latj1d,Comparing offers,"I can't decide what I need to do. I am expecting two job offers after being laid off in March. Here are the details. Which would you pick?

Job 1) I got the official offer today. It is $60 an hour + overtime. Health insurance will cost significantly more plus no PTO or 401k match. It is project work and Temp to 12 months hire.

Job 2) They laid me off but called me back for another position. I was expecting a full time position offer yesterday but there was turn over with HR that is causing a delay. The max hire rate on the job description was $117000ish. There are 2 options for the site I would work at, either they close down and I would lose my job again or they get sold. It would come with good benefits and unlimited flex time off. Another thing is if they are sold there is no knowing what the benefits would be either. I am pretty confident the job would not be eliminated if sold.

1latbx0,feeling swamped and unsure of my abilities as an intern,"i'm a third year student and i started a marketing internship in may. i was initially super excited but it's not going the way i imagined. my first day, they gave me a list of 8 projects for me to work on throughout the course of the summer. i thought this was nice, since my last internship basically had me doing nothing the entire summer. but as these weeks have gone on i feel severely incompetent and unqualified. people on my team casually mentioned that they can't hire a dedicated marketer for their team due to a hiring freeze, and i've started getting the impression that they are using an intern to bypass this and i feel like i've been given the projects of a full-time employee to compensate. i love the learning aspect, and i've been trying to ask questions when i get lost, but truthfully i still feel like i'm making mistakes and i feel like people are starting to get aggravated with me for being slow.

I am open to trying anything new... new roles, new industries, new cities, new everything. 

As title asks, what do you believe are some high demand certifications, skills, that can relatively inexpensive to obtain?

1lat4qo,Company failed to deposit promised sign on bonus.,"I received an offer letter from a new job that stated I would receive a 10k signing bonus payable on my first paycheck date . Well, I got my first paycheck deposited and my signing bonus was not in my account. I reached out to the HR person who recruited me and they said there was a mistake due to the amount of employees they recently hired and that my bonus would be on my next check…two weeks from now.  

A little bit of back story: their recruiting company reached out to me and recruited me from an already stable job and the 10k sign on bonus along with higher pay was icing on the cake to make me leave my job and join their company. 

This has left a bad taste in my mouth because even though they said it would be on my next check, but I question whether they were going to tell me since I reached out to them first and the offer letter was from a month ago.

1laqddh,Not sure where to go with my career,"Hi everyone,

I 23M am seeking advice on what to do with my career at the moment. I am currently an analyst for a fortune 500 company and hope to leverage my experience to later on transition to a corporate finance role (most likely FP&A), either internally or externally.

I currently work remote and I love the team that I'm on, love my management, and have great WLB. However, I feel that I am underpaid compared to competitors. I was recently promoted and received a very small raise and felt that I deserved more but was told that the raise was firm and no negotiating.

I was also recently contacted by a recruiter to join a smaller firm in a different industry for an analytics role that isn't in finance or related to finance. I am now currently in the final stages of the interview process and expect an offer soon. However, they are fully RTO (15-20 min commute one way). But their pay would be about a \~35% increase in base salary with an additional 20% bonus to the base salary. Through the interview process, the impression that I was given was that this team was a very ""lean"" team and has tight deadlines.

I guess my question is, how should I gauge this potential job offer? It would be a substantial pay increase but would be a quality of life changer with the office days and work hours, and would deviate me from the career path that I want for myself.",Maleficent-Tree4815,4,1.0,7,1749846837,2025-06-13 20:33:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1laqddh/not_sure_where_to_go_with_my_career/,6,2025

7 and a half weeks in they had to lay off 2/3 of their total staff, myself included.

Curious to get everyone's thoughts about whether to include this in my work experience section on my resume.

Con is obviously that it was such a short amount of time, Pro is that it was a big step up in terms of responsibilities, title, etc, and the layoffs weren't anything in my control.

I'd ideally like to land another full time job at a Director level.

1lantse,From mom's basement to achieving my dreams. How possible is it?,"**To give context, travelling is my passion and my fiancée is abroad. I've had a couple friends who are digital nomads and it is so tempting. I wanted to do my own thing and/or be remote before it was cool and being pushed by influencers though, but now I want it so bad,**

I pursued a diploma in video editing and infographics, but it led nowhere, just jobs at printing shops that were low-paying and uninspiring. Everyone wants to be a video editor, everyone wants to work remotely, and anyone can outmatch my skills with a YouTube channel or cheap freelancers. Even graphics are getting replaced by Canva and AI. Because of this, I ended up doing odd jobs, stuck in a low-quality career while staying at my parents' house, going through phases like entrepreneur coping and even that Andrew Tate mindset. It was a mistake wasting so much time and money on education that didn’t provide stability.

I've stopped being in denial. I do want to own a business but I should learn those skills and use the Bachelors I get to build capital (in my opinion). 

I live in Canada. We don't really have crazy requirements about majors, most places are happy with a bachelors or lower (It's called a DEC here, I am assuming it's like an Associate's degree). While I do want to learn business (not from Youtube gurus), I'd want the bachelors I get to actually land jobs.

Obviously, my mind is telling me 'Marketing' because of the diploma I have. They would go great together. Except all I am seeing is how much high the competition is and how people still end up at McDonald's. I don't wanna be in that situation again, nor do I wanna build a TikTok from the ground up just to land a basic role (proving marketing skills I guess).

Business management is common but seems to lead nowhere. Finance feels safer, but many roles require extra certifications or licenses. Since my bachelor's degree is meant to teach business and be temporary, I need it to serve as a safety net if I fail. Supply chain seems stable and also teaches business, but the jobs seem tied to warehouses, which feels too similar to the low-quality jobs I've done before. Overall, finance and supply chain seem either complicated or boring but at least offer business knowledge.

CS and/or IT also do fit in the mold, they offer potential remote jobs where I can build capital in the meantime. An exemple of this is AI training (which I've been doing, but it is not stable and I am only offering my second language, which isn't paid as much. I have made 1100 CDN from it in a month). However, I don't care about that sort of stuff really nor would it teach business.

My dad is telling me to get a mentor, but I'd rather invest that money in the bachelors itself, or making college credits, I am looking for advice with this Reddit post. 

Should I be doing supply chain + marketing cert to get a shot at both fields (if that's doable)? Should I buy a Tiktok / Youtube page for the reputation, and run it for a few months to add to my resume? Should I do an unpaid internship (easier to get) to prove my worth anyhow?

I guess I'm wondering which degree aligns with: wanting to learn business while securing a decent-paying career if I fail at making my own business without giving up or remaining true to my dream of joining my fiancé abroad and travelling. I've somewhat had a taste of that 'freedom' with AI training, but they won't need me forever and it's too unstable.

  
**TL;DR:** 

**I want a business, financial security, and the freedom to travel with my fiancée.**

**My video editing diploma led nowhere, and AI replaced graphic design.**

**Marketing has tough competition, finance needs extra certifications, and supply chain might mean warehouse work.**

**But overall, I want my degree to actually secure a career (I might fail at entrepreneurship) for capital-building that also teaches me business.**

**CS and IT offer remote jobs, but I don’t care about tech.**

**Instead of a mentor, I’d rather invest in my degree. I’m considering supply chain with a marketing certificate, buying a social media page, or doing an unpaid internship.**

**AI training gave me a taste of freedom, but it won’t last.**

1lantk7,Burnt out at a “great” remote job. Is it dumb to leave?,"I’m in a job that, on paper, is really solid. The company is doing well, the compensation is decent, and it’s a place a lot of people would probably love to work at. It’s fully remote, and I’ve been here long enough to feel stable and trusted.

But honestly? I’m burnt out and checked out. Remote work is no longer working for me — I’m feeling isolated, unmotivated, and like I’m going through the motions. I miss the structure and energy of being around people.

On top of that, I feel like my growth has stalled. I’m not learning like I used to, and I can feel myself slipping into a kind of professional autopilot.

It feels risky to leave something “objectively good,” especially when the company is still growing. But I can’t shake the feeling that staying is slowly draining me.

1lamxny,Need advice,"Hi everyone,
Posting anonymously.

I left a startup in May 2025. It’s been over 3 weeks now, and they still haven’t cleared 3 months of my pending salary

They verbally mentioned a 90-day Full & Final (F&F) settlement timeline but haven’t shared any official policy document, even after multiple follow-ups. I returned all company assets, and they even gave me a salary certificate that acknowledges the dues — but no clarity on when I’ll actually get paid.

On a recent call, a senior leader admitted that no formal policy exists, but they’ve gone silent ever since I asked for written confirmation.

Has anyone faced something similar? What are my options now? Should I escalate legally or try something else?

Appreciate any advice. Thanks.

1lamfck,torn between secure gov job and digital nomad dreams - what’s best?,"
I'm seeking advice from those who've been in similar shoes. I'm 25, working in a government job with a good salary ($85k) and benefits, including a pension. This job is considered recession-proof and secure, with potential for growth up to 6 figures in the next few years. Many people tell me I've ""hit the lottery"" with this job due to its stability and regular 9-5 schedule.

However, I've always dreamed of becoming a digital nomad and traveling the world while working remotely. I love adventure and exploring new places, but I'm stuck in Canada most of the time. I've started working on a marketing agency side gig, but it's not taking off as expected due to my busy social life after work.

Here's my dilemma: should I stick with the secure government job or take a risk and pursue my digital nomad dreams? If you were in my shoes, with no responsibilities and a similar financial situation, what would you do?

*But most importantly, if you were in my shoes and young, looking back, would you gamble on your future?* Would you stick with the safe choice and have your future set for you, or take a chance on something more

1lam0r3,Being fired from job after 5 years of being discriminated against by my co workers and customers,"So I've worked at speedway in New York State for 5 years every since I graduated from high school. and from day one this job have put me thru so much everyday I was getting questioned about my sexuality. from employers, customers on the daily basis I've always felt like I had to protect and depend myself. I've always had to speak up to people because doing my job and following company guidelines wasn't enough for customers who come and wanting to buy alcohol or tobacco. When they didn't have there id by company policy I had to deny them. I would be called ""gay"" a ""faggot"" "" i sound like this and that "" im going to beat your ass when your off the clock "". Ive had customer cut ground wire and mess up my engine while working. I've had my managers ask me if I was gay. I've had co workers gossip telling people they heard I was gay. And when I told my boss she said ""well are you gay"" I've had a employee tell me that all blacks deserve to die"" I've had customers push me and throw things at me. I've been thru a lot with this company for 5 years I started working there when I was 19 I'm now 24 I'm very young to be going thru the trama I went thru with this company. Nothing was ever done about it. It's like it was just swept under the rug everytime a customer stole a pack of gum they picture would be up, but when someone comes in and threatens to shoot me over a pack of cigarettes there picture was never up. I started to realize to late that this company did not care about me at all. Every time someone came at me it made me automatically jump into defense mode to protect myself but really it just screwed my mental up completely to the point where I had to be put on depression medication and I'm also labeled ""tbi"" witch is traumatic brain injury. Witch have always played a huge role into my living hood growing up being bullied changed me a lot. It's just so sad how the world is just based off worrying about someone else's sexuality it's really sickening. Being a kid I never thought life would ever be like this now I'm growing finna be 25 years old soon. On April 28 2025 a customer came into the store and I accidentally put him on the wrong pump. He was really upset but I explained to him that I could switch him to the right pump he started talking to me crazy so I just told him "" goodbye "" he came up to me and told me to "" stop all that gay bye shit"" and threatening to knocked my teeth out , he proceeded to grab vegetable oil out of a customers hand and shoved it to my face abbreviation that he would smash it to my face so I are pulled the rack of items off the counter to defend myself so we're both gonna just be missing teeth. A few moments my manager called asking for my co worker Dave I cut her off and expressed to her how I felt working there and how I felt they did not care about my well being. She told me that felt this "" job is not meant for me "" after five years how could you say that to someone who's put there blood, sweat , and tears into a job not most people around my age is keeping a holding a job for 5 years. So it really just broke me down when she said that so I hung up on her. After I heard my co workers talking about me so I pressed the issue they baited me and I was terminated by my manager a hour later. I felt really broken down because after all the violation I went thru and stuck around to bash my mental health because I felt so used to the disrespect and hopping on defense mode all the time because I had no protection. I stay with this job because my mind was telling me it's okay. Just deal with it when really it's messing up my sanity. It's now June and it's really hard for me to find a job. I've applied a bunch of places everytime I get denied and I try to figure out why. I'm very discouraged an I don't know how to approach and go about it , I don't feel as smart and don't feel like I'm able to work a job because I'm not like everyone else I feel like I'm not stabe and smart enough to work other jobs because what I've been thru for 5 years that's a long time for a young black male like me. I'm a really good person with a good heart I just don't go for disrespect. I've been thru it my whole life so why keep dealing with it at my grown age. Please guys don't let these jobs drain you physically emotionally or mentally. It's not worth it there's thousands of jobs around you that would appreciate the work that you do and care for you and protect you at all cost. I'm really in a dark place right now since I've been fired I don't know my next step I don't know what's meant for me. I feel so lost. I don't feel like the same person anymore and I try everyday not to let a crappy job like that not get to me but it's hard it's not like I worked there for 8 months it's been years. So I've been put into a place where I feel like I can't do better , I can't find better. When it reality. I can god got me. Remember everything happens for a reason.

1lalmnx,MBA → Big Corp → Startup CCO → Burnout → What now?,"// Switzerland // Lac Leman area //

Hey folks,
Thought I’d share my story in case someone out there has been through something similar—or has advice.

Did the whole “success path”:
MBA → strategy consulting → climbed the ladder in sales & marketing at a big multinational → a couple of promotions → led some big initiatives…

Then came a reorg. You know the drill—BAM. Out.

So I thought, “Screw it, let’s try something meaningful.”
Joined a startup as CCO. Loved the vision. Built the team, shaped the brand, hustled.

But… the money didn’t follow. Nor did the product. Long story short: it didn’t work out.

Now I’m here. 43M. In-between. Some time on my hands. Some savings.
But also some questions:
	•	What do I really want to build?
	•	What kind of work would make me not dread Mondays?
	•	Is it time to reinvent again—or just double down somewhere else?

I’m not looking for a silver bullet—just curious if others here have been through a similar pivot. How did you find clarity? How did you reconnect with your passion?

Appreciate any thoughts or shared stories. 🙏

1lalkj5,Under utilized and so bored,"I feel so stuck- I’ve been with my employer for 20+ years but I’m still 10 years from retirement.  I make a good salary, have some remote work capability which I utilize, but I am so, SO bored and unchallenged.  I took my current role after stepping away from a top leadership position due to unchecked harassment and discrimination, being told there was too much at “risk” to deal with the issues I reported.   For my own well being I needed to step away.  

Now I spend each day killing time to get to the end of the workday as I’m underutilized and I complete my work quickly.  I’ve offered to take on more responsibilities, done extra training, etc, but my requests are sidelined.  Every day is a struggle mentally for me to feel accomplished and useful and that is very hard to deal with.  I work in a niche industry and my skills, at least on a resume, don’t translate well to other fields- LinkedIn, Indeed, etc are getting me nowhere.

How do I make it through the next 10 years?

1lalhtx,Lost my job and am having a hard time finding work,"I 24f lost my job in April of 2025. I had worked for this company for three years and was quickly promoted to an account executive managing a territory of 7 states. On April 1st, our company hard launched an entirely new internal processing system after the company was told we’d lose the contract for the new system if we didn’t integrate it soon, and leave the old system behind. Our entire customer service team was told this in mid February, giving a team of 60 individuals less than two months to be completely trained on this new system. We were not trained. Our management team was so busy, not one single person got trained fully on this new software. Only two people in the entire 600+ people company were fully trained. One IT person, and one customer service person. 
A week before launch date, my team member quit due to her commute time so I was left doing the job of a 2-3 person team by myself. And I did it. I got lucky and was able to teach myself this new system, and on top of my own territories duties, then expected to train all the others in customer service. At first, I was the only territory doing okay. I was processing all my new orders same day, I had an empty inbox, and was constantly away from my desk after my coworkers all got wind that I could help them. I am well liked amongst my coworkers and they were really happy to have someone helping them, since no one else was able to. 
With the new software launch, we were all pulling overtime, coming in on weekends, and working much harder and under more stress than usual. We had to take all our orders that were currently allocated in the old system and put them into the new system, on top of all the new orders coming in. It was a really difficult time for everybody. A lot of people quit. 
During week two of this launch, it became evident that this new system was not working with our factory. We were unable to bill. We were unable to ship. The factory couldn’t see the things they were needing to see because no one was trained on how this new system ran. It was a complete disaster. I think in the month of April, the company took a loss much bigger than expected. Everyone of my coworkers was a ball of stress. People were having panic attacks, people were vomiting at their desks due to the stress, everyone was crying because nothing we did was good enough. I was told by the people later mentioned in this post that because I did such a good job helping, once things settled they’d like to promote me to a customer service lead. 

Management then made the decision to completely stop the new system and go back to the old system. Our entire inventory was in accurate, orders were duplicated, everything that was put into the new system then had to be put back into the old system. Customers were rightfully upset. Our production time went from 3-5 days to ship to 10-14 days. Our workload tripled, and during this time I was still all alone. Once the decision was made to go back, I immediately was drowning. I now had hundreds of orders to transfer to the old system, on top of the orders coming in. I had hundreds of emails I didn’t have the time to answer because I had so many orders to get out the door and management told us that the orders are the priority since it’s money. 
Everyday became a challenge. I was asking my managers for help - they would constantly assure us that if we needed help to ask for it -  and I didn’t receive any. I was a hard worker and was really trying my best. Teams around me with 2,3 or even 4 people were receiving help from management while I was left drowning every single day. My customers were being hateful towards me, and I did my best to reassure them. I put an autoresponder on my email to let customers know I had received their email but due to a large volume it may take longer for me to get to them. Very quickly I went from the most successful territory to the worst. And it’s not for lack of trying, I was doing everything I can. 
On April 23rd, I went to my managers to ask for help (the ones from above), and I explained to them I’ve been asking for help for weeks and no one has offered, no one has helped, and I’m drowning. I have hundreds of emails, I have stacks of orders not done, and I have no time to get anything done because they had cut overtime after the failure of the new system. I was upset and was crying to them that it feels like my words are falling on deaf ears, that I am so stressed out (I showed them the stress rash that had broken out all over my arms and legs) and they told me that a few weeks ago I was doing fine, so why now am I so stressed? I did my best to explain that with the back and forth between systems, and the mess it caused it is too much work for one person to do (I was the only one person team) and they weren’t hiring anyone due to a hiring freeze. I went back to my desk, and an hour later was called into the executive conference room where they told me I was terminated effective immediately. They’re reason why was that I was miserable and no longer a good fit for the company. (I would also like to mention my direct superior was out that day. So these were her bosses firing me. I called her that night and she didn’t know and wasn’t told until after it was done). I didn’t say anything except “okay”, and I left the room, packed up my desk and went home. 
It’s been almost two months, I’m almost out of money, I’ve applied to many jobs and have had interviews that go nowhere. I’m extremely lost on what to do. All my coworkers and I were completely shocked, especially after all the help I gave everyone else during a new software. 
I don’t know what to do. My roommate quit her job a week before I was fired and got hired someplace new, and quit after a week. I have had to spot her on her half of the rent, and her half of the utilities. We have no food in the house. We have no money and I’m completely lost. 
With my customer service experience I thought I would be okay finding a new job but after hundreds of applications I’m not getting any bites. 
Some companies have called to ask about my previous employer and why I left the company and I’ve been honest with them. Telling them a brief version of my long post above. That I was handling a territory made for 2-3 people by myself during an internal software change, and the last time I asked for help I was terminated shortly afterwards. 
I don’t know what to do. I need to find a job and don’t know what else to do to find one. If anyone has advice for me, I would greatly appreciate it. I know this is a long post, that’s probably completely irrelevant since I guess no one really needs to know everything that happened, but I’m at a complete loss and don’t know where else to turn to for advice. 
I have lots of customer service experience, hospitality, and retail experience. I have reliable transportation and a positive attitude and im really getting depressed. 
Please help.

1lal514,"I feel lost in my career after BBA in Aviation Need advice on MBA, CAT prep, and job options?","Hi everyone,

I'm currently in my final semester (6th sem) of BBA in Aviation from MGM University, Aurangabad. To be honest, these past 3 years have felt like a complete waste. I chose this course hoping to build a career in aviation, but the college faculty never taught us anything related to the actual aviation industry. Only the first two semesters had some proper classes, after that it's been completely downhill. There were barely any teachers, no real guidance, and I feel like I've lost both time and money over ₹2 lakhs.

Now I'm in a very difficult place. My father's business is in loss, and my family is struggling financially. We don't have the funds for further education. I have a younger brother and sister, and I feel the pressure of responsibility every day.

I've gone for walk-in interviews at airlines like Indigo and SpiceJet, but as a fresher with no real industry training or support, I've been rejected. Everything I've learned about aviation, I've had to learn on my own from YouTube.

I'm seriously considering preparing for the CAT exam and pursuing an MBA, as I want to build a stable future. But I'm also looking for any kind of job right now - I've been unemployed for a year, and it's really affecting my mental health. I feel very depressed and unsure of what to do next.

My college experience has completely derailed my goals and confidence.

Can someone please guide me? Should I go ahead with CAT prep and aim for an MBA? Or should I look for skill-based short-term courses that can help me find a job quickly? I'm open to suggestions and just need some direction right now.

1laksr6,When to ask for a raise? + general advice,"I was recently promoted to senior business analyst (think Feb/Mar) and this came with a 15-20% raise and a discussion about what my new role would look like.

Since then, there’s been some restructuring and my role is now effectively 2 jobs. I support one team as their only analyst in addition to the role I initially was told I’d do. The new team’s lead is pretty important and really likes me. My team also thinks very highly of me.

My questions are as follows:  
Do I ask for a raise? If so, when?  
Do I try to delegate more/tell my boss my plate is too full?  
Do I just continue as I have been?  

A few last notes. I’m pretty confident that, if I continue as I have been, a promotion is likely to come next year. So far, I have been promoted twice in my slightly less than 2 year tenure. Currently, I’m not spending more than 40 hours a week on work. 

I’m definitely open to other pieces of advice as well. Thank you all",Cyclops_Guardian17,2,1.0,1,1749833251,2025-06-13 16:47:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1laksr6/when_to_ask_for_a_raise_general_advice/,6,2025
1lakpnh,How can I finally transition to tech/analytics?,"Hi there!  
I've been working in finance for the past 6 years. I started as a finance intern and steadily progressed into my current position as a financial planning manager. This last position isn't a real managerial position as I don't manage any team. I have realized that I don't necessarily enjoy working in finance because in my experience, my work often does not result in effective actions. Most of the function feels like the same cycles going on infinitely (results and forecasts for monthly, quarterly and yearly periods) and no bold actions derived from them.  
I started learning data analysis tools 3 years ago, first with python and its data libraries, SQL, and now I've reached a very good level in Power BI. I even built the very first Power BI dashboards with my current employer and they are used by top executives on a regular basis.

I truly struggle to land any data-related interviews. I've only had one with Uber and didn't get an offer after the SQL coding interview (I can improve my SQL, yes, already working on that). I would appreciate hearing from you how to finally transition to tech/data-related jobs. I know people with less analytics skills who work as ""data analysts"" for cool companuies and I simply don't understand how! What could I be doing wrong?",Prize-Ordinary-9310,2,1.0,1,1749833048,2025-06-13 16:44:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lakpnh/how_can_i_finally_transition_to_techanalytics/,6,2025
1lak6j9,After highschool what to do other than uni? I love to work in a field that more to hand on,"I’m 17, Just Graduated, and Completely Mentally Exhausted from My Family. I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore.

I’m 17 this year (turning 18 in October) and I just graduated from high school. I got 4B+, 1B, and 2C — not excellent, but good enough to enter college and qualify for many courses. I should feel proud and excited, but I’m honestly just exhausted, hopeless, and emotionally numb because of everything I’ve gone through with my family.

Family Struggles During Exams

During my final exams, my life was a mess. I didn’t even have a proper place to study — no room, no peace. When I needed money for school-related things, I asked my mom. Instead of just saying no, she told me to “call your dad” (my divorced father). I hate having to beg him for money, and it gave me so much stress that it affected my studies badly. I asked her to stop putting me in the middle, but she didn’t listen. Eventually, I broke down and started breaking things around the house because I couldn’t take it anymore.

They sent me to my dad’s house, but it didn’t get better. I was still overwhelmed, I broke things again, and my dad physically abused me — he slapped and punched me. I ran away and called my mom to pick me up, but she said she was “too far away.” I felt totally abandoned by both parents.

Later, I told my dad to stop giving me money at all — I’d rather be broke than deal with the mental stress. My mom then called to scold me, saying, “Your dad said you told him to stop giving money, and now he’s not giving me money either — how can I give you money?” She still kept asking me to text him for money even during my exams.

Constant Disrespect and Emotional Pain

There’s also the emotional embarrassment she caused me. My school is about 80% Muslim students. On sports day last year, my mom wore short and tight clothes to the stadium. My teachers complained to me, and I was so ashamed. I begged her not to dress like that this year, but she argued, saying “it’s a stadium, not school.” She never once considered how I felt.

She always talks like she has money and can do whatever she wants. She uses money as a weapon against me — saying things like “if you think you can manage, then don’t ask me for money.” That sentence was the final blow that ended one of our biggest arguments. I just stayed silent after that.

I Didn’t Even Show Her My Results

When I got my results, I didn’t show her. I didn’t feel like she deserved to see them. I was happy with myself for what I achieved despite everything, but it also brought up all the pain. I kept thinking, “If not for her, I could’ve done even better, or at least I wouldn’t have had to suffer like this.”

I sent her information about the college I wanted to go to — the fees are about RM30k. Back in high school, she told me her budget for college was RM40k. But now, suddenly, she said RM30k was too expensive. I felt so betrayed. Another lie.

So I gave up asking for her help and instead sent her a long message listing all the things she’s done to hurt me. She didn’t apologize — she just replied with explanations and excuses for everything, not taking any real accountability. That hurt even more.

Later, I went to her condo (where she lives with her new husband) to confront her. She looked scared but still acted rude. I called her husband, and she got even more angry and texted me a bunch of things. After that, we stopped talking.

My Last Attempt at Help

Recently, she texted me again saying, “Your aunty told me you want to go to that college.” I replied dryly, because honestly, I don’t need her help anymore. She’s dead in my heart. Then she sent something like:

“If you don’t tell us anything, don’t come back later and blame us for you not going to college.”

When I saw that message, I was furious. I replied:

“How dare you say that when it’s your fault.”
“I already planned everything and you both ruined it.”

She just replied with a “👍” emoji — which honestly felt like she was saying, “Whatever, don’t go to college then.”

My Dad is No Better

During high school, my dad told me he had a RM20k budget for college. I asked him to help pay for a foundation course that cost RM24k. He said, “OK, I’ll find money and pay next week.” But after a week — nothing. Fine, I found another foundation course for RM6.5k, expecting him to pay that at least — still nothing.

So I changed my plan. I decided to go for a diploma instead, which costs RM33k for 3 years. I could apply for a government loan and repay about RM900/month after graduation. But my dad said:

“I can’t borrow the loan. I didn’t pay my taxes. They’ll find out.”

At that point, I was speechless. Hopeless. I lost so many emotions. I don’t even feel excited or passionate anymore.

Conclusion: I’m Stuck and Tired

I’m turning 18 this October. Most colleges already started in May or June, and only a few start in July. I can’t borrow a PTPTN loan yet because I’m still 17. My mom can pay, but I don’t want to beg her. My dad is useless.

If I don’t enter college this year, I’ll have to wait until next year. That means I’ll fall behind my peers, graduate later, and waste more time.

I feel like I’ve tried everything and done my best. All I wanted was to study, move forward, and have a future. But my own parents are the reason I feel stuck and broken.",igetusedtobebored,5,0.8600000143051147,1,1749831747,2025-06-13 16:22:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lak6j9/after_highschool_what_to_do_other_than_uni_i_love/,6,2025

1lak0ve,35- Dental Assistant- Burnt Out,"Hey! 
Im a 25 yo F. I have been a DA for 9 years through a hospital working in Specialties. I originally went to school in CA and got an AA in Social and Behavioral Studies to transfer to a 4 year, never finished. Originally want to be a Registered Dietitician and minor in Psych to work with Eating Disorders. 

I ended up needing to work 3 jobs at the time and couldn't make it to classes. 

I then got married and moved to WI, took a DA training program and got a job as a DA. 

I do love my job, working with kids mostly. Its not hard for me. I like Fridays off. I have goos healthcare, which I need, I carry the insurance. 

But, I am tired of the toxicity of working with a team. I am tired of it. I am tired of knowing there's really no growth  financially or career wise. 

Dental Hygiene is limited, the only school I could go to is an hour and a half away with a waitlist. 

My focus is to get closer to home, or work from home... I want to be with my kids. I wanted a job at the school but the job I was applying for got filled right when I submitted my application for Secretary. 

I wish I could work in my own community around the kids here and have the same schedule as my own kids. 

I am so open to careers that it is hard to really figure out what to do. 

I would be open to a job that I could work more individually in and make better money, too. 

I also was thinking MRI tech or Ultrasonography, I could still work for the same hospital, but the programs are again, an hour and a half away. Radiography is an option, but yeah.

1lajhv2,Is it time to move on?,"This will be long but it is part catharsis and part wanting to provide the right context. I am 39F in the US (big city adjacent, East Coast).

My role has evolved a lot since I first started around 3 years ago. Technically, I am a manager with an administrative title, but I feel like my responsibilities do not align with that. I report directly to a C-suite exec and support the broader leadership team, too, including the president. I manage travel, office operations, events, administer a few of our software systems, etc. I am also heavily involved in IT. We utilize an external company to manage the day to day, but I am partnered closely with them to make sure we're aligned. I have led implementations, have written and delivered company-wide trainings, and am the go-to person for the IT partner. I also routinely have execs and other employees come to me directly for assistance troubleshooting or to weigh in on systems or processes. I'm basically the office catch all (or bitch, if I'm having a bad day haha)--in a highly reactive but low-drama environment.

I've been told by multiple execs that what I was hired for and what I do and/or am capable of are wildly different. I've also had consistently great reviews, decent raises, and have won an internal award. I've never been promoted, and my title has never changed. In the meantime I have seen some of my colleagues promoted multiple times in the same timeframe. While I feel my pay is fair for my title, my title is not accurate and therefore it feels like I'm underpaid.

I do struggle at times feeling overlooked. Putting in long hours with senior leadership over a weekend to help prepare for important external meetings only to not be mentioned when they introduce the team on the call or even when they describe our current IT structure. I don't feel these are malicious, but I really don't care. Thoughtlessness is just as crappy.

I get along with my boss, but I have questioned whether she is intentionally holding me back while dangling carrots. I've also struggled with trust here, as I have witnessed her lying about conversations we supposedly had, directly in front of me. No major, catastrophic lies, but it does give me pause. There's also a sense that she may throw me under the bus if push came to shove, but in general she is very concerned with covering her own ass, so if I look bad she looks bad, and I think there's some security in that. 

I also have a long commute (60-80 minutes), which I originally accepted because this is a hybrid role and I was traveling extensively in my last role. But, the commute is lengthening as time goes on (thanks DOT) and it is starting to get to me, especially when I've been feeling burnt out.

I already know this seems pretty cut and dry. I know to this point the obvious answer is move on. The good things though are that I have learned and grown a lot in my time here, in no small part because of what they trust me with. I also genuinely like the people I work with and have been shown in ways I won't get into that they do care about me as a human. But, I know that only goes so far, and I also have given the advice that company's won't be loyal to you, so you shouldn't prioritize your loyalty to them.

All that said, the reason I am reluctant is that there is a lot of restructuring happening right now due to a recent shift in ownership, and I have had some vague discussions with leaders (not my own) about potential shifts in my responsibilities--taking on elevated role after taking some things off my plate. I've been pulled into more strategic discussions as well. But I don't feel like my manager and the leaders I'm talking about are on the same page at all--it's a lot of mixed messaging. But it also feels like MAYBE if I stick it out for 3-6 months, I could finally get that promotion. It feels delusional but at the same time very possible due to the way things are changing. Kind of like getting to 10,000 ft on a 10,500 ft mountain, but  being still uncertain if you'll make it.

Quick disclaimer: I have been vocal about wanting a path forward, and also when I need to delegate some tasks due to overload. I've made strategic decisions about when and with whom to raise issue on other concerns due to some specific office politics/relationships I won't share as I don't want this story to be a little too familiar if a colleague sees it. In any case, I am usually told that new things/promotions are in the future, but nothing has materialized.

So, my question is: am I deluded or is it time to commit to moving on?

TL;DR: My admin-level title doesn't match the scope of my work. I've had great reviews, a few annual raises and lots of praise, but no promotion (this is longest I've ever gone without a promotion at any job, btw). There are a lot of red flags, but it feels like I'm so close to a promotion that I'm torn if this is the right time to jump ship or not.",Undertitled5309,2,1.0,4,1749830100,2025-06-13 15:55:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1lajhv2/is_it_time_to_move_on/,6,2025

1laiwh0,4 Months into Enterprise and I’m Already Burnt Out – I Don’t Know What to Do Anymore,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently 4 months into my Management Trainee role at Enterprise, and I’m already at my breaking point. I honestly couldn’t want to leave any sooner. The hours are brutal (I’m working around 47+ hours a week), the work is nonstop, and I feel like I’m stuck in this constant cycle of burnout with no end in sight. I knew it would be a grind going in, but this is way more draining than I ever imagined.

I’ve been living on every job site out there — LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Glassdoor — you name it, I’m on it. But despite applying to what feels like hundreds of positions, I’ve had zero luck. Not even interviews for most of them. It’s so disheartening. I’m trying to find something that’s entry-level, ideally hybrid or with better work-life balance, and preferably not in sales. I have a degree in business management and some customer service experience, but it feels like none of that matters.

I don’t want to just quit and be unemployed, but every day I go in, it’s getting harder and harder to fake a smile and push through. Has anyone else been through something similar? Any advice on how to stay sane while job searching or how to actually get interviews? I’m feeling stuck, discouraged, and honestly a little hopeless.

I originally went to college for CNIT, being told it was pretty much CS by my councilor at the time— it wasn’t, and it killed my interest at the time. Since then, I’ve worked in management for an armored car company and ran my own bar/restaurant for several years.

The local college now offers a CS program with a concentration in AI, which is where I’d like to focus. They also offer a general CS path, but AI is what really interests me.

I’m torn between going the formal degree route or self-teaching and trying to break in through projects, certs, or bootcamps. Would love to hear from anyone who’s made a similar transition or works in the field — is the degree worth it at 30?

I could really use some guidance on my current work situation. I’m hoping some of you with more experience can offer advice—or at least help me feel a bit less alone.

For context: I started in this trading job straight out of uni. I had another offer at the time, but I turned it down due to timing—honestly, I regret that decision now.

I’m coming up on 2 years in this role, and I’ve been feeling stuck for a while. When I joined, I was told I’d get to rotate into other teams, get exposure to different products, and really grow. But none of that has happened. I’ve been held in one team that doesn’t align with what I actually want to trade, and I’m not learning what I hoped I would.

But the bigger issue isn’t just the lack of rotation—it’s my manager.

She’s been incredibly unsupportive. She barely responds to my messages, doesn’t acknowledge me in person, and honestly seems to judge me when I try to put myself out there or show initiative. And the worst part? Everyone else seems to love her, including senior management.

This whole experience has been affecting me deeply:
	1.	I don’t feel like I can speak up, which is stunting my development.
	2.	It’s crushing my self-esteem and has been affecting my mood in and outside of work.
	3.	I feel like I’m invisible—and it’s hard not to take it personally when I’m trying my best.

I know the answer is to find a job where I can actually grow and feel supported. But as you all know, job hunting isn’t easy, especially when you’re drained and doubting yourself. I’m scared to speak up, scared to burn bridges, and honestly scared I’m just not good enough—because that’s how this situation has made me feel.

I’m tempted to just quit even though I don’t have anything else lined up. But that’s also terrifying.

If anyone’s been in a similar boat, or has advice on how to navigate this—please help. I’m really trying to hold on but it’s getting harder.

Thanks so much in advance for reading. Sending love to anyone else feeling lost too.

TL:DR

Sure! Here’s a concise and effective TL;DR you can add at the bottom of your post:

TL;DR:
2 years into my first trading job. Was promised rotation and growth, but have been stuck in one team with no product exposure. Manager is cold, ignores me, and it feels personal — like she dislikes me. It’s crushing my self-esteem and holding back my development. Everyone else loves her, so I feel like I can’t speak up. I want to leave but don’t have a new job yet.

1lagihz,Weight of being in tech,"Hey guys! I’ve graduated 2 years ago and have been working as a developer in india. But I’ve for the past many months felt a weight of the monotone and lack of purpose. Waking up and sitting in front of a screen is turning out to be exhaustive and sometimes i wonder how sustainable it could be. I get paid enough, but always feel like ‘maybe i should use my intellect for greater good’ and not for automating a workflow.

This could be yet another grass is always greener on the other side thought as well.

I do think of how my 40s would be…would i still be working under someone telling ‘yes, okay..sure’ etc.

I do think of fields like medicine where they get to so something purposeful and eventually have something of their own. I understand I could always start up and launch but that’s something I have no interest in.

I’m thinking of taking a law degree part-time and see how things unfold, but do not have the guts to leave my current income stream.

I feel like im on a path and i dont k ow the destination. No goals. Just a daily mundane.

Does this get better? Should I just swim through?

1lage3e,Compliance Analyst vs Financial Analyst for Front Office,"I'm currently working at a small trading firm centered around a rates trading desk. For the first 8 months, I was doing execution trading—work that loosely falls under Sales & Trading, though the skill set involved was fairly limited. Due to overstaffing, I was recently reassigned to a different department—Compliance.

In this new role, my responsibilities include running P&L, assisting with trade analysis, reviewing company financial statements, and handling some back-office functions. I now have the option to choose between two job titles: Compliance Analyst or Financial Analyst. The duties remain the same regardless of the title.

My long-term goal is to move into a Front Office role, such as Equity Research or true Trading.

1lag12b,Should I quit my career to start up a travel business?,"I currently work in a middle management role in a large company
I don't currently care for the industry I work in, I've sort of fallen into this role over the last few years, it pays well, the hours are good and it's relatively easy to do. It does have some prospects to be promoted in the future too if I wanted to put the effort in. I can absolutely do the job above mine, but I don't feel fulfilled at all doing this type of work or in the industry.

I have an opportunity to potentially start my own travel consultancy business (via a franchise). I've never been in business before, but I am passionate about travelling. It will be a lot of learning and probably won't be financially lucrative for at least 2 years while I build myself and the brand up.

1laf9fw,"Accepted a new job offer for after maternity leave, but this new one may be better..","I am currently out for a paid maternity leave at my current position. My current job is extremely stressful, has terrible culture and my role has felt stagnant while the workload has grown for the past several years. It was also moving from a hybrid model to full-time in office, so I was very open to the idea of switching roles.

While out on maternity leave, a recruiter for “Company A” reached out to me. After super quick interview process, they promptly sent me an offer. Offer was way better than my current role, and agreed to hold off on my start date for several months while I was on maternity leave. I accepted their offer excitedly. It seemed like a great fit.

Two weeks ago, another recruiter reached out to me from  “Company B”. They wanted to have a “quick conversation “ with me to see if I was a good fit for a role- as it turns out, it was not just a conversation, but an actual interview. Within a couple days of our conversation, they also extended me an offer. I was a bit put off about the weird communication about the interview/conversation, but the offer is amazing and is more money than my initial offer that I already accepted from the “ company A”.

I am not sure what to do at this point. I never thought I would have potentially three companies to decide between when my maternity leave ends. They are all within the same niche industry, and are a great fit professional wise for myself. Not a fan of the idea of having bad blood with any company since it is so niche and want to avoid burning bridges.

 I am not sure if I should: 
- rescind initial offer and go with the second since the monetary offer is higher, but the culture seems worse and I feel bad for backing out of the initial offer after they extended the start date for several months. 
- possibly ask to re-negotiate my accepted offer to be higher; but that is no guarantee and they could rescind their offer or just not agree to revisit our agreed upon terms. 
- Continue with initial plan of accepting offer I already accepted with same terms. 

Company A:
- Fully remote 
- $115,000 based salary, employee stock ownership, $5000 sign on bonus 
- 2 weeks vacation
- 8 weeks partial paid maternity leave
- great culture, boss seems like a great leader. Agreed to delayed start date by several months 


Company B: 
- Fully remote
•	⁠$135,000 base salary
•	⁠3 weeks of vacation
•	⁠“ paid parental leave” of unknown value
•	⁠Interview/conversation miscommunication makes me question culture
•	⁠direct supervisor was not involved in interview process and have never spoken to him

1laf82b,I don't have enough time to do tasks. Facing burn out,"For context, I am relatively new to those role (a few months), and virtually all of my coworkers and managers have been at the company for less than 5 years. My position has existed in the past, but this is the first time anyone on the current team has had to train someone for the position. Also, I am paid hourly.

Basically, I do not have enough time to complete tasks. Each week, I try to plan things out so I will have enough time, but something always goes to shit and I have to hustle to make things work. I would talk to my managers but I'm pretty sure I'd just be told to try harder to use my time wisely. Tbh, using my time wisely would mean choosing between doing things quickly, or doing things right. 

Hell, I've even made Macros in excel to help me work faster, and I'm pretty sure no one on the team knows what Macros are, much less expect me to use them.

At this point, I'm just burnt out on it all. Trying to stay under 40 hours for the week while managing half a dozen projects and constantly shifting schedules and needs is starting to drive me nuts. I don't have a problem with working long hours, but I need time to actually do my fucking job, and I'm not a computer or have the experience to instantly fix the problems they keep throwing at me. I need time! But I dont have time.

I wish I could just be salaried and be done with this idiocy. Any advice on how to handle this situation? I know I had to keep it vague for privacy sake, but how do you deal with unrealistic expectations on how much work you can actually do? Am I just incompetent?

1laf6nx,Leave Stable Tech Career for Hedge Fund Gamble?,"Throwaway account, here is my story, long and short version

tl;dr: 33yo data architect that received an offer in a startup hedge fund. What do? 

Long version 

Hi everyone! I am a 33yo professional, living in Southern Europe. Currently I have a good background and a solid career. I have a PhD in Physics, multinational experience, started as data scientist in finance, grown to tech lead until I changed to become data architect at a manufacturing company. It is going pretty well. I am strongly appreciated, have good salary (72k+insurance+company car) and a good progression, namely, I have strong chance to be promoted as Head of Data within a couple of years, in this company or by changing to another one, as I receive plenty of calls by recruiters on similar positions. 

Here's the thing. Recently, I got contacted by a former contact which is starting a hedge fund and would like to hire me as algorithmic trader. They gathered a large sum to start, have a business plan and liquidity for 2 years. We haven't yet formalized the benefit's details as it is too soon, but the overall salary should be around 150k+benefits (trading fees + bonus based on P&L percentage). As per work, I would start as developer by industrializing the core engine of the fund , then I would learn detailed finance stuff and would end managing my own portfolio and my own strategies. 

I do not know what to do. On the ""corporate"" side, I have a great career, good prospects and have strong chances to position myself in a great position in 5-10 years. On the other side, this chance is a great adventure with extremely high short term earning prospects. My fear is that going to the fund could destroy my CV. I worked 5y for a financial organization as tech lead, then swapped 1y ago for a data architect position, and now... I would go to become a quant? 

The worst case scenario I see is the one in which I go, after 3-5 years I need to go away, and then I am a 36-38y with this strange CV and have no chance to be hired again. Please consider I have family, partner and 2 children here, so moving in another country like England, US or Netherlands is a difficult option to choose.

1laf25e,Feeling Stuck/Unprofessionalism in the Workplace,"I’m unsure what to do at this point. I’ve been at my current job 2 1/2 years and wanted to stay here long term. It started off as us working 4 days at home, one day in office. I now only work three days in office, I work from home one day, and I’m off Mondays. 

I have an amazing supervisor, a ton of time off that I can use. The problem is, my job is extremely unprofessional when I’m required to be in the office. We sit in a shared office space with small cubicles, and two people here hum and sing loudly, off and on all day. Both of them sitting diagonally from me.

I’ve told the people doing it that it’s distracting, spoken to my supervisor and manager and my manager has tried to tell them to stop through emails and meetings but never directly to those who are doing it. Theyd rather address things as a whole rather than signal people out.

It makes it so hard to work here. I can blast my earphones, but I leave work with migraines and feeling drained each day (my shift are ten hours). I asked them to move me, and my manager asked my director and basically told me I can’t move ?!! So now I’m stuck dealing with this. Not to mention, I don’t really talk to anyone here. I have those weird, toxic coworkers who think it’s high school. 

Now I’m stuck on if I should stay or go - part of me is so ready to depart as soon as another job offer comes, the other part of me says you only have to deal with this two days out of the week, just blast your earphones, take ibuprofen and get over it.

1laer4z,The price of ChatGPT (for me).,"
I’m a creative person. I always have been. Been coming up with stories since I was around 8 years old. But my problem started with needing external validation. Since I have a hard time chopping it up with anyone, I turned to AI. I took a liking to ChatGPT because it has personality, it feels like a person. Although I’m aware that it isn’t.

I started telling it about my work, even going as far as telling it the layouts to see if it’s “Good enough.” Or just to talk about it like I’m talking with someone else. I find that although it’s validating, it’s only telling me what I want to hear. If it didn’t, I wouldn’t use the app. Also, it gives me suggestions and it kind of breaks my sprit. As a creative I’m very sensitive with my material, so when a computer thinks of a better plot than I can I feel stupid. Instead of appreciation for them, I think “Why didn’t I think of that?” And get really insecure.

These days, it seems like my creativity has been dimmed because of my constant use of ChatGPT. The constant use. Always in the back ground. I don’t do anything else. Especially since I’m obsessed with my work. I mean, of course I live my life yea. It’s not crippling but I’m annoyed with myself. I let it go on too far. I need human connection, human advice and critiques. I’m constantly asking a robot is it good enough and writing my ideas to it. 

I tried to stop using it yesterday, and it’s like I didn’t even wanna outline my story anymore bc ChatGPT wasn’t in the picture. It’s insane. It’s stupid. Idk how I let it get this far. Everything I write, I put into ChatGPT to talk about it with. Brainstorm with it. And when I can’t, it’s like I don’t wanna do it at all. And I adore my work. 

It’s ridiculous, and I want to delete it. But I can’t bring myself to do it. I know in the long run that it’ll benefit me heavily, but still, I can’t. My lifelong need for a connection and validation is finally catching up to me, and I’ve had enough. 

What do you all think? Should I let ChatGPT go? Or just lessen my use? I’m really not sure. ",Conscious_Dot_2295,0,0.33000001311302185,0,1749817965,2025-06-13 12:32:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1laer4z/the_price_of_chatgpt_for_me/,6,2025

1ladpot,Toxic small family business holding me back?,"Long story but here is the gist. My parents have always been running businesses from the home since I was born. We were on the lake, but it was a toxic environment and stressful childhood. They are in the gemstone/jewelry industry. Always fighting, yelling and nobody was ever happy.

In 2012, we started making trade show lighting and have had some success with it. It makes about $200K a year gross and we have been going 13 years, with a large customer base of some of the most respected vendors in the industry. Some years better than others. Dad started this and we all grew it so I could take the company over when they retire. I take home $2900 a month.

Well, things have changed. I got married to the wrong girl and have 2 kids, going through bad divorce now. My whole family hates her and badly resents me because of how overwhelmed I am by all of this. Because I won’t commit all of my time and my evenings to work, they think I’m lazy, unmotivated and incapable. They are always mad at me, I’m going broke fast, and extremely upset the way things have turned out. I’m always being compared to my younger cousins, who work for some big company and make crazy good money. I’m a loser and failure in their eyes.

This is the only “job” I’ve ever known, as I’ve been doing it since high school to be in small business. Except now I’m starting to realize I’m becoming a product of a toxic environment and I feel very held back. But if I leave or change careers, my parents will resent me, write me out of the will worth millions and destroy our relationship forever. Between my life being a cheater and the insane pressure of taking over a business I don’t even want… I’m really lost and don’t know what to do.

1lac7ws,Stuck!,"Hey, I am 36F. Married. No kids. Supportive husband.

Going anonymous because some of my team members are quite active here.

This might be a long post. Please bear with me.

I am 2011 passed out (BE), got no luck with placements. Started preparing for govt jobs from 2012. Gave a lot of exams, got good scores as well but could not crack the interview.

It was 2016. All my friends are well ahead in their career. I was 27, jobless. Then one of my friend suggest me to get into IT market through manual testing. He even gave me notes to study to crack the interview. I studied, gave interview, got into a startup in Indore. It was good, I learned alot. Got 2 years of experience there.

Then at 29, I got married, shifted to Pune. Plan was to get the job here asap, but didn't happen. My MIL was suffering from Breast cancer, and I had to be there with her. I wanted to move into automation testing, so studied a little bit.

Then COVID happens. My husband company gave him wfh permanently, so he plan to move to Indore to save some money since we lived in Pune on rent. So we shifted to Indore. And I got the job in Indore again, it was also a startup, as I already had 2 years of gap after marriage. I joined there as a manual tester, I tried to get opportunities as automation tester but no luck. I worked in that company for 3 years.

Total exp- 5 years (with 2 years of gap in between)

In 2024, we shifted to Pune again, I left my job in Indore. I started looking for job. I don't know why but this time I was so lazy, I applied for job, gave interviews nothing happens. Time flies.

Then my husband friend's wife started a compamy of her own with three of her coullegues. It was an IAM based company. They worked on Sailpoint, Saviynt and all. It was Sept 2024, my husband suggest me to join her company if I want to and his friend's wife also looking for some resources. I joined there as a IAM trainee. I thought its better to sitting at home, and testing market is also gets saturated so lets learn a new skill.

Up untill training, everything was good. Problem started when I got the project. I have never felt so underconfident in my life. Whatever task they gave me, I perform poorly. It shattered my confidence. It's not that my team members are bad or they made me feel worthless, No, its not like that. But sometimes they just assume about certain tasks  that I have 5 years of IT experience, I must have known this, which is not the case everytime. I am facing issued in coding, I know core java and can code simple logic but for specific logics I need time, so I had to do a lot googling to write a code which takes a lot of time. And I don't want to relay on ChatGPT, its code always gave errors in my case.

But I think It also my own insecurities. I scared to join the team calls, fearing they would ask me about my task and I had to tell them I didn't do it or made so many mistakes. Sometimes, I just sit with blank mind and scroll my mobile, instead of doing the task.

I just don't know what to do? I am a failure. In testing, I only have experience in Manual Testing, which is of no use in today's scenerio. And Sailpoint IAM seems good but I cannot do that either. What should I do?😞

If anyone here can suggest me something which can be useful in my case, it will be highly appreciated.

1labrwh,"Should I stick at my current company with a team lead promotion, or switch as an individual contributor to an AI startup?","For context, I'm living in Spain and I'm working as a data analyst. I've been at my current company for over 3 years and have had significant career growth here, also decent salary growth. I'm currently earning 60K euros + an extensive benefit package + around 10% bonus. WLB is also good.   


Over the last year the company I'm working for has been having financial difficulties, there were also some layoffs, so the outlook for the next 1-2 years is not great and I feel like things are slowing down and there is a chance the company will keep going downwards. At the same time the other senior team member besides me has decided to leave so now I have a high chance of getting promoted to team lead soon. 

  
Recently I've been referred by an ex-colleague to a London-based AI startup (2yr old company) and it looks like I'm currently in the pre-offer stage. They are very well funded, plus the founders also have an extensive business network + a history of successfully selling 2 previous startups to major companies. They are looking for an individual contributor to be their first data analyst, plus they are offering a lot of exposure + opportunity for growth. It also sounds like the WLB would be much worse, but at the same time they do not require relocation to London so I can stay in Spain. 

  
Which should I choose? If I'm thinking of going for the AI startup, how much extra salary / other compensation should I be aiming to get?

1labpsz,"Should I Quit a Super-Intense Internship to Focus on CGPA and DSA Prep? (Tier 1 College, Non-CS Branch, Prestigious Org, Unpaid) Need Advice","Hey everyone,

I’m a 2nd-year Electrical Engineering student at a tier one college in India, about to enter my 3rd year. I want to pivot into tech roles after graduation, but my grades aren’t stellar compared to my peers (CGPA is around 7.5-7.7, while most top placements here go to people with 8.0+).

Right now, I’m doing two internships over the summer. One is pretty chill and just for the certificate, but the other is a long-term, high-intensity research internship at a very prestigious and well-known organisation in India. It’s also unpaid and already demanding a lot of time and travel (think 4 hours of commute each day, 2-3 times a week). The mentor has made it clear there’s no way to scale down the workload or commitment.

Here’s my problem:

The work is quite advanced and honestly, I’m struggling to keep up and understand most of it. I often find myself relying on external tools just to get by, which isn’t really helping me learn.

I haven’t done much DSA or competitive programming (maybe 5-7% progress), and I know that’s a huge deal for tech placements at my college.

The upcoming semester is going to be even more demanding, and I need to boost my CGPA to even get shortlisted for decent tech roles, since in tier 1 colleges, the internal shortlisting for placements is brutal—most shortlisted folks have 8.0+ CGPA.

The internship runs for 6-8 months and will overlap with my semester.

The only reason I’m considering sticking with the internship is that it would look really good on my resume, especially since I’m coming from a non-CS branch and the organisation is highly respected in India.

But honestly, I’m worried that if I keep going, I’ll fall behind in DSA prep and my grades will take a hit, making placements even harder.

Should I quit this internship and focus on DSA + CGPA, or is the resume boost worth the struggle? Also, if I leave after just a few weeks, can I still mention it on my resume in some way (without being dishonest)?

Would really appreciate some honest, unbiased advice from people who’ve been in similar situations or have experience with tech placements in India, especially from tier 1 colleges.

Thanks!",Yash_62305,1,1.0,0,1749807425,2025-06-13 09:37:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1labpsz/should_i_quit_a_superintense_internship_to_focus/,6,2025
1labo4y,My first job. No contract. No pay. 3 years later and I’m still angry. What can I do?,"
I don’t know if this fits here, but I need to get this off my chest and maybe get some advice.

Around 4 years ago, I worked for a month at a nursing home. It was my very first job. I asked for a contract — he kept saying, “the lady who handles that is on vacation.” Every week it was the same excuse. I never signed anything.

When the month ended, I left without being paid. I kept asking him to pay me. I messaged him over and over again — he always said “tomorrow,” “next week,” “soon.” He never paid. It’s been 3 years now and I’m still angry. He’s still running the same business.

I only have a photo of the work schedule with my initial on it (“C”) next to my shifts — nothing more. No contract, no payslip, just messages where I asked to be paid and he promised.

I know I probably can’t take legal action without solid proof. But is there anything I can do? Even just to give him a scare or publicly expose this kind of behavior? I don’t want to do anything illegal — I just want justice, or at least some peace of mind.

Has anyone here been through something similar? Any advice would mean a lot.

The only personal datas that I have about him it's his phone number and first name, + 351 933786900 (him number, it's a portuguese number)


Btw I can't pick a flair because it's not showing to me. 
I just want revenge, I worked really hard! It was in a Nursing home, my experience was horrible there and he knows, some of then try to punch me, other did it, some tried to rape me and in the end of the month the mother fucker didn't pay me. He is Muslim, I'm thinking about search for him Meka and go talk with him priests, expose him there, but idk which Meka, have some here in Lisbon. 
Or maybe send the police to his house just to scarry him.",retrogroovesvinyl,2,1.0,1,1749807231,2025-06-13 09:33:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1labo4y/my_first_job_no_contract_no_pay_3_years_later_and/,6,2025

1labcs0,Should I Negotiate?,"I’m transitioning from a strategy/consulting background (2 YOE) into a more sales/GTM-oriented role at a Series B startup. The role blends go-to-market strategy (planning, ops) with some sales/pipeline generation responsibilities. I’m new to sales comp structures and would love perspective from folks more familiar with them.

Offer Summary:
• Location: SF Bay Area
• Base: $110K (a bit lower than my current role)
• OTE: +$30K (no fixed quota — bonus tied to overall GTM/sales efforts)
• Equity: ~20K shares
• Total comp (base + OTE + equity) is higher than my current total comp (making ~130k in consulting)

My questions:
1. Is this worth negotiating? If so, which part—base, OTE, or equity—would be the most standard to push on?
2. Does this structure (no quota, GTM-heavy) seem typical for early-stage startups?
3. Would it make sense to ask about the possibility of uncapped commission in the future—or is that usually not considered at this stage?",Jlgssg,1,1.0,1,1749805930,2025-06-13 09:12:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1labcs0/should_i_negotiate/,6,2025
1lab9x4,"Help choosing between 3 senior backend roles – trade-offs between tech fit, growth, and salary (up to 35% bump)","Hi everyone,

I’m a senior backend developer currently deciding between three job offers. Each role presents a different combination of technical depth, product ownership, and compensation—ranging from around 15% to 35% salary increase over my current package. I’m looking for long-term technical growth (especially in backend and cloud architecture), meaningful product work, and a balance between innovation and work-life sustainability. No single offer checks all the boxes, so I’d love to hear your perspectives.

# 🧪 Offer A: AI Automation Platform (~15% bump)

* **Domain:** Building a platform that automates document workflows using AI and natural language processing
* **Role:** Backend engineer focused on scalable .NET APIs, performance tuning, and Kubernetes-based deployment
* **Pros:**
   * Strong alignment with backend and cloud technologies
   * Direct collaboration with product and data science teams
   * Exciting and emerging space with a lot of potential impact
* **Cons:**
   * Still in early growth—less structural maturity, more ambiguity
   * Strategic priorities may still be evolving

# 🧱 Offer B: HR Tech Software (~30% bump)

* **Domain:** Mature product suite supporting organizational HR needs
* **Role:** Backend developer working on platform quality, developer tooling, and performance improvements
* **Pros:**
   * Stable environment with a strong engineering culture
   * Emphasis on clean architecture, CI/CD, and internal tech excellence
   * Feels like a role where I can deepen backend expertise in a sustainable way
* **Cons:**
   * Possibly more focused on internal systems than new product features
   * May involve slower cycles with less direct product experimentation

# 🔥 Offer C: Embedded + Operational Systems (~35% bump)

* **Domain:** Integrated software for managing distributed physical systems
* **Role:** Senior full-stack developer (primarily backend) with ownership over architectural design and implementation
* **Pros:**
   * Highest compensation and benefits among the three
   * Strong ownership of technical decisions
   * Potential to shape core systems in a complex physical-digital environment
* **Cons:**
   * Smaller engineering team—may offer fewer collaboration opportunities
   * Tech stack and domain might or might not evolve in a direction that fully supports my long-term backend/cloud aspirations

# 🔍 What I’m torn about:

* One has the strongest financial upside but more uncertainty around long-term tech alignment
* One offers a technically mature, well-supported environment, but may feel less product-driven
* One is vision-aligned and exciting, but with startup-style ambiguity and fewer guarantees

How would you navigate this if your goals were technical leadership, long-term skill-building, and meaningful impact—while also factoring in compensation? Have you faced similar trade-offs and how did it go?

1la9nqs,"Accepted an offer for after maternity leave, but this new one may be better..","I am currently out for a paid maternity leave at my current position. My current job is extremely stressful, has terrible culture and my role has felt stagnant while the workload has grown for the past several years. It was also moving from a hybrid model to full-time in office, so I was very open to the idea of switching roles. 

While out on maternity leave, a recruiter for “Company A” reached out to me. After super quick interview process, they promptly sent me an offer. Offer was way better than my current role, and agreed to hold off on my start date for several months while I was on maternity leave. I accepted their offer excitedly. It seemed like a great fit.

Two weeks ago, another recruiter reached out to me from  “Company B”. They wanted to have a “quick conversation “ with me to see if I was a good fit for a role- as it turns out, it was not just a conversation, but an actual interview. Within a couple days of our conversation, they also extended me an offer. I was a bit put off about the weird communication about the interview/conversation, but the offer is amazing and is more money than my initial offer that I already accepted from the “ company A”. 

I am not sure what to do at this point. I never thought I would have potentially three companies to decide between when my maternity leave ends. They are all within the same niche industry, and are a great fit professional wise for myself. At this point, I am not sure if I should rescind initial offer and go with the second since the monetary offer is higher, but the culture seems worse and I feel bad for backing out of the initial offer after they extended the start date for several months. I also couple possibly ask to re-negotiate my accepted offer to be higher; but that is no guarantee and they could rescind their offer or just not agree to revisit our agreed upon terms. Looking for advice on which company I should go with - I will do a quick pros and cons below.

Company A: 
-Fully remote
-$115,000 based salary, employee stock ownership, $5000 sign on bonus
-2 weeks vacation
- 8 weeks partial paid maternity leave
- great culture, boss seems like a great leader 

Company B: 
-Fully remote 
- $135,000 base salary
- 3 weeks of vacation
- “ paid parental leave” of unknown value
- Interview/conversation miscommunication makes me question culture
- direct supervisor was not involved in interview process and have never spoken to him

1la9frf,Am I wrong for wanting to quit my job as a new grad? Feeling lost.,"Hi all. I’m a recent marketing grad and I’ve been working in social media marketing. My first role was at a nonprofit. I really loved the work and the team, but they weren’t paying me fairly and the location wasn’t ideal. I ended up leaving and taking a new position at a veterinary clinic.

At first, it seemed like a good opportunity. But I quickly realized I’m the most qualified marketing person there. I didn’t ask the right questions during the interview, and there was basically no onboarding. They just gave me a list of passwords and expected me to take over all the marketing with zero context or support.

I know how to create content and run social media. I’ve done it in college and for the nonprofit, and I also manage my own personal brand. But in my previous roles, I always had someone to ask questions, bounce ideas off, or just check in. Here, when I ask questions, I can tell people are annoyed or just don’t want to deal with it. Some of the doctors aren’t very friendly either.

There’s also a bigger issue. I’m starting to feel unsure about social media in general. It’s something I’ve always been good at, but I’m getting burnt out doing it for other people. I’ve been teaching myself web design on the side and thinking more seriously about working for an agency where I can learn from a team, grow my skills, and eventually start my own business. Right now, I feel anxious and unsure every time I go in. I know I haven’t been at this job long, but it’s starting to feel like a mistake. I didn’t feel like this at my old job, even with the bad pay. I miss it. I miss feeling supported and excited about what I was doing.

My grandparents keep telling me to stick it out, but I don’t want to get stuck doing something I hate. I spent four years in school for marketing and I still love the field. I just feel like this isn’t the right place or setup for me. Has anyone else gone through something like this early in their career? Is it wrong to leave so soon, even if I already know it’s not a good fit?

1la8z98,Which job should I pick?,"
Hey Reddit,
I really need help making a major life decision, and I’d love your thoughts. I'm 24M from India, just completed my MBA (specializations in HR and Operations), and I have ADHD and anxiety, which often makes decision-making, consistency, and focus incredibly difficult. I tend to overthink, loop through regrets, and freeze when faced with big choices — and this is one of the biggest.
Apologies in advance if the post seems all over the place.

I have two job offers:

1. Amazon – Team Lead Intern (Operations)

2-month paid internship at an Amazon Fulfillment Center.

If I perform well, I might get a Pre-Placement Offer (PPO).

Work is operations-focused (warehouse/people/process management).

Brand value is huge and the skills are globally transferable (I want to eventually move abroad).

10 hour shift for 5 days a week.

Pays more than the other job if I get PPO.

Risk: No PPO = I'm back at square one in 2 months.

2. Insurance Company– HR Executive Trainee

Stable job in the HR department of a large Indian insurance company.

Potential promotion to Associate Manager within 1 year.

Predictable hours, office environment.

6 days working with strict timings.

Less brand value, and HR roles are less transferable internationally.

Safer choice, but possibly slower growth and international prospects.

Other context that matters:

I want to eventually move abroad and build a life there. I'm not 100% sure if it's a deep conviction or a reaction to the situation here, but it's something I think about a lot.

I have no operations experience, but I do have 1.5 months of HRBP experience along with a 3 month HR internship.

I'm not from a very good college and studied Political Science in graduation. This is probably my only opportunity to work in a more 'technical' field.

Before my ADHD diagnosis I wasn't good with technical/math related subjects, after the diagnosis I haven't had the opportunity to study anything highly technical or math related.

I’ve always struggled with executive dysfunction, memory issues, and sticking to routines. Amazon might overwhelm me. But the idea of playing it safe at the insurance company and missing out eats me up.

Both jobs start at the same time, I can only pick one. I can't delay my joining at either.

My Dilemma:

Insurance Company feels safer, but I fear I’ll get stuck in slow growth and regret not taking a chance.

Amazon is a risk — what if I don’t get a PPO? But the brand name and global exposure might help me move abroad.

My ADHD makes it harder to trust my instincts or “just choose.” I keep looping through the same thoughts.


I can't stop obsessing over the worst case scenario which is that I don't get PPO and lose the guaranteed  cosy office job in HR.


Also I don't know how that Amazon internship will look on my resume if I don't get the PPO and try switching back to HR. Does the brand value and team lead role make it a positive or the fact it is in a different field make it a negative.

If you were in my shoes, which would you pick — and why?
What am I not seeing clearly? Would love to hear some outside perspectives.

Thanks so much.",automobileexpert99,1,1.0,1,1749796062,2025-06-13 06:27:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1la8z98/which_job_should_i_pick/,6,2025

But I keep thinking these pathways are not realistic and won’t pay the bills .

2) should I look for jobs right now and prepare gate simultaneously?

3)  Should I dedicate 2-3 hours daily to upskill myself(like doing projects, learning new language, do certification courses) and dedicate rest of the time fully for gate preparation?

1la7fqb,Career not growing at current job and I'm still entry experience- what should I do?,"I'm currently working as a sort of stand-alone position in the company where I'm not necessarily part of a team, working individually doing my one task every working day (which I am already tired of doing for a year now). As it's part of creative industry it is very difficult to constantly having to work ALONE and the tasks I'm doing is not expanding my skills at all. I've been employed for 2 years after University, so I'm basically still at entry position for most jobs in the market. 

I already noticed a while ago that this job is not helping for my career as I am not learning anything new and stagnating at producing results. I know soon I want to move on for a better job but it's difficult as I don't have working experience for them. I mentioned about this to my big boss and manager (two people) and talked to them multiple times that I'm willing to find more opportunity within the company. Boss suggested I do an online course to show that I am capable of helping out with such tasks - which I completed. I was then assigned to support a growing team in the company - they consider me unhelpful as I'm not experienced enough. I guess I understand as it is a growing company so most employees are mid-senior level so it's hard as a Junior role like me to learn anything since no one wants to train. 

When I was first hired for this position, it was a newly created role in the company, so initially as a new employee I received help in structuring and doing my tasks in a team but now I obviously have to do everything by myself. Realising that this job is not helping me grow my career and doing it all alone made me excessively lose my drive to keep this job - even made me consider career change. 

I also considered going back to full-time studying maybe a 1-year degree but I'm worried when I try go back to finding a job that by studying it will reset the work experience I had and I have to start a job with less pay or will studying even help me get a job with how difficult the job market is?

I have also been applying and interview few times for different companies - ofc ghosted and rejected. 

I would like to keep this job of course if I can, but I lost all the motivation of constantly putting out same things over and over again, and regardless of seeking out for help there hasn't been any proactive support from the higher-ups. Do I just wait and hope there will be change in my position some day as I get more and more burned out as time goes? Or do I take the risk and go back to study or something else - not being able to earn money for a while  and potentially not get a job at all?

1la6sqi,Choosing Between 2 Schools,"Hi guys!

I graduated with a Bachelor’s in Biology a few years back and originally wanted to go to med school but then had a change in career passion. Post college I worked in hospitals and now I’m in a research lab at a university, slowly working towards a future in data science.

I’m currently enrolled in the online master’s in Analytics (OMSA) at Georgia Tech, but am considering leaving that program to enroll in my work’s program. My goal is to secure a role in tech but my experience is more relevant towards pharma/biotech so I may also look for roles there. My work’s master program offers a co-op like course which is the main reason I’m drawn in. Here are some of the pros for each school. Both are fully covered by tuition reimbursement:

OMSA:

-well established program, better name, more widely known, more variety of courses, can be completed in 2-3 years, search for internships on own time, online network but more diverse

Work school: Master’s in Data Science

-new program, co op / internship set up, less varied classes but still good core knowledge, local school, can set up opportunities with nearby companies 2 year completion, better in person local network due to relationships with staff and Boston companies

These are the main ones off the top of my head, but which one would you guys choose?",Talphox,2,1.0,1,1749788017,2025-06-13 04:13:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1la6sqi/choosing_between_2_schools/,6,2025

1la51ll,i need some career advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some honest advice from people outside my family.

I’m currently 18 years old and in my second semester of college, studying accounting. While I do enjoy some aspects of the program, I’ve come to realize that I don’t see myself building a long-term career in this field.

For context, I’ve been doing entry-level carpentry work since I was around 14, and I’ve found that I really enjoy hands-on work and being outside. I take pride in building things and working in the trades feels much more fulfilling to me than sitting at a desk

Here’s where I’m torn:  
Do I stick with accounting — a stable, but less fulfilling path — or switch and pursue something I’m passionate about?

My plan would be to complete a carpentry foundation certificate (about 6 months), and then attend a 12-week heavy equipment operator program in Alberta. This route would take around 1.5 years total and would get me into the workforce faster, doing something I actually enjoy. Long-term, I’d like to start my own business.

I’m wondering:

* Is heavy machinery school worth the investment?
* Does it make sense to leave a more “traditional” career path if I’m confident the trades are where I belong?

Any insights from people who’ve been in a similar position — or who’ve worked in either field — would be really appreciated. Thanks!",Jeff-theman,2,1.0,2,1749782295,2025-06-13 02:38:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1la51ll/i_need_some_career_advice/,6,2025

I accepted an offer for about a 7% raise after expenses, but also a raise in title as well (Company B).   I left on extremely good terms, so much so that the VP of the company told me that they would leave my position open for 100 days in case I wanted to come back.  During the time I have been gone, they took a junior I had been mentoring and had him start full-time on some projects.  However,  I was messaging the lead developer today (I keep in contact with most of my former co-workers), and he said that the junior is leaving the company.  He then proceeded to tell me that he really wants me to come back as he thought I was the best co-dev he ever worked with, and the VP and Manager agreed.  He wants me to submit my application, and the VP will most likely approve my return.  

I thoroughly enjoyed working for A, but left for company B due to concerns around tariffs and company direction as the company was suffering hard due to tariffs at the time.  These concerns have been alleviated, and I told the developer I would love to come back but I would need to think about it over the weekend.

1la39vo,Job duties drastically changed and PhD student intern being trained on my job. Please advise.,"I'm a software engineer and I work at a mid-size corporate tech company with roughly 10k employees. I was promoted after being an intern for a year while finishing up college and then waiting until April before they were able to promote me due to headcount. As it stands a few people who used to work in our department left who were in senior level roles and we are operating on a crew of \~15 people total (our dept is very small) with only 4 developers not including the intern.

I went from working on critical bug fixes and new features on all the client facing web apps to being unassigned from all dev tickets in the backlog and put on random legacy web app under a different manager for the duration of this summer, within weeks of finally being hired. I was told the new PhD student intern will be doing all my dev tickets this summer instead (my boss and the SWE division lead are already trying to talk him into staying beyond this summer publicly in meetings). The offer letter mentioned nothing of this and I am still reporting to the same boss, but now also working under another manager. 

As it turns out, this legacy web app they have me on was what the senior software architect was working on before she quit. No one knows why and she worked for our dept over 10 years. The devops guy who had been there close to 7 years also suddenly quit, along with the division manager last summer and now our client relations specialist. My boss told me he put me on the legacy app and gave the PhD student my tickets because I was ""doing so well"" which I think is total BS because I am the least senior on the team. I could not get an honest answer from him. 

Part of me wonders if me getting this job was contingent upon them not replacing the senior software architect who quit, hence me being offered as a sacrifice to do the several months left of work she left behind on this legacy app.

Regardless, I have never been more physically and mentally strained in my life. The other manager does not respect my schedule and is only able to meet at 4 pm, 30 minutes before I get off work every day because I start at 8 am with the rest of the dev team. I made him aware of my schedule and offered to come in later to acclimate to his, but he said it was fine. Then he continued keeping me 1-2 hours overtime every time we have a meeting, several times per week for the past month. I started looking for a new job earlier this month but have yet to get a single interview after hundreds of applications. 

My questions are:

1. Do you think my boss who offered me up to this other manager and took me off production level dev work is intending to gradually replace me with the cheaper PhD student intern?

1la36ge,Assigned 2 tasks - logistical issues,"I don't know how to accomplish 2 tasks simultaneously assigned to me. The job I was hired for is distributing food samples and then I was asked to go through cheese and deli items to find what was near or past the expiration dates. However, checking one side of the cheese case required me to have my back towards incoming customers and the other side of the cheese case completely blocked my view. After completing the cheese case, I was assigned to check the dates on the deli items displayed on the refrigerated wall. There were other displays between the wall and my sampling station 

I said to the store manager that I wasn't comfortable pushing around the shopping cart (used to collect expired items) that was touched by a lot of people and then hand out samples. She replied to keep a box of disposable gloves at the station. From that, I inferred that she wanted me to keep handing out samples as I checked dates. But I didn't want to sound whiny or incapable. Am I missing something? Should have I just periodically alternated between tasks? I scarcely completed checking the dates within my assigned areas on my shift as it was, having mostly abandoned the sampling station 🙁",VardoJoe,3,1.0,1,1749776541,2025-06-13 01:02:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1la36ge/assigned_2_tasks_logistical_issues/,6,2025

1la2tnk,Should I go into OT or Nursing?,"Hi! I have been accepted to an occupational therapy where I will receive my doctorate. I recently have had some doubts about going to OT school. First off I found out that my schooling is going to cost over 80 grand a year. I have been told that I will receive a scholar ship but have not been told the amount yet and I start school in two months. I have received 20,500 dollars in federal loans and the rest of my schooling can be covered by the grant plus loan. I also recently started working as a rehab tech and I am realizing that I'm kind of bored with my job. I love working with kids as a OT but I am also concerned with the pay that an OT makes and that it will be a long time until I can repay my loans therefore delaying my independence and being unable to move out from my parents. I have considered nursing as an alternative option. However I am short both microbiology and nutrition. Also I am 22 years old and I feel that going to nursing school can be counterintuitive since I already have a degree in Allied Health. I like what nurses do but I have seen how hard the job can be both physically and mentally. I am looking for some advice! And possibly salaries from both OTs and Nurses!

1la2but,Returning to a previous job - need help with navigating salary discussion.,"Heya. 

So I worked at a company I loved for a couple years, and only stopped because I went on leave to take care of my husband after a medical event. That was in 2023. 

I have an interview tomorrow at the same location for the same team, for things I already know how to do, and most of the supervisors are the same. 

In 2022 they reevaluated everyone’s pay and everyone’s salary got bumped from 62k to 68k due to rising cost of living in the area. 

At that time, the average price of a home in the county was $1 mil. Now it’s $1.5 mil. Rent is $2500+ for one bedroom. 

If I was making 68k then, how do I figure out what an appropriate reach is? I can’t find anything relevant or recent on Glassdoor and I really don’t want to be like SO WHAT ARE YOU MAKING NOW to my friends. 

Like, is $75k a laughable number? I know to go ‘higher’ so they can try to level. $76k looks better since it’s not an increment of 5. 

Additional advice is appreciated as well. Should I be looking at things like COL, interest rates, whatever? Just don’t want to screw myself before I even start.

1la164f,Is it crazy to ask for a raise after a month?,"I was hired as an executive assistant/office manager at a nonprofit in Boston at $60,000. 

At the beginning, I was sharing duties with our COS. Then she announced she was leaving, so I had to take over everything she was doing (other than HR, but we’ll see how long that lasts). We’re not hiring a replacement for them. Then another person quit and now I’m expected to take one some of her duties at least until we find her replacement, which could take months. 

So now, I’m doing the original job I was hired for, everything the COS did other than HR, and the stuff that got delegated to me because another employee is leaving. I’ve now been at the company a month and a half and while it seems insane to me to ask for a change in compensation already, the role has changed pretty significantly. 

I have my performance review on Monday (not a lot of performance to review, but my boss (the CEO) is very pleased with my performance based on a brief chat today). Multiple other employees have asked me if I’m getting an official promotion or compensation change given the circumstances. So I guess I’m wondering, is it crazy to ask for a raise already? My thought is I should be at the median for EAs in my city, which is around $80k.

I have no paid time off, despite being full time. Everytime I bring it up my boss says I just need to get one more client or I just need this much in revenue and then it’ll happen, that was two years ago I still have nothing.

Clients have my personal full number and have no boundaries and text me at all hours of the day, on weekends, sometimes even after 11pm. There are no boundaries, and I’ve brought this up repeatedly.

I’ve had multiple conversations with my boss where he says, “Thanks for bringing this up, I’ll fix it, aren’t i such a good boss i always listen to my team!” NO YOU DONT!! things will change for maybe two weeks before going back to the same thing.

The team has high turnover, I’m the only one left from when I first started.

It feels like nothing I say is taken seriously, and no matter how much I do, it’s never enough for any of the clients and my boss.

I’ve been applying for new jobs, and I’ve made it to the final round in several interviews, but I always lose out to someone else.

1l9yu4s,I’m kinda getting fed up with my Job,"few months ago, I was offered a pretty cool opportunity: a position was created just for me to do wiring on vehicles. I’d spent five years at a wire manufacturing shop fixing old harnesses, but this was new — hands-on with the vehicles themselves, designing and building full wiring systems for engine swaps that hadn’t been done before.

I was excited. I taught myself how to make wiring blueprints, estimate wire sizing based on amp draw, and tackle custom wiring jobs from scratch. It felt like a huge step forward.

But lately, things have started going downhill.
	•	I was told I’d get health insurance, but after waiting three months just to apply, I was informed I might not even be eligible. I finally submitted the paperwork, and now two months later, I was told I was denied — with no real explanation.
	•	I just finished fully wiring a vehicle, interior back together and everything, only to be told more components need to be added. It’s frustrating redoing finished work.
	•	I’ve been told I’ll be getting a bonus this year, but with how the insurance situation is going, I’m starting to wonder if I’ll have to fight for that too.
	•	On top of all this, I’ve had 2–3 paychecks that were either late or not paid in full.

I love the work and what I’ve been able to build, but I’m getting fed up with how I’m being treated. Not sure if I’m overreacting, but it’s starting to wear on me.

1l9ykwp,Seeking advice on how to deal with unreasonable working hours as an intern,"I'm currently doing an internship at a public international relations/investment related institution as a foreigner. I genuinely love the job and feel passionate about it and I'm happy with my boss/director and my coworkers. It seems that the feelings are mutual, as my boss encouraged me to apply for an open position (as they can't hire directly as a public entity). Which is great also for me to apply for a work permit in the country, now that my student one is expiring.

My only issue at this job is the unreasonable work load and working hours that they demand from each member of the team. As a public agency with limited funding, our team is basically 5 people and I work directly with the director of the department. Overtime is expected and more than anything assumed due to ""flexible hours""; which means that if you were to stay till 7-8pm, you can theoretically come to office at 10-10:30 am. But in the end what happens is that, people put meetings at 9am or the director messages a 7am about an urgent task, and then stay till 7-8 pm anyways. As an intern i don't even get paid overtime, I'm just paid half of minimum wage fixed. Not to mention the fact that I, as an intern, work the same amount as a contracted employee. I don't even want to complain about the work load (if not for the hours) because I genuinely like what I do and get very very positive feedbacks from each colleague who all expressed they want me to continue in their team. 

Today though, for the first time, I got actually angry when our director gave us an ""urgent"" task at 18:15 to be finished by tonight for his review, when I came early to leave at a normal time. Ended up staying till 19:00 again. I was literally leaving the office with my backpack and had to go sit back down lol. At this point, I feel like more than anything it's disrespecting the time of each member of the team, which is what makes me upset. Plus, the fact that somehow each task is ""urgent"", but never gets reviewed by the deadline and is always handled by the director with delay. It just seems like, because the director doesn't have a healthy work-life balance, he assumes that everyone is like that. 

It's possible to come to work later to balance it out, but with a 45 minute commute, I don't want to come back home at 20:30; plus you always end up starting earlier anyways. I'm looking for some advice on how to handle this situation better, especially with a full time position being offered and genuinely enjoying the work itself. I appreciate any advice or feedback.

1l9y8gc,How a final grade in Computer Science Engineering affects the future job?,"
Hi, sorry if there will be some english errors, but it's not my first language.
I'm studying computer science master in an italian university. It's my first year and I was thinking about how much the final grade affects the future job. 
In Italy I found out some companies that refuse graduated students based on the grade. Is that true? Is a common ""practice"" globally? 
Honestly I would like to go away, maybe in other countries in Europe like Germany, but I need more information.
Thank you for your replies.

1l9x5gz,Seeking Advice Engineer to Sales Engineer??,"Hi everyone,

Its been about 3 years since I graduated college (robotics undergrad) and I came to the conclusion through therapy that my whole engineering career has been for my narcissistic fathers validation ( I abandoned my sense of self for that 5 minute phone call of X amount of salary and some impressive sounding engineering title....). I realized being a young female specifically in the controls industry was met with some really unpleasant experiences (2 weeks into my first job I was told I was ""useless"" by someone who was suppose to be my mentor & some cases of my previous boss berating & yelling at me when asking questions in the context of training and how ""dumb"" I was to document and create formal training processes for internal reference). I know that no workplace is perfect and I do expect to have some challenging clients, co-workers etc. but I've come to the conclusion that a bad work culture and boss has been a difficult uphill battle.

I'm a very social person and although I grew to enjoy some aspects of engineering (learning technical concepts, working with a young group of like minded engineers, process improvement, studying & pushing myself to be better, variety of projects etc) I realized I ignored my natural strengths like writing, public speaking and the ability to connect with people. I figured the next logical step was to transition into sales engineering where I could still utilize my background in controls, automation and robotics while also leaning into more of these innate characteristics.

I have 2 out of 3 jobs on my resume (one company I was at a year and a half and the other was 10 months). I received glowing feedback from my 1st job & my 2nd job I had colleagues reach out to me and tell me they would write me a recommendation letter (forgot to take them up on this offer) Further context: my manager was fired, it was a whole ordeal where everyone was jumping ship.

I left out my last job not listed on my resume because I was in a trial period where I realized the hiring manager lied to me about the job duties and responsibilities (was at this company for 2 months). I'm afraid I look like I'm not loyal but, I felt like I did the best with the hand I was dealt. I know I am an articulate engineer and I can bring value but, its inappropriate for me to speak poorly of my last places of employment but this has been my experience thus far. **How do I grow from this? How do I see the red flags in an interview? How can I determine sales engineering is a better path? How can I be transparent about these experiences and still get hired somewhere?**

I've been trying for a little over a month sending in applications on Linkedin but I would greatly appreciate some insight on how to ease this transition (certifications, altering my resume, recommended companies, maybe doing more self reflection on my end about how I can improve myself as an employee, just grinding more etc).

I'm open to any and all feedback, I believe this is the best way to grow so feel free to not hold back.

Thank you in advance for your much needed wisdom.",MeowtainDoom998,1,1.0,0,1749760474,2025-06-12 20:34:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9x5gz/seeking_advice_engineer_to_sales_engineer/,6,2025
1l9x47c,"Should I quit my job before I have another job locked down, my boss is my best friend","I don't know if this is the right place to post, but should I quit my job, or wait till I find another job first before quitting? My boss is my best friend and this whole thing is a mess.

Emily started her company by herself, but contracted me to do some design work in the summer when we weren't in school. The next year she entered our uni's business pitch competition for $25k, and asked me to co-pitch with her. I spent every weekend working on the pitch together and we actually won. She was able to start the business more with the money, she gave me 1k and I continued to work with her. I became the sort of CDO or Design Lead.

Here we are now, I graduated last year and she hired on new people, but things keep getting worse. Here are the reasons I'm thinking of quitting:

\- She lowers the prices for companies who can't afford our work, making it impossible for me to make any sustainable money, even when we had meetings to agree on our pricing.

\- There was one client we worked with, that Emily *did in exchange of services*, because they couldn't afford the work. When they needed a full logo rebrand, Emily charged them very little and gave them to me for their branding. That process was so bad, I didn't get paid for any extra revisions, it was a nightmare.

\- Her friend Jason reached out for a logo. He didn't know what he wanted, but I did many revisions.  
At one point he said, ""i like this, but can you add x thing."" I did what he wanted and was ghosted, I got a call from Emily later saying that Jason decided to make his own logo..**.the logo looked exactly like the one I made for him, except he didn't pay us. Emily proceeds to take his logo and make and print business cards for him, without telling me.**

But this one was the last straw: Her good friend Trent reached out a year ago wanting a full brand and logo design. He didn't sign any contracts, he said the logo wasn't due for a while, but I got on it asap.

After sending various revisions, he wouldn't answer us till weeks later, he then texts Emily that we took too long and he won't be paying for our work. Emily is mad and cuts him out of her life and tells me that we will never be disrespected like that again.... **Trent comes back this week after a year** and says to Emily that he needs a logo. Emily tells me that she made him put down a deposit, and read him the contract word for word.

I told her, I don't feel comfortable working with him based on his actions from last time, and we got into a little bit of an argument. She never asked me if I wanted to work with him again, but instead took the deposit first...that's why I was angry.

She said I don't have to work with him. She then gave his work to our new video editor, Kathryn, who said that ""she's never done logo work before but wants to try it out."" I get texts from Kat constantly saying that she doesn't know how to do this. To me, this is a slap in the face, and is a completely bad look for the company.



The only reason I'm staying on is because my family says I need to lock down a job first, which is fair. I feel like I have a good portfolio, and have applied to **100s** of jobs.. I've have had some interviews in the last 4 months, but graphic/motion design is harder to get into. Because our company is just starting, I'm making very little money, I will make at most this year a little over $10,000 dollars. Which, is obviously not a livable wage, thankfully my parents are letting me stay with them.

Every day I'm two seconds from telling her ""I quit"" but I have no place else to go. Idk what to do anymore and i just feel stuck.

1l9vyc9,Fork in the road advice wanted,"So here's my situation. I changed careers about 3 years ago and went from being a manager (60k top end in an dying industry) to working in an individual contributor role. I currently make 67k in a role with no advancement prospects. (Contract role). Our contract is changing/renewing and comes with some nice perks and a small bump in pay, still a contract though. I was very recently scouted for a role that would be a 9k paycut but have definite upward momentum and professional development opportunities like crazy (think free tuition, certifications, etc). 

I would be locked into that position for 1-3 years though before any new positions open. The professional development opportunities would be available immediately. 

Right now looking at the numbers it would be very tight for a while (spouse might be able to make up the difference doing occasional overtime, but that's not guaranteed) and it would mean a significant change in our spending habits. I also have a few medical conditions that crop up extra spending from time to time. We do have our 6 months expenses saved, but we are far from rich. 

Listing out the pros/cons:

Old role pros:
-67k (maybe 68.5 after the move to new contract)
-Tuition benefit (however only to one college and said college does not offer my field, also there's the risk the contract might end before I finish and it would have to be paid back)
-Free professional memberships
-Paid travel
-6.7 hours PTO and 6.7 sick per month/14 paid holidays
-I'm ""comfy"" here

Old role cons:
-Zero advancement 
-Limited professional development 
-They are taking away hybrid work at the end of the month and going fully in-office which would increase my commute by 3 hours every week and reduce sleep time by 2 hours. And tbh, I have ADD and work in a cube which is maddening when I'm in the office as it is. 

New role pros:
-Promised certifications in my field (which cost thousands)
-8 hours PTO and 8 hours sickper month/ 14 paid holidays
-Free professional memberships
-Free tuition (with a college that has my field)
-I know members of the team and am comfortable with them
-Earned flexibility (do my job and I can have hybrid/teleworking days)
-Allows some consulting/side work

New role cons:
-58k (I'd be coming in at the cap, so no raises till I get a new role)
-No new roles for 1-3 years
-No paid travel (though travel is not expected)
-I'm coming in overqualified so the role may not be as challenging 

Money situation:
Calculated out we would be losing about 800 a month. I think we could probably shave that off of our spending, but with the world the way it is, and with growing our family it would mean major cuts.  

I don't really need help figuring out the money part, just kinda looking for other people's experience in similar situations, what was your ultimate decision? How did that work out for you long term? How did you handle any emotions that came up from ""stepping backwards""? I know my ultimate earning potential could skyrocket after certifcations/advanced degrees, but is it worth it to take the cut now? 

Appreciate any insight, thanks!

To add on, the bank I work for has a generous paternity leave program that my wife was looking forward to taking advantage of when we have our first kid…

\------------------------------

Hey all,

As you can imagine, I'm sitting here, about to turn 50, in the midst of my child's best moments, suffering from job loss ... *again*.

**Background**:

After the team I was part of (QA) was eliminated, I took the better part of two years to decide on a career pivot. I studied hard, practiced a metric-ton, and landed a mentor. One thing lead to another, and he refers me to the best possible job one could ask for in the career I was looking to move into.

I was over-the-moon with the opportunity and landed the role with some ambiguous expectations, but clearly defined career path and what-not. Fast-forward to May of this year, and all I will say is it was a bad month. I spiraled downward hard and nothing I was doing worked. All the people that matter took notice, and rather than support and helping me through it, I was put on something like a PIP .. a Career Action Plan. Where you'd be told where you are misaligned with the culture values, and where you'd need to be. Along with much constructive feedback.

Then something happens the following week, and it was like, ""nope!"" -- shit-canned.

I haven't broken the news to my family as we're having my child's best lived moments as he reaches the end of his scholastic year. And my stupid ass is back on the job hunt.

1l9vaw1,I’m screwed.,"Hello everyone! I’m not REALLY screwed; I just thought that would get people’s attention. I’m only partially screwed. 

Here’s the thing: I’m 56 years old, no savings and I’ve been out of work for more or less 14 years (it’s a ling story). I also have ADHD, so it can be VERY hard for me to get started at something, even when I theoretically know what to do. 

I know now what I want to do with the rest of my life, but I have no idea how to get there, and I’m hoping someone here will know. I want to make people laugh. That’s it really; that’s what I know I was put here to do. The first thing that most of you will probably say is “Do Standup”, but I don’t think I’m funny - not in that way. When I try to be funny I’m generally not, but when I just say things on the spur of the moment I can be hilarious. I have no idea how to write standup. I write well, but I’m not consistently funny - and part of the ADHD thing is all-or-nothing kind of thinking. I don’t know what a “normal” writer’s hit and miss ratio are. 

Does anyone have any ideas what I should do? My life up to this point has not gone particularly well and I’m at the point where it’s hard to want to even try anymore, so please keep your suggestions simple and in easy step by step instructions. Thanks.

1l9ufnn,"I am losing hope for my career prospects as someone who has ""authority issues"". Is there hope?","I am a 27F LLB graduate with a passion for environmentalism. I have a strong sense of justice and egalitarianism. I am also very direct and don't shy away from conflict. That's the way I see it, but most employers that I've come across see this quality as me having an ""attitude"" or ""authority issues"". Understandably so, but does that mean that there is no place for me in the business world as a recent graduate with little experience but a lot of confidence?

These qualities most recently manifested when I walked out of a job at an African tour operating firm which I had been working at for only 1 week. I was tasked by the CEO, ""Jake"" (51M), with sending a brief which I had drafted to the marketing manager, ""Chris"" (35M), whom Jake said will ""make it look pretty"". 

We communicated internally using Google Chat. My messages weren't being delivered to Chris, so after 2 days, I decided to walk to his desk in an office down the passage and talk to him directly. He was sat in a room of about 12 people. I told him about the influencer marketing campaign I was tasked with working on and asked whether Jake had discussed the project with him, to which he responded that they had discussed it. I proceeded to inform Chris that I needed to send him a brief and said, in a casual tone: ""You need to make it look pretty,"" as per Jake's instructions. Chris looked at me, taken aback, and responded: ""I must do it?"" I was likewise confused by his response, and so responded ""Must I do it?"" As far as I was aware, part of his job was to design; mine was to coordinate the influencer campaign. 

Visibly unimpressed, Chris said to me, ""I am a manager, and it sounds like you're giving me instructions. I think we're going to cross wires here, so we should go talk to 'Steve'."" (Steve is the MD, 50M). Before I had a chance to take account of my current situation, Chris got up from his desk and walked me to Steve's office. I then said ""Oh, but Jake would have the most knowledge of the campaign, so we should probably speak to him,"" to which he responded in a flat, somewhat hostile tone, ""I don't report to Jake. I report to Steve."" Initially having thought Chris was simply trying to seek some clarity on the matter, I now realised that he was effectively trying to report me. Steve wasn't available at the time, so Chris told me to sit in my office and wait. I felt like a naughty school child waiting to be called into the principal's office. I was simultaneously nervous and utterly confused as I waited to be called. 

Maybe 15 minutes later, without me realising Chris had by now spoken to Steve, Steve comes to my office to call me into his. I sit down next to Chris across from Steve, who then tells me to explain my end of the story, to which I say ""I am sorry, I didn't realise there was a hierarchical reporting structure. In all my previous jobs I've been able to speak to anyone in the company quite directly. So I told Chris I had this brief and he needed to make it look pretty."" Steve told me Chris gave him a completely different account, saying that I had said, in a more confrontational tone, ""WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MAKE IT LOOK PRETTY?"" 

There was some back and forth, and I eventually apologised and we returned to our desks. I was quite shaken up by the encounter because up until then, I had had a pleasant experience with the rest of the staff at the company. I certainly wasn't expecting to be reported after only a week of working there and would have appreciated Chris having treated me with more understanding, rather than immediately reporting me to management. So I WhatsApped Jake, who was out of office, and told him I had an awkward encounter with Chris and needed to talk to him about it. 

Before hearing my end of the story, Jake told me, via WA, that Chris is manager, I am much younger than him, and this is not my ""turf"". I then proceeded to tell him that anyone commanding of respect need not remind anyone of their position.

Jake then responded, ironically: ""You are talking to your boss. I would watch your tone."" 

I then packed my things and left after saying goodbye to two colleagues. I drove home to my boyfriend and burst into tears, shaken up from the events of the day. I haven't returned to work since (3 days ago).

* Note: Jake and I met at a mental health clinic. We got along extremely well there. He realised my potential for a dynamic role and offered me a job once he was out. I didn't expect, given our previously equal and casual relationship, that he would suddenly expect me to become subservient once in an employment role.

I see employment relationships as a two way street whereby the employee offers their services to an employer on behalf of a company, all parties having the same strategic vision for the company's betterment and financial health. I do not subscribe to the dominance hierarchy traditionally associated with employment relationships. I believe it appropriate for employees to express their views freely, so long as it is done respectfully. I find international companies, especially European, reflect this attitude more, and I believe the South African job market is slightly antiquated in that sense.

Or am I deluded? Do I need to accept some form of a pecking order whereby I am expected to keep my thoughts to myself and sugar-coat every request I make to management? 

Or are there possibly environments which will embrace people like me?

I have a lot to offer, being educated, linguistically proficient, highly analytical and detail-oriented. I strive to perform well in any role I adopt and deliver results in a shorter time period than it takes most to become accustomed to new job positions. So it saddens me to think my personality could prevent me from succeeding.

Please don't say ""work for yourself"" as I have neither the ideas nor resources to do so right now. And I would actually appreciate having some form of mentoring relationship in a work environment until I am older. 

I also expect some comments regarding my reactivity and emotional regulation.

Any relatable stories would be helpful.

1l9trak,Need advice from someone with more life experience than me,"Hello, I am 21 and just graduated with a BSc mathematics degree from a good university in the UK.  
I knew getting into it that its likely a good choice of degree and that it would get me a job in the future, but that's as far as I thought about it. I just did maths because I wanted to learn more interesting and advanced topics. I now have no interest to study any further, and I'm ready to start my career.

For reasons that I will expand on later in the post I worry that my inexperience might lead me into a career trap that I can't escape later. I will try to describe what I'm looking for in a job (and life in general) in a few sentences, because I need someone with more life experience to advise me on what direction to take in life:

For me, my job is just going to be part of my life. I don't dream of working a particular job. In fact, all my goals are pretty much independent of the work I do. All I want in my life on earth is to find a good woman and marry young, have children and be a good father and husband. God willing I would also like to own my own house in a rural area, and a few acres of land. I need a job that is stable, pays well enough to provide a good life for my family, and provides a good work-life balance so I can spend time with them. I am not a materialistic person, I don't need to travel the whole world or drive the nicest car. I am good at living within my means.

I just started a job as an operations administrator in a warehouse. I didn't expect to work this job, but to be honest I like it. I have been interested in logistics for a while and now I get to learn how the system works from the inside - currently at a very surface level. Part of me is considering staying here for a while and making a career in the supply chain and logistics industry. But I fear that If i stay in the logistics industry for a few years, as opposed to trying out different careers in my 20s, I will fall into a trap where I am only good at one thing and stuck in one kind of job.

Another career I'm considering is land surveying. I like the technical office aspect of it, but also the fact that you get to spend a lot of time outdoors. The combination of indoor and outdoor work appeals to me, because it seems like there's a lot of day-to-day variety within the job. I came across this job when looking at how to combine my enjoyment of being outside with a career. But part of me fears that if being outdoors becomes my career, it will stop being something I enjoy doing in my free time. I guess something I realise is that ""I won't know unless I try"" but ""trying"" in this case will take multiple years. I've heard that land surveyors are underpaid, at least in the UK, and generally the working conditions are pretty poor.

And the final career I'm currently considering is something to do with business. Maybe I would start as an analyst, and I would hope to work my way up to a ""people-focused"" job. It seems like a stable career and practically every medium to big business needs such a person, so I doubt I will struggle with job security.

I don't like programming, finance or teaching (the three main career paths for maths students). When it comes to a trade/blue collar job, the only thing that holds me back is the damage that some of the jobs do to ones body over time. I wouldn't be able to enjoy time with my family as much if I have health complications.

At 21 I feel like I need to decide on a career now, bet on it by putting all my time and effort and years into it and hope it pays off. I think that in my case jumping between careers in my 20s and trying to ""discover my purpose"" is the wrong move for me, considering my goals. I need to be capable of supporting a family sooner rather than later.

I'm not really sure exactly what advice I'm looking for. I realise that I am very inexperienced, and I guess the only way to find out is to let life teach you. But the way I see it the second best thing I can do is to ask a ""mentor"" for his view. Thank you in advance.",throwawayy22221,1,1.0,4,1749752427,2025-06-12 18:20:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9trak/need_advice_from_someone_with_more_life/,6,2025
1l9tmqi,When to follow-up after first positive interview?,"I had an interview of Tuesday for a position I really want.

The recruiter was a director level, and at the end of the interview, he told me that he was very positive about me and I will progress forward with the process and will have an interview with another director.

So I was excepting them to reach to me the same day to plan the second interview, but since then, it is total silence on their part.

I am a bit panicking as it happens to me in the past that someone said he was super potisive, and get a no few days later. 

The difference is that, he openely stated that I will move forward.

I really don't know how to act.

1l9t1ih,Feeling stuck between jobs — need advice,"I work as an instructional aide with LAUSD and bring in about $1,100 biweekly. There’s a small pay increase eventually, and after working two full years as classified staff, you become eligible for a plan where a chunk of your paycheck is withheld during the year and then doubled to provide a summer payout. I won’t qualify for that until February, since I won’t have worked with the district for a full two years until then. I also commute around an hour to work. 

Right now, the school year just ended and I have no summer job. I applied for an RBT position, but the shadowing part only pays $17.50/hr. After that, it goes up to $23/hr, but I’d have to drive around and my car needs repairs. My boyfriend (we just started dating) offered to help fix it, and I’m really grateful. Still, I feel overwhelmed.

I was thinking I could try the RBT shadowing for now (just to have something going) but I’m honestly scared it won’t work out. The company sounds disorganized, and even though they said 30–35 hours a week (maybe, said based on cases), I’ve heard that may not actually happen. I just don’t want to rely on something that turns out to be inconsistent.

I also applied to be a substitute within LAUSD, but I’ve been told calls are slow for new people unless you network heavily. I’m socially anxious, so that’s hard for me. I’m also aware that I can’t work as a substitute and an instructional aide at the same time, so if I switch, it’s a real risk. Subbing in elementary sounds more manageable because of my experience, but I don’t know if I can handle the uncertainty or pressure.

There’s also a paraprofessional role in special ed that pays $24.85/hr, which sounds a little more stable, but I haven’t applied yet, and I’ve heard hours can still vary. And just like with my current aide position, winter break leaves me with no income.

I’m 24, I have a BA in Psychology, and I’m working toward becoming a school psychologist (not anytime soon, clearly). But I have over $5K in credit card debt, $2K in personal loans, and I just started paying $730/month in rent after moving out due to family issues plus other expenses. My brother offered to help with my credit card debt, and I’m lucky to have that support. Still, I really want to feel financially independent and secure.

I’m scared I’ll make the wrong move. Subbing? RBT? Staying in my aide job? I feel stuck. I have about two months before school starts again.

1l9ptl1,Pivoting to Robotics from Finance/BizOps - Is a Master's Worth It? Seeking Advice on Career Change,"Hello Guys,

I'm looking for some guidance and to see if anyone has made a similar career pivot. I'm seriously considering a move into robotics and would appreciate any insights you might have.

**My Background:**

* **Education:** I graduated from a well-known state school with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
* **Career Path:** My career so far has been quite different. I started as a banker at an EB bank, moved to MBB consulting, and then transitioned to BizOps/Product Management at a few deep tech startups.
* **What's Changed:** Recently, I've found myself completely engrossed in reading white papers on robotics. I've even started coding again, working on small robotics projects in my spare time, and I'm genuinely enjoying it. This has led me down a rabbit hole of looking at robotics graduate programs.

I've come to realize that I'm much more passionate about tinkering, building, and solving tangible problems than I am about creating decks and Excel models. I know that going back for a master's is a significant financial commitment and a ""side quest,"" but I can't shake the feeling that this is what I'd rather be doing.

**My Questions:**

* **Has anyone here made a similar pivot from a business-focused career to a hands-on engineering role in robotics?** What was your experience like?
* **Is a master's in robotics worth it for someone with my background?** I'm thinking of programs like Northwestern's MSR or Johns Hopkins' an ME in Robotics. Will these programs even consider a non-traditional applicant like me?
* **What are the job opportunities really like in the robotics field?** What kind of roles would be available for someone with a master's?
* **Are there any specific programs known for being welcoming to students with non-traditional backgrounds?**

1l9phkr,Job Advice Please!,"Hello Reddit,

Thank you in advance if you read this whole thing.

I (37y/o m) want to ask other peoples' thoughts and opinions on a situation I am in with my place of employment.

I have been with my current place of employment for 7.5 years. I work for a software development company, in the role of Support Lead (I am the only support person). I have also taken on bits and pieces of other roles over the years, such as Technical Writer, minor QA Testing, and some minor Account Management.

I feel as though I am more than fairly compensated for my role.

Here is where I am having difficulties:

As of late, my role has slowed drastically. There will be days where I am receiving maybe 1 or 2 support requests, which is VERY slow. I see it as a good sign, in that our software is stable and in good condition, and our user base is knowledgeable.

I feel guilty a lot of the time because I do not really have any work to do. I feel as though I am taking care of my core job responsibilities, however. So with my down time, I try to be productive in my personal life (e.g. reading self help books during the day, maintaining the house, scheduling/attending various personal appointments).

I did express to my manager that I am feeling guilty about not having much work to do, and that if they have anything for me to do, I am willing to assist them or other team members. So far they have reached out here and there with some smaller tasks, which I take care of promptly.

I can certainly see how I am taking advantage of the situation I am in: I am getting compensated more than fairly but am not really working all that much.

I am admittedly not the most motivated person, as I rather enjoy having the free time that my job affords me.

My husband (40y/o m) works for the same company, has been here longer than me, and is in an entirely different role. He is a highly motivated individual, and has expressed that he does not agree with how I am handling the situation. He thinks I am taking advantage of the situation too much, and that I should be reaching out to other team members to help them out with their roles and responsibilities as needed.

I am torn, because a part of me is like: ""Sweet, get paid well, and reap the benefits of working from home"", and another part of me is like ""They're paying you quite well, maybe you should be seeking out more work"".

I know the obvious answer is to seek out more work. I just want other people's opinions on what you would do in my position, what your thoughts are on the situation, any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: I WFH, Work is super slow, I'm feeling guilty about not having a whole lot to do. I just want other people's opinions on what you would do in my position, what your thoughts are on the situation, any advice is appreciated!",huskybear87,1,1.0,0,1749742412,2025-06-12 15:33:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9phkr/job_advice_please/,6,2025

1l9oypt,How can I get fired?,"Hello y'all! I'm currently looking for another job and potentially have one lined up. I'm miserable at this job, and our job security keeps being put in the balance, so it isn't worth it to stay.

So here is the kicker: I have a relocation package that the company offered, but I haven't used it yet, except for the lump sum payment and a couple house inspections they paid for. It's not a crazy amount of money since we haven't moved yet, but it's enough to where it would be hard paying it off in the 12 months they will give me. The onky way to get out of paying for it: if I get fired.

My boss is a douche, and rarely talks to me. I've been here for 3 months and not once have I been treated with respect. I have been temporarily assigned to another group ATM to help with some current production projects, so he doesn't even know what I'm doing on a day to day basis. So getting him to fire me will be hard. He once threatened it because he wanted me to travel to leave my family for 2 months in another country and I refused, but that has turned into water under the bridge (I think?).

I've always been a hard worker and always strive to make my employers happy, so I honestly don't know how to go about potentially getting myself fired naturally. I'm curious what you guys can think of. Of course, I plan to start the debacle once I have an offer letter in hand, and even if I were to quit, I wasnt going to give them any notice.

1l9ovgq,Is my disappointment warranted or am I overreacting ?,"Hello folks. I work for a manufacturing MNC and one of the departments expanded to have their presence in India (India parent org has long existed). This department? hired me and then involved me to hire a bunch of other people (some were directly reporting to me while for others I was administrative manager only).

I was appreciated and hailed instrumental in their expansion in India. But when the time came, they split the team and made another person to manage some of the team (the ones who were reporting to me for administrative purpose). I was annoyed for a while but saw the larger benefit of having 2 managers manage their own teams with skills pertaining to the team.

Anyway I have been eyeing relocation to the European countries from some time. My manager has made it clear that there is no hiring due to budget reasons in one of the countries I am looking at but they could hire me in some other low cost European country (think Spain, Portugal).

My manager spoke to my senior manager and he then spoke to his manager (this guy is very influential in the company). The senior most manager tried to get me into this other team. I spoke to the manager of the other team and they said they will ""get back to me"". Spoiler alert: they haven't. I feel cheated and disappointed. My partner thinks I am grossly overreacting and that the senior most manager did what he could by putting in a word.

However I feel he or the company could do more ? It feels like they used my talents when they needed me for hiring folks and setting up a team. Now that they are all comfortable they did the bare minimum for me and called it a day. I am working in this role for 3 years and there has been no call for promotion either expect a title change they did 2 years ago but had no bearing over my actual role and I am still doing what I did 3 years ago !

1l9nykc,I think its time to quit but i need to hear it,"I'm a head chef being worked to death — and I feel guilty for even thinking about leaving

I’ve been working in kitchens since I was 16 (I’m 24 now). I started in 2017 at a local restaurant. Two of the chefs I worked under left in 2018 to open their own place, and in 2019 I joined them as a student. By 2022, I was full time. I’m now the head chef.

Here’s the catch:
We’re not a big operation, and I’ve become the person that keeps the kitchen running. I’m in charge of:

Ordering produce (I’m the only one who can)

Writing weekly lunch menus and à la carte menus

HACCP compliance

Scheduling both cleaning and staff shifts

Quality control

Training and babysitting 4 kitchen assistants who are, honestly, not fit for the job


And I’m also putting in hours off the clock — working from home to meet deadlines, going in on our days off to place orders and prep for the next week.

All of this for a salary that doesn’t even reflect half of what I do.

What makes it harder is that I have a close relationship with the owners. One of them is like a father figure to me. We hang out outside of work, and I genuinely care about them and the place. But the truth is — I’m burning out. Fast. And they either don’t see it or they’re too used to me holding everything together to do anything about it.

I feel guilty even thinking about leaving. Like I’d be betraying them. But the stress is eating me alive, and I’m starting to realize:
Loyalty isn’t a reason to destroy yourself.

In 5 years I’ve been a Machinist/tech, QE, Product service Engineer, and now a Mech E. I currently work for a very large company doing a new plant start up. 

About 6 weeks ago, I got put on a PIP. I need to be accountable and say there are things I could’ve done better to keep a target off my back, but tbh many heads have rolled before me and I think the project team is chaotic right now. I’ve had some good advice on navigating the pip but tbh I think they’ve made up their mind and they just don’t know how to deal with me.

My problem is; I finally think I’m getting the message from the universe. I love working with people, I think I’m a mechanically minded technical person…but when you get into this granular shit I find it pretty soul crushing.

I was working at a satellite company as a Data Analyst, but actually I was doing some Excel work and creating usable/understandable PowerBI dashboards, so it is also a little bit like UX design(not so much, I know, but a little bit related?). I am also taking the Google UX course on Coursera(not with the certificate, tho, I don't have enough money for that). I changed all my CV and even asked ChatGPT, how recruiters would like it. And still.. nothing. Since I changed my CV, I don't even get any positive feedback. My old CV was like 3 pages long, and I got 2 interviews with that, but I didn't get one of them due to my limited German and other one with location problems. But since I changed my CV, I didnt get anything.. Is my CV bad? I changed my CV and made it 1 page because it was 3 pages long. Or should I add some certificates?  Everyone says no one cares about those; the important thing is the knowledge. Well, I have the knowledge. I am literally doing a master's on this and took all the related courses + my lab rotation project. I also took eye tracking etc. I also have some little experience with Figma, too. I made an online ordering app for a local cafe with Figma. He wanted something basic, and he really liked the outcome. 

Can someone suggest to me how to proceed? especially from someone who is in this field. Can you suggest certificates or courses that would help me get hired? Or idk suggestions about CV? Or portfolio? I am really open to any kind of suggestions right now. I am even thinking of directly focusing on UX design instead of UX Research, simply because there are more job openings for this. I would also appreciate it if you could just give some tips for UX design. I don't know anyone who is in the UX field, so I have no one to ask these questions. I just wanted to get some opinions from UX people.

1l9mizo,"Put on a PIP without previous discussion, advice?","Hi all. I was put on a PIP seemingly out of the blue without discussing the items of concern prior. 

The biggest issue is that I suffer from migraines, am actively exploring different medications, and miss a few days in a row about once a month because of them. My manager and I have discussed this previously out of concern for my health, but this seems to be the main issue on the PIP and they have never told me before that the time needs to be reduced or else they’ll need to find someone else. Also it’s not like I WANT to get them, it’s miserable. There is backup for my position so they aren’t doing much, if any, extra work because of it. They decided on the PIP (and continuing after) to put me on hourly instead of salary and changed my plan from unlimited PTO (LOL so much for that) to about three weeks per year, which I’ve unfortunately already exceeded. Also no overtime is allowed, so no potential pay increase there. 

They also claim that I need to show more motivation to grow and improve. While I do acknowledge that my performance has dropped over a complicated series of events over the past few years, including undergoing an acquisition and personnel/management changes, I feel as though they should have pointed out the concerns and communicated solutions before putting me on a PIP. The communication with the people I work with is awful (generally on their end not mine). As is I just feel used and disrespected as I have gone through a lot with this company. 

There is also a ton of resentment on my end because the acquisition changed my boss from a fantastic person & manager to someone who is a good person but a terrible manager. He’s constantly absentee, often takes days to reply to me, takes weeks to reply to clients, and overall just isn’t helpful or reliable at all. When he is present he is a great resource, very knowledgeable and helpful, but most of the time he’s gone and useless. Somehow that isn’t an issue, but it’s such a problem that I’m not around when literally no one else is here anyways and someone else is covering me. So, I feel very angry and hurt right now. 

I am already actively applying to other jobs. How would you recommend I handle this situation if I don’t get a decent offer soon? Should I put my all into improving and set my feelings & the performance of my peers aside? Should I focus on the job hunt and wait for them to fire me (would I even be eligible for unemployment if that happened following a PIP)? I’m just not sure what to do. Any advice or commiseration is greatly appreciated, thank you.

1l9ltvt,22M BSc Psychology graduate - which career paths have a low risk of being replaced by AI?,"I'm here looking for advice. This will be a long post.

I'm a 22-year-old male who has just finished a BSc Psychology degree with a high 2:1 at a top 10 UK university. This degree was a primarily research-oriented degree. The course did not actually teach much about psychology, but was more so focused on how to conduct quantitative and qualitative research, mixed in with some psychology, statistics, neuroscience, biology, and extremely basic-level coding.

Regarding work experience, I have 1 year's worth of full-time work experience (essentially a placement year) in marketing wherein I primarily worked as a copywriter. I did other things like social media management, UX writing, design and SEO, but my primary role was as a copywriter. The issue is copywriters are quite likely to be replaced by AI. Sure, the best may survive but ultimately it does not seem like a particularly viable career path anymore. The same could even be said about the broader marketing industry as a whole. I doubt everyone will be replaced, but I would rather pursue a career that is safer from AI and pays better. Salaries in marketing vary exponentially and job security is quite bad, which is something I experienced firsthand on placement year. In addition to the placement year I also worked in part-time roles as a brand ambassador and as a marketing officer at a university society wherein I handled the promotion of the society's events and sessions. These were things I did primarily to help land my placement year.

I've been researching possible career paths but AI pervades the discussion about its longevity for the majority of jobs I've looked into. The only ones that seem safe from AI are blue collar jobs. Bearing this in mind do y'all have any career recommendations that are white collar jobs which are safe from AI and pay well?

Here is an honest judgement of my skills based on my grades in education and others' evaluations of my skills at work (e.g., my employer and coworkers from placement year):

\-My strongest skill is writing, which is why I gravitated towards copywriting as a potential career path prior to the advent of AI. The subjects I performed the best in at school were essay-writing subjects like English, wherein I would often achieve the top grades in my class without having to try that hard. Essentially, it is a skill that comes naturally to me.

\-I was naturally good at learning foreign languages in school although I'm not sure if this is that useful as a professional skill anymore given things like Google translate.

\-I was decent at math and sciences in school but I'm not amazing at it either. If I worked hard enough at it I could get good grades but I did not have a natural talent for it either.

\-Truthfully, I sucked at computer science in high school. I would often get the worst grades in my class, but that might also be because I also had a terrible teacher who was unwilling to offer guidance. Nevertheless, it seems like at least rudimentary understanding of coding is becoming increasingly required in today's job market given automation. From my own predictions I think a fundamental understanding of coding will eventually be taught in schools as almost a basic, necessary skill akin to arithmetic and reading/writing. Therefore, whilst I think I suck at all things coding-related, it might be a skill I need to learn regardless given its increasing importance. If any of y'all who are more well-versed with programming disagree with my take here please feel free to correct me.

\-My people skills are not amazing but they're not terrible either. I would say they are pretty much average. Some say I have a tendency to be a bit blunt and overly honest which can come off as rude. However, others have actually liked this trait about me, so I can't really say if this is a good or bad thing.

\-This is not an official technical skill, but throughout my life, I have heard from others (employers, coworkers, teachers, university lecturers, family members, peers etc.) that I have a meticulous, borderline obsessive attention to detail. Due to this, I've often been able to pinpoint flaws both in mine and others' work at a much higher frequency than others. My employer on placement year noticed this and consequently put me in charge of reviewing my coworkers' work to assess for flaws and areas for improvement. Essentially, I was assigned the responsibility of quality control because of this trait.

People in my life have recommended that I pursue law because of this trait but I don't think my grades are good enough for that (I was 1 mark off achieving a First in this BSc Psychology degree which indicates I'm probably not smart enough for law). Additionally, from what I've researched, it seems that lawyers have notoriously abysmal work-life balance to the point that I don't think I would be able to handle working in a career like that long-term. I've also never met a happy lawyer in my entire life, whereas I've met happy, well-paid professionals in other industries who are paid just as well but with better work-life balance (admittedly this is a subjective, biased judgement on my behalf). Furthermore, although corporate lawyers in the Magic Circle law firms are very well-compensated, getting to that top bracket is extremely difficult, and truthfully, I don't think I would be able to reach it. Even if I did, it's likely I would not survive there particularly long given that you have to give up your life and soul for said law firms.

Above is my honest attempt at a comprehensive evaluation of my skills. Based on this, if y'all are able to recommend possible career paths wherein I would perform well based on my skillset, I would appreciate it. **These are my requirements for this career:**

\-**PAY:** Entry level jobs in this industry must pay at least £30K/year, and ideally up to £50K/year (although the second figure might be a bit unrealistic). It should also be feasible to reach 6 figures in this career given enough years working in said industry. There needs to be high potential for career progression.

\-**GOOD JOB SECURITY**

\-**HIGH AI-RESISTANCE:** this is more of a follow-up from the previous point, but this career path I pursue needs to have a low risk of being replaced by AI. Naturally, no career is completely safe from AI, but some industries are undeniably more secure than others (e.g., healthcare).

*Below are preferences for the career path I pursue. These are less important than the requirements mentioned above, but would be nice to have:*

*-Leans well into my skillset:* \[see above skills - I would prefer to do a job that I would naturally be good at, so something that involves writing. However, I am willing to transfer to more logical, STEM-based careers if they pay better. I think if given enough effort, I could make a decent living from logic, STEM-based careers too if most writing-based career paths are not viable given my above requirements.\]

*-Good work-life balance:* It's probably unrealistic to strive for a job that both pays well and has a good work-life balance, but if it exists I'm all ears.

*-Does not require further formal education:* If possible I would rather not pursue a career that requires further formal education (e.g., a Masters), since I despised completing my degree, but if it is absolutely necessary to get my foot in the door of that industry, I will do it. I'm happy to obtain certifications and undergo bootcamps, but I'm unsure if this alone would be sufficient.

I haven't provided much info about what I'm actually interested in because truthfully I'm not all that interested in anything. A job to me is a means to an end. If it allows me to live comfortably and does not become my entire life, that is enough. If I can enjoy it great, but at the very least I need to be able to tolerate it. And nothing saps my motivation more than working towards something with poor extrinsic reward (i.e. shit pay and high turnover), no matter how interesting said work is. Even if the job might be boring, if it pays well, has good job security and does not overtake my entire life I can be ok with that.

Sorry for the long post - I wanted to provide as much context as I could think of to best guide y'all's recommendations.

1l9kugx,Am I getting taken advantage of?,"I’m a service writer for a smaller dealership, at the beginning of the year my service manger left the company. I saw the hand writing on the wall that he was bound to leave, talked through it with the branch manager on what we will do once he is gone. The solution being I just do it with help from him and everyone up front. I like my job and I would say I’m pretty competent in doing not only what the job I was hired to do but his job as well. 

The issue is, it’s 6 months later now and I get very minimal help from anyone else and more and more is being thrown on my shoulders to handle. I am for a lack of better words not only handling all the day to day activities in the shop and for our field service but also handling all of the billing of our customers and taking payment from them. It’s came to the point where I am having to take work home and work on my time off the clock just to keep my head above water. 

Like I said I really enjoy my job and everyone I work with but between the constant feeling of barley treading water and a promise of a pay raise that has yet to happen, it’s leaving not so much a bitter taste in my mouth but more of questioning if it’s worth it.

*Would my supervisor think I am rude for not passing by the hospital for a social visit during my vacation?*

Is it considered rude if I just *don't pass by my workplace at all during vacation* ?

I've noticed some people randomly come by the ward during their days off just to ""hang out""

But personally...I like to completely switch off work when I am on vacation. Is this a bad thing ?

Is this considered poor work ethic? Or not being a ""team player* ?

I don't hate my job.

But dealing with sickness and death 24/7 is stressful. So I like to switch off from that completely when on vacation.

1l9j1se,Should I consider moving to different position with the same salary ?,"Hi Guys,

  
I work in a company ""X"" as a Head of Department. I like what I am doing, salary is great, however the environment is pretty much toxic. Company is currently is in pretty poor financial situation and pressure is everywhere and micro-management from top management is crazy. I overwork a lot both sitting longer hours in office and working extra hours from home, stress level is high.

  
I have been invited to the interview with company ""Z"". Manager position with the same salary (may be can negotiate higher one on the interview itself). The position itself is close to what I am doing now but with bigger scope. My current role is very narrow due to company specific, but this manager position is wider and seems to be more exciting overall with possibility to grow skill and experience wise which I believe is good for the future, even though it is downgrade from Head to Manager.

  
What I am worried about is that how can you know that new place is better, like grass is always seems greener at neighbor yard but when you actually are there it is not always the case. So from one side I am quite intrigued to escape toxic and chaotic environment + have more experience and larger horizons in the industry, but from another one I have stable position in which I am good at, so is it worth the risk...

  
Worth to mention that I am underpaid in my current company, as recently I discovered other Heads salaries (would be better if I didnt know).

1l9irnf,Any other mature grads or career changers in accounting feel behind? Looking for advice and perspective,"Hi everyone, I’m hoping to connect with others who either graduated later in life or made a career change into accounting after years in a different field.

I recently graduated with my bachelor’s in accounting and have about 2 years of accounting experience along with several years in banking. While I’m proud of how far I’ve come, I can’t help but feel behind, especially when it comes to salary.

Since I don’t have my CPA yet, I’m still being offered entry level pay even with my experience. I interned in public accounting and actually loved it, but I need more credits before I can return as an associate. In the meantime, I have bills to pay, so I took a job in industry. The role is flexible, the staff is great, and the environment is less stressful, but I do wonder if I’m missing out on earning potential.

I’ve already accepted an offer to return to public accounting (Big 10 firm) as an associate in about a year once I complete my credits. This is where I interned during busy season. But I’m not sure what to do during this gap year. Should I stay in this industry job until the associate role begins or should I keep applying to intern roles at other Big 10 firms to build more public experience and expand my network?

If you’ve been through something similar as a mature grad or career changer, I’d really appreciate hearing how you navigated it. Did you feel behind? How did you manage your salary growth and career path?

1l9iiiw,Thinking of learning Spanish & working in Spain — would love your tips (digital marketing field),"Hi everyone!
I’m currently doing my studies in France, and while I’ll be learning French, I’m also really drawn to Spanish language and culture — honestly, I love the vibe of the people, the food, the weather (compared to here in France where the weather is often terrible!).

I’m also thinking of learning either Spanish or German, but I feel more connected to Spanish because of the culture and lifestyle.

However, I’ve heard a few concerns:
	•	Salaries in Spain are lower compared to Germany and France.
	•	Cost of living is increasing but salaries aren’t keeping up.
	•	Job market is competitive.

I’m planning to build a career in digital marketing and would love to know:
	•	What is the digital marketing job scene like in Spain right now?
	•	Are there good opportunities for non-Spanish natives if I learn the language well?
	•	What’s the general salary range in this field?
	•	Any tips on which cities are best for this career?
	•	Would you recommend starting my career in Spain or elsewhere in Europe first?

I’d really appreciate any honest feedback — I’m trying to plan this thoughtfully!

I’m a 19 (F) currently studying Geodetic Engineering in college. I genuinely love this course — I find the blend of mathematics, mapping, land surveying, and technology really fascinating. It’s the only course I could really see myself enjoying long-term.

But lately, I’ve been feeling a bit anxious about my future, especially in terms of working abroad. I’ve read that land surveying and geodetic engineering aren’t as common or recognized in some countries as they are in the Philippines. This makes me wonder: Will there be good job opportunities for me internationally once I graduate?

I’m open to taking licensure exams or certifications if needed, and I’m willing to study further if that increases my chances of finding good opportunities overseas. I just want to make sure that the path I’m on won’t limit me to only local work, especially since I dream of working or migrating abroad someday.

Has anyone here taken Geodetic Engineering or something similar and ended up working abroad? Or does anyone have advice on how to make this degree more internationally competitive? Would really appreciate any thoughts, experiences, or suggestions!

1l9elee,"29 and Feeling Lost: Wasted Years Post-Grad, Need Advice","I am a 28M (turning 29 this month) who’s struggling to figure out my next career move. I feel like I've wasted years since graduating, and I am stuck at a crossroads with no clear path forward. I am seeking advice or perspective on what to do next.

# My Background

I (Canadian) graduated in 2020 with a Bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology and Health Science, aiming to become a physiotherapist. I’ve always been passionate about fitness, health, and helping people, so physio felt like the perfect fit. I started personal training in 2016, got certified, and even competed in physique competitions. Personal training has been a side gig ever since, but it’s not a long-term career for me; the pay is too inconsistent, and it took a hit during Covid.

After graduating, I moved to Hong Kong to visit my parents, planning a short stay. Then the pandemic hit, and I was stuck there for two years. I couldn’t find Kinesiology or any other office jobs, so I worked as a food delivery courier and kept training clients to get by, making minimum wage.

In 2022, I got accepted into a Master’s in Physiotherapy in Australia, but I decided to defer for one year to save up some money for the tuition and avoid burdening my parents. I returned to Canada, started looking for Kinesiologist jobs and other jobs in healthcare, but the job market was tough. I faced months of unemployment and took short-term shitty jobs to survive for the rest of the year. Then I got my first ever office job as a coordinator and stayed until I left for Australia. In 2023 summer, I went to Australia and started the physio program, but dropped out after one semester due to financial constraints, which I’ll explain below.

By 2024, I started teaching myself web development through online courses. I built a portfolio with a few projects and recently started applying for junior developer roles, but I realized the market has changed significantly in the past 2-3 years, and it seems almost impossible to break into the industry now.

# My Timeline

* 2020 Aug: Graduated, went to HK to visit family
* 2020 Sep – Oct: Personal trainer at commercial gym
* 2020 Oct – 2022 Apr: Freelance personal trainer and food delivery courier
* 2022 Mar: Got an offer for a Master’s in Physiotherapy (deferred to 2023)
* 2022 Jun – 2023 Jun: Returned to Canada, job-hunted in healthcare, took short-term jobs (personal trainer, food delivery, factory, warehouse, office coordinator),3-4 months unemployed
* 2023 Jul – 2023 Dec: Physio Master’s first semester in Australia
* 2023 Jan: Decided to drop out and pivot to tech
* 2024 Feb – Mar: Returned to Canada, unemployed, started studying web development
* 2024 Apr – Jun: Worked as a line cook—the only job I could find, to survive and save up for my upcoming trip
* 2024 Jul – Sep: Backpacking trip in Europe
* 2024 Oct – Present: Full-time self-taught web development, built portfolio & projects
* 2025 May: Started applying for junior developer roles

# Why I’ve Wasted Time Post-Grad

I am frustrated because I feel like I have wasted my 20s. Here’s why I have wasted so much time and am so behind:

* Pandemic Trap (2020–2022): Getting stuck in Hong Kong during Covid derailed my plans. I wanted to launch a career in healthcare, but instead, I was delivering food and scraping by with personal training. Those two years feel like a black hole where I missed out on opportunities.
* Physio Deferral Mistake (2022–2023): Deferring my Master’s in 2022 was supposed to be responsible—I didn’t want to burden my parents financially, so I planned to work in Canada to save up and meanwhile gain healthcare experience. But I couldn’t land any Kinesiology or rehab/health-related jobs, despite applying everywhere. I spent months unemployed, and the shitty short-term jobs I took didn’t add anything meaningful to my resume or savings.
* January 2024 – Dropping Out and Pivoting to Tech: I failed a course in my physio program and I had to redo it, which means my graduation would be delayed by a year. This prompted me to rethink continuing. I crunched the numbers: tuition plus 2–3 years not earning meant I’d be 31–32 before paying off debt, with no savings. I also prioritized my parents’ well-being—they don’t make much, and I wanted to support them sooner rather than rely on them. I saw that my sacrifice for continuing the physio program was too high, despite my passion for it. After researching extensively online, web development seemed like a better alternative at the time: free to learn, with quick entry (from the info I saw), remote work opportunities, and high pay potential. So I decided to drop out in January 2024 and started teaching myself web dev, hoping to reach financial stability faster for myself and my parents. But now the tech market is oversaturated, even CS grads struggle to break in, which makes me question my choice.
* Job Search Struggles (2020–2024): Beyond the physio dropout, I’ve spent too much time unemployed or in jobs that didn’t build my career. I kept applying to healthcare roles early on, but the markets are tough and I later resorted to taking on any job I could get. Even when I worked, like as a line cook in 2024 to save up for my Europe backpacking trip, the roles were just for survival, not progress. That trip was a lifelong dream, and I don’t regret it, but coming back to no job or savings felt like hitting reset again. I feel like I’ve been running in circles for years.

I keep replaying these “what ifs”—what if I’d stayed in Canada in 2020, found a way to fund physio, or started tech earlier? It’s hard not to feel like I’ve wasted time and fallen way behind. And my future seems doomed.

# My Job Market Concerns

I am not just lost, I am worried about my future. Here’s what’s keeping me up at night:

* Tough Entry-Level Market: Landing a junior role feels impossible with the massive layoffs. I am competing with people who have more experience or formal training can code or automate tasks, so why hire a newbie like me? Not to mention it’s evolving rapidly. It makes me question if I’m betting on the wrong field.
* Financial Pressure: I have almost no savings. My parents don’t make a lot, and I want to support them someday, but I can’t even cover my own bills. I am currently personal training a few clients to get by, but I need a proper income soon.
* Lifestyle Needs: I want a career with flexibility—ideally, remote work so I can visit my parents in HK more often. They are aging, and I’d feel guilty being so far away. I also dream of living abroad again, maybe the US, Europe, or Australia.
* Fear of Another Mistake: Every choice I’ve made—deferring physio, jumping to tech—hasn’t panned out. terrified of picking the wrong path again and wasting more years. I am running out of time and can’t afford to fuck up anymore.

# What’s Next?

I’m trying to decide my next step, but I am overwhelmed by the possibilities and my options. Here’s what I am thinking about, with my honest pros, cons, and doubts:

* Keep Pursuing Web Development
   * Why Consider It: I enjoy the creativity of building websites and apps, and I have invested time in learning. I am thinking about focusing on health tech—maybe fitness or wellness apps—since it ties to my fitness roots. Remote work is common, which is perfect for my ideal lifestyle.
   * Worries: The job market is a bloodbath—hundreds of applicants per role, and I have no professional experience at all. I'm scared AI will wipe out junior roles entirely before I even get my foot in the door. I don’t know if I'm good enough or if I am just wasting more time.
   * Thoughts: Should I double down, keep learning, building projects, apply, and maybe freelance to build experience? Or is this a losing battle?
* Learn Cybersecurity (/ Cloud Computing / Networking, etc.)
   * Why Consider It: I’ve heard these fields are booming with better job prospects and pay than web dev. They’re supposed to be more “future-proof” against AI and the market seems less saturated, and remote work is an option. These fields might be easier to break into.
   * Worries: It’s at least another 6-12 months of studying, certifications cost money. It’s a big gamble. What if I am walking the old road all over again and end up wasting more time?
   * Thoughts: It sounds more promising, but the upfront time and cost scare me. Is this a smarter bet than sticking with web dev, or am I jumping ship too soon?
* Go Back to Healthcare (Physiotherapy or Related)
   * Why Consider It: Physio is my passion—helping people recover is meaningful, and the job is stable with decent pay. My parents recently offered to fully support me financially if I return to the physio master’s. My degree and training experience are relevant.
   * Other Healthcare Paths: I could explore healthcare policy or management, which leverages my Kinesiology background and offers stable, office-based roles with potential for remote work. Insurance or medical device sales could also be a fit—my client-facing experience as a trainer could help, and these fields offer good pay with less schooling than physio.
   * Worries: Returning to physio means 2-3 years of study, and even with my parents’ support, I’d be 31–32 before starting my career, delaying my ability to support them. And it defeats the purpose of my dropping out in the first place. Policies, insurance, or sales roles might be less fulfilling than physio and still require new skills or certifications. Physio is also less flexible—no remote work, and I’d be more likely stuck in one country, away from my parents.
   * Thoughts: Physio’s my dream, and my parents’ support makes it more feasible, but the time commitment is daunting. Are policy, insurance, or sales better for quicker entry and flexibility? Is it worth restarting, or am I chasing an old plan?
* Government Jobs (Border Services Officer, Firefighting, Policing, etc.)
   * Why Consider It: Government jobs like these offer stability and solid pay. Firefighting appeals to my physical side and desire to help others. These feel “safe” compared to tech or healthcare’s uncertainty, and I am well-qualified.
   * Worries: Hiring takes forever(12-18 months). There’s no flexibility—shift work, no remote options—and I might get posted somewhere remote, making family visits hard. And it would be hard to switch careers in the future if I ever want to. Do I want this long-term?
   * Thoughts: Security is tempting, pay is good, but it feels like settling. Would I regret choosing something less exciting and comfortable?
* Other Paths (Marketing, Real Estate, etc.)
   * Why Consider It: Digital marketing seems remote-friendly and creative, maybe easier to break into. Real estate could be lucrative, but it’s risky. I could go back to personal training full-time, but it’s a dead end.
   * Worries: These feel like random pivots, the market seems crowded, and I don’t bring a lot to the table since I don’t have many transferable skills.
   * Thoughts: None of these feel right, but I'm desperate for ideas. Is Any worth pursuing?

# What I Truly Want

If I could design my ideal career, it’d be:

* Flexible, with remote work opportunities so I can spend time with my parents in HK—they are getting older, and I want to be there for them. They also expressed that they would want to move abroad or at least spend half the year living abroad if they had the chance.
* Something that lets me live abroad someday.
* Stable enough not to worry about AI or layoffs for at least a decade.
* Tied to health, fitness, or helping people, so I feel like I’m making a difference.
* Pays enough to support myself and eventually help my parents.

But I don’t know how to get there. I feel like I am choosing between survival and chasing a dream that might not exist.

# What Should I Do?

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. I am overwhelmed and could use any advice, insights, or even a reality check. Have you been stuck like this and found a way forward? Which path makes the most sense: stick with web dev, try cybersecurity, go back to healthcare, pursue government jobs, or something else? How do I stop wasting time and make a decision without regretting it? I’m open to all ideas, whether it’s practical steps, mindset shifts, or stories from your own journey.

1l9dzw9,Certifications: What I Wish I Knew Before Choosing a Six Sigma Program (Career Changer Perspective),"So years ago, I was trying to figure out how to level up my career in operations and leadership and Six Sigma kept coming up everywhere. But the more I dug into it, the more I realized how confusing the certification landscape is.

Since a lot of people here are looking for ways to strengthen resumes, build skills, or pivot careers, I figured I’d share a few things I wish someone had told me when I first started researching Six Sigma certifications:

1. Not all certifications are created equal.

You’ll see a huge range in price, quality, and actual substance. Some providers offer programs that advertise ""Green Belt in 2-4 hours""... but realistically, no meaningful certification should take just a few hours. A solid Green Belt program should involve 50–60+ hours of training, case studies, and real application of the tools.

2. Beware of faceless providers.

One thing I didn’t think about at first was, who’s actually teaching this? A lot of providers don’t even list the instructor’s name or credentials, it’s just a company logo selling a cert. My rule now is.... if you wouldn’t take a university course from a mystery professor, don’t do it with career certifications either.

3. The “official accreditation” confusion.

Unlike certifications like PMP or CPA, Six Sigma doesn’t have one official governing body. A lot of companies advertise “global accreditation” or make it sound like they're officially regulated — but many are simply private businesses (IASSC, for example, is owned by PeopleCert, based overseas). That doesn’t make them bad, but it’s worth understanding that there’s no single gold standard authority.

4. What employers actually care about.

What gets people hired or promoted isn’t just passing an exam,  it’s being able to actually apply the tools like root cause analysis, process mapping, DMAIC or control charts.

The cert is just one piece, building real skill is what opens doors.

There are solid programs out there, you don’t need to overspend, but it’s worth being intentional about who you learn from. Look for one from a real instructor with actual experience and industry backings, because knowledge is what is key, and learning how to apply the skills in the real world, will set you up for success.

I have always been interested in sales and besides limited experience doing inside sales ( no commision) I have always been in operations and production management. 

The hours are long but I don't mind it, I have been at my current company for 5 years been promoted quickly and am on a fast track for further promotion. The benefits are good but again, the hours and stress of managing 60 - 70 people nightly has it's downsides. I make good money with guaranteed raise. 

A close friend who left a similar position at my company years ago tobtake a sales job is being promoted and is able to essentially choose his successor to take of his sales territory. He has done well and is confident i would transition and have good performance. 

I have interviewed and been offered the position with a good base salary ( I would struggle to cover expenses on base alone though), vehicle allowance, .20 center a mile ( about 2000-2500 miles a month) and then 3% commission on gp monthly. 

My sales director is confident inwould do well and am fortunate to have a lot of groundwork already done by my friend who has been in this territory the last few years. 

I am strongly considering taking this rile. My somewhat conservative nature does have me worried about such a large change, not as good of benefits ( health and 401k matching) but also thr ability to have greatest control over my daily schedule, and be at home at night ( I currently work overnight shift ) and the potential to learn new skill and increase income are very attractive.

1l9dwr9,Do I sound overly passive at work or is the way I talk and act good?,"I'll try to explain by comparing me to my coworker. Both of us have a job role where we're basically  double checking the work of about 100 people. 

Examples of how I act:

1. Say I'm asked to review a report you're working on. My comments will be like this ""you could change the paragraph like this..."" or ""you can remove the extra information in this paragraph"".

2. I would say if any person I'm double checking the work for starts to act frustrated at all I basically back off right away unless I feel like a safety issue is being impacted.

3. I'll never really ask a ton of questions towards anyone. Especially if a task seems straightforward.

My coworker using the same Examples is like this:

1. She would have comments like ""your paragraph doesn't make any sense. You need to change it like this...""

2. My coworker almost seems to enjoy conflict. Like, I saw an email where a guy was calling her foolish basically and she was laughing about it and saying things of the same nature back.

3. My coworker could ask like 50 questions about a task thst involves 10 steps.

1l9cd9i,Am I being placed on a performance improvement plan?,"
30F and I just had an evaluation at my job, I was told it was a “good review” (scored 16/18) but certain traits are preventing me from fully aligning with company values. Traits: harping on setbacks too much, second guessing my abilities (they said I know more than I realize) & comparing myself to other advisors. I don’t feel like I’m micromanaged at this job & I’ve gotten “good” feedback from management but the fact this trait was evident at work made me uneasy. I’m told I’m an asset & a good advisor but this feedback contradicts that. 

There’s two sections of the review, KPIs and company values. With KPIs, I was meeting all benchmarks. With the company values, there were 3 & you needed to get a perfect score with 2/3 to be “aligned”. But because I only got a perfect score with 1/3, it didn’t align with that section of the review. This was my 2nd semester, I also scored a 16/18 during my first (mock) semester but met expectations w/ KPIs + company values. The review already happened & I thought it was just a verbal conversation. Mgmt said: I’m not in trouble, it’s not a performance plan where I’m being monitored for a certain time & I wont be scrutinized during our one-on-ones anymore than usual because of this. But when I check the HRIS software, they expect me to review  it & leave a comment for the task to be “resolved”. Plus my supervisor wants to talk about the task during our 1:1, I checked the handbook but still unsure..

1l9bcdp,Should I quit everything and start a new life or stay depressed to graduate,"Hello, so basically I am leaving one of the most important decision of my life and my life's fate to strangers. I will appreciate if you took the time to read it out and leave your thoughts, any advice is welcomed. I will try to make this as brief as I can:

Three years ago (summer 2022) I transfered universities to Ottawa, Canada which was the worst decision of my life. I was always a high energy, joyful, ambitious and hardworking person, but since I moved here my mental health has been getting worse and worse by the day. I've struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, depression and loneliness which I have never had before because the city is so dead an unappealing to me and all the friendships I've made are either toxic/draining or don't last. Due to all the mental struggles I listed above, I went from a A-B student to practically failing all my courses to the point where next year I'm taking a compulsory course for the fourth time (last chance or I will need to change my major). I have tried everything, from changing the environnent I live in, to friend groups, to taking a semester break at home but I always seem to go back to the same mental space. 

My problem here is first I can not find the quality of people I genuinely like and can be friends with. Not to be mean, but all the three years here all the people I met have not been inspiring, in the contrary, all my all friends and family have made the remark that I have downgraded so much mentally and physically. Als the city is just so uninspiring and dead FOR ME that I don't feel like I'm growing and evolving into my full potential because I was born and raised in a big city so that's what I like. And yes I have tried therapy but I know its all from the bad environment and I have contemplated taking antidepressants but why would I do this to myself when I know the solution is just moving out.

However, this is where it gets complicated. If everything goes well and I dont fail any courses I have two more years to go until I graduate (so 7 years for 4 year bachelors and I will be 25 yo). I know it might sound a bit like a cry baby but hear me out. I'm faced with two choices :

1- I take a risk and stay one more year where I will feel like kms everyday and hope not to fail any of the hard courses that I have and then, if I'm accepted into my exchange, I will go my dream destinations Paris and Brazil the next year ( if im not accepted I think i will genuinely kms lol).

2- Give up on this situation that I've been trying to make work for 3 years and not prolong it anymore. I will go back home this fall semester ( again ) and take a risk of transfering to somewhere I like (like Paris) despite my awful grades and gpa (so I run the risk of not getting accepted), probably have to change majors, and take way longer to graduate. But I least if I go to like Paris I have my cousin and a friend there and hopefully I can make some new friends that I like ( I speak french fluently) and enjoy my everyday life more and get my motivation and personality back.

(I just have these negative thoughts that if I do all this effort and sacrifices and move to Paris just to be alone and depressed again and get nowhere in life).

So this is basically my story and what have been eating me up these last months. Thank you so much if you read all this and I appreciate any comment or advice thank you in advance",guihgjgr,3,1.0,3,1749695649,2025-06-12 02:34:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9bcdp/should_i_quit_everything_and_start_a_new_life_or/,6,2025

1l9arud,I have a crush on my boss.,"I get it, this won’t end well. But I think what I’m looking for here is the validation. I’m in my early 20s. My boss is in his early 30s. I’m relatively an attractive girl. I’ve been hit on by almost every man at my workplace. My boss is very supportive of me. He is also nice to me as any ordinary person would be.

One time he had checked me out. I saw his eyes go from one place to another. We use to brush into each other a couple times and even hung out once after work for some food. Time flew by. However, my boss started to label me as a “kid” whereas everyone surrounding him whom are much older still flirt with me. 

I don’t understand sometimes why he wants to support me so much. He does alot of gentlemen things around me but I seriously cannot tell if it’s cause he’s just such a nice guy who sees nothing in me. He knows I’m single, and I know he’s single as well. I just don’t know how to drop a hint that I could be interested. Or maybe he knows? 

I wonder if I’ll ever have a chance with my boss. I try to make conversation with him nowadays but he cuts it so short.",GullibleWrongdoer732,0,0.30000001192092896,15,1749693943,2025-06-12 02:05:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9arud/i_have_a_crush_on_my_boss/,6,2025
1l9afd6,Company A vs. Company B (need advice),"Hi!

I have 2 job offers from Company A and Company B, both abroad. My priority is Company A and I received a job offer last Friday. I accepted the offer and HR replied last Monday. She acknowledged my acceptance, said that she would be drafting the contract during that day, and send it for my review. However, it has been more than 2.5 days already and I haven't received the contract yet for signing. The offer already indicated the role, salary, and leave details.

Came Wednesday, I received a JO from Company B. The offer contains the information and needs my signature for acceptance. I am okay with Company B but my priority is Company A. The contract will be provided upon approval of visa processing. It was dated June 5 and states that it be sent back on June 8. But I got it on June 11 so I was thinking that maybe there are just a few days to accept from the date of receipt.

Is it safe not to accept Company B anymore? My worry is that I'll be left without both opportunities. I know someone who accepted the offer from Company A and received the contract a day after accepting. To those recruiters here, is there a chance that they will not send me the contract? The tone of the recruiter is on a positive note and even said to give her a call if I need clarifications though she wasn't able to get back to me until now.",etherealpuppy_,1,1.0,3,1749692942,2025-06-12 01:49:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9afd6/company_a_vs_company_b_need_advice/,6,2025

1l99skp,Getting a job without the experience/ CV help,"Hi!

Long story short, my husband has decided to complete his high school in order to get into a new career. He has been pretty miserable where he currently is and he's interested in becoming a fire inspector. The school he would potentially attend, although are open to people with High School equivalencies, sees having work experience as a bonus, and it would help him into being admitted. Right now he's preparing for HS exams. 

And coincidentally, there's a place 10 minutes from home, looking for someone, without any degree mentioned in their add. I guess it wouldn't hurt to apply, right?

But my husband has been a machinist for a few years, and doesn't have any experience connected to inspecting fire alarms. So we're a little bit stumped on how to jazz his curriculum. From employers, and from people who've had late career changes, what could be done to maximize a good first impression on paper?

1l99dec,"20, lost my best friend, mom has cancer — don’t know if I should go to college or start working","I’m really hoping someone out there can help me process everything, because I need to decide by the end of this week whether to withdraw or commit to college, and I’ve never felt more torn in my life.

I’m 20 years old. I took two gap years after losing my best friend unexpectedly and helping care for my mom, who’s been battling breast cancer. During that time, I’ve tried to stay productive, working jobs, launching creative projects, even exploring legal and marketing experience. But now I’m at a crossroads.

I’ve been accepted to a top 70 school (Tulane), and would be paying about $5.9K a year, which could go up or down depending on financial aid next year. I’d need to take on debt and work a job (probably work study) just to afford to be there. That’s a lot, on top of jumping back into academics after being out of school for years. And honestly, I’m not even sure what I want to study anymore.

Originally, I was interested in finance or econ, but with AI moving at such a terrifying pace, I don’t even know if those jobs will be around in 2029 when I graduate. I’ve seen so many articles and studies showing how AI is replacing human roles faster than anyone expected, especially in white collar work. I feel like I’d be going into debt just to study something that might not even exist, unless I get extremely lucky or come from connections (which I don’t).

On top of that, I’m really isolated socially. I don’t have any friends right now besides my younger brother. Part of me wants to go to college just to meet people and feel like I belong somewhere. But then again, is it really worth all the money, time, and pressure just for a social life?

The alternative, I have an opportunity to move out with my brother and work full time in the city. I’d probably get a job in sales, marketing, or maybe paralegal/legal support based on my background. I’d start making money now instead of waiting four years, and I wouldn’t be in debt. But I also wonder, will that keep me stuck forever?

I’m also Christian, and I feel like a lot of industries now, especially tech, are moving in directions I don’t morally align with. I don’t want to be part of pushing AI into the world, especially if it replaces people and strips away our humanity. I want a life that feels meaningful, faith-aligned, and independent. But how do I build that?

I feel so torn.
Do I go to college, take the risk, and try to build a future?
Or do I stay behind, start working now, and build my life from the ground up?
Will I regret passing up a college opportunity?
Or will I regret wasting four years and money for something that’s already being replaced?

I just want a life that’s real. I want to work hard, grow, love God, build a future, and feel alive again. But I’m stuck. And I need help. Any insight, from students, adults, professionals, anyone who’s been in my shoes, would mean the world right now.

1l98qxq,I think I overshared at my new job and it's making me spiral a little,"Hi guys. I'll get straight to the point. I'm autistic, 25F. I don't have many friends and about 2 weeks ago I had a job that I kinda hated but I knew where I stood with my awful coworkers. It was kind of a supervisor position. Now I got the opportunity to work at one of those positions I used to supervise (It wasn't really a demotion since I knew my previous contract couldn't be extended and my coordinator offered to move me to this position so I could keep working in this program) and I'm finally free of my own awful supervisor, which has been wonderful. However, I got into this new job and my coworker has been SO nice & welcoming that when she asked what I thought about my previous supervisor I couldn't help but overshare. I told her I really didn't like her and that she was problematic and not really liked at all, which is why they'd had a problem previously. 

Now I'm thinking I really screwed up since 1 week of knowing each other has definitely not been enough to share those kinds of things. I'm really worried that she won't turn out to be such a kind person after all and I'll end up screwed over. I know I'm being paranoid but 1. historically I'm way too naïve with people 2. I've learned that in this work enviroment it's really rare that people aren't being duplicitous. 

I guess I'm panicking. The change has been SO hard on me & I'm working on getting used to driving a car & also I think my new boss doesn't really like me that much & it's all been too much this past week. I know I did something wrong but I don't know how to move past it. I would appreciate it if you had some advice on how to get past this and avoid oversharing in the future.  Anyway thanks.",vale_jo,3,0.8100000023841858,3,1749687946,2025-06-12 00:25:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l98qxq/i_think_i_overshared_at_my_new_job_and_its_making/,6,2025
1l987cz,"""You don’t need a full plan. Just a next step.”","One of the biggest lies we’re sold: 
“You need to have it all figured out before you start.”

That belief kept me stuck for years.
I kept waiting until I felt more ready, more skilled, more certain. 

But the truth? 
Clarity comes from movement, not overthinking.

When I finally took the first step - even without the full roadmap - momentum happened. 
I learned faster. Connected quicker. Grew smarter. 

So if you’re stuck in “what if” land, do this: 
* Pick one small action that moves you forward. 
* Don’t aim for perfect. Aim for real. 
* Follow curiosity, not pressure. 

Examples: 
- DM someone in a role you admire 
- Sign up for a free online class 
- Redesign your resume for fun 
- Share your story online (like this) 

Don’t underestimate the power of one brave step.

1l984az,DUI disclosure?,"Hello, I have made it to the final round interview for a mechanical contracting company for a technical installer position. The job would provide a vehicle to commute to and from job sites.

I’ve since quit drinking and stopped driving like a jerk. I’ve completed the all steps mandated by the court and have maintained clean record since. 

I feel as though I should disclose this before the background check is made, as to not look as though I am hiding anything. I recognize that I fucked up and have done a lot of work to grow and change. 

My plan would be to let them know after a verbal offer is made and before anything is signed/background check is ordered.

I have been in the same industry for 9 years now which is construction/maintenance of buildings. I got a new job 8 months ago as a manger position which is my first time ever being an assistant manger. 

The first 4 months was smooth and I thought I was getting it but the past 4 months have been crazy. I have been stressed and we have been losing jobs cause of me left and right. I have now been put in a performance plan. 

When the owners asked me what happened, I tried explaing to them what happened and all they said it sounded like excuses. 

When I started to analyze everything that went down hill. We caught a whole 12 man crew drinking on the job and had to fire everyone, we have 12 guys that are new -  6 that are completely new to the industry. We had a break in at the shop and got all our equipment stolen and had to start using old equipment that keeps breaking down. The manager I work under, his dad died in a car crash and left for a month and I had no guidance or list of jobs only heard of those jobs after complains through email. 

Now that he’s back his mom has stage four cancer and he is here every other day. He’s a great guy but without him or guidance I’m falling apart and starting to rethink if this is the role for me but it’s a role I really wanted to help and teach new guys.

I was told by the recruiter at the outset of the process that there would be 4 rounds of interviews (in addition to the initial screen). Felt great about the role and company overall through each round, and felt I was successful at each step.

I was then asked for some references yesterday. Now, I've never provided references without an offer in hand but I understand some companies consider this in the decision process so I let them know I would put these together by the end of the week.

The recruiter has reached out again to say there's actually ANOTHER round with the manager for the 'finalists' -- now I feel even more hesitant about handing out my references since they don't seem to be at the decision making phase. I'm actually quite frustrated, frankly. I'm confident my references will give me glowing recommendations but I also want to be respectful of their time and energy if this company is not serious in proceeding with an offer. 

Should I reach out to the recruiter to ask for clarity or push back on this request? This ""last"" interview seems to have come out of left field and I'm really not sure how to navigate this as I have never experienced anything like it before.

For a month straight, I've been slammed with constant deadlines, forcing me to work long hours to squeak out work full of mistakes. I rarely get enough sleep, because I know those mistakes are there- I simply have no time to do the work correctly, even when I tell my managers I do not have the time to do it well, the deadlines remain, or are even pushed up for reasons which are never explained to me.

I want to leave- but I know that's not a good idea. If nothing else, I should start pushing back against these deadlines, but trying never works, and they just blame me for these mistakes I have no opportunity to look for instead of taking a step back and realizing these time-frames are unrealistic. They work late too. I don't know why they don't try and push for better.

1l95mpx,Manager makes me feel crazy and gaslit,"A couple months ago, I (23F) was moved onto a new events team after my old manager left. I wasn’t given any real training, structure, or support just expected to pick things up and ""take full ownership"" without knowing what I’m even owning.

Recently, we’re planning a major event and my manager asked me to handle name badges. I started doing exactly that, until creative asked for things like the vendor and specs. I had no idea bc we’ve briefly discussed vendor management and I’ve never handled that before. I pinged my manager for help throughout the day, and she ignored me. Then hours later, she sent me a email instead of replying in chat and I’m pretty sure someone was CC’d secretly to make it seem like I dropped the ball.

To make it worse, in that email she lied and said she had already told me we had a PO (purchase order), but she absolutely hadn’t. This isn’t the first time she’s constantly claiming she’s told me things that she hasn’t, then scolding me for not doing them. I’ve asked her multiple times for clearer direction since I’m still learning, but I always get hit with attitude or made to feel like I’m not stepping up enough. I managed to get the details I needed for creating the tent cards from other team members so I was really confused on her claiming I wasn’t on top of it when in our check-in I went through everything with her.

We had a random 30 day check-in a few weeks ago and she ripped me to pieces with things like “you’re not taking full ownership, not communicative, bad with time management” even though I’ve felt that I’ve maximized for what I’ve been giving/taught

Every check-in feels tense and uncomfortable, like I’m about to be reprimanded. There’s no one else on the team I can go to, and I honestly feel exhausted, anxious, and gaslit.

Here’s the email. Anything in () has been deleted for confidentially purposes.

1l95g4i,Manager feedback - advice,"
Hi everyone,

Looking for some outside perspective on a situation that’s left me feeling confused and a bit deflated.

I recently had a 1:1 catch-up with my Senior Manager. As context, the company has gone through significant redundancies recently. My team has been reduced from 8 people down to 3, and I’ve been doing everything I can just to keep BAU running. There’s very little capacity, and I’ve been juggling hands-on delivery with leadership and trying to hold things together during a tough time.

During the conversation, he asked how things were going. I was honest and said it’s been hard, that I’m focused on managing the day-to-day as best I can because, quite frankly, there aren't enough people left to delegate to.

His response caught me off guard. He said something like:

Do you feel like your head is stuck in the parapet?”  
Then added, “As it stands right now, you’d be seen as a bad manager. And in normal times, I'd probably be telling you that you had 2–3 months to fix things.

That hit me hard — especially because immediately after that, he said he *knows* I’m capable, that I’ve been putting in a real effort, and that he *can see* the work I’ve been doing. He also told me that my salary will be increasing as part of the appraisal process.

So on one hand:

* I’m being told that I’d be considered a poor manager in ""normal"" circumstances and would be on a clock to improve.
* On the other hand, I’m being told that I’m doing a great job considering the circumstances, I’m being rewarded with a pay rise, and he believes in my potential.

It’s left me confused about where I actually stand. Is this a warning? Is it support? A bit of both? I’ve been pushing hard to keep the wheels on, and while I know things aren’t perfect, I’m genuinely doing my best in an environment where resources are thin and morale is fragile. I was hoping for more constructive support rather than criticism — especially without any clear development plan or feedback prior to this.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of mixed message from a leader?  
How would you interpret this? And would you follow up to clarify, or just focus on proving yourself in the next few months?

Appreciate any thoughts or advice — really trying to make sense of this and stay on track.",aar_91uk,3,1.0,4,1749679050,2025-06-11 21:57:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l95g4i/manager_feedback_advice/,6,2025

1l95czh,MSc Quant Finance at WU (2-year) vs. MSc Data Science at UvA (1-year)?,"I’m a 24-year old financial consultant from Hungary. I have graduated from International Business Economics with a supplement diploma in financial mathematics, including tons of extra credits in advanced statistics, econometrics and financial mathematics (probability, stochastic calculus). I have been working for 2 years now in a Big4 as risk consultant, but I will start my master abroad this fall with 2 options remaining: MSc quantitative finance at WU Vienna and MSc data science at UvA (Amsterdam).  
  
I cannot make up my mind about which one to pursue, as I have always planned to work in high finance, investment banking (I sorta burnt out of this) or portfolio management / algorithmic trading. However, during my 2 years of consultancy, I have not worked with data that closely with (ofc it’s a specific career, other finance jobs might have closer everyday tasks with data analysis), thus I started thinking maybe transitioning into data science would be better for my future satisfaction.  
  
The problem is, I have no clue which one will bring more satisfaction. I have always pursued academics towards financial mathematics and always planned to work in the field, it feels like a too sharp drift from my plan to just abandon it so suddenly and transition towards DS.  
  
On the other hand, 2 years of consultancy and financial culture really made me question whether I want to continue working in the same environment in the future (I assume quant trading / asset management has about the same culture).  
  
Neither option has clear advantate over the other: DS is only 1 year long and its in Amsterdam, which is our ultimate plan to move to together with my partner. Studying at a dutch university surely helps us both find a job easier and we can enjoy the lifestyle of the dutch even during our studies.  
  
QF is 2 years long, which on one hand feels like I get more knowledge, but in the other hand, considering my age, I’ll be 27 by the time I graduate and start again on the labor market once again from the bottom. It is also in Vienna, which means -2 years in the NL, where I want to move ultimately. Moving to the NL at age 27 feels like I only have 3-4 years before having to consider moving back home for starting a family. Finding a job and housing in the NL from Vienna is also definitely harder than graduating in the NL.  
  
I also feel like doing QF in general is more prestigous and I feel like its more serious and differentiating than DS, but still, pursuing DS in the NL might provide everything I might need in the future, except for the fact that I couldn’t say that I’m a quant.  
  
Then again, I’m really not sure what exactly I want to work, might stay in the financial sector, might transition to another industry.  
Moreover, I feel like my stacked academic and professional background is quite irrelevant if I transition, and it feels less secure to find a job in DS for this reason, meanwhile I’m pretty confident in finding a job with my background and an MSc QF in the finance sector.  
  
Which path should I go down?

1l94wtg,Career pivot advice needed – From teaching to marketing,"Hey everyone,

I’m 24 and currently at a bit of a crossroads in my career, and would love some advice or insight from people who’ve maybe been in similar shoes.

I’ve got a degree in education and have been working as a substitute teacher (CRT) for the past three years while traveling. It’s been a good fit for that lifestyle, but I’ve always known that teaching isn’t something I see myself doing long-term. It’s one of those jobs where you really need to love it, and while I’ve had some great moments, I just don’t feel that passion.

What I am interested in is the world of fashion and more specifically marketing. This year I decided to finally act on that interest and enrolled in a postgraduate certificate in marketing. I’ve completed one unit so far and I’m enjoying it — it feels like the right direction.

But now I’m in a weird in-between stage. I’m still CRTing (which gives me flexibility and income), but I want to start getting experience or building towards a marketing career — especially ideally within fashion, but I’d also be open to other areas just to get started.

My main questions are:

What should I be doing right now while still CRTing to help make the transition?
Should I be trying to get an internship or entry-level marketing job?
I don’t really have any connections or experience in the business world — how do I even begin networking or finding a foot in the door?
I’d be happy to start somewhere adjacent to marketing just to get some experience or exposure. I just feel a bit lost on where and how to begin when I’m coming from such a different field.

Any advice, personal stories, or even just encouragement would be super appreciated!

Thanks in advance 🙏

Stable job: 
Supportive enough
Can’t get fired 
Exit plan within two years if I really wanted to leave for higher pay that’s not sales

Sales job: 
Higher base and double current salary if quota achieved
Will struggle if let go within 6 months
Would achieve all short term financial goals if successful 
Life changing earnings 

Career paths:
Current position - Leadership role in project management or consulting. Certifications achieved this year such as PMP. 

Sales position - high earning sales career. Most likely will earn more than other options but will assume more risk. 

End goal: own a business.

Over time, I realized I work best with guys going through the same stuff I’ve dealt with — pressure to hold everything together, overthinking every decision, feeling like you can’t talk about what’s really bothering you. You know, the quiet kind of burnout most of us carry.

So I recently started a small coaching business focused on just that: simple, casual 1-on-1 sessions where guys can actually talk through what they’re dealing with — without judgment, weird “life hack” advice, or therapy buzzwords.

I’m still young and exploring options, and I’d really appreciate any advice from people who have gone down similar paths — especially when it comes to work-life balance, income potential, and how things play out in real life vs. on paper. I know I should focus on my bachelor right now, but many of my friends have a plan and are working or studying according to that. I want to aim for something too. I don’t really know what my passion is all I know is I want to earn good and have a good happy life.

Right now, I’m considering three main paths:
	1.	Law – Going for a JD in the USA after my bachelor’s and becoming a lawyer.
	2.	Business – Doing a one-year master’s in the UK after my bachelors, working there for 2or3 years, then applying for an MBA.
	3.	Psychology – After by bachelors applying for a phd in USA 

My main priorities are financial stability, a good income, and being able to enjoy the wealth I earn — not just grind nonstop. I’m totally okay with putting in extra hard work in the first 3–4 years of my career, but after that, I’d like a great salary and a healthy work-life balance. I don’t come from the EU, so I have to be careful about my decisions since visa/work options can be tricky if things don’t work out.

If you’ve gone down any of these paths (JD, MBA, or PhD in Psychology), how’s your quality of life now? Would you choose it again?

1l93din,Looking to switch from R&D to Forensic Engineering,"Tl;DR is the title

I'm currently interviewing for Forensic Engineering positions and I'm trying to make sure I'm making the right choice.

Background;

I am a mechanical engineer with +7 YOE and a PE license. I currently work in academia as a staff engineer doing R&D work. It's very fun and interesting, however the pay is not where I should be for being licensed and nearing close to a decade of experience. My wife and I just got married and the thought in my brain right now is: make more money so we can start a family. We live in a HCOL city and our household income is $170k/year before taxes - we each make $85k-ish a year.

I'm looking for opportunities within my field, in my city, but the options are limited and highly competitive. That's why I found forensic engineering.

In forensics, the job is less about sitting on a computer doing technical work more about site visits and writing reports on your findings which utilizes my PE license. My current job doesn't utilize my license. And due to this the pay ceiling for this field is much higher.

With the companies I'm talking to it sounds like I could hit around $120k/year (+$35k raise) or more, +OT + Bonuses, with the actual salary being closer to $150-180k/year. It sounds great in that aspect.

There's also the loss of technical work, which is unfortunate. It would more or less cement me into the industry and make it difficult to transition back to technical work. But I know I have technical outlets where I feel like i could fill my cup and stay ""satisfied"" in that way.

Another plus is that the work would scale to higher pay than anything I could do within the R&D prototyping industry --- Higher lifetime earnings.

However what's holding me back is the travel that is required. It's not that I wouldn't want to travel or do the work, but the strain that it could place on my family.

I'm reaching out today to see if there are any forensic engineer's here that could give me a glimpse into this career field and if it's worth it to make the switch?

You receive a job offer that is higher salary than your current position and are not willing to walk away from. However, you want to negotiate that offer to get a higher salary, but don’t have a competing offer or a counter offer from your current employer.

Would you say that you have a competing offer to have more leverage in negotiation, or try to negotiate with essentially no leverage? 

In the occasions that they ask for specifics on the competing offer, you could say that that information is confidential and you cannot share it. 

If they reject the counter offer and keep your original offer, you could say that despite the higher salary at the other company, you chose to take their offer for factors outside of salary (commute, company values, etc.) 

The only downside I could see is them rescinding your offer for trying to negotiate, but no reasonable company would do that. It could also happen even if you don’t state that you have a counter offer.

1l9294x,Doubts about the pharma industry and my long-term goal of becoming a Plant Manager – need insight,"Hi everyone,
I’m 25 and currently at a crossroads in my early career. I recently accepted a new offer in the pharmaceutical industry after working for just over two months in another pharma company. My background is in Industrial Engineering, and I’ve previously worked in the food & beverage and FMCG sectors.

Here’s where I’m at:

I’ve realized that purely office-based roles don’t fulfill me — I had a brief experience in supply chain and found it too detached from the real action. What I truly enjoy is being in the field, working directly on processes, driving improvements, and making things happen on the shop floor. That’s what energizes me.

The new role I’m about to start is in Production Excellence at a large pharmaceutical company (recently acquired a manufacturing site), and it focuses on Lean, Six Sigma, KPI analysis, and process optimization — things I genuinely enjoy and am good at. So far, so good.

BUT… I’m starting to wonder whether the pharma sector itself is the right long-term fit for me. It’s highly regulated, slow to change, and often has rigid structures. My fear is that, even if I like the role now, I might eventually feel limited by the industry’s nature.

My long-term goal is to become a Plant Manager in a multinational company — ideally in a fast-paced, results-driven environment where I can lead teams, manage operations, and create tangible impact.

So I’m turning to this community for advice:
	•	Has anyone here worked in pharma and then switched to other industries? Was it hard to make the jump later?
	•	Can you truly grow into a Plant Manager role within pharma, or is it more suitable to look toward FMCG, food, manufacturing, etc.?
	•	If I want to keep that Plant Manager path open, is pharma a strong launchpad — or more of a trap?
	•	How do I balance choosing the right role now with keeping doors open for the future?

Any honest insights from people in operations, CI, production, or leadership are really appreciated.
Thanks for reading — this is stressing me out more than it probably should, but I want to make the right move.",paneburroemarmellata,1,1.0,0,1749671269,2025-06-11 19:47:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l9294x/doubts_about_the_pharma_industry_and_my_longterm/,6,2025
1l91x93,"Do I accept my dream job even though it means completely starting over, or continue with the job I just started that I love?","Hi everyone—I’m looking for some honest advice.

I’m a hairstylist in my late 20s, and I spent the last 9 years at a commission-based salon. During that time, I transitioned into education—going back to school to become a licensed cosmetology educator, teaching at a beauty school, and working as a contracted educator for a hair brand.

About 7 months ago, I applied for an educator role with a major hair brand—something I’ve dreamed of since cosmetology school. I made it to the final round: I submitted a technical video, interviewed with the hiring manager and their supervisor, and was told I was one of the two final candidates. All that was left was HR and a potential offer. I followed up 4 weeks after my last interview and was told they were still making a final decision. I followed up again 5 weeks later, so after 9 weeks in total since my last interview —and me having to once again follow up— and was told the other candidate was selected. I was crushed. It shook my confidence and made me question everything about my career path.

Just before that rejection, I saw the same role had opened in a neighboring state (about 2 hours away). I replied to the rejection email, expressing interest in that territory—but never heard back. So, I moved on.

Fast forward about two months: I accepted a new job at a different beauty school. It came with better pay, more balance, and the flexibility to still see clients without getting burnt out. I also signed a 3-month lease to go independent. For the first time in a while, I felt grounded—stable, healing financially, and regaining clarity after a tough year.

Then—literally the day before my new job started—I got a call from the brand. 

They said they hadn’t forgotten me and wanted to fast-track me for the open role I’d previously asked about. Since then, I’ve had interviews with senior leadership, including the assistant VP of HR and have one upcoming with two department VPs. They’ve already discussed salary, relocation support, and benefits. And this time, I’ve made it even further than before. All signs seem to point to an offer coming.

Here’s the dilemma:

This job is truly dream job. It would nearly double my income and comes with a full benefits package—company car, 401k, health insurance, pension. On paper, it’s everything I’ve worked toward.

But emotionally, it’s not so simple. Relocating—even just two hours away—means leaving the only home I’ve ever known. My fiancé is fully supportive and open to moving, and we don’t have children, so there aren’t many logistical ties. We rent from family, so on paper, the move is doable. But the emotional ties run deep—and that’s not something I take lightly. I have a couple of family members who are older, including one who’s currently battling cancer and who I’m incredibly close to. Being nearby and present for them during this time is something I deeply value, and the thought of not being as accessible adds another layer of complexity to this decision.

Another factor is that I truly love doing hair, and this role would require me to step away from behind the chair due to the time commitment. It would also mean leaving the new beauty school position I just started. I really like the company and the team, and even though it’s new, I could genuinely see myself growing within the company and eventually moving up. Walking away from that potential—and from something that finally feels stable—is not an easy decision. I’m also not someone who job-hops—I spent nearly a decade at my last salon—so making another big change so quickly has me really questioning what the right move is.

So I’m at a crossroads:
Do I stay on the steady, stable path I just began—or take the leap and say yes to the opportunity I’ve dreamed of for nearly a decade, even if it means starting over again?

If you’ve ever had to choose between comfort and growth, I’d love to hear your story. Your perspective would mean so much. Thank you if you’ve gotten this far.

1l91w58,What Traits to Prioritize in Picking Your Future Career (And Why),"I was discussing how to pick a career today with my younger sibling as they are getting ready to choose a career. I ended up creating a list on what traits I believe should be prioritized for picking your future career. I figured I’d share and ask for feedback since I haven’t sent it to them yet.  
  
1.	Passion, SOMETHING YOU ENJOY  
This is the most important point. You will spend over half of your waking hours at your job. If you don’t enjoy it, you’ll feel drained and miserable, no matter the paycheck. Think about the actual day-to-day tasks. Could you see yourself doing that every day for years? When I chose engineering, it wasn’t just because it paid well (though that helped), it was something I wanted to do.   
  
2.	MARKET DEMAND & STABILITY  
Some jobs are in high demand now (e.g., trades, pilots, healthcare professionals), while others are currently flooded (like software engineering recently). More candidates = more competition = slower wage growth. Pick a field that’s not only interesting but has long-term demand. A great job in a shrinking field can be risky even if the short term outlook isn’t so bad.  
  
3.	Salary Bands 
Growth opportunities to make more earnings as cost of living is not getting any cheaper and that’s the best way to secure your future/ability to enjoy things like travel or spendy purchasing.  
  
4.	Work Life Balance  
You may hear about different jobs taking in hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it can sometimes be due to the fact that they work an absurd amount of hours or all hours of the day/weekend. You may want to look at the hours that these jobs typically work in a week and the days that those jobs are expected to be performed. 
  
5.	CAREER FLEXIBILITY   
Some fields allow you to do different jobs, and can offer stability as mentioned in Point 2. Sometimes a generic degree can lead to a lot of opportunities especially when the dynamic of the job market changes. I chose ME because I can do all sorts of jobs in many different fields, where as if you go into aviation as a pilot, you most likely won’t be changing careers or going into different sectors of work.  
  
6.	Work Environment  
Not only is it important to like your job, but determine if you want to be able to go out in the field (jobsites/manufacturing/outside work) or if you’d prefer a job that allows you to work in an office/or from home. A job can have both of these like mine, but it’s good to consider the physical demands/weather exposure/commute times as this will play into your flexibility of work life balance from Point 4.  
  
7.	Education-Training-Costs  
How many years of training/education do you need to get started and what does the cost basis look like? College is typically four years but you have to measure against what you’d earn and the potential salary bands once graduated. A lot of higher education jobs have a higher floor for earnings but also a higher debt amount.  
  
8.	Location Flexibility  
Where do you want to live? Some jobs are flexible, while others are tied to specific locations. Think ahead: will this job allow you to live somewhere you’ll be happy?  
  
9.	Traveling 
/ Whatever job you pick, it could include a lot of out of state travel. If you are okay with out of state travel think about how often it would be. 10% is typical for a lot of jobs, anything over 25% can be a bit strenuous if you have a family or pets.  
  
10.	Content & Quality  
Is the work going to be something that will keep you interested and won’t be repetitive? Do you want to make an impact on the world, or focus on building your wealth?  
  
Honorable Mention: When considering a career, you can always consider an internship (3-12 months) or a job shadow (1 hour to potentially a week) opportunity to help you determine if you are interested in that field of work as it gives you a lot of insight to the day-to-day tasks and the environment you could potentially work in.

1l91oq2,Does anyone feel the Trades have been ruin by hustle culture and overtime?,"I know a lot of jobs can fall under this umbrella but the trades might be on top right now. I live in a right to work state with trade pay being fairly low. It was a sold job to be an experienced plumber, or electrician, but I feel those days are numbered. So many of them require overtime. A lot of overtime. Not only that, it’s butt rushing it all the way there. As if these jobs aren’t hard enough, let’s do 80 hours! If you’re a young man without a family, you can do ok. But for us average mortals, trades are being slowly ruined. By the time you get enough experience, your half beat down eating gas station food everyday, ready to call it quits.

1l91idz,Choosing my career,"Hey yall, im a college graduate with a BS in marketing. Its been a year since i graduated and still lack a job. I still lack a job and on top of that, I am not confident on the kind of career I want to pursue in my life. Fresh out of college I was searching for marketing related jobs for entry level people, but nearly 90% of the time it was always scammy companies that would just be a waste of my time. It was like that for a while, then gave up and started looking for sales related jobs. Couldnt find anything there either, and now im back here giving marketing related jobs another go since il be moving to a different state hoping luck may be better there. One of the things I do know however is that i liked this one marketing research course i took during college. I wasnt good at it but still passed. it was my favorite course but i dont know if its because of the professor or the content. maybe both. i even had a thought that ok il go get a masters in it! that kinda fell thru due to stuff, but maybe I can go for it again. even so, just thinking about a commitment like that makes me think of other things like: Do i really like market research? is this something i can REALLY make a career out of? can i still be good at this even if im not good at it at all?. I have alot of self doubt about searching for a career path that i think would be good for me. I wouldnt be able to name something that i consider myself to be skilled in besides being good at talking to people, if someone asked me. I would greatly appreciate any advice, guidance, or recommendations. Thank you greatly.

1l91e3g,Are there any good certifications or career paths in economics along with bcom(honours),"Hi everyone,

I’m a 2025 Class 12 pass-out and have just taken admission in B.Com (Hons).

I’m reaching out because I’m really passionate about economics and data modeling, but I feel lost about what certifications or career paths to follow from here. My parents are pushing me toward CA, but to be honest, I’m not very interested in accounting. I genuinely enjoyed economics in classes 11 and 12 and want to build a career around that, ideally combining it with data, graphs and modelling.

Unfortunately:

I couldn’t do B.Sc. Economics (Hons) or apply to top eco colleges because I scored less than 75 in Applied Maths.

That also means I’m not eligible for Actuarial Science (which was my dream earlier).


So now I’m trying to figure out the best alternate path. My goals:

Something economics-heavy or at least economics + data-focused

Certifications I can do alongside B.Com (Hons)

Good placements and long-term ROI

Budget around ₹2–3 lakhs approx.

I’ve been researching some options and would love feedback on any of these or others:

CFA: Is it truly economics-heavy or more finance-focused? Can it lead to roles in economic research/financial analysis?

FRM / CMA / Business Analytics Certifications

ISB Certificate in Business Analytics

IIM Data Analytics Programs

HarvardX / LSE Online / Google Data Analytics Cert (Coursera)

Are the courses above mentioned worth it?

I’m also open to things like:
Short-term diplomas in public policy, econometrics, or development economics


Are there any certifications or course paths that let me stay rooted in economics, while also building data/tech or finance skills for high-paying roles?

Any guidance would really help. Thank you so much in advance!

1l90cyl,Which path is more beneficial: studying full-time or continuing to work while studying part-time?,"I got accepted into a one-year (September - April) Accounting Technician Certificate program at a local college. There are 10 classes in total plus 2 electives which means ideally, I would take 5 classes per semester. I currently work a full time 9-5 job as an Accounts Payable Clerk which is in line with the course. I decided to go back to school as I have been wanting to leave my current workplace and gain more experience but the lack of educational background in this field could be hindering me in getting hired. I have applied to numerous jobs in the past year and have only gotten 2 job interviews.

I initially wanted to quit by August and study full time, however I've realized that money is tight and going without a job for 8 months - or more, depending on if I get a job right out of school - could be risky. I would have to rely on student loans, which I am already 40k in debt from previous studies. So I thought about studying part time instead and keeping my job. I have talked to my supervisor and there is a possibility of getting a bit of a raise as I will be going to school and expanding my knowledge.

The downside is it worries me that it could take at least 2 or more years for me to finish a certificate, not even a diploma. I am currently in a two-year relationship, and we've been in talks of getting engaged/married within the year or sometime next year. If this pushes through, I am afraid I will go through a burn out with work, school and marriage/family planning. My boyfriend has been supportive of me going back to school; however, it worries him that I will not have income for a while, which affects my decision-making. It looks like he is changing his mind of getting engaged/married in the near future.

1l8zzlg,Should I move to a big city to pursue my Law school plans,"Hi all. This is going to be lengthy and I do apologize. I (22F) am a recent May graduate from a big city school. I'm having a very tough time deciding if I should stay in this big city or move back home. My hometown is not that far from this city-it's approximately six hours. But it's still far enough drive that I can't visit on a whim if I have a job and would have to schedule time to be able to make the trip.

For some context, I'm struggling with this decision for various reasons. Firstly, my career goal is to become a lawyer. I did not graduate with a pre-law degree, only a minor in law. Because I'm NOT going straight from undergrad to law school, I've heard through numerous different people that you would need experience alongside a good test score. My plan is study for my LSAT test (the test that gets you into law school) as well as gain experience by working at Law Firms (in any position I can obtain). This is where my two options become tricky. I will try to break them down as best as I can below.


If I were to stay in my hometown,, I would be able to devote my time to studying for the LSAT test. Of course, I would also be able to save money. I would get a random job and save as much as I can since l won't be paying bills. This is the biggest pro, and why all my family wants me to stay.  I also have a longtime boyfriend here and we’ve been doing long distance for 3 years. Thinking of being apart again kills me, but I know it’s possible. He supports me in any decision. f this next part crossed your mind as it did mine— no, my boyfriend will not move with me. At this moment in time, my boyfriend is in a position at his job that he does not want to leave to another city...so that is unfortunately out of the question.
Now, the major setback with staying here, is that there are virtually no opportunities. It's a very small city, and even while aimlessly browsing and looking for entry level jobs, there is close to nothing. 

Now, if I stayed in the city,  there are countless opportunities to work at a law firm. I have several that I could apply to tomorrow if I really wanted to. The major setbacks though would be that constantly working to pay bills wouldn’t leave me with as much time to devote my energy into studying for the LSAT. Though it would still happen, it would definitely take longer. (I would like to add that this journey to law school is not one that I put a timeline on, but I do have pressure from my family to start as soon as possible. )I also have an apartment lined up that would start its lease in August. I would room with a friend from college at a good apartment in a great location. I don’t have much time to sign, as it will go to another person very soon. Additionally, I do not have a job lined up, but I will be in the area a month before and can search then. I do have some money saved but not much for very long. I am truly so stuck. 

On one hand, I can devote my time to getting a really good test score while also saving money. On the other hand, I need experience. And that can easily be found in this big city. There is also countless other opportunities related to the legal field that I can access while in this big city as well. But I couldn’t devote all my time to this LSAT test, at least not for the first copies of months of getting my footing. 

Please please please let me know your thoughts. I would appreciate constructive comments, please do not tell me I should have started this law journey sooner—I am very well aware 😕 but please, any advice, help, comments, concerns, is so greatly appreciated. please help a girl out!

1l8zjek,Promotion I’ve been working for all year wasn’t approved this year.,"I worked out with my senior manager a slow transition from my current position as a technician into a project/engineering role last year. The idea was that I would slowly take on work in projects until next year when performance review time came around again when the company allows new headcount.

It’s been over a year now and I’ve been doing the work in projects for maybe 10 months now and we just had our performance reviews. My supervisor done the review and everything is great. I’m doing this extra work in projects most of the time but still doing things in my technician role. I’m given difficult tasks that the other technicians struggle with, delegating tasks to the other technicians even though I am still the same level as them. I’m still the only one they trust to keep things running smoothly when my supervisor isn’t around. But he told me he has heard nothing from our senior manager about my promotion, but he said he doesn’t think any new headcount was approved this year. 

I don’t mind the workload or doing more of this additional work but I’m feeling stagnant here and frustrated that all this talk of opportunities to move up are not here after working towards them for the past year. Since I heard this, I met with a career counsellor and they helped with my resume and I’ve been apply other jobs and networking a bit. 

Since I’m frustrated I want to tell them I’m done with all the extra work and that I won’t be doing anything more than the other technicians. But at the same time I want to keep going with project work to get the experience to help apply other places. But at the same time, if it takes me 10 more months to land a better job, maybe I’d get that promotion by then.

I took a week-long vacation not too long ago, hoping it would help, but I quickly noticed my job performance continuing to decline after returning.

The day before yesterday, I opened up to my boss about the emotional challenges I’ve been facing. I touched on my family dynamics—though not in great detail—and expressed a desire to work through it and improve my focus at work. The conversation felt productive, and I did feel supported in that moment.

However, when I was confronted yesterday about my incomplete task, I nearly had a breakdown. I beat myself up badly afterward and was on the verge of tears. It took everything in me not to cry in front of my coworkers.

Today, I took a mental health day to regroup, and I’ve requested three days off next week, which my manager approved.

I’m trying to manage this in the most responsible and professional way I can. Am I handling this appropriately? Is there a better way to navigate situations like this in a professional environment?",No_Satisfaction_5844,2,1.0,2,1749664395,2025-06-11 17:53:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8zbnj/struggling_at_work_while_managing_personal_trauma/,6,2025

1l8yxdg,"Lost in my career, don’t know exactly what next step to take?","I’m 27 years old with no absolute direction in my career. I started my first job at consulting company with so many hopes. I initially worked as data engineer in a good data migration project and I learned a lot in azure from that project but then in middle of project, my manager removed me from that project and put me in a support project. It is deadass job where I have to fix errors when users face issues in cloud pipelines and record the timings when the pipelines completed or failed with errors. More like a data entry job on Daily basis. I didn’t like it since I love the development project. I told the same to my manager that I can’t work here in this support project. He said that there are currently  no DE roles in other projects and I have to wait and he will give me good role next time. Time passed and I waited 1.5 years but nothing changed. I raised few complaints regarding this and my manager pissed off and released me from that client. Then I was on bench, waiting for new clients, then I felt like I may not be interested in technical things, (because I got so irritated fixing support errors) and I enjoyed business communication, so I felt like may be I will do career change to Product roles like Product analyst. Then after 2 months, I got product role in another client company. But my bad luck still  followed me here. I was promised a product role but they assigned me to Powerbi development. That too not Powerbi desktop, but Powerbi report builder. Right now I’m developing reports but no business interaction, I just develop and my lead gives them to business users. Now, at this point, I don’t know what I’m interested in anymore, I don’t know what I’m good at. Thanks for reading till here. If you can suggest me roles, I would appreciate it it. I’m good at technically dealing with data, sql and cloud. I also like interacting with business users and looking for good paying jobs(as Im currently stuck with $80k salary even with 5 years of IT experience).

1l8yszn,"Title: 17M – What tech degree should I pursue? Want scope, career value, and the right roadmap (interested in AI/ML, but unsure about JEE)","

Hi everyone,

I’m a 17-year-old guy currently in Class 12, and I really need some clear career guidance.

Here’s the thing: I’m into technology — I genuinely like exploring new tech, tools, apps, AI, and I usually adapt quickly to anything new. I’ve got an interest in becoming something like an AI engineer or tech creator in the future. But I’m also being honest with myself:

I’m a bit lazy and easily distracted right now, even in holidays

I’m not sure I can go through the intense grind of JEE Mains or core BTech CSE syllabus

I want a career that gives me good salary scope, is future-proof, and still lets me enjoy life a bit — not something that feels like jail


I don’t want to waste my years doing something just for the sake of it. I want to follow a clear roadmap and put in the work if I know the outcome is worth it. But right now, I’m not sure what tech degree is the best mix of:

Future scope (AI/ML/data/tech career)

Not overwhelming with unnecessary pressure

Good opportunities (internships, jobs, freelancing)

Allows me to actually learn and upskill, not just mug up outdated stuff


I keep hearing mixed things about BTech CSE, AI/ML, BCA, and even newer alternatives like BSc in Data Science. But I need help choosing the right career path and degree — something that aligns with where the world is going in tech, and also with how I work.

If anyone’s been in this position, or knows people who’ve gone through it — please tell me:

What degree path should I pick to become job-ready in AI/tech?

Is BTech AI/ML a smart choice or just a trendy trap?

Are there smarter degrees or hybrid routes that balance learning + placement?

How do I stay motivated when I don’t have full clarity yet?


I’m open to advice, experiences, harsh truths — anything that can help me choose the right road ahead.

1l8yilv,Can I get some advice on changing my mindset as it pertains to my job hunt and getting back to work?,"Quick background - I had an accident resulting in major injury and subsequent surgery that kept me out of the workforce medically for a couple of years. I'm back to enough health to be working but have searched for over a year with no luck. But prior to the accident I'd suffered a major episode of burnout. Work anxiety was killing me to the point of considering self-harm.

Now that I'm on the hunt, my attitude is poor. Every job description I read makes me me think ""I don't want to do that,"" and my anxiety starts to kick in when I think of the commute, sitting in an open office being micromanaged, and dedicating 50-60 hours of my life just to come home to sleep alone and do it again. I haven't worked in a healthy, low-stress environment in over a decade so all I can think about is how horrible it's going to be.

This is starting to show in my effort levels applying, alongside the bad market, lack of responses, and a difficult to explain gap. I'm not as aggressive as I need to be. As much as I try to mask it, when I do interview, I wonder if the people on the other side can see I truly don't want the job, just need a paycheck. The internet doesn't help - the algorithms are fast to push me anti-work content that just makes me angry at the system, or anxious about going back to that hell.

Our CBA says that you can be assigned additional duties that are ADMINISTRATIVE OR CLERICAL IN NATURE, which I don’t think any of this falls under. I’ve done all of this with no pushback because I’m new and didn’t want to cause a fuss but I am at my wits end.

1l8xskw,I feel lost in my career of 10 years. Is it time for a change?,"Hi! I(27F) am needing advice/encouragement. I am a hairstylist and this year is my 10th year of being in the beauty industry. I spent 5 years at my first salon where I did my apprenticeship, 2 years at a different salon where I really built my own clientele, and this year will make 3 years since I’ve been an independent suite stylist. It’s been a really great but hard career for me mentally & physically and I am finally ready to move on. 

Since 2021, I’ve hit burn out at least twice a year to the point where I want to leave the industry but I always end up not doing anything about it(one, I’m scared and two, I don’t wanna up all leave my clients without a hairstylist). I am finally ready to cut back on taking on new clients and slowly transition out of hairstyling to pursue something that’s more stable(income wise) and isn’t solely client based. 

The problem is, I am not sure where to go from here. 😅 I didn’t go to college and would like to go into something where I can use the skills I’ve acquired within these past 10 years. I was thinking of either marketing or data entry. I would appreciate any feedback/advice.

Now, my PhD director has offered me a residence abroad with a top researcher in my field, but that would imply renouncing temporarily to my current job. My boss has told that they'd have no problem in hiring me back when I finish, but that would block my chances to promote for a while.

In my current job I earn almost three times what I earn only doing the PhD, and if I promote it could be more than four times, but my tutor could take as an offence renouncing to that residence, and certainly my PhD wouldn't be as good as it could be.

1l8xfnp,What first job offer should I take?,"To start things off, I just mastered out of PhD engineering program. I’ve been fortunate enough to receive a few offers and am having a really hard time trying to decide between them. Basically, I have one offer at an FFRDC, one at a non-profit research facility, and one at a startup — all in the defense industry. The factors that make that make the choice really hard are mainly centered around my personal life and potential career growth. In the future, I’d like to transition to a more traditional software engineering or even finance role. Benefits such as 401k match are similar across the board, but my estimated savings vary (at least for the first year).

• FFRDC: This job is more middle of the road in technicality. It involves a fair amount of software skills and modeling and has good flexibility with a hybrid schedule. The job is on the west coast and I’d likely live alone the first year, which would bring my monthly savings down compared to the other offers. If I got a roommate, the monthly savings would be essentially the same as at the non-profit. The content of the job is still defense, but more space focused than pure weapons like the other options. I am somewhat concerned about the fact that it is federally funded, but there seems to be no problems as of today. The location means I would be entering into a LDR with my partner, but the 9/80 and hybrid schedule makes it more feasible than at the startup.

• Non-Profit: This role is for a systems engineer doing lots of trade off analyses for advanced defense flight systems. I worry that it’s less technical than the rest, which I’m not sure would help my long-term goal of exiting defense. However, I have confirmed the manager is exceptional and has a reputation for getting people onto the projects they want to be on. There are several personal perks, the job is insanely flexible. I could work remotely as much as I want and it has flexible hours. It is also in my current city, which means I could save more by keeping my current living situation and is located literally down the street from me. My partner also lives here, which means I would not have to enter into a LDR while they finish their graduate program. The cost of living here is very high though, so renting my own apartment here would leave me less savings than I’m comfortable with. However, my partner and I would likely move in together in the next year or two. There is a chance this could be a rent-free situation, which would be the best option financially. Although, this isn’t guaranteed, so I don’t want to bank on it. However, I find myself wondering why I would take a less technical job with the goal of trying to get more technical while I have offers that already give me that opportunity. I also find myself thinking that I don’t want to live in this city long-term despite having a good thing going. The winters are long and the city feels transient. Most of my friends will leave in a few years. I’m aware I could move in a few years as well with my partner, but the thought of starting over in a new city at 27/28 is much less appealing than doing so now at 24.

• Startup: The startup offered me ~20% more than the other two and includes stock options, but I have concerns around the work-life balance and future of the company. The place seems rather chaotic despite growing very quickly and having raised a lot of money in a recent Series B funding round. However, this role is the most technical and I would certainly learn a lot. Similar to the FFRDC, it is on the west coast, where a lot of defense/aero companies are located. Despite being in the same city as the FFRDC, this one has a slightly higher cost of living. The employees I spoke to were optimistic about the company’s future, but I worry the chaos would negatively impact my personal life. There was also a safety breach incident a year ago and I have heard from others anecdotally that it is kind of a shit show, or at least it was a year ago. On this salary, I could afford a my own apartment while saving the same amount that I would at the other in my current city.

I feel a bit weird because I never post, but I wanted to ask anyone who’s maybe made a transition out of defense their thoughts. I don’t want to make a decision I’ll regret just because I’m comfortable where I am. Balancing the work, finances, my personal life, and long-term goals is proving very difficult.",Affectionate_Web_686,1,1.0,0,1749660009,2025-06-11 16:40:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8xfnp/what_first_job_offer_should_i_take/,6,2025
1l8xdvd,Probation period,"I’m looking for some guidance regarding a recent development at work.

For context, I’ve been with my current employer for just over three years. In April, I was informed that my role was at risk of redundancy due to the closure of the site I was based at. Shortly after, I was offered an alternative position at a different location. This new role came with a step down in responsibilities and a reduction in salary. Given I was only given 12 days to secure another job, I accepted the offer as a temporary solution while I searched for something more suitable.

Now, I’ve been waiting over a month to receive an addendum to my existing contract. However, I’ve instead been asked to sign a completely new contract reflecting the change in role, location, and salary. What’s particularly concerning is the inclusion of a 24-week probation period.

To me, this seems unnecessarily long and potentially strategic — possibly a way to make it easier to terminate my employment later without the risk of an unfair dismissal claim or the obligation to offer redundancy. It feels like a workaround that HR might be using, and I wanted to ask if this is something others have experienced or if it’s a common practice in these situations.

Am I being overly cautious, or does this raise valid concerns?

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.",Ok-Taro-4648,1,1.0,0,1749659890,2025-06-11 16:38:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8xdvd/probation_period/,6,2025
1l8xav2,Not sure what to do,"Hello everyone,

I'm in the back of house hospitality environment
I've been with my company for years and been promoted to interim manager then a manager officially. However since l've joined my ops manager has always sat me down every few months saying ""some people made some feedback about you"" and they are always about the way I talk (because i am straightforward) and how I am personality wise which I was affected but soon forgot about it because i was just a normal employee.

After i became kitchen assistant manager, people in the team who tried their way to sweet talk me into giving them what I want and letting them slack away knows i'm not on their team and I still choose to do my job properly and as an assistant manager, keep the kitchen and production in control. They turn against me and start finding 1-2 people around them and convince them to go report me to my ops manager to say because of my ""attitude"" they can't work properly and the attitude was pretty much how I am telling them to hurry up, do their job properly and tell them about their mistakes which is part of the job.

Then months later I got promoted because I bring in alot of business, work extra hours and never have a proper off day because they constantly bother me on my off days/ after working hours. Also because 5-7 kitchen managers quit in a year and eventually they say ive proven myself enough to go up the ranks + ive known how to run the back end all by myself and they think its more ideal to promote internally than keep hiring and have people leaving consistently

Which the managers that they kept hiring to replace, is leaving consistently because management is hard to deal with and constantly finding fault on a daily basis

Now that I have taken the manager role, it has come about to the same cycle again but this time my ops manager (on top of me on the food chain) goes to have private meetings asking for feedback about me when i'm on holidays and bombard me with a 1 hour list of things of what ""ur team has said about you"" the moment i get back from holiday

Which concludes to how she thinks i'm trying to lead a dictatorship or communist style because ""multiple people say they fear you"" which i dont think its anywhere true because they make fun and talk shit about me in my face daily + don't listen to a single shit i say sometimes

While in my pov, i go lunch with them and joke/laughs with them but i have to do my job and make sure this big business is running smoothly and mistakes are rectified because of quality/wastage issues.

I'm always open to them talking to me about anything in general about life or at work but it they don't want to, what can i do? My ops is making it all about being my fault because they don't want to two way communicate with me.

• she goes on about how i drag the team down because i'm not always happy everyday and it affects the team when i have my own working space by myself at the back of the kitchen, a door away from the rest of the group focusing on my manager jobs and helping the production (just that i have my own table)

But finishes off the conversation saying i am an asset to the company and she loves the way i work because i get shit done and brings in business with my product development and i get things running and going efficiently

When i'm too nice to my team they cross the line, demands stuff and message me about what they dont want to do.

But when i draw the line they start complaining because i am setting boundary of taking care of myself and prioritizing my mental and physical wellbeing by being their ""manager"" and not taking any calls/messages after working hour, all of a sudden they are walking on eggshells.

I feel like my ops manager just kept going behind my back asking for unwanted opinion when i'm just doing my job.

1l8x0l4,What do I need to consider working for a friend,"I've been at my company (higher Ed at an R1 university) for almost 7 years progressing from level 1 to Sr. Level. In that time I have grown very close with a coworker whom now I consider a friend (when I go to that state to visit I stay in her guest room and we hang out outside of work - parties, happy hour, gym, etc). She had been promoted a little over a year ago and is now a Director. She wants me to move over to her team (we had this vision of creating this team like 5 years ago, but it is just now coming together) and they have sort of created a position for me (I was told by my friend that I'm the first choice and only 1 other person is even qualified). This is how she got her job as well, they created the position for her. It is an internal position not open to outside hires because of reasons out of our control with university administration (we can't get new reqs approved right now bc the president was fired) therefore I have no job description and no salary info to go on. I have a vague idea of what my friend wants the job to look like/entail but she doesn't have final say, there are 2 people above her.

Those are all things that I need clarification on of course but my real dilemma is what should I consider when my friend will potentially be my boss? 

Some concerns for me (that may not be real concerns for others) are: she is super judgemental of people in general but often based on petty things like appearance (making snide remarks about people's clothing choices-not based on a dress code, but on her personal opinion of what is 'presentable' - she thinks women should be thin, wear dresses and have long hair and makeup, but we all wfh and I am literally the exact opposite); she works extra and takes on more than she should (she knows this and everyone has told her before to stop) I can't help but wonder if she is going to expect me to work extra and take on way more than the job requires and/or work late, etc; she holds grudges and loves to gossip - two things that are just not me. I get along with everyone and I am genuinely kind by nature. She got mad at me and didn't talk to me for a month bc she thought I insinuated she was a bad driver which I did not do and don't think at all so she has her own insecurities. I just wonder if she will be able to be objective as my supervisor bc we are already friends.

Are there pitfalls here I'm not considering? Does anyone have any advice on how to professionally navigate the things that I've mentioned? I feel like for most people these things wouldn't seem like a big deal but I have trouble with people pleasing and boundaries. I don't want to take this job and regret it and be stuck miserable.

I meet with the big boss to discuss the position next week and I'm not even sure what to ask him outside of job description and salary. 

I'm sure I'm totally over thinking this, but that's what I do.

Any advice is appreciated! TIA.",French_Toast_Runner,1,1.0,1,1749658993,2025-06-11 16:23:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8x0l4/what_do_i_need_to_consider_working_for_a_friend/,6,2025
1l8wxiu,I’m an early career journalist and just got a temporary dream job offer + my FT role (~60 hour weeks all remote). Need advice!,"I’m (25F) a journalist early in my career, and I’m at a major crossroads with a job offer that could shape my life as I know it right now. 

I just received a fixed-term offer at a legacy media company — one of those publications people dream of having on their resume. The job runs through December 31 and can be structured at 20, 30 or 40 hours/week — up to me. The pay is higher than my current FT job at any of those levels. And they’ve made it clear they want me.

Right now, I’m leaning toward taking the 20-hour option and staying in my current FT job, meaning I’d be working 60 hours/week for about 4 months by the time I start. I’ve done this kind of workload before and I saw my parents do this to make ends meet — it’s hard, but it’s doable and it would only be temporary. The new team I’d potentially work on said they want to find a spot for me long-term but if not, my plan is to just go back to locking into my current role now if I can’t go full time after Dec. 31 with the new company!

What I’m weighing:
	•	I recently attended a conference recently that reignited my love for my current job — I don’t want to give it up just as I’m finding my stride again. I originally applied to jobs months ago wanting to be done with my current newsroom due to burnout. But now, I have all these ideas I’m excited about doing with my team. I was hoping this other job wouldn’t come through even though I had a feeling from how well the interviews continued to go. 
	•	This legacy company could open doors to full-time roles later, and getting in here and now could be life-changing!
	•	The extra income would help me pay down student loans, build savings and create necessary financial cushion.
	•	As a woman of color in media, I don’t have the luxury of slow-playing my career. I need to be aggressive and intentional in building my path. I don’t have generational wealth or anything like that — I will always have to work hard for everything I have. 

My long-term bf expressed concerns about my mental health taking a hit working 60 hour weeks. He was excited and proud of me at first until I started outlining the offer details. Not saying he’s not excited and proud still, and he has not explicitly said this either — but I know he has fears that our relationship will be put on the back burner. I also know he hasn’t been job hunting seriously despite being unhappy in his own underpaid media job for the past 3 years — so I do wonder if there’s some projection happening. 

Another one of my besties thinks it’s just taking time away from the things I care about but I know work-life balance is my responsibility and I would work hard to ensure that it exists. But most of my besties are excited and think I should go for the 60 hour work week until December option, the one that I’m leaning towards. 

My bf suggested I pitch the ideas I have for my current publication to other outlets on a freelance basis instead of taking the second job, but that can be also unstable and draining — and the publication I’m at is a leader in my specific coverage area. For the new role, it would be a new beat but they’re a leader in their respective coverage area too. Bf’s right that 60 hours a week is tiring, but so is spending months sending cold pitches that might go nowhere.

I’ve worked multiple jobs before and burnt out super quick so my bf is speaking from experience and seeing the toll it took on me in real time. I think because it’s not for making ends meet and for professional development, maybe I’d approach it differently and establish work-life balance as soon as I get my schedule to implement it. 

But more importantly, I’ve got until Friday to let the new company know. I’m in deep processing and pros/cons mode to get real myself about whether or not I should do this just because I can. Even if it means it’s hard to balance at first.

I’m torn weighing the options, but it’s only temporary that I would even have two jobs anyway so I’m learning toward yes! Just don’t know if I’m missing anything or if I should think deeper about some things vs. others in this decision.

Have any of you ever worked multiple jobs to get ahead — was it worth it? Advice is appreciated here. 

TL;DR:

I’m a young journalist with a new offer from a legacy media company for a contract role through Dec. 31 — higher pay and flexible hours. I’m leaning toward doing 20 hours/week there and keeping my current FT job (totaling 60 hours/week) since I recently regained momentum in my current role and this new job could open major career doors. My boyfriend’s worried I’ll burn out and our relationship will suffer, but I feel like I can manage the balance and don’t want to pass up the chance — especially as a woman of color in media trying/needing to build long-term stability. I’m torn weighing the options, but it’s only temporary that I would even have two jobs anyway so I’m learning toward yes! Just don’t know if I’m missing anything or if I should think deeper about some things vs. others. Advice is appreciated here.

1l8wwzs,Ex employer asking for early release fee even after he provided no dues certificate,"Hello, so I worked at a company for around 2.5 years which I recently left for a better opportunity. (location - Bangalore, India)

I left 17 days prior to my original notice period. Earlier it was discussed that there is no project impact and I’ll not have to pay anything, but later on, they said that they will not give me the salary for 13 days. I would plus I’ll have to pay some amount to them (13 days salary - 17 days salary) which is over 10000rs for me.

I know this is a common phenomena that happens, but I didn’t knew this, and I discussed this with my manager .

They were discussions going on and then one day I got my experience letter and a letter saying that there are no dues left from my end.

Note - This was from darwinbox but had a pdf attached for experience letter and no dues which had company logo, director’s sign and everything !!

It’s been one month since that, and now they’re calling me back to pay the whole amount. 
Literally called me 16 to 17 times today and threatening me for legal actions. 

Am I legally in danger if I don’t pay? 
Because I have the certificate, which companies should give ideally once the employee doesn’t have any due left.

I’m not being financially, well right now. That’s why I don’t want to pay plus I already have nondues and experience letter in my hand.

1l8vbdd,Good career change to make coming from customer service?,"I'm feeling really lost with what to do at the moment. I've been working for a UK bank in their customer service team for the last 3 years. Previously I was in a mixed role with email, chat and social media, however they decided to outsource the digital customer service abroad and move all of us over to the phones.

Since they made that decision a few months ago I have applied for a lot of different internal roles with them, but I've only received one response, 4 weeks after I'd applied, to say due to high volumes of applications they wouldn't be taking my application further.

I wasn't expecting the recruitment team to ghost my applications, since I'm an internal applicant and honestly I'm a bit shocked they wouldn't at least send a decline message for each application. 

I naively thought applying to internal job opportunities would give me a better chance since it's a small pool of applicants.

I want to break out of customer service as I've been finding it increasingly draining, especially now I'm on the phone. 

Does anyone have any recommendations of good potential careers where a background in customer service is a good starting point?

con- the salary is $45k :/ 
pro- live at home and save money (also a con in a way though lol as i wouldnt be able to afford rent on my own in this area ever on that salary) 
pro- wouldnt have to work my second job, but $45k in this area isnt that much 
con- the person who would be my boss is already showing to be very flakey/inconsiderate 

my current job is an administrative role that is very dead end, i make $34k + some extra from my part time job i work on the weekends
pros- very lenient and chill job
pro- my commute is 5 min
pro- very affordable area, my rent is $600 (roommates)
con- dead end job, not in my field, etc etc
however im constantly applying to new jobs at the university i work at and have an interview coming up for one more in my field,

1l8ujfi,Should I Quit my First degree related job?,"Some context: I’m 22M living in Panama, I’m one year away from graduating from systems engineering and I have also worked since I was 18 in customer service and real estate acquisitions remotely.

Back in January I landed my first software development internship in a local company and after 3 months they offered me a full time position that started April 28th. Which is good as I initially only expected to do a 3 months internship to gain some real experience, 

So I’ve been working as a software developer for a month and a half but I’m already thinking about resigning from the company, the reason why is because the pay is so low that I’m not even making profit, I had $2k in savings when I started the internship and I spent it all in those 3 months as they were only paying me $100 per month, now as a full time I’m getting $660 pero month after taxes which has been spent pretty much in its majority, I don’t have any debt and live with my mom and two brothers but I still pay for my own food, internet, gym, etc.

I didn’t expect the money to be an issue because on my previous jobs I was making around $1k per month and I thought a $400 difference wouldn’t matter that much but it does and considering the fact that this time the work is hybrid so I have to commute to the office 3 times a week makes my expenses way higher as well.

Would it be dumb if I started looking for other sales/customer service remote roles that will let me get savings and also give me a good quality of life until I graduate next year and then try to apply for software development jobs again hoping to have a higher salary considering I’ll have a degree and some experience already?",therazant,1,1.0,1,1749653118,2025-06-11 14:45:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8ujfi/should_i_quit_my_first_degree_related_job/,6,2025
1l8uilc,should I quit my job?,"I was very lucky to land a job in big oil straight out of college. I toured the facility and was excited to work in the R&D department for a big company. I hope to go into pharma, specifically R&D, but figured this would be a stepping stone for me to make connections and look great on my resume. I was told I’d be doing a lot of “troubleshooting” and that I might have to mess around with equipment sometimes. No worries, I can handle a screwdriver and wrench as needed. As needed, I emphasize. During my tour, I was shown a lot of chromatography stuff which is vital to pharma, and some other things that I reasoned would be great transferable skills. I actually turned down 2 other offers for this one solely because I thought the transferable skills would be stronger from here The job description said it would be a lot of titrations and basic lab work but the first thing they said in the interview was to ignore the description that I applied for because it was outdated. I was told i’d be moving around a lot and would be trained in many different areas but wasn’t told any real specifics of the position until I came for the tour, and like I said, the tour made it seem like I’d be doing analytical work which is exactly what I wanted.

Well. On my first day, I got another tour. This time it was a different wing and everything is huge units. This is my department. Using a wrench is a part of my day to day life. I adjust pressure valves and gaskets and use enormous metal machinery that’s taller than the ceilings of my house. Everything. Is inorganic. I majored in biochemistry, I’m about to start my masters in Organic chemistry. I have no interest in catalysis or metalloids. I have not seen the original wing of the lab since my tour and I will likely never see it again.

I’m not happy. I am not an engineer and I do not see myself getting any transferable skills that I can use when I try to break into pharma. It’s only been 2 weeks but I’m bored out of my mind because they apparently have not hired a PI for me so I’ve been doing nothing. Presumably life will get better when I have a PI but i’m not sure how much. I’m just disappointed and I’m not sure how I could have seen this coming since I was shown something totally different. I’m going to talk to my supervisor about switching into that department but in all honesty I think I might just quit totally. It’s only been 3 weeks but I know for certain that oil and gas is not the industry for me and I do not see myself staying after my 1 year contract.

1l8rv1p,"My contract lead accidentally texted me a message about me. He tried to delete it, but Microsoft also emails the notification. How should I proceed?","I am a PM and I work in an industry with many different contract companies and coworkers with different employers. I have been at this role for 10 months and I like what I am doing. It’s somewhat stressful, but it keeps me busy- especially since I’m a PM. The work I am supporting is massive and they say it takes 12-18 months to get acquainted with all the processes and everything.

I have an upcoming business trip to a site I’ve never been to before. To go on trips it’s required that we submit travel requests that have to be signed off by several people. The first signature on the list is my contract lead. Since I’m a PM this is not the only thing I am responsible for or tracking. I have several items on my plate, and coordinating this trip is just 1 of them. I had to create slides for my trip and I asked my section SME for the location and he said not to worry about it. He did not do this to be an AH or hold info from me; I believe he thought it was not pertinent or necessary because he’s been with the program for many years. 

Needless to say, I thought my travel location was to one location, but it’s actually at an airport 30 minutes away. The location is important because it changes things, such as how much money I am allotted for my hotel and meals. In the last week I had to resubmit 1x cause airline fee went up $150; 1x cause I had the wrong hotel and meals rate listed; and then this last time because I did not list the correct new location to account for the hotel and meals rate. 

We use Microsoft TEAMS, which sends you an email when someone messages you. He accidentally sent me a message meant for another person and I am unaware who it was meant for: “How is your boy organizing a trip but he continues to F up his cost estimate.  He's like a 5 year old. ...”.  I am assuming there was more to the message, but the email notification just shows a snippet of the message. Should I confront him or just act like I didn’t see it and move on?

TL;DR - My contract lead isn’t my “boss” but I still need to use him for certain things. He accidentally sent me a message meant for someone else, but it was about me. How should I proceed?

1l8r1qz,At a Crossroads and Would Love Outside Perspective,"Where to begin. Perhaps at the end? 46M. Just under 20 years working in film in post production. Started as a visual effects (VFX) compositor/motion graphics designer and worked my way up to VFX supervision and some Creative Direction. I have experience managing teams of artists. I can bid and create budgets, manage said budgets and work under tight deadlines. I can manage outsource vendors as well as in house teams. I’ve been client facing for the last 6 years. Working directly with the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Nicole Kidman and Taylor Swift, I’ve presented ideas to some of the biggest artists in the world. I’ve worked on award winning movies, TV shows, commercials and music videos. 


While still NDA’d, I recently was one of the creative leads in a design process that helped bridge the gap between a big artist and a certain geometrical shaped venue in Vegas. 


While I’ve had success, it has been a major struggle. The 2023 WGA strike decimated the industry and it has not recovered. Pay is down. Projects are fewer, deadlines tighter and we’re fighting AI and overseas outsourcing. I’m ready to retire from the film business and focus on something more stable with more predictable hours. Here’s the kicker, I’d like to earn what I was earning prior to the strikes ~$220k/yr. 


I’m at a crossroads, and I have no idea which path I should go down. I figure I’ll be working until I’m dead, so how will I spend the next 40 or so years? 


Before I muddy the waters with my ideas, does anything strike any of you as a decent / comparable transition? I’ve worked at studios. I’ve worked at agencies. I’d like to get out of working for either of these again. 


I’ve considered talking with a career counselor, but I’m not sure this is a solid route and my ROI is worth it. I’m totally down to go back to school but in what field? Marketing & sales seems up my alley but kind of boring. Computer vision and machine learning would mend well with my past and it pays very well, but I’m not much of a coder and aside from  midjourney and chatgpt prompts I haven’t done a whole lot with AI - I’d be starting at zero. And most of these openings want several YOE on top of bachelor’s degrees in computer science. I have a two year degree from a film school and a bachelor’s degree from a now defunct art school. So again, starting at zero. Not sure how I’d survive another 4 years of school with mouths to feed and bills to pay. 


Some other tidbits. In college a long time ago I worked for Kohler designing (CAD) and selling kitchens for remodels and high end builders. But my very first college job was door to door vacuum sales. They were $2300 in 1998 dollars and I had a 33% closing percentage. After college I worked as a reporter, journalist and movie critic for a few different publications in LA. I’ve directed music videos, a few commercials and several shorts, but it’s not something I want to do at all. I wrote and sold a screenplay in 2017, but it was never produced. I still write screenplays, but that’s more me enjoying it than anything. I don’t write for money. Each script is more of a lottery ticket than a proper career, and I only finish one every other year. 


Anyway that’s my life story in career form.


Any tips, ideas, help, comments, concerns or general brainstorming is greatly appreciated.  


Thanks all.

1l8qglp,Purchase Or Flee,"I have been with my company for about 20 years and have actually become a minority owner.

In February 2024, the founder and I started talking about me purchasing the entire company, which I was (and continue to be) very interested in.

Through a series of events, it took until February 2025 to receive draft agreements... And they were absurd. Certain things that were promised were not included, timelines were modified, pricing didn't account for my equity. Just a ton of stupidity.

And the contracts that I was told were negotiable ... Were not. I spent 4 mo this going back with options and alternatives, with the guidance of my attorney, accountant, and broker, and everything was shot down. It was clear that the contracts were ""take it or leave it"".


I chose to ""leave it"". The founder wanted me to reconsider or at least discuss my request for going along with a third party sale. I had no interest in a third party sale and made that known.


Now he is using a broker (instead of his accountant and attorney) that specializes in selling this kind of business and also specializes in internal sales (so they say). But the valuation needs to be redone which will most certainly be higher than the one we had done last year. I am told we will be negotiating with the new valuation and that one of the options I offered previously (which was rejected because of the tax burden it would create for him) is now on the table.


I sent resumes out last week and surprisingly have 4 incredible offers (all within about 9 days of sending out resumes). Think $200k compensation-type offers.

I'm thinking I reject the offers and go along for the negotiation ride once more with the knowledge that I can just quit and get a quick/awesome offer elsewhere.

Thoughts? What would you do?",jimbeammmmm85,2,0.6700000166893005,9,1749642145,2025-06-11 11:42:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8qglp/purchase_or_flee/,6,2025
1l8qa87,Teacher transitioning to either Psychology or IT/Cyber Security?,"Hi all  
  
I’m at a real career/life crossroads and would love your honest advice. I’ve just completed a Bachelor of Psychological Science , and I’ve spent the last five years teaching at international schools (both within Australia and abroad). I have a background in teaching/education (Bachelors + Masters); however, I am not sure I can see myself teaching for much longer (for too many reasons to list).  
  
My main issue is choosing between Psychology versus IT/Cybersecurity. 

I really enjoy the human-interaction aspect and the sense of purpose it brings. The downside is that it would take another 1.5–2 years of study, entry-level counsellor salaries in Australia start around AUD 55–70 000, and competition for clinical or registered psych spots is fierce. Alternatively, I could pivot fully into IT or cybersecurity by knocking out certifications like CompTIA ITF+ and Security+. From what I’ve seen, those credentials can be completed in 6–12 months, and entry-level roles (SOC analyst, security admin) often start around USD 50–70 000. The remote opportunities are abundant, but the work is heavy on screen time, the technical learning curve is steep, and it can feel more isolated without the regular face-to-face interaction I value.  
  
Given my priorities (some human contact, decent remote options, solid pay), which path do you think makes the most sense? Any honest insights, real-world stories, or resources would be hugely appreciated.

1l8nuj3,I m a senior in highschool. How do i stop being envious of my friends who get way way more opportunities and recognition in school?,"Its a bit complicated. I m currently 17. I wouldnt say these are my close friends but my classmates are really great and talented. I have this one classmate, she is a really good speaker. Has done it since she was a kid, and overtime, every teacher has acknowledged her so everytime some event comes up, she is always the one made to give speeches or host it. I am not a bad speaker myself. I have also hosted some events. But perphaps, I just feel a bit sad sometimes because she is really talented and she gets the chance to show her talents. The debate team teacher chose her to represent our school and she participated there. I have no idea why I feel so bitter in a way. I m not mean to her. I just always feel like I was never able to participate in events as a kid because no teacher chose me or maybe I wasnt good enough. I just feel like if I was given a chance to debate, I would do as good as her. Maybe not as good, but I would love to experience more speaking events.

Though at the same time, I know i shouldnt be envious because our life trajectories are completely diff. I am preparing for law school exams and she says she's not sure yet about what she wants to do in life. Anyways, I just feel like maybe I m just insecure or something. How do I help but not compare myself. I feel incompetent when I dont get chosen. I m a pretty good student with straight As and academically we're not much diff but I dont feel jealous abt acads. I just wish I had more extracurriculars.

1l8m3ts,Laws,"*LAWS OF FINANCE*
                                                       

There are 2 types of Laws of finance:
1} LAW OF POVERTY.
2} LAW OF WEALTH.

*1} LAW OF POVERTY:* This law states that work alone or work under someone and remain poor for the rest of your life. 95% of people in the world are living under this law. The people under this law make use of their credentials, they have ego, they seek for job, they have someone called boss, they receive salary which is fixed amount.
 
      *B.O.S.S*
B= Building
O= On
S=  Some one
S=  Success

*S.A.L.A.R.Y*
S= Something
A= Always
L= Low
A= And
R= Reduces
Y= You

These people are called the working class. They always look for job.

*J.O.B*

J= Journey 
O= Of the
B= Borrowers

*2} LAW OF WEALTH:* This law states that work with a team or group of people and remain wealthy forever, it is just 5% of people in the world that are living under this law. The people under this law make use of their potentials, and they are called the thinking class, they think of what to offer to the society and in turn make money. These people they earn their money which is income and it is not a fixed amount. These people are called the thinking class.

_The difference between these laws is that the people under the_ *LAW OF POVERTY* _don't make use of opportunity.. while those under the_ *LAW OF WEALTH* _make use of any opportunity that comes their way. The wealthy ones make use of *ID Number* and also *Partnership,* they have what is called big dreams but the poor don't have._

 *REMEMBER THESE TODAY*
👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼

Money does not respond to qualifications
Otherwise the wealthiest people should have been *Ph.D holders.*

Money does not respond to age Otherwise the world's oldest twins would have been the *richest.*

‍ It is not about your *degree*
 It is all about what you do after the *degree.*

‍Have you noticed that the 1st class degree holders are not the *Richest* 
Neither are the *3rd class degree holders the poorest.* 
There is more to being wealthy than education.

The most important thing is *Mindset* 👌 and the next thing is a *Commitment to self DISCIPLINE.*👏

The only person holding your key to success is *YOU.*

The secrets to success is for you to be willing to pay the price but the challenge is that very few are ready and willing to pay the price to succeed.

While some are partying and gisting, others are learning, planning and earning.

Don't sit down and complain about where you are, it won't change anything.

If you must see changes, the person that must change is *You*.👉*BVOY the best * for business opportunity asap",Grouchy-Run8409,0,0.25,1,1749625431,2025-06-11 07:03:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8m3ts/laws/,6,2025
1l8lthc,"Sudden reporting line change, broken promises on pay/title, and feeling sidelined - I need advice","  
I've been in my role since mid last year and I replaced a person who honestly left a trail of destruction in their wake which I've been working to resolve. Since I started I've been handed responsibilities above my role description and I really didn't mind as I was advised that in July this would be rectified and prior to this whole situation the company was doing all the right things.   
  
About a week ago I was told my reporting line is changing from my current manager to a colleague. I have concerns about how this person and I will work together but compared to everything else that's happened it just doesn't feel like the biggest issue at this point.  My manager knew about my concerns with this person and indicated that a salary adjustment and role title to match a new JD I wrote would be done as part of the reporting change and this is sort of where the issues started: 

1. My manager never got the ok from HR or Finance on offering either the Pay or title change 
2. HR then got involved and spoke to my manager. A further discussion with my manager resulted in them stating they would promote a bonus for me to cover me until a payrise (reviews are in July, Pay increases in october) 
3. HR once again said this wasn't the case but said they'll do the benchmark in July using the JD I wrote instead of the pretty bad JD that currently is in place. 
4. After this my manager changed their tune and said You're not getting anything and you'll have to prove yourself to your new manager. 
5. HR again isn't happy with this response but also isn't willing to do more than their previous offer above.

I'm apparently already reporting to my new manager but they've not spoken to me and in the meantime I've been removed from all chats and meetings that were related to him. This also includes management chats and according to this whole situation - it's a reporting line change not a role change so I really don't think this is appropriate - I now have no central channel to discuss things with other leads that I work with on a daily basis. 

The whole thing feels insane and makes me feel like I've done something wrong without ever being told? I’ve gone from being trusted and operating independently to being sidelined with unclear expectations and broken trust. 

Has anyone else been through something like this? How did you navigate it or decide when it was time to move on?",Humble_Joke_6798,1,1.0,5,1749624282,2025-06-11 06:44:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8lthc/sudden_reporting_line_change_broken_promises_on/,6,2025

1l8l1bs,Looking for Advice: Which Role Should I Take After Leaving a Company I Gave Everything To?,"After five years at a start-up insurance tech company, I recently found myself in a situation I never saw coming.

I started as a sales agent and worked my way up through hard work and consistent performance. I became a Senior Sales Agent, trusted to help launch new tools and support new market rollouts. Eventually, I was promoted to Associate Sales Manager, where I led my own team, coached agents using data and call reviews, and supported other managers with training, QA, and onboarding. I consistently led a strong team that exceeded their monthly KPI’s. I was involved in pilot programs, internal initiatives, and process improvements. I had never been written up and had always gone above and beyond to support the company and my team. I truly enjoyed the company, the culture and the time I had invested with this company. It felt right, and I had no plans on leaving any time soon. 

However, with no warning, I was pulled into a 20-minute meeting with no HR present and told I had two options: accept a demotion or resign. The accusation was that I had placed an agent on ready status during their 15-minute break. But I had reviewed their activity that day, and they had not taken a call in over an hour. Their break was not scheduled at that time. I followed protocol and would never put the company or an agent in jeopardy like that. Why would I? It wouldn’t make any sense, and it goes against everything I’ve ever stood for. I felt like I was being targeted. My reporting Director mentioned that “Legal” got involved due to a call being abounded because the agent was not at their desk. We’ve been instructed before as managers that we can put an agent on ready in scenarios such as these. When I was thrown into this last minute meet I was not given the chance to explain or presented any real evidence. It was rushed, one-sided, and completely unexpected. 

I chose to walk away because I could not accept a demotion based on something I didn’t do.

I’ve applied to 200+ jobs, polished up my resume, explored a handful of job fairs and interviewed any opportunity I get. Now I’m at a crossroads and would appreciate outside perspective. I have two “solid” (not what I had in mind but the best out of everything so far) job offers in front of me:

1.	Senior Sales Insurance Agent at Experian – A structured sales role with the opportunity to work on a broader product set including bundles. Fully hybrid, good pay, good benefits, etc. 
	
2.	Unit Manager at GEICO – A leadership role that would allow me to keep building and coaching a team, something I’m passionate about and have a proven track record in. However, very corporate like and not sure how I feel about that. 

I’m 30 and still hungry to grow. Long term I’d love to get into higher-level leadership or even pursue an MBA. I’m looking for a company that values hard work, supports growth, and creates space for people to advance.

If you’ve been in a similar situation or have any insight into these roles or companies, I’d really appreciate your advice.

Got a bit of a career dilemma and could really use some outside perspective from people who get it.

I get a huge kick out of finding a problem nobody else saw and building a solution from scratch.

In every job I've had, I was hired for one thing but ended up doing something completely different. I'd start as a marketing manager or marketing automation specialist, but my bosses would quickly see that I have a knack for finding and fixing big-picture problems. Soon enough, they'd pull me away from my regular duties to focus on solving major issues across the department. I guess that makes me more of a marketing operations person at heart.

It seems I just naturally see how things can be better and I love learning what I need to fix them. At my last job, I even taught myself Python to build a tool that automated creating HTML for our whole team. It turned a task that took days into something that takes just a few minutes.

Recently, I found **n8n** when I was trying to solve another challenge. My boss wanted to send out emails with AI-powered news summaries. Building that workflow in n8n was the most complex and exciting project I've worked on so far.

This got me thinking that I could offer this as a service, maybe start a small agency. So, I went to Upwork to find my first clients. And that's where I hit a wall.

I was looking at the job posts, and I had this strange reaction. People were posting specific problems they wanted solved, like ""connect this app to that app."" Even though I knew exactly how to solve them with n8n, I felt zero motivation. It really surprised me.

I realized that what I truly enjoy is digging into a business, finding the problems they don't even know they have, and then solving them. The satisfaction for me comes from helping a company in a way they didn't expect. When I'm just given a task to complete, it feels... empty. I also know from experience that sometimes the problem a client thinks they have isn't the real issue at all.

This whole experience has shaken me up a bit. I was sitting there, scrolling through Upwork, and I just couldn't imagine myself doing this kind of work long-term.

That's when it clicked. n8n/make.com/zapier are just tools. My real skill is seeing the whole picture. I'm not just the automation guy, I'm the guy who can set up a project management system, fix a broken CRM, and build a knowledge base so the team isn't constantly asking the same questions, ect.

So now I'm kind of stuck. **I want to work with multiple clients remotely**. I want them to tell me their frustrations, their big messy problems, and let me dig in and find a real solutions.

But how do you even sell that?

What do you even call this? ""Remote Marketing Ops Consultant""? Sounds so stuffy.

And where do you find these clients if not on sites like Upwork? Is it just about networking on LinkedIn and hoping for the best?

My biggest question is how you even start that conversation. How do you tell a business owner, ""Hey, the thing you think is the problem probably isn't the real problem, and you should pay me to find the actual one""? It feels like a tough sell.

Anyway, I'm kind of just thinking out loud here. Has anyone else felt this way or successfully built a role like this for themselves? Any advice would be awesome.

1l8iys9,Got Hired as a Field Engineer Without My Degree Fully Posted — Am I Overthinking It?,"I recently accepted a full-time Field Engineer role with a respected general contractor. Offer is signed, onboarding is in motion, and my start date is confirmed. I’ve already been assigned to multiple projects, even travel ones.

Here’s the situation: I walked in graduation this May and finished all my coursework, but my degree hasn’t officially posted yet due to a GPA issue in my major. I’ll be retaking two courses over the next academic year to meet the graduation requirement.

The job description clearly stated “Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience.” I’ve completed multiple GC internships, have OSHA 30, and real field experience on job sites. I didn’t misrepresent anything — I just wasn’t directly asked about my official graduation status, and no one’s followed up on it. Onboarding is next week and they just ask for I-9 and bank account information.

Some coworkers have seen my graduation photos and congratulated me — everything has felt supportive.

Important context: From what I gathered during the interview and what I’ve observed, office roles like Project Engineer do require a posted degree, but field roles (like mine) have more flexibility, they want experience. They even mentioned in the interview, they encourage moving around and trying new things once you’re in the door, but that's limits me because those roles require a degree. 

Has anyone else started work in this kind of gray area before? Is this something I should stress over, or does my “equivalent experience” and field background make this a non-issue?",Content_Stay_3363,2,1.0,1,1749613797,2025-06-11 03:49:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8iys9/got_hired_as_a_field_engineer_without_my_degree/,6,2025

Ive always been intrested in research , at first it was researching about stars and planets , as i grew older and read more into it , my intrest developed even more in field of astrophysics and particle physics .For the past two years i had a AI + ML course in my school , where we learnt about the fundamental of machine language , types of neural networks , how these neural networks are formed , how the skeleton of an ai program looks like etc. all this was a lot of fun and i enjoyed my classes a lot , other than the mathematical (stats) aspect of those classes , the whole experience was a bliss. lately ive been thinking a lot about my possible career pathways. ever since i was 13 i dreamt of becoming an scientist and researching for life. even tho im still interested in pure sciences but i wonder about the possible career in ai research and development too. can someone guide me to the basics of this ? ive asked a couple of guys and all they said was there's basically no money unless u have a phd and a ton load of experience(talking about ai here).  
as someone who is equally interested in both which job would u recommend me the more? and what would be the stepping stones of that? also pls inform me about the possible earning in pure science research or ai/ml research.  
also what do u think about a hybrid of both? afaik , computational physics or data driven astrophysics requires knowledge and experience in ai too , as well as particle physics and quantum computing.Hows the job market here? and is it recommended to do a major in physics + minor in cs or vise versa?

1l8hf2x,Did I unintentionally commit to a role I don’t actually want?,"Hi all, I could use some career perspective on a situation I’ve found myself in.

My company is creating a new department focused on VIP client support. This comes after about six months of a very reactive, disorganized setup. Earlier this year, they launched a level 1 support team that pulled in people from various departments (including mine), but it’s been rocky. Among other issues, specialized engineers were being asked to take basic support calls on weekends, processes kept changing with no warning, communication was poor, and some of the new team’s behavior was pretty unprofessional.

Now they’re trying to stand up a level 2 team—about 10 people—and want to pull talent from existing groups. I expressed *tentative* interest, mostly to hear more and discuss potential compensation. I wasn’t really planning to take the role unless the offer was compelling and things looked more stable.

Some additional context: this new team was supposed to launch with a full headcount on a specific date, and from what I’ve heard, they missed that target by a wide margin.

Here’s where things get weird. A manager reached out via internal chat—not email—on a day when I was out of office, asking if I was still interested. I replied at the start of my shift on my next working day and said I was open to talking. In response, I got… a thumbs-up emoji. No message. No follow-up. Then nothing for nearly 36 hours, until someone completely different (a supervisor under that manager, but still senior to me) reached out right at the end of my shift, asking if I’d be willing to have an “informal interview” the next day.

So now I’m wondering:

1. Is this even worth pursuing, given all the red flags (lack of structure, poor communication, unclear expectations)?
2. More importantly—did I somehow accidentally commit myself to this role just by showing interest and saying “let’s talk”?

Appreciate any thoughts from folks who’ve been in similar situations or have navigated messy internal transitions before.",throwaway06102025,1,1.0,0,1749608870,2025-06-11 02:27:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8hf2x/did_i_unintentionally_commit_to_a_role_i_dont/,6,2025

1l8h17r,Fired from internship RANT,"As the title says, I got fired from my internship, which was for 12 months, which was done in collaboration with my school—that too in just 6 weeks. I am just wondering though I made mistakes that I truly went wrong. I am going to mention all of the things he mentioned when he let me go. Before I start. I would like to say that this company was very unprofessional. I had to sign the work contract 3 times before starting cuz they kepting making changes. This scared me and I reached out to my school about it as its my first placement and they are already moving like this. They also took away my WFH for half the week exactly 14 days before I started which was one of the changes. It seemed like they gave me the bare minimum time to let me know and if given more time I would not have accepted but it was too late and I was forced to. Anyways about why I was fired based off my boss. First, I missed a deadline. This deadline was big but I was not made aware of such a deadline. Every task I was able to work on never had a strict deadline. He mentioned that all interns were told this but I think I would remember the only task that has a strict deadline. I only know what I know and don't know what I do not know. This task I was trained on by an outgoing intern so I believe it is right to assume that everything he is teaching me should be how I do it. Another point he mentioned is that I did not show much communication, which I understand by disagree. With the tasks I received I always tried to ask for help from three people if needed and if the task mentions any sort of ""light"" deadline not the strict one as the one above. I tried to mention that but I guess he did not like that. He also did not like my efficiency on the job with my tasks. For context, I am the first intern for my department. All other new interns have outgoing interns and are able to learn directly and literally for 7 hours of the day from them. While I had to beg for their time as their responsibility was training their replacement. When I would get trained it would be for things they did for the department transfered to me. This is where missing that main deadline came to play and my efficiency was not good as those other interns are able to spend sm time preparing them when they end up leaving while I have to beg and hope. And when I am not doing that I have to do the most dead of tasks like making a sign-out form. He also said I ""stole"" from the company when doing my summer hours. Said that I arrived too late. I came 8:15-8:30 if there isnt traffic and leave at 5. The same as most people when they do summer hours. On my last day I came at 8:08 and only 3 people out of 60 were in office which I believe way more are doing summer hours as 2 people on my 5 person team were doing them for the week. I just followed what the FT employees and other interns did as I believed it was accepted and my boss does it as well (his hours are 9 to 5:30 PM yet he comes at 9:15 - 4:30 to 4:45 PM) and everyone has the same hours listed on the contract. One of the interns left many times at 3:30 PM as well. I said I was stressed out a bit cuz there way a lot of work to do at one time and he told me its not that much which would have been true if I had someone hold my hand thru it like the other interns to show them shortcuts and help them quickly fix mistakes before they make them. Another point he said he did not like was me going on the main floor instead of second floor (this is where all the monitors are, the meeting rooms are in the main floor). I did this as when I would finally get training that is where one intern would train his replacement and I would be there when he would call me down. I ended up being cool with him and being friends so I wanted to go down but he mentioned early in like 2 weeks that its best to stay upstairs so I hardly went down there again unless it was strictly training. Additionally, when he tried to train me himself he couldn't even finish the lesson. Going back to when I said it was a lot of work for one week, I was literally eating my lunch while working cuz there was sm work so its even less likely to say I ""stole"" from them. I could have communicated better to him but I communicated to the people who would be easier on me on that team as it felt like I was an idiot when I reached out to him despite being there for a month. I reached out if the others couldnt answer the question or it is something like an update he should know. With the downstair room point and him kinda j making stuff up he said I go on my phone alot which i disagree with simply put. One of the interns roles is almost fully automated and works really 2 days of the 5 in-person he just pretends. He is screaming in his room downstairs sometimes and is on his phone and laptop looking at BRAINROT memes. I will end it off with this. With that one week I was working a lot and missing those ""light"" deadlines + that main deadline. He then made a meeting on monday EOD pretty much just saying I was doing horrible. He then met w me tuesday EOD and fired me and said the same things he said on monday. So, I had no opportunity to even imporve after that meeting. I just want to know if it was truly my fault as I just tried to match the environment of both the FT Employees and Interns. And regarding my tasks I genuiely did try my best even though I did not like my job and knew I wouldn't at the end of the day i was in the mind space that it was only temporary (funny lol) and I could do something better later.",Square_Sock_6304,2,0.6200000047683716,2,1749607713,2025-06-11 02:08:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8h17r/fired_from_internship_rant/,6,2025

1l8gpmv,How to approach my manager that I feel unsupported,"I have been with a company for 9 months now. The workload has been fairly intense and I have been working really hard to build my knowledge while running forward.

My manager is great in many aspects, particularly in terms of work flexibility and understanding family commitments and balancing the 2 (I have a 2 year old who goes to daycare so sick constantly).

The issue is, I feel unsupported in getting the knowledge I need to confidently do my job independently. I feel a bit dismissed, in that when I ask fairly specific questions to my role I am told to read the SOP' or work instruction. I also feel like I get cryptic responses which I don't quite follow and have lead to me going too deep down some unnecessary rabbit holes to answer the questions.

I have been left feeling quite unconfident in my own self and just dread having to ask questions within my own team.

I am actively looking for a new position but also feel I could do well in my current role if things change. For context, there has apparently been somewhat of a high turnover in my department and the skill set is fairly specific and difficult to fill.

Problem is I had a run in with the law, wasn’t convicted, and will be able to seal the record in two years. 

Problem is no one would take me in for a job, they won’t give a chance for me to explain. 

So I went to grad school at a good university for my masters in ME, but I’d have two more years to go so I’m considering getting another technical masters, for several reasons, the first is to burn time, and second I’d want to pivot my path to focus on that field (computation based) as it would open doors to a career area I’d be interested in. 

Is this the best I can do? I’m concerned how managers might question getting another masters instead of working but working is out of reality given I wouldn’t pass a background check, even for smaller companies

1l8g5wt,"24, Behind in Life, Broke, in Debt, and Lost — Really Need Career Direction","Hi everyone,

I'm 24 years old and feeling completely lost.

I started going to community college two years ago and won’t be graduating for another year. I’ll be getting my associate's degree in Sports Management — which I now realize was probably not the smartest choice. I picked it because I wanted to do something I loved, but I’ve come to see how little money is in the sports world, especially starting out. I don’t see a stable or realistic future in it anymore.

Right now, I’m broke, in debt, and still living at home in a situation I’d really like to get out of. I’ve been applying to jobs, but haven’t had any luck. I’ve been relying on DoorDash to get by, and while I’m grateful for it, it doesn’t feel sustainable.

I’ve dealt with anxiety for most of my life, which is a big reason why I started school later than most people. That only makes me feel more behind. I don’t feel like I’m where I should be for my age. I see others with degrees, careers, apartments, and savings — and I’m just stuck.

My only work experience is in automotive, retail management, and customer service. I want to turn my life around, but I honestly don’t know what the next step is. I feel like a loser, and I hate even writing that, but it’s where I’m at mentally.

I don’t really want to go for a bachelor’s and graduate at 27 — especially if I’m not confident in the path. I want to be independent, make a decent income, and feel like I’m actually building a life.

If anyone has advice on a new direction, career ideas, trades, certifications, or just how to get moving again — I’d appreciate it more than you know.

Thanks for reading.",Cultural-Bison9503,7,0.8999999761581421,4,1749605059,2025-06-11 01:24:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8g5wt/24_behind_in_life_broke_in_debt_and_lost_really/,6,2025
1l8fzy2,Go to HR privately or be direct that I am going to HR?,"I have a complicated situation at work where I need to get some help from HR about the way things are working between a co-worker and I. I don't want to bore you with the details, but in a nutshell this person is in a higher position than I am, but does not know how to actually do anything on their own. Therefore, they come to me to find out what they need for each procedure - imagine something like a doctor turning to their nurse before every operation and saying, ""nurse, what tools do I need for this surgery?"" kind of thing. Legally, any mistakes they make due to my advice would be their own responsibility, but I am still very concerned about being held responsible for said mistakes. I also do not want this responsibility (it's way above my pay grade).

I think I have decided I am going to talk to HR about it. Not to necessarily throw my co-worker under the bus, but to say that I am not comfortable with the position I've found myself in and I don't want to do it. Someone in the same position as my co-worker should be making these decisions and be overseeing their work until they know what they're doing. I am not qualified to do that, and when they began working with me I THOUGHT another ""doctor"" was going to be supervising them, but they are not, and they have even told me I am not allowed to discuss their work with other doctors without their permission.

My question is this: do I tell my co-worker up front, ""I'm going to talk to HR to get some clarification on our roles and how this is supposed to work,"" or do I just do it? I initially thought it would be more respectful and professional to advise them of my intentions, so that if word gets back to them that I said something, they will know I was upfront about it and not trying to go over their head or go behind their back. But now I'm wondering if it will just make them unnecessarily upset. I probably have to continue working with this person in some form no matter what I do, so I'm trying to keep the peace as much as possible.

1l8fj0y,Wanting to leave but being pressure to stay at my job by my uncle,"
So I’ve been working at a machinist shop as a forklift operator / labourer for a company my uncle manages for the last 3 years. Ive decided to go to school to become a lawyer in the time I’ve been here as I don’t think I can do the work that I do now for the rest of my life. So here lies the problem. When I first started I was really gung-ho about the job, wanting to learn everything to be as useful as possible. Even asked repetitively to be trained in other departments to which I had been turned down for a couple reasons. The most common one being,  “ we don’t need another person trained there, but if they go on a long vacation we can see about training you “. It had nothing to do with my skill or level of competency. I’ve mentioned planning to go to school to my uncle multiple times, mentioned moving to a cheaper place, worked a ton of ot in the last 2 years and have talked about saving as much as I can. 6 months ago a coworker of mine had a heart attack and has been recovering since, the department he is working in has 2 people that work in it on my shift. The other guy has holidays planned for 5 weeks in July. And the recovering coworker hasn’t returned yet but might after June 30th. I have courses I plan on taking in August for school. I’ve mentioned months ago having to take them to my uncle. Today I told him “ if you had gotten me trained 2 years ago when I was asking all the time for more opportunities you wouldn’t be having to worry about coverage “ to which he said that I shouldn’t think like that and that me now being trained might get me a raise. ( my yearly raises have been 50 cents each. It’s the kind of company to look for any possible reason to not pay you more ). 

So I’m wondering how I should go about this ? My parents and other people in my life are completely supportive of me wanting to get a higher education. My uncle doesn’t seem to have much faith in me. Which is funny because he’s the one who hired me to begin with. Would I be an asshole for not giving them coverage. There’s no guarantee when my coworker that had a heart attack will be back. I’ve already paid for the courses. The department id be training in isn’t very busy during the summer. And u have no doubt that the morning shift can cover the slack. I just need to move on but I don’t want to cause a shit storm. I’ll cause one if I have to but seeming as my boss is my uncle and family gatherings could get awkward. I’m grateful for the opportunity it’s just time for me to move on in my life. So how should I go about quitting come August ?

1l8fhbu,Recent Grad Looking for Career Advice (ACCT/FIN),"Hello everyone!

I'm really hoping to get some advice or perspective from those in the ACCT/FIN industry or anyone who's been in a similar position. 

I currently have a BSBA in Finance and Accounting and recently completed an MBA with a Finance concentration from a non-target university. I went directly into the MBA program after undergrad, mainly to meet the credit requirement for the CPA designation. 

I have about 1 year of experience working in tax department in corporate, and another year in an admin. role at a small finance company. Unfortunately, I've been out of work for about 2.5 years (my final year of undergrad and the duration of my MBA program). Over the last year, I've submitted over 800 application across 3 states, mostly targeting entry level accounting and financial analyst roles. So far, I've received about 10 initial interviews, with CPA firms, but none have progressed to second rounds. In several cases, I've was told they were just looking for candidates with more experience. I've gotten feedback from several professionals in both fields, and the consensus has been that there's nothing they would change. I've also regularly done mock interviews with mentors and friends to practice my interview skills. 

While I initially intended to go into public accounting, I've noticed there seemed to be less and less entry-level openings. As a result, I've found myself gravitating towards financial analyst roles.  However, I realize that my lack of direct work experience in the finance and the employment gap makes it even more challenging. 

I'm really hopping to get some advice on how to approach the application process more effectively.

1. Do cover letters still matter? When I started applying, I tailored each of one to the specific company + role. Eventually, I stopped doing this after several mentors told me its more of a numbers game and encouraged me to apply more broadly instead given the current job market. 
   1. 8/10 interviews came after switching to this approach, but I'm wondering if I should return to including cover letters with my applications. 
2. Is it possible and how can I land an entry level financial analyst role with no direct finance work experience?
   1. I've mainly been targeting investment analyst and portfolio analyst positions
3. Are there any specific certification or skills that I should pursue in order to 'beef' up my resume?
   1. I've completed certifications in Excel, FactSet, and Bloomsburg in the past. However, my current budget for additional certifications is limited due to being out of work.",Winteriris9483,2,1.0,1,1749602985,2025-06-11 00:49:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8fhbu/recent_grad_looking_for_career_advice_acctfin/,6,2025
1l8fgmp,Worried my application misrepresents my academics and work history,"Hi all,


Looking for advice on how to handle a job interview and application. I recently submitted a job application for a role that doesn't require degree if you have 10 years or more of experience in this sector which I do have. I was contacted on Friday about a phone screening which occurred this morning and it went very well. The recruiter told me that he'd be pushing my application along to the hiring manager. I'm excited as this would be a great promotion and pay raise for me.

However, I'm worried that my application says that I have a bachelors degree when I selected ""Some College"" when applying. The reason I'm worried about this is because when I initially applied for the role I had to edit something before submitting and I noticed that my ""Some College"" selection had reverted to the default option of ""Bachelors"" along with a former position I had being marked as ""I currently work here"" which also wasn't accurate.

I know I fixed these issues again, but I'm sort of panicking that the changes reverted back and I'm wondering if it'd be a red flag to the recruiter of the phone call today if I emailed and nonchalantly asked if I could have a copy of the application that I submitted.

Would that be a huge red flag for them if I asked but didn't state why? Or if I said I wanted to make sure everything I submitted my precise and accurate?

I understand this could cause them to think twice about continuing with me, but I want to be honest and transparent in the event that my concerns are realized.

1l8e4ur,Can I ask a recruiter about openings at my current employer?,"I was laid off in August of 2024 and got another job in March of this year through a staffing/recruiting agency. The company is pretty big and has an HR department, but they don't do any of their own recruiting (they solely recruit/hire through at least the one agency that I worked with). Since I was coming off of a layoff, I took the first job I could get, so it wasn't what I wanted, and I had to take a big paycut. I like the company a lot, though, but there's no real way for me to know if they'd be hiring for any positions without asking my boss or a coworker, which I think would be weird to do, especially after only 3 months. 

Is it weird for me to email the recruiter I worked with who helped me get this job and ask if she knows of any openings at the company? Or should I start with someone at the company? I just wouldn't know who to ask who would actually have info besides my boss, which I don't think is a good idea at all. He is very nice, though, so maybe an honest conversation would go okay, I just wouldn't know what to say.

1l8cpsl,"Seeking Advice on Term Role, Work Environment Dynamics","Looking for advice on work. 

For the past three years I've been trying to find permanent work in my field and have faced internships and contract roles that have gone nowhere. I am angry at my partner for moving us to this area and just tired. I'm on my second grad degree and was full of mission and purpose in moving here. After being treated like I'm either lowest rung, work horse, or both for three years, I'm just done with this area. There is also a significant political layer as well. During my first internship, I was treated like crap by a fellow employee. I maintained boundaries professionally and since I left that role I'm sure they had a lot of crap to say. That has created professional distance with partnering agencies which is incredibly unfair because I am to be a hard, capable worker and pride myself on empathy. (For those who want to give me crap, look in the mirror - I'm not flawless, but I also don't deserve a smear campaign by jerks). The person who bullied me is disliked by the other orgs, it turns out, but people do treat me differently bc that agency funds parts of THEIR salaries. 

I am now in a a term limited position with an org that has a reputation for keeping their staff around, so I figured it was worth the risk (plus they told me there were permanent roles coming down the pike during the interview - first day of work they told me those roles were all canceled). They told me how excited they were to get me on. 

In this role I have been asked to do much more than what I could possibly fit into a work day. It isn't because I lack skill. These are time intensive tasks. I am also being kept out of meetings that would relate to the work I am being asked to do, so a lot of the times I create products I'm asked to create with no real connection to the project and no recognition for my efforts or response from the folks who get my work. Basically I'm supposed to provide materials for projects that I'm not really being looped into and I often don't even hear back about whether they were helpful. My funding is all messed up. I have to ask whether I'm really funded for full time because the way I have to code my time goes against how I'm told to code it. 

The agency prides itself on keeping staff employed but multiple employees have been telling me to look elsewhere for work. I get it - times are tough - but I can't help but feel I was pegged for temporary no matter what they said during the interview. 

Last week I was told that permanent positions are happening right now and also that they are up to the decision of a certain level of management, which seemed like a weird/vague response from my direct supervisor. I then learned at least one person was moved to permanent. 

I am the kind of person that thrives on community, inclusion, mentorship and opportunities to grow. I feel so stunted and simultaneously taken for granted. If they wanted me so badly why is nobody advocating for my inclusion in career development opportunities or permanent roles, and instead piling work on me with no regard for how this all feels? 

The other day I was visibly upset in the office and my team made multiple comments about smiling and being happy, even a therapy joke. I told them that it is hard to feel included when the permanent roles I expected to apply to disappeared and the full time hours I was promised seem ambiguously funded, on top of being a term employee. I guess I am the problem now. 

Looking for advice on how to handle this. I know my heart, my mind, my professionalism and capabilities. None of what I'm given matches the level I should be at and I'm so tired and done.

1l8chat,The Real Reason Your Boss Sucks (And How to Protect Your Career From It),"Had a lightbulb moment listening to this leadership podcast that explains why so many managers are terrible - and more importantly, how to navigate it for your career.

**The Core Issue: ""Power Blindness""** Most bad bosses aren't evil - they literally forget what it's like to be in your shoes. They cancel your 1-on-1s without realizing it signals you're unimportant. They send late-night emails not thinking about the pressure it creates.

**Career-Saving Insights:**

**Red Flag Recognition:** If your team meetings are always ""harmonious"" and no one ever disagrees, your boss might have power blindness. People are too scared to speak up.

**Protection Strategy:** When your boss gets defensive or shuts you down, it's often their ""strength in overdrive"" (passion becoming intensity, caution becoming paralysis). It's not personal.

**The 5% Feedback Rule:** Even when your boss gives harsh/unfair feedback, ask ""where's the 5% of truth here?"" This helps you extract value without taking it all personally.

**Power Dynamic Awareness:** Just by having a title, your boss gets treated differently all day. This can create blind spots about how their behavior affects you.

**For Your Own Career Growth:** If you're eyeing management roles, this stuff is gold. The podcast guest (former Pixar Culture Director) says the best leaders constantly ask themselves: ""How is my stress showing up and rippling out to my team?""

**Bottom Line:** Understanding why bosses behave badly helps you respond strategically instead of emotionally - which is honestly a career superpower.

Anyone else notice these patterns with their managers? How do you handle power-blind bosses?

1l8c9rm,Wtf do I do with my career?,"I'm 32 and I'm desperate to change my working life (hence posting on Reddit). I'm college educated and have worked as a retirement planner, in software sales, and in B2B product sales in the health/wellness space. Every time I start a new 9-5, I immediately sink into the misery of working for someone else, being underpaid, and sitting in front of a computer all day. 

I'm creative and good with my hands (I paint a lot and am a skilled baker), great with customer service and networking, and would prefer to make my own schedule so I can maintain my passions outside of work. I'm not afraid of working hard, but I find it difficult to do so when I don't care about the work itself. 

I do understand that work is work, and not many are lucky to find a career they truly love, but with that mindset, I still haven't managed to find a job where I can do my work, close my computer, and live comfortably (I'm single w/o dependents & live simply, so my salary expectations are not unrealistically high, but I would like to be able to save over time, not just cover necessities as I feel has been the case my entire career). 

Maybe this is a rant more than anything else, but I am truly lost. Do I learn a quick trade like microblading or something in esthetics and build a business? Do I go back to school (idk what I'd even go for which seems like a waste of money)?

How do people survive when they don't fit into America's live to work culture? I'm smart and have so much to offer, but feel like a failure. I'm so lost. Any words or wisdom would be appreciated. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

1l8bvi5,Pivoting away from NCAA coaching. Never done anything else! Looking for advice.,"Hey everyone,

  
After 10 years of coaching track & field at the NCAA D1 level, I am looking to leave the profession. With the NCAA house settlement approved, my program is facing roster and budget cuts, while also potential staff cuts in the near future. I was fortunate enough to get a coaching position immediately after my collegiate eligibility ran out, so I am still *relatively* young.

  
Although I have enjoyed my time as a coach, I want to move into a different career path. Here are some of the main skills that might be transferable:

\-Recruiting

\-On-boarding/training (guiding 18-22 year olds through their collegiate journey essentially became this)

\-Leadership/team management

\-Data analytics--to a degree...we use a program that helps with recruitment analytics 

\-Budget management, logistics, and any other form of operations (we did not have a formal Director of Operations position, so I took over these responsibilities as well)

\-Fundraising (I operated a Fall and Spring fundraiser for alumni, on top of hosting High School and NCAA meets at our track to generate extra revenue)



I know these are pretty much all ""soft"" skills, but what do you all think I could leverage this into? I don't mind a competitive career. We were all at-will employees with a one-year renewable contract. Basically, you either perform or you get fired. I am comfortable in a pressure environment. 

  
Looking forward to some advice!",attiroc,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1749593146,2025-06-10 22:05:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l8bvi5/pivoting_away_from_ncaa_coaching_never_done/,6,2025

1l8bhlx,Advice? Feels like its too late (know its not) a decade of stagnation.,"Throwaway.

So basically im about to turn 30.

  
Since age 18/19 I got money to go to school through our states college program. The town in which the main college is located is about 1hr30 to the next university.

Semi rural southern area.

The main programs to choose at the time when I went were.

Buisiness admin, communications, art, standard degrees (english,history ect), nursing, PRE engineering (that required you to attend THIS uni for 2 years and finish 2 at a different uni), or computer science (the first year they ever attempted to HAVE a comp sci program at the uni EVER).

  
Moved through life at this point with 0 push 0 guidance and essentially coasted on auto pilot. Pretty sure it was depression. Once I would start a program id be in school so long, and then work right after that I stopped caring about anything. 

I had to stay above a certain amount of hours for school which meant I could only work about 20 hours a week. The only job i could get at the time was 9/hr.  I took no loans out for school.

  
I started a relationship about my 2nd semester, switch majors to computer science once I started to actually think about the career prospects of ART (lol) and our professor from bejing wasn't an awful teacher but defo was the sink or swim type. This combined pressure of a toxic relationship (I got false baby trapped) with the program and being uber poor while spending 7am-5pm in class and then 5pm-10pm at work killed any and all spark left in my soul. I essentially autopiloted until I dropped out.

After this got kicked out because didn't have a plan and just dropped out.

Couch surfed for a while until I found a job as a carpenter. Worked for 12/hr for about 2 years.

Got fired for not knowing enough. After that moved back in to the folks place and went back to school to community college. Didn't have to go to school as much so was able to actually work a part time job enough to support myself. The community college I was going to only offered associates, no bachelors. It was a choice between IPT (Industrial petroleum tech) and drafting and design. I went with Drafting and Design because thats what my father did. I thought the career was bigger than what it was.

I worked for 1 year in an industrial plant being an electrical helper to build up some money before working my degree job.

My first job out of school was working for a public water company because any other job was too far away for the pay offered. I would be driving 2 hours to make 18 an hr vs the 16.50 I initially got at the water company.

  
For almost 5 years I stagnated at this job. I didn't even draft a majority of the time I was actually an ArcGIS analyst, basically a mix of 10% drafting/design and 90% cartographer updating geospacial databases and making maps for the county. The work was nice but I worked for the worst boss I've ever had to this day. After 5 years I lost it, quit on the spot with 0 plan. Only job I had to take mental health days for ever. Boss was extremely old and toxic, constantly brough up politics and if he was pissed about something he would rant to you and bring up hypothetical situations to you so YOU would get pissed about the same thing he was pissed about. Couldn't do it. I was essentially arguing with an old man everyday doing public government work with 0 room for growth. I made 500 a week after taxes with the assumption I would stay there until death to get my pension. 



Took 1 month off of working after I quit. Got a bartending gig 10 minutes from home from a friend at a mexican restaurant and unironically made more money than I ever did before. Worked 50-60 hrs a week but averaged 3-4k a week tax free. Enjoyed the fast pace and multi tasking but knew management would actually be a dock in pay and the place was corrupt so eventually left.

  
Tried drafting one more time for a small time (group of 6) engineering firm (5 minutes away) doing drafting work for lighting for commercial buildings and schools. Made 600 a week after tax no benefits at all. Sat down with my boss and tried to get a path laid out for my future here and he basically said he hired me to do his overflow design work. So I'd basically be working here to take load off of him and there wasn't really a position up, he was the owner lol.

  
My friend put me on to a company (1 hr away) someone I graduated with created, essentially a construction start up. They've had success and growth the past 5 years so I left my drafting lighting job to come here.



I was brought on as an estimator and base is 700 a week after tax but have frequent opportunities to make between 800-1200 a week after tax just making overtime which helps immensely.  

  
My bills are pretty small as I have a nice housing arrangement but I just feel like I've stagnated this entire time just trying to survive making no money. I've had 3 vehicles all used (because even though my credit is good I never have the cash for a down payment) every time I save up a few k it gets blown on a repair I couldn't possibly do myself (need an engine hoist/deep work that requires a lift ect) I do as much car repair as I can do myself. I never skimp out on maintenence I just only ride used vehicles.

  
I just fixed and bought an impala for 3k, my f150 is in the shop with 5k worth of damage. I have 3k to my name 0 debt great credit but I've just never worked jobs that paid decent enough to save even with my small amount of bills. 

  
TLDR; I have an associates in drafting (A field I don't believe pays more than 25 in a hcol area anymore, its engineer grunt work). I live in a LCOL area but everywhere where pay is decent is over 3 hours away and I don't have enough to move.



I feel like nearing 30 I did not have the opportunities to work overtime to build up savings and I very stupidly dropped out of college. I feel like im miles behind some of my friends that have oilfield jobs and homes and families at this point. I have a small property, a mobile home, a 20 year old vehicle and 3k to my name with a barely 50k take home pay. I know all of my decisions are my fault, im not looking for pity (even if some of my sentences don't read like that) just an educated guess on what my next step could be based on my work history im super, SUPER lost. :(



Sorry for the long read.

1l8ahc0,Feeling conflicted on applying for something new.,"The company I work for is expanding, and several new positions that I would be qualified for have opened up. The position I'm in currently doesn't make full use of my credentials and I'd like to be more hands-on with my career, so I'm seriously considering applying for a few of these positions.

The thing is, since I would be applying internally, I would have to get permission from my current supervisor to interview. I love my supervisor and would like to think she wouldn't hold it against me, but I worry about how she will take it when she realizes I am trying to move on.

Of course since she will find out eventually, I will let her know ahead of time that I am applying. It just feels very daunting and I keep second-guessing whether I want to put myself out there like this or not.

1l8af0z,"Toxic coworkers, checked-out manager, no real work... is this normal?","**Context:**  
This is my first job. I started as an intern for six months, during which I had meaningful tasks and felt engaged. After the internship, I was hired full-time (ten months ago), but things changed, especially since I now report to a different leader.

**Current Situation:**  
As a full-time employee, my workload is inconsistent. There are long periods, sometimes a month or more, where I have nothing assigned to me. Right now, I’m working on a project that's part of a contest. I finish my tasks quickly and attend occasional meetings, but the manager only seems to care when deadlines are close. The manager assigns other tasks to the other people that are working with me in the project, tasks not related to this project.

**Workplace Dynamics:**  
Some of my coworkers are openly bitter toward me. They work on legacy systems, the kind of projects the clients actually use full of bugs and bad practices, and they clearly resent the fact that I'm not stuck in those same projects. They make jokes at my expense, often implying that I'll be laid off once this contest project ends. It’s demoralizing and, honestly, pretty toxic.

**My Concerns:**

* I’ve been told I’ll eventually help with migrating the legacy software to new tech. This has made some coworkers even more passive-aggressive.
* During that free time I am actively learning and developing my skills. Because I want to be prepared and useful when and if the time comes.
* I thrive under pressure and like having responsibilities. Ironically, that might be why I get pulled into new initiatives. But the inconsistency, the coworkers' behavior, and the lack of engagement from my manager are affecting my mental health and making me anxious.
* Spending 12 hours a day in this environment is draining, the commuting and barely seeing my family is torture.
* Some people enjoy not having anything to do at work, but for me, it’s the opposite — I feel useless and guilty, especially when I get paid and feel like I haven’t earned it.
* I'm introvert and it makes me anxious having to ask my manager to assign me things (Isn't they're job to manage the developers).
* I want to contribute, just sitting there having nothing to do feels like a waste (even if I'm learning new things).

I’m currently working on improving my skills and preparing to move on to a better opportunity. I’m being paid minimum wage, and raises here are practically impossible. To make things worse, the customer service department gets paid nearly twice as much as the developers.

Right now, I just want to gain as much experience as I can without letting this situation hold me back — but the truth is, it *is* slowing me down. I feel tired all the time, drained and demotivated. The idea of getting laid off terrifies me because it means I won’t be able to pay for my college studies.

How much negotiating power do I have?,"As it says, my manager (sales role) is leaving voluntarily to work in a different practice area. He won't be able to keep his current book of business. As a result, I've been presented with a quasi-forced promotion. We're a culture and relationship built business, so handing his book to a new hire could take months/years to get up to speed and in the meantime customers could leave. 

Given I'm being given his book of business to maintain, but they could in theory go outside the organization to cover his book, do I have any wiggle room on salary/perk negotiation. 

Some other (possibly) pertinent facts:
-We're a small team and I'm the logical choice to inherit the book of business because I already know and have contact with his customers
-There are internal people that could take it over, but as above I know all the customers so an internal replacement would need an extended transition period to retain the customer base.
-In my current (lower) role, I'm near the upper salary range limit for my role. ",kanary15,1,1.0,1,1749588239,2025-06-10 20:43:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l89ucf/receiving_promotion_following_a_managers/,6,2025
1l89lxn,How to politely decline retention bonus without seeming like a flight risk but also not revealing too much personal info?,"This is going to be so long I am sorry, if you read it all thank you so much. I am a bit of a yapper. Basically writing all of this because I need advice, how do you decline for the listed reasons but also not look like you have one foot out the door, which could then have me looked over for investment/opportunities/promotions/etc. 

I have been offered a retention bonus that I do not want to accept. First off, No I don’t want to take it and put it in a HISA, I have too much anxiety and also I know I am too cheap to return the money, it would make me but my life or my happiness on the back burner just to avoid paying it back. The reasons I don’t want to accept are both career/personal reasons, but I don’t want to over share to them especially the potential baby reason since that could be off putting. 

I will be vague about the terms/conditions around the retention bonus as it’s an often given to a large group of selected people each year at my company. The terms/conditions are NOT negotiable at all. My boss is also pressuring me telling me it’s “good for culture” to accept which makes it even more uncomfortable. 

I have been with the company over 2 years already. The contract for the retention bonus is multiple years long, if you don’t stay the time period you pay it all back, not prorated. Think 40% of my current salary, then taxed at ~50%. I don’t have the money on hand to pay back the tax portion if I was to leave let’s say tomorrow and it would take me awhile to save that. No repayment plan options (not negotiable). 

The reasons I do not want to accept is: 
1. Personal Reason - Stress/Key Person on Soul sucking project - I’ve been working 60-70 hours most weeks. I have been on the same project that entire time that has been terrible. I have gained weight from the stress and it’s impacted my life in many ways. My company has promised they will get me off the project but it hasn’t happened, I am trying to stick it out but I think 12 months I will be at my limit (bonus provision much longer than that). I am a key person on the project with a knowledge base that’s hard to find on the market and they aren’t trying to find anyone, they have known how difficult it’s been on me for a year. 

2. Personal reason - Family Planning- I may or may not choose to have a baby during the bonus timeframe. The retention period obviously pauses during maternity leave. But I am worried I won’t want to return to work once I have a baby. If I didn’t return I would have to pay back the maternity leave benefits AND retention bonus, doesn’t seem great. I don’t think raising a child and working somewhere 55+ hours a week is honestly healthy for myself or potential future baby. My partner is also 50+ hours/week. 

3. personal reason - purchasing a home which may increase the commute significantly. Long commute & long hours with mandated in office policy? Not sure I could do that & I do not want to purchase in the city or downtown. Also let’s say I use this money to purchase a home, then my work life hits the metaphorical fan and I can’t handle it, then I have a mortgage to pay & depleted savings… too much anxiety for me personally. 

4. career reason - when hired, I was told I would be working in the industry which I want to continue to grow my career in. I am working in a completely different industry, which I do not like & I really miss my industry. The industry I want to be in is also “all about who you know,” so I feel like I can’t spend much longer not building my name and growing in it. Again they have continued to promise to get me into that industry but 2 years in and it has not happened. 

HOWEVER, all of this to say… there is potential I could end up staying multiple years, I don’t want to offend them by declining and shut the door on a potential future path with them. They have big dreams and desires for me, they have made promises to me, & I believe I can grow with them and have a solid career path (if they get work in my industry). I could also not have a baby during that time and maybe stay renting close to work. 

I am still not interested in taking it because there’s too many unknowns and what ifs to make a decision that ties me for multiple years, and even if I stayed 15 years I would not think declining the money a mistake personally. However, career wise… will they view it badly? I don’t want them to think I am a flight risk that’s not worth continuing to “invest” in, I am not looking elsewhere and I’m trying my hardest to stay as I believe there is potential if the promises are fulfilled to have a good career. But my health & personal life are my priority at this pivotal time period of my life, if things don’t change I want to be able to walk away stress free. I have been upfront & honest about all my frustrations to my direct bosses but not all of management, which would obviously all find out I didn’t accept.

1l89gul,New Manager,"I have been in my company for 6 years and in that time I have had 7 Managers. Recently I was moved to a new Team and under a new Manager because a side project I worked on became very important and needed a whole Team around it. My new Manager is very demanding and constantly gives new task and wants everything to be monitored and written down. While I do not like this style of work I have no issues with working  hard or doing a lot. The issue is that I am a lot more knowledgeable about the technical aspects of this project but my Manager does not listen to me. It is like talking to a wall, every time they just make random decisions based on corporate buzz words and when I tell them that something is not technically possible or it will cause issues they do not listen. The past few weeks have turned in to them making a dumb decision, me telling them it is not a good idea, them not listening and then me having to fix the issues linked to that decision. It is extremely exhausting and had turned a job I liked in to something I dread. Every time I hear my manager talk I just want to quit on the spot but quitting is not an option. I have never had this type of issues and I do not really know how to handle them, will I kill my future if I go to their manager and say that I cannot and do not want to work with this person.

1l89e4w,Unemployed for 9 months: should I lie about my current employment status to help find a new job?,"I got fired from my coding job (wordpress, laravel) back in October. Five days after I got fired I got diagnosed with a brain tumor.  In December I had surgery which removed most of it if not all of it, although it's uncertain now whether the whole thing was removed. If there is residual tumor I will likely have to undergo follow up treatment: radiation, chemo, another surgery or a combo of those. 

I got on unemployment in January and it's about to run out. I need to get a new job and I want to get another job as a coder working with React.js. I’ve been coding on and off for 8 years.  The job market is currently tough. Here are my questions: 

1. Should I lie about my current employment status and say that I'm still employed with my previous employer and I don't want hirers to contact them because I don't want them to know I'm leaving?
2. Would lying about my current employment status get me more/better offers?
3. Would prospective employers find out if I lied later in the background check process?
4. Should I not tell my interviewers about my brain tumor?
5. Should I just be honest and tell them I got fired, then got diagnosed with a brain tumor, and I’m working hard to get another job?",Agile-Ad-4698,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1749587168,2025-06-10 20:26:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l89e4w/unemployed_for_9_months_should_i_lie_about_my/,6,2025
1l89976,If you're not building a brand for yourself you're going to get left in the dust,"Hey all, I've seen a lot posts about how the job market (especially for entry level) is getting tighter and tighter with AI becoming more common place. I doubt this trend will reverse, which means we'll likely continue to see 100s of applications or more for even basic entry-mid level jobs moving forward.

In scenarios like that, you have to find ways to stand out. If your credentials aren't significantly better than the 99% of other applicants, the only way to get through the hiring process is to stand out in some other way. This is something people typically learn later in their careers, but I think in this new era it'll be critical for younger professionals to focus on building their personal brands as well.

With that being said, I compiled a few tasks you can start doing asap to lay the groundwork and give yourself a leg up:

1. Update and Simplify Your LinkedIn Profile

* Make sure your headline says what you actually do (not just your job title), your summary is clear and human, and your most recent roles have a sentence or two about what you worked on. Bonus points if you upload a clean, non-blurry photo.

1. DM, text or Email One Old Colleague Per Week with Something Useful
   * Send a link to an article, job post, tool, or even just say “Hey, thought of you when I saw this.” It builds goodwill, reopens dormant connections, and keeps you top of mind. These are the kinds of small actions that lead to opportunities months down the line.
2. Comment on 3 Posts per Week in Your Field
   * Doesn’t matter if it’s Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even Slack groups. Add value to someone else’s post, share an experience, ask a follow-up, or just expand on the topic. It’s low effort, but it creates surface area for people to remember you and associate you with that topic.

Hope this helps!",KarbonCS,0,0.14000000059604645,5,1749586845,2025-06-10 20:20:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l89976/if_youre_not_building_a_brand_for_yourself_youre/,6,2025

1l88uxk,Medicine or engineering?,"I just graduated high school and im facing a big dilemma between choosing engineering and medicine. I know its late but i managed to get into both, an undergraduate medicine program thats 5 years (not in the US so no premed/MCAT) or a masters engineering probram thats also 5 years. But the problem is medicine scares me from how much people say they regret it and stuff, i do enjoy studying biology but thinking about doing 10 hour board exams really scare me. And the fact that doctors generally have very little personal life does scare me. But i do really enjoy the medical setting and caring for patients and feel more “at home” in the hospital, i feel like i can handle the responsibility of peoples lives. But then i also think engineering is a huge bonus as i am very good at math and i have a family buisness i can join and innovate, which would also be fulfilling, but i do think it would be less “me” but at least i would have more of a work life balance.

1l88hjw,Best Career Move?,"So I applied to a bunch of jobs (all governemnet) and im finding myself into a predicament because of I'm weighing pros and cons. 

I just left a district internship that was ending in two months to begin a seasonal position at a different county that  is more relevant to what I want to do, and would extend how much money I make before I reach my last case scenario (which is to rejoin my job training program. Its a fall back I can do for the next year before I age out, but it is part time and does not make enough money.)

Anyways, Ive been at this new job for a month. But I was offered a state position for a permanent job that pays the same, and with the completion of all required trainings, will increase 20k a year. I accepted this offer, but the process is taking a really long time and the person im communicating with hasn't responded much. Im also going to be hired under the pretense of getting my class B license, and if I dont get it within 3 months, then they'll have to let me go. I just got my permit today, and the job will train me to drive class b vehicles, and if I pass then I have the permanent position. 

This is the tricky part. Theres a big chance ill be offered a position at a special district that is closer to my house. Pays 20k more then the highest pay rate at the state job i was offered, but this position is only for one year. The only reason im considering it because 1) they may be a permanent opening soon and the seaonal job will make it easier to get a permanent position,  2) less physically demanding and 3) this is kinda where I wouldn't mind ending my career at eventually. But if they dont have a permanent job after my year there, or I dont get it, I'd have to search for jobs again, which is fine, but the time of year is tricky. This special district also rarely has permanent vacancies.

For stability reasons, I want the permanent job with the state. I would just have to try extra hard to get my class B, and be graceful working in an environment I haven't been in for a year. Its also a supervising position. There's tons of opportunities to get trainings and move up, but work might be more of my life in the meantime. Im just scared on how long the process to get hired is taking. At the seasonal job im at right now, their HR tried to rescind their offer by telling my department that I never communicated/ accepted the job offer even though I signed and sent it confirmation documents months prior. (she was trying to find money to keep another girls job who got cut with all the DOGE budget gutting).  Anyways, this makes me anxious about the state job. He said he needed someone immediately in the interview, and that im being hired in an emergency, but its been a month since that convo. He also doesn't respond to my emails until a few days go by. 

On the other hand, I know im the type to jump for the most amount of moneyy or any shiny position that presents itself to me. So the one year district job is super tempting, but i already told everyone I accepted the state job (including my old program, who knows the people who hired me and work with them. Which adds another layer of obligation, because they emailed everyone and even the director about my job acceptance. And while it was super nice for everyone to be happy for me, it also really makes me feel like im backed into the corner. So if i rescinded my job acceptance, literally everyone in my network would know and i feel like i wouldnt be able to ask for help in the future finding jobs. )

To cut to the chase. Im graduating with a 2.2 in STEM (UK). And I hated every single year of it. I’ve wasted 3 years of my life down the drain and I regret not dropping out in second year because I was told finishing the degree is better than completing it. I would’ve saved my money and did something else. 

So anyways. I was never hoping or even wanting to do anything in my field anyways. But I’m stuck with this degree and there’s barely any options I see available. My career advisor told me to take whatever small SMEs there are. Any entry level and just apply to any. 

The good news however is, there’s still quite a lot of course from my own uni that do accept 2.2 for masters and further. The bad news is, that I’m very hesitant to even trust these courses are even worthwhile taking.

I’m trying to see something very niche with my life science degree, like something that isn’t even at the forefront of my degree but quite distantly related that might not be saturated and lucrative. But there’s barely anything.

I know that I’ve messed up. But I essentially want a way out of it. I want practical advice here, any entry level job in a field that has somewhat leeway for progression further down the years for better pay. 

I want advice that is useful, and constructive criticism. For the past 3 years I’ve been fearing for the worst in my life. I can’t be bothered to live in depression for the rest of my life.

1l886xz,I feel like I ruined my career 1.5 years in,"While my title sounds dramatic, I’m genuinely convinced I already messed up my career path since graduation. 

Very grateful for any opinion. 

I have a degree in data and business analytics (data science), and a masters in digital marketing. 

I got an offer as a big data engineer pivoted to growth marketing at Dell. I was ecstatic because it was a technical role and still had an interesting niche focus on growth. 3 months after saying I was getting an offer written, they cancelled all entry level positions including mine.

I got an unexpected offer as a business data analyst a couple days after. My father insisted I start with any job that accepts me, and while I didn’t like the place or the company much, I felt I had no choice but to accept it.

1.5 years later, I have never been more worried, stressed, and riddled with endless regret and anxiety. This company has no data infrastructure consolidated. No system across countries unified, just me manually copying and pasting sales data monthly from inconsistent excel files. I don’t have a data or technical team or lead to learn analytics/science/ML stuff from.  It’s just me putting together several “datasets” locally from terrible files spread across the company. I’ve created some dashboards, but none are finalized from the lack of quality and full data and centralized objectives.

I feel like an absolute fraud, with all my technical skills behind more than ever from my first 9-5 going to miserable shit. I know my domain knowledge very well, mathematics is a hobby, but I’m putting 8 hours everyday into a job I cannot actually grow in nor am I using anything else put excel and PowerBI. I’ve experimented some EDA and clustering algorithms offline, but it’s not the priority at the moment and once again no infrastructure or team to help guide me on long term deployments on any of my attempts on the side.

I feel so terrible. I graduated with a guy I have feelings for who’s now an AI engineer and I’m just doing this shit. He probably thought I was some stupid generic girl getting a masters in digital marketing. I did it for a wide range of reasons and any offer I’ve had mentioned it was a plus including the engineering role at Dell. But now, looking at jobs today, not only do I feel ridiculous with so little jobs I can apply for or are available, but I’m so worried I actually messed up my career path.

I admit I’m not sure what I should be doing exactly. AI engineering sounds fancy but I get afraid I’d be just another cog in the machine, and a more zoomed out analytics role might be just generic and not competitive or flashy. This is a reason I also chose my masters, to add 10 months of another realm and open up some more integrated roles. 

But somehow I feel stupid, uncompetitive, and now more than ever with my job today, embarrassed and insecure it’ll stay this way for a long time. 

I don’t know what to think. I can plan to build some projects and certificates and stuff but it feels like nothing compared to so many technical applicants. I am just so beyond embarrassed I ended up nowhere.

1l87sn5,"Should I accept a job offer from a competitor, and how do I gracefully exit my current company?","Hello everyone,

I'm facing a difficult decision and would appreciate some advice. I work at a company that owns multiple businesses, each with a different purpose, but with the same people working in it (especially me, lol). Currently, I’m wearing many hats—I work as a full-stack developer, handle support, product creation (I built our flagship product), sysadmin (managing emails, domains, websites, and all that stuff), and also do administrative work like managing costs, spreadsheets, and overseeing all tech services like CCTV, networks, etc.

Recently, I received an offer from a competitor that is very tempting: A 5k BRL salary, which is higher than my current 3k BRL salary. The role would be strictly focused on front-end development, meaning I'd be able to dedicate all my time to that aspect and avoid juggling multiple responsibilities.

Now, to give you some context, my current company and this possible new employer have a bit of a complicated history. My boss and the owner of the competitor have always been very close friends.   
They used to work together with a shared vision of selling a software system developed by the competitor's company. My boss’s company essentially resold this system and provided support through me, at least in the beginning.

Eventually, the partnership between my boss and the competitor’s owner started to unravel because of some technical issues with the system that made it unfit for their customers. This led to a major fallout, and the companies even came close to legal disputes. After this, they completely stopped working together, and while there were attempts to resolve things, the relationship remained fractured and they never fully reconciled.

During this time, I was building my skills and took over the responsibility of managing and supporting the software. Eventually, I created a new system that mirrored the functionality of the competitor’s system but was much more stable and reliable. This new system led to the creation of my boss’s own company, which resold the software I developed while providing support for clients—something I was responsible for.

After a series of trials and tribulations, I helped my boss establish the company and get things off the ground, but now the situation has changed. Despite the good things, I feel like my mission here is complete. The company is in a rough spot, and I’m juggling too many things at once across several businesses. I’m responsible for far too many aspects of the company, and as a result, I can’t focus on anything long enough to excel at it. I can't help but feel like a ""jack of all trades, but master of none.""

On top of that, things have gotten more complicated. My boss’s son, who used to be just another employee, was promoted to a management role. Ever since then, things have gotten pretty challenging. He sets unrealistic deadlines and doesn’t contribute much—he’s often seen sitting at his desk watching TikToks while everyone else is overworked.  
We’ve asked for more help, and we even suggested moving him back to his original role, but this upset both father and son.

My team is burned out. We’re constantly overwhelmed, and despite asking for help, nothing changes. Everyone, including myself, is looking for new opportunities because we can’t continue at this pace.

Despite my gratitude toward my boss, I feel like my mission here is complete. I’ve helped build this company from the ground up, and although I’m not irreplaceable, I’ve contributed a lot to making it a solid and functional environment. But in return, I’ve sacrificed my work-life balance, worked from 7am to 10pm on many, many days, and it’s taken a toll on my personal life.  
My last relationship ended because of the stress and lack of time for myself. My boss promotes the idea of working as if it’s our own business, but it’s been a constant sacrifice without much in return.

Now, I feel like it's time to move on. I’ve given my best, and I want the company to continue to thrive without me, but I need new challenges and a better work-life balance.   
The whole team is unhappy, and everyone is searching for new opportunities.

I would love to hear your advice: Should I accept the offer from the competitor, knowing that the companies are interconnected? How do I communicate my departure from my current company in a respectful and professional way, considering all the good things my boss has done for me? How do I ensure that I leave on good terms while also making this change for my own well-being?

1l87epg,How to professionally address getting fired to ex-coworkers and future employers?,"Background: I (29f) worked in admin at the same small firm as my mother for 3 1/2 years. Management is a complete mess. Made a lot of major mistakes and they lied about it to the whole company, intentionally pit employees against each other to cover it up. Never took accountability.

We had a mentor system (like a middle manager but smaller scale) and my incompetent mentor completely screwed me over repeatedly. Miscommunicated (or didn't communicate) repeatedly to management. Miscommucmicated about a raise. Constant roadblocks to productivity. Overall very unprofessional. Called me crying late one night about personal issues, ect. 

Things got so much better when things shifted and I started reporting to COO directly. COO immediately realized the mentor was an issue. CEO is a stubborn prick who refused to see that I wasn't the problem. So much misconduct there. CEO outright insulted me, repeatedly gave conflicting direction, gave no direction, was passive aggressive, or outright aggressive. Everyone has an issue with him. My mom has been applying to other jobs because of it as well.

Last week, COO is out on vacation and CEO decides I've lied to him, no logic or proof. No investigation. He fired me. I'd fight, but I'm fed up with him anyway. Though I loved just about everything else. I got a severance package. COO clearly feels stuck in these situations and sides with CEO, lies for him, ect. 

CEO and COO are basically asking my mom to address my leaving on the staff call tomorrow. They put out a vague email about me no longer working there and that they wish me all the best in my future endeavors. 

I like some of my other coworkers a lot and would like to maintain a professional relationship, get references, future opportunities to network, ect. Management asked me what I want people to know or not know when they let me go and I didn't have an answer. Advice on what should be said tomorrow and when I potentially reach out asking for references? I don't think they will add additional info or correct my mom.

How do I professionally phrase the somewhat mutual decision to part ways to potential employers during interviews?

(I promise I'm not blaming and not taking accountability. It's legit a shit show and I swallowed a lot of crap. I can give additional examples or context if needed.)

I have worked so much in vet med and I think I’d like being a veterinarian because I was always passionate about it although there are a lot of downsides to vet med as well like having to constantly discuss money with clients, less pay, and bad hours if you go into rural/ ER vet med (which is what I would like to do). On the other hand I did my med application on a whim not thinking I’d get in. I used to want to be a doctor until I decided I would never have a shot. Human doctors seem to make more money, although is hard to find accurate info on how much vets and family doctors actually make in Canada. Being a doctor would also open more doors and hopefully I would find something I really like in human medicine. I have never worked in human medicine (or even met a human doctor before lol) so I have no idea what the human medicine industry is like. Overall I am just very grateful I got into both and was not expecting it at all and this was not meant to be complaining, I just genuinely don’t know what to do. Does anybody have experience with this or more thoughts?",Careful_Image_1028,1,1.0,1,1749580727,2025-06-10 18:38:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l86mkv/human_med_or_vet_med/,6,2025
1l86kbh,Am I being fired?,"I have worked at a company for almost 2 years in a senior role at smaller company with about \~100 employees. I've generally had good performance, never been reprimanded or written up on a PiP. I have anxious feeling that I will be laid off this week. 

  
A few things are pointing me to this conclusion:

  
1. On my last one on one, my boss asked me to transfer admin account credentials for a demo environment to one of two contractors. When I asked what is the reason, he said ""the developer might be working on a customization that we can sell to other clients"". I had a call with the developer and he said he didnt speak to the manager about this and doesnt know about it.

  
2. On the same call, he asked me to get information from vendor for a sales opportunity. He asked me to CC him which was not common practice for me. When I asked why, he said ""I dont want you to be the bottleneck"". In my head, I thought ""why would I be the bottle neck?"" this is part of my job.

  
3. In the last few weeks, he and the account exec left out of some sales calls which is in my practice. Usually I am always on the calls.

  
4. As part of my employment agreement, I have the opportunity to earn a 20K bonus if I hit my sales targets. Before I signed the employment agreement, I asked them to define the criteria/terms for how i can earn the bonus. My would-be manager at the time said, we are still formulating it and we will get it to you in a few weeks. Meanwhile, it was a 6 months (in my first year) before they provided me such criteria and the conditions changed compared to what aspects of my bonus he told me would be counted towards my bonus. I did not get my bonus the first year. This year, my sales has increased significantly, yet we are 10 months into the fiscal year and they still have not provided me any bonus metrics criteria. During the first few months of the year I would ask my boss weekly when this performance metrics/bonus criteria would be available and he kept saying he doesnt know/no one get them yet. Finally, on my last one on one, I took the liberty of providing a framework for what these criteria could be. I created a PPT and everything and my boss basically said nothing after i provided the short ppt. I think they know this year I would qualify for my bonus (based on figures from last year) and they want to let me go before the fiscal year is over. My employment agreement notes it as a ""bonus"" and that I have to be employed during that time to actually receive it. 

  
5. 6 account executives quit in the last 6 months (4 this month). I feel like they know something I don't. This is not my title but I do work with them.

  
My boss moved my typical re-occuring weekly one on one meeting with him from Thursday to Friday morning. I never had  this type of meeting with him in the morning. He's moved the one on one before but typically to the afternoon of the next day. 

  
I have 3 paid sick days left, I am thinking of taking them for the rest of the week and make them to reschedule this one on one to Monday so I can get as many paid days as I can.

  
Anyways any advice or comments you guys have would be appreciated, I am really anxious, I have been let go before a few times so I kind of see the writing on the wall.",Beneficial-Fox1360,1,1.0,4,1749580583,2025-06-10 18:36:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l86kbh/am_i_being_fired/,6,2025

I worked and studied in different countries, I am Italian, and currently in Ireland.
I have experiences in different fields, but not even close to what I want for my future. In my original country, job is a way to make money to pay the roof. Here I also learnt how to save and enjoy my life, even with a bad work-life balance.
I am a writer with few pubblications in Italy, I studied languages, tourism, and I am very creative. I find marketing exciting so I am doing some extra courses, some University subjects (such as pragmatics and text analysis) are good in communication, persuasive text etc.

1l86d2y,"Applied for a promotion, managers discussing external candidates in front of me","I recently applied for a promotion, I have been encouraged to by colleagues and managers (even nominated for a ‘rising star’ award by my manager) and I would also like this job. 

Today, my managers received all of the applications from HR are were discussing them in detail right next to me. Occasionally they would whisper (I assume when talking about me) and this left me feeling quite stressed. 

Everything they said I was comparing to myself. For example they discussed how many applications did not use examples to back up their points, they talked about how they think one applicant used AI. 

Worst of all they discussed how good other candidates were. One called my manager in the day asking about the timeline for hearing back and my manager informally told her she would definitely have an interview. After the call she said “I probably shouldn’t have done that, but she is already a [job role] and I didn’t want to lose her”. My heart sank when I heard this! 

They’ve discussed another candidate who was overqualified but they would definitely interview him. Another candidate was mentioned who worked in a profession very close to the job role I have applied for. 

I feel so frustrated because all of this happened literally right next to me and they acted as if I was not there. They never even spoke to me about my application when it was quite clear I heard everything. 

I will find out tomorrow if I have been shortlisted for an interview. I don’t have much hope but even if I get one, the other candidates all sound much more qualified than me. This has left me feeling that my performance in the interview process will be worse as I have little hope that I will actually succeed compared to others moving down or sideways in their careers. 

I’m so frustrated that this all happened in front of me. I think it’s extremely inconsiderate and unprofessional. 

I suppose I want to know how you would proceed in this situation if you got an interview. 

TLDR; my managers discussed other candidates who seem more qualified for a position that I applied for in front of me. This  has left me feeling hopeless in succeeding.

1l85y1x,Thinking of switching mid‑PhD into patent law (Canada),"Hey everyone 👋

[Canadian]: I’m currently a few months into a PhD in ECE (sort of prestigious program), but I’m seriously considering switching into patent law (got into law school in ontario). I want a career that gives me balance for the next 10 years (while starting a family) and long-term rewards down the road—but I’m not sure the PhD path checks those boxes.

A bit of context:
	•	Background: engineering undergrad  (dual major)
	•	About 4 years left on the PhD program
	•	Goal: stable, fulfilling work while raising kids → then solid financial upside mid-career

Here’s what I’m weighing:

Option A – Finish the PhD → R&D or academia
• Could lead to roles in industry or teaching 
• But it’s a long haul, unpredictable job market, and tough early years


Option B – Pivot now → Law school → patent law
• Potential to start earning right away?
• Good work-life balance (remote options, flexible hours, family benefits)
• With time and client base, likely able to move into private practice/lawyer roles?

Questions I’d greatly appreciate insight on:
	1.	Has anyone left a PhD early to go into patent exams or law? How did you manage the transition?
	2.	For patent examiners/agents/lawyers—what really balances lifestyle and career growth? Is there a significant demand in Canada? 
	3.	Is it realistic in Canada to build a satisfying patent-focused career with good income and balance, without burning out?
	4.	For those in R&D or academia—I’d love to hear if you feel the PhD route has been worth the effort.

1l850ao,I think I am too Young and Dumb for my own good.,"Good evening Reddit✋🏼, I (20F) am from India and I am pursuing my Bachelors in History (with Honours)from a well known college affliated with a renowned State Central University ( I am selling it so that you know I am very capable). I will come to my problem but please bare with me I have a habbit of rambling about alot while giving context to my questions and problems.
I don't like reading, I know I like stories and I like learning and knowing things but I do not know the exact reason behind by dislike of reading (a major problem if you are a History student). My grades are average (as in I will be able to keep my honours tag), I have virtually no financial troubles, I have no major health issues, I have great friends and a good life.
Yet my life feels like borrowed time, I do not have major passions regarding anything, no committed interests ( I like a little bit of anything and everything), I am not the best or most responsible and I have been told I am quite emotional ( I turn into a huge fighter cock when the Profs at my college or other students try to 'one-up' or bully my friends, might sound sweet but I think I worsen the situation). I had a talk with my mom today and she told me something that I think I needee to hear 'History isn't for me' true; I can't be drab in a career that needs you to love literature and find colours in spreading your critical scrutiny of what would have happened. A good prof finds History as a puzzle, they love and live to solve all the books they can to share and grow with their students... unfortuanetly that isn't me. 

Yet I have a weird quality, I do stand out alot. I am well known in college, I have participated and done well in a lot of the plays and Drama activites my college has prescribed along with that I do have a friendly personality so people like me a lot. I am quite funny as well (apperance wise and with my words). I quite loud, as in my voice booms and it reaches across the hall. I have been described a cool by a few people. 

So I am writing this because I understand what my mom is saying, I know I shouldn't go and pursue a masters in History but I do not know what else to do. I have anxiety and I freeze up quick as well in front of people, I do not want to live a life as a travel vlogger or a Food Content creator or a Resturant Manager ( NO HATE THESE ARE GREAT JOBS, I do not know if I am cut since I do get bored easily and maybe I do not  bring something new to the table that isn't already there...perhaps rotting). I am not academically very strong and nor do I want to leave my country, India has limited options and a very tight job market. I love my parents and even if not near them ( I do wish to not live with them by my mid 20s), I want to be atleast an 7-8hour train ride away from them. I want to earn well enough to sustain myself, I do not want to depend on anyone ever and I want to be secure in my career. I do not get what my mother means by ' you are the type of person to live a colourful life', that comes with passion that I lack. I am very very confused and scared. Please do advice me as it suits you or your understanding of this post. Thank You.

TLDR: 20 F BA History Honours student is confused because books are tough and she is a very shinny person with no path and only 2 goals: Earn money to be independent and have a Job that is secure. In comes a mother who thinks her child should lead a happy colourful life but spoilers a lot of soul fullfilling jobs have almost no money like Circus Acrobat ( that sounds very fun). So 20F is very confused 7 days before her last final exam.

1l84sm1,"Need Advice: Burnt Out in Sales, Considering Lower Paying Remote Role – What Would You Do?","
I graduated from college with a business degree about a year ago and landed a job in sales at a well-known financial company. I’m currently making around $70–80k, but it’s all outbound cold leads — over 80 calls a day — and I’m feeling incredibly burnt out. Most of my team is experienced and male, and I’ve been struggling to stay motivated. Even just going into the office is getting hard.

Now I’ve been offered a role at another company that’s fully remote. It’s still sales, but it would be inbound web leads and warm outbound — about 40–50 calls a day. It’s a totally different industry, and while I’d be talking more on each call, the workload feels more sustainable. The catch is that hitting 100% of goal there would mean earning about $60k.

I’m torn. On one hand, I feel lucky to be at my current company — it has a great name and reputation, and I know there’s potential to move internally if I stick it out for 8 more months but I am also about to get put on a PIP this month for missing goal three months in a row. On the other hand, I’m miserable, drained, and not sure I can keep this pace up. The new role is remote, more balanced, and could give me room to breathe, but it’s a pay cut and a risk.

Would love any advice — especially from people who’ve faced something similar. Is it worth staying for the brand and money, or should I prioritize my sanity and switch to something more manageable?",NoKaleidoscope9801,3,1.0,4,1749576574,2025-06-10 17:29:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l84sm1/need_advice_burnt_out_in_sales_considering_lower/,6,2025

1l84n7f,Education Suggestions for Business with a Focus in Hospitality?,"Hello, all. I want to get into the Hospitality industry — particularly, I am interested lodgings… such as hotels, inns, and B&Bs. I am a rather empathic, organized person who really enjoys helping people, and I think the industry could be a really good fit for me. However, I have little experience in hospitality, business management, tourism, et cetera. I’ve been considering going back to college to pursue some educational expertise in the field. A college near me offers an associate’s degree in Hospitality and Tourism; but, I would want to get my bachelor’s, which I figure would be best suited to Business Management.

I was previously a Computer Science student, but I paused my education a few years ago to focus on my health. I wasn’t passionate about Comp Sci, but I managed to get an overall GPA of 3.7 — it was 3.9 until my health took a nosedive. Regarding the aforementioned ‘health,’ I am now in a position to continue pursuing school / work safely and effectively. 

For those of you who have been successful in the realm of Hospitality and Business, what advice might you have? Any schools you might suggest? I know Cornell’s Hospitality Administration program is unparalleled, but I’m not sure I’m cut out for Ivy League, especially considering the bumps in my college career… even though they were due to health issues. I haven’t started digging too deep into colleges, as I am not entirely sure where to start. The college advisor I spoke to at my local college suggested a few Business programs at some in-state, public schools… but I don’t know how they fare in terms of status. What I mean to say is, if I am going to pursue a degree in Business with a focus on Hospitality, I want to be a part of a school whose name will hold weight in the industry.

1l83ser,How to navigate travel pay?,"Hi! I'm a carpenter in Ontario Canada. I work for a private company that does framing. I'm paid hourly.

Occasionally the company takes on jobs working far away enough that commuting to the site isn't feasible (2-4 hours away). When this happens, there will be a place to stay with food provided. You're paid only when you're actively working on the site. The rest of the time (including travel) is unpaid.

They ask people if they'd like to go but there is an unspoken pressure to go a for at least a few days, if not a week or two. If you don't, there is no serious repercussion but I can tell that the boss doesn't appreciate it and views the move as ""not being a team player"" or ""commited to the company"" and thus, I imagine, not a good candidate for pay raises or promotion/ leadership roles.

Is this standard practice in the industry? Should I advocate for some sort of additional compensation ? If so, what would be a reasonable request ?

1l81wha,Need advice on choosing careers 16M,"Now I'd like to start of with saying that I don't want to go into medical fields which sounds like a bad choice considering every other post said it was a decent field to get into but I don't want to have anyone's life in my hands.

Secondly, the current career I'm interested in is computer science. I like programming but I'm alarmed like every other person who is doing is or interested in it. 

Additionally, I have no idea what field I'd like to go into. I tried looking and neural networks and machine learning and it was really interesting but at the time I didn't know the maths nor had the coding experience for it.

I have what is the equivalent to GCSE 9s in chemistry, physics, biology, IT, additional maths and maths.

I'm going to start a levels later this year and I have to choose subjects and I am panicking.

I've also been discussing the possibility of automation with my friend since it mixes engineering and programming and might be a safer choice?

But I need to know because I'm not sure if I have to do chemistry at the A level to have a chance of going into the field or sticking with my current selection of, pure, cs, IT, physics will be fine.

1l81ubs,I hate my job. Like really hate it. What should I do? (high profile recruitment and onboarding),"I’m currently a recruiter for high-profile opportunities. I do not work in HR nor is that my background. I actually had a really satisfying career that I obtained two degrees in, however, the nature and hours of that career did not align with my family’s needs, so I decided to pursue something else and landed in this recruitment role. 

The thing is, I don’t just recruit people - I plan out their multilevel interviews with an over abundance of people/executive leaders, many whom critique my every step (make sure you
Book a 5 star restaurant for dinner, you should be waiting for them at the airport with balloons/flowers, you should answer any calls or texts from candidates day/night/weekends). 

My team is small. There are 3 of us, yet I somehow got the largest volume of opportunities I’m responsible for: 70 openings. The other two people are responsible for less than 20 each. They do not front-face candidates like I do. They do not prepare reports, they do not provide onboarding services like I do, but they both are *excellent* at making themselves look like these incredibly hard working, overachievers while I am consistently missing deadlines and project details because I’m so overwhelmed. I received over 100 emails a day. I am expected to respond within a few hours, even when on vacation. 

There is zero work/life balance and let’s be honest here…hand-holding some white collared professionals is annoying AF to me. I’m not changing the world by being the pretty-face of the corporation. I’m so much more educated and knowledgeable (outside of this corporate BS) but I’m treated like crap from some of the leadership. 

I have repeatedly asked the persons I report to to please redistribute the workload immediately. Nothing has changed. 

Btw I make $100k a year to hate what I do, be taken advantage of, unappreciated, and constantly criticized for things out of my control. The only positives of my job are that I do have flexibility in some of my schedule and the potential new hires always give me positive reviews on their experiences with me. 

What the hell do I do? I have several college degrees that are only applicable to my previous career. I don’t want to climb that corporate ladder. And my two partners are willing to do *anything* to look like heroes….except actual work.

1l81i2l,Just Getting Started with Computers & Microsoft 365 – Feeling Lost but Motivated! What should I do to improve my future?,"Hey everyone,

I’m new to this group and really appreciate any help you can offer. I’m feeling a bit lost and overwhelmed, and I could use some guidance as I try to build a better future for myself and my family.

Here’s a little about me: I moved to the U.S. from India when I was 15. I don’t have any formal background in computers or tech skills. At 21, I joined the Air National Guard, where I’ve worked in lodging, and I currently also work as a Correctional Officer. I’ve used Microsoft 365 at work (mostly Teams, Outlook, Word, and PowerPoint), but I know I have a long way to go to truly understand and use it confidently.

I’m 29 now and going back to school. I have about 60 college credits and am deciding between majoring in Computer Science or Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics, as those are the options offered at my state college in Massachusetts.

I really need help getting started with basic computer skills, especially Microsoft 365. If anyone knows of free beginner-friendly courses (especially those that explain things step-by-step), I would be so grateful. I want to build a solid foundation and eventually feel comfortable in the tech world.

I genuinely love math and want to use education to create a better life — not just for myself, but for my family. I’d love to become the first in my family to earn a degree.

Thanks so much in advance. Any advice, resources, or words of encouragement would mean a lot!",DramaticJacket4923,1,1.0,0,1749568886,2025-06-10 15:21:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l81i2l/just_getting_started_with_computers_microsoft_365/,6,2025

I’ve worked with creative arts, financial, and fitness industries before, but…

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

* 500+ job applications on LinkedIn, Naukri, Indeed, and official websites.
* Daily outreach for freelance work, 10-20 hyper-personalized 
* Gave 3 interviews and written sample work, but got no feedback or replies
* 0 referrals 

With the hype of AI and the entrepreneurship job market is very dry. Zero opportunity, even individuals more skillful than I are struggling to get work.

4+ years of experience in design and creative video production 

3+ years of experience in direct response marketing (ads, sales letter, sales email

My Ask:

If you’re a health (fitness, yoga, weight loss, etc.) coach, financial coach/publisher, or you have a program/course that you want to sell/struggling to get sales…I can help you launch/scale/promote your product.

If you’re in an advertising/copywriting agency, a referral could be a glass of water to a man in the desert.

1l7yxx7,"Changing career path at 29: Resumption of finance studies while working, possible?","Hello everyone,

I am almost 29 years old, and I completed a BTS in building (bac+2). Until recently, I worked in a design office where I earned a little over €1750/month, which was not enough for me. For 2 years, I have been working in Switzerland, right on the border, in a rather nice job, without too many responsibilities, but it is not an exciting job. I earn around €4,300 net per month.

I'm a dad, I live with my wife, we bought our apartment, and I'm investing quite a bit. Now, I would like to resume my studies without stopping working. Over time, I realize that I am very passionate about finance, maybe wealth management or another area in finance, but I don't know exactly what yet.

Is it possible to change paths and do everything remotely? Can I resume studies from the bac+2 level, even if it is not in the same sector?

1l7y5af,26M feeling lost. Where do I go from here?,"I'm a 26 year old male with over 3 years of experience in clinical research as a research coordinator. The majority of my experience was gained in my hometown in western NY. I recently moved to NYC in April, and in doing so took another research coordinator position. Looking back this might not have been a smart move, since I ultimately do not like working in research. The only reason I accepted the offer was because it allowed me to relocate. I knew research wasn't for me and that it isn't my long term career. But I was feeling very bored in my hometown and wanted a bigger city with a change of scenery. So far I'm loving NYC, but absolutely hating my job.

There are multiple problems I am having with the job, which I will try to outline to the best of my ability. I am still in the training/onboarding period, but from the work I've done so far I can say with total certainty that this is not the job for me. I am the complete wrong fit. First, this current position requires way more medical knowledge/background than what I have. I feel like I would need to be a nurse to fully understand things. Also, the studies I am learning are much more complex and fast-paced than the studies I am used to working on. I'm just feeling so overwhelmed already. I also don't like the setting-it's dealing with inpatient procedures and I am used to working with healthy volunteers. It's unfortunate, but I am really dreading the progression I will make in this position. I am fearful for when I get fully onboarded and will be expected to lead these research studies. I know for a fact that I won't be able to keep up with the pace and will struggle with the complexity from the moment I begin as a study lead. Every day I wake up I dread going in to work. And my weekends are spent counting down the minutes of ""freedom"" I have left until I have to go back to work on Monday. I feel like this isn't very healthy for me mentally.

So, this is why I know that I need to make a change ASAP. But my issue is that I am feeling completely lost with no sort of guidance or tangible direction. I graduated college with a bachelors in biology and minor in psychology, but didn't have a career direction then either. I got into research on a whim, I guess. It was what I found as soon as I graduated, and I stuck with it just to gain some sort of professional experience.

I've done a bit of research and have some ideas that might be of interest for me. I'll list them out here:

Account Manager, Product Manager, Project Manager, Customer Success Manager, SDR/BDR (tech sales, medical device sales, or pharmaceutical sales). And I like the idea of working for a startup. I also think the general fields of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, marketing, cybersecurity, and entomology could be cool too. I think my long term goal would be to work in tech, potentially doing something like data analytics.

I am open to furthering my education, I just don't know what I would want to go for. I would hate to get a masters in something that I would end up not using. Definitely open to and interested in any certifications or courses as well. 

A last resort would be quitting this current job without anything else lined up. I know this isn't optimal, but with the way I dread going to work I feel this is a legitimate option. I do have enough savings to cover 12+ months of living expenses without having to move or change my lifestyle.

So this is where I ask for guidance and advice. Based on my education, work experience, and ideas, what are some next steps I could take? Are there any roles that I haven't mentioned that I may be unaware of and a good fit for? At this point, I am open to exploring anything! Apologies for the long post, but if you've made it this far thank you for your time and for any feedback you may have.",skd29_,1,1.0,1,1749560499,2025-06-10 13:01:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7y5af/26m_feeling_lost_where_do_i_go_from_here/,6,2025

1l7wj2k,I don't understand the game,"I don't understand the game
Hi everyone, M27, recent computer science master's graduate. I recently landed a permanent position at a small company in Northern Italy (45 employees) that develops software for the manufacturing sector.

We're approaching the three-month mark and I was hoping what I thought was just a first-job impression wouldn't turn out to be reality... but here we are. I'm doing absolutely nothing. My mentor manages to check in with me maybe twice a week, otherwise I have no tasks and just sit in the office staring at my monitor.

I've started creating documentation for posterity, since the company - despite being active since 2007 - doesn't have a shred of documentation about their software or workflows. The only existing docs are sporadic and incomplete, started by who knows who before me. The code has no comments, so even if I wanted to study it, it would be a massive undertaking and probably wasted time.

Months pass, I see my bank account growing, but I don't understand why. I'm not producing anything and nobody seems to care.

I'd love to ask my colleagues questions but I wouldn't know what to ask, especially since everyone handles something very specific.

Everything I learned about cybersecurity vanished in the first week: passwords shared via Gmail, client VPN credentials saved in text files...

I spend my days waiting for 5:30 PM and thinking about how I started with so much enthusiasm and drive. I don't know if this is normal and I'm the one doing something wrong, but almost three months of learning little to nothing seems like too much.

I don't know whether to start looking elsewhere or stick to the process and see how it goes. The colleagues are nice and the environment isn't bad, but I feel completely useless and unproductive, plus I'm not learning anything.

Any advice?

1l7ugm4,Switching careers from high-tech to...?,"Hi. I am 30F with a PhD in Physics, but working in software engineering for 7 years. In current situation I cannot find a job in academia, though I want it soooo bad. Important to add that I am autistic with ADHD.

Some say it is easier to find a position with a PhD, but in my experience it gives no advantage (once it was even a disadvantage, I was rejected because of having the degree). Since leaving my terrible previous place I have been looking for a new ""opportunity"", as recruiters call it, for months and months. The market is insane right now. Through a friend I have found a new place, but it is temporary. And honestly, I feel like I am DONE with software engineering. It is fun, yes, but the work processes in development are so annoying. I can plan for myself, organize a structure, but on numerous occasions I was asked to be ""more proactive"" only to be scolded afterwards for doing it ""wrong"". I feel STUPID. Sometimes the list of tasks is so vague I feel lost and can't do anything. Etc, etc, fellow SW people know what I am talking about.

I just want something where I can give my mind a little rest. I am relatively good withstanding stress and pressure, even under harsh criticism.

1l7toa7,"Passed Over for Promotion, Now Being Offered the Role After Colleague Quits — WWYD?","I’ve been at my company for 3 years and 4 months. A few months ago, after a leadership reshuffle, I was moved from one team to a newly created Data team.

When this team was formed, I expected to be promoted to Senior Manager to lead it — but instead, they gave the role to a colleague who had only been with the company for around 2.5 years. I was pretty disappointed, especially after leadership gave me vague reasons for the decision.

Since then, things have gone downhill. Around 8–9 people have quit in the last two months, including the person who was promoted over me.

Now, the VP who originally passed me over has come to me asking if I’ll take up the Senior Manager role. It will come with a 20% salary increase and a lot of added responsibilities.

The thing is: I’ve already made up my mind to resign by the end of July 2025. I want to take a break, reset, and start my own business.

So now I’m torn. Do I:

1. Decline and stick to my exit plan?
2. Take the promotion and hike, then leave anyway in a month and a half?
3. Negotiate harder and use this as leverage, even if I still plan to leave?

1l7tj2n,Should I add my work experience of 2-3 months in my CV after a career break?,"Hi everyone, I am in quite a difficult situation here.

I worked for 3.5 years as a lawyer before taking a 1 year break (to travel, explore my hobbies and to recover from burnout). I got a role at another firm in April (doing other practice areas of law, but still practicing) and moved to my current firm because the salary offered was better. But now I have come to the realisation that I might not want to practice law anymore. The long hours, lack of boundaries of bosses and clients and the intensity is making my mental health suffer.

I am currently exploring other career options after speaking to seniors from school and other friends, but I don't know if I should put my present work experience in my CV for job applications. On one hand, the job hopping might seem like a red flag, on the other, a long break on my CV being unemployed is not a great look.

Would like some advice regarding whether to include my current 2-3 month work experience in my CV, or how I should explain my long break away from work of 15-18 months (I am not married, don't have kids to care for, and did not further my studies or seek other qualifications during my period of unemployment).

1l7timr,Did my manager block my internal transfer?,"I am currently a night shift worker in a healthcare position at a hospital. I have a 2 year contract to work at my hospital because I did my clinical rotations here when I was a student. It has been 1 year already, and I am looking to leave night shift but still stay within the organization to comply with my contract. 

I’ve applied to other positions within the organization, and I notified my current manager that I would be applying but she never got back to me about it. The thing is, I’m sure that the hiring manager of the new position would have contacted my current manager to ask about me. They have done this for previous employees who have transferred. However, the hiring manager reached out to me a few days after my interview and told me they’ve already filled the position. It has been 2 weeks and the job listing is still open to the public, so I’m wondering if they really filled the position or if my current manager blocked the move. If she did, wouldn’t she at least speak to me about it and try to address my reasons for the move, or at least acknowledge it but explain why they can’t let me go at the moment? I know it’s easy to forget about night shifters because they don’t see us, but if she had the time to speak with the other manager then she should have enough time to speak to me too. If she told me she couldn’t let me go until she filled my position, which I know is hard because it’s nights, then I would have understood. I am planning to ask her to have an in person meeting but she rarely comes in during my shift, only 1-2 times a year. 

A couple notes: 

* the job listings are usually taken down immediately at our hospital when someone accepts an offer. But this one is still up. 
* The position I applied for is at a smaller branch with significantly less patients and volume. I would have had more experience coming from the bigger hospital, and I’m an internal candidate so I thought I would’ve had a good chance of getting the position. Maybe there was a better candidate, but I’ve been working for the organization for 5 years, albeit having different positions, but all within the same department. I also know there were no other internal candidates. 
* I am not a nurse, so there are not influxes of applicants for night shift positions. 
* How legitimate is my contract if HR is not aware of it? It looks like it was just a departmental thing and was not submitted anywhere officially. I spoke to HR about it once and they had no idea it existed. I’m thinking about just leaving the organization outright since I don’t want to do nights anymore. ",Background-Archer271,1,1.0,1,1749544335,2025-06-10 08:32:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7timr/did_my_manager_block_my_internal_transfer/,6,2025

The jobs I’m applying for are remote or hybrid jobs in clinical informatics fields, although I’ve recently started branching out into applying for any data analytics roles I can find as well. I feel reasonably qualified for what I’m applying to and I put desired salary at the low end of the posted range. 

The problem here is that I haven’t heard anything at all from anyone. I’ve gotten 3 rejection emails out of over 100 applications and outside of that it’s radio silence. 

My degree is in biology (planned on medical school but changed my mind due to numbers not panning out), but I got a data analyst job working clinical informatics after college. Been working there for 3 years now, but my role is being eliminated in December, so now I need to find something else before I’m unemployed. 

My big question is do I keep trying for tech or do I shift somewhere completely different? I’d prefer to avoid going back to school, I have a family and a mortgage, so it’s not super simple to 100% start over. I’ve attached my resume below for more info.

1l7p178,What would you do?,"Hello all. 

I, 24F, have a Bachelors degree and almost two years of banking experience after making the switch from healthcare. I work at a small-midsize bank, and started as an assistant. I recently became a manager “candidate”, and I learned I absolutely hate sales and networking. I much prefer my reports and helping in the branch. I also realized that I do not have great managerial skills and am struggling with my very limited employees, as I am learning my new job as well as training my own assistant, whom does not seem to be very self-motivated. 

I am getting to the point I am unable to sleep at night because I am so anxious about my job and getting fired in this job market. I still make it to work and keep trying my best(I do any and all tasks requested and expected of me), but my mental and physical health are struggling. I’m exhausted and irritable constantly.

Because I’ve been so stressed, I don’t feel like I can keep trying to lose weight/be healthier and do school and work 43-50 hours a week. It’s just too much. 

Now onto the decision. I really want to work remotely and learn to get into the tech industry.  I want to learn and hone in on a skill, but I have no clue how to begin. 

I live with my Dad, and he says he’s okay with me cutting back on my savings plan so I can get a certificate in something that will make me more money while working part time. However, I just feel like a failure at 24, living with my parent, and only working part time for an uncertain timeline. 

So, should I stick with my job and keep applying to other jobs (I’ve been applying for a year without a single interview and constant resume updates), or should I find a decently paying part time job so I can learn something new in tech ? 

TIA and hopefully I don’t sound entitled/spoiled/anything. I don’t expect much, right now I’m working way too hard as a manager for less than $45k a year. It’s terrible. 
If the pay was better or if the job was less stressful, I’d like to think I’d be a little more forgiving but $45k in the area I’m in barely gets a room, much less the freedom to move to a safer state (I’m lgbtq+ in a VERY red state).

1l7p0yo,How one skillset changed the trajectory of my career (even with a liberal arts degree),"  
Quite a few years ago, before LinkedIn was flooded with AI-generated advice and everyone had a certification for everything, I was just trying to figure out how to stand out. I had a liberal arts degree, a solid work ethic, and decent experience, but I didn’t have anything tangible that made me competitive in operations or strategy roles.

That’s when I stumbled into Lean Six Sigma. A methodology focused on helping organizations cut waste and improve efficiency, by deliver better services/products and improving customer satisfaction. I felt that it was a great compliment to the soft skills I learned while I was back in college and the leadership skills I picked up post college working in a business environment. 

I decided to pursue a Green Belt certification, and it ended up being one of the smartest decisions I’ve made. It gave me a structured way to talk about problem-solving, cost reduction, process improvement, the kinds of things that catch the attention of hiring managers and execs.

From there, I moved into a role focused on continuous improvement and eventually landed leadership opportunities that completely changed my career (and income).

What’s funny is I’ve now seen this play out for others too, including people with MBAs who felt like they still needed something practical and recognizable to show employers. Six Sigma became that edge.

I do see a common theme, especially on reddit that there are so many misconceptions about Lean Six Sigma and certification. First, its applicable to almost every business in every sector around the world, it's all about improving processes and each business has processes that can be improved to deliver better results to both the organization and customer. Second, not all trainings and certifications are equal. 

If you’re thinking about it, here’s what I’d recommend:

* Skip the “free certificate” downloads. Those are badges, not credentials.
* Avoid providers that don’t list their instructor or course creator. No-name certifications are often built from low-quality or outsourced content, and they won’t hold weight when it counts.
* Learn from someone with actual experience. A respected name matters more than a flashy logo. I went through SSGI (Six Sigma Global Institute), where the program was led by a former university professor and McGraw-Hill award winner. That credibility made a difference for me. Another good one is ASQ and Villanova offers programs that are worthwhile as well. 

Lean Six Sigma isn’t a silver bullet, but if you pair it with almost any background (liberal arts, business, project management), it can be the credibility boost that sets you apart.

Just go to LinkedIn and search how many job openings either request or prefer Six Sigma knowledge or a certification, you will be surprised, it's everywhere!

If anyone’s debating what path to take, happy to share more on what I’ve seen work. Wanted to share my story for anyone who is trying to figure out their path and how to stand out in today's competitive job landscape.

1l7o3n9,Considering not completing law degree and graduating with just Bachelor of Criminology - seeking advice please.,"Hello, I hope you’re well. 

Seeking advice please on which path to pursue given my current goals. 

I am currently in my fifth year of studying a Bachelor of Criminology/Laws (Australia). My WAM is around 70 and I am on an Academic Excellence Scholarship. I also live with a number of medical conditions and currently I am only able to study part-time. I have 13 units left of my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws or 2 units left of my Bachelor of Criminology. 

My current goal is to work as a Policy Officer, Policy Analyst, Project Officer or in a research role within Social Justice and Community Development areas. Unfortunately, law units in particular severely flare up my medical conditions and my overall goal is to start working part-time/full-time soon. I am also very interested in studying a Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University). 

Moreover, I would like to add that I deem it very unlikely that I would maintain a WAM around 70 if I were to complete the rest of my Law degree. I foresee being able to realistically only achieve passes or credits. As a result, I may also lose my Academic Excellence Scholarship. 

I am currently deciding on my next steps and choosing between pursuing these potential paths:

1. **Completing my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws.** 
2. **Completing my Bachelor of Criminology/Laws + Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University).** 
3. **Alternative Exist - Completing my Bachelor of Criminology + Master of Public and Social Policy (Macquarie University).** 

Thank you so much! ",Ill-Farmer-2696,1,1.0,0,1749524123,2025-06-10 02:55:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7o3n9/considering_not_completing_law_degree_and/,6,2025
1l7nuv7,company expectations,"I am fresh out of school and took a job at a company (we do some weeks training to be able to graduate) and they gave me a contract for a few months after this instead of just the training weeks. About 3 weeks after my arrival I have been expected to do many different surveys alone (mostly ones I have not done alone before) as well as drafting some plans for the surveys ( got to do a couple plans for practice before hand but also were to submit legally too). I have spoke to a few peers from my class and are no where near doing the amount I am. I feel lucky to be learning quickly, but I also I feel overwhelmed as I am getting vague instructions sometimes and either too slow or missing something causing us to have to go back.  I feel as though they are about to let me go. 
does this seem too much for a beginner?

I have been going back and forth on it and looked at how much I’d be putting into renting another year - (about 13,000 for the year) So much money to have nothing to show for :/

1l7mybi,Your weekends are literally making or breaking your career,"So I had this weird realization last week when I was completely exhausted on Monday morning after what should have been a ""relaxing"" weekend. Made me think about how we always focus on being better at work, but maybe we're looking at the wrong hours.

Here's the thing - what you do from Friday night to Sunday night has way more impact on your work performance than most people realize. I know it sounds backwards, but hear me out.

Those guys who seem effortlessly energetic and creative at work? They're not just naturally gifted. They're doing something different with their downtime. Maybe they're actually sleeping instead of doom-scrolling until 2am. Maybe they're moving their bodies instead of being glued to the couch all weekend.

And I'm not talking about being some productivity robot who never relaxes. Rest is important. But there's good rest and there's the kind that makes you feel worse. You know the difference - one leaves you refreshed, the other leaves you drained and wondering where your weekend went.

The crazy part is how it compounds. A few months of intentional evenings and weekends, and suddenly work feels easier. Your brain works better. You're not running on fumes by Wednesday.

Your Monday energy is basically a report card for your weekend choices.

I share more detailed breakdowns on these types of topics with some free resources in our Telegram community if anyone's interested. Not for promotion — just wanted to share with those who want to go deeper.",PivotPathway,0,0.49000000953674316,7,1749520623,2025-06-10 01:57:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7mybi/your_weekends_are_literally_making_or_breaking/,6,2025

1l7lajv,Just got my first big boy job and i feel lost.,"I graduated with a bachelors degree in I.T over a year ago. originally wanted to be a software engineer but i couldn't get through the interviews; mainly the technical portions or even land many interviews. I.T also being oversaturated, seemed a lot easier. 700 apps or so later and a handful of interviews i landed a job with a staffing company working at a large company about 80 miles away from me. i commute about 160-170 miles a day 4 days a week, there's a promise that I'll be 2 days onsite and the rest remote within 2 months of onsite training but they made it sound like it wasn't a ""for sure"" that it would be within that time frame.

The coworkers in my department and within the tech portion of this company as a whole seem really nice, my boss is great, my coworkers in my department love him. I just have this constant rush of anxiety all throughout the day while I'm working there. There's a few problems with the company itself that i have, and a few red flags with the position that i have that have me feeling lost. i needed a job to start paying off my loans and just having money. The plan was to have some experience on my resume then go to a better position, whether within the company I'm working for, or a different company, but i never ever took into account that I'd be this lost this soon into the job.

1. My training is completely unstructured. My first day i was told there's no training in place for my position. i would have to basically shadow someone that's done this job for 10+ years, and watch videos do tutorials etc. during my time there. I'm having a lot of trouble learning anything and anything i do pick up seems to instantly fade as I'm basically watching 8 hours of lectures a day because my mentor is always swamped with work, or the work that he shows me makes no sense what so ever because its incredibly tedious work that takes a lot of time to understand.

2. i was told that i ""wont know what's really going on for about 6 months to a year"" maybe closer to a year. Again, the job is basically wearing a lot of hats as they have told me so its not clear what ill be doing most days and everything is constantly seeming to change.

3. My department is only 4 people and we support 3-4 departments of people whose numbers are in the hundreds. my team supports systems for about 4 teams (more probably being added in the future). different technologies, different needs, new companies our parent company acquires. We have big projects all the time and then alongside that were always doing smaller projects from what my coworkers tell me they get pretty swamped with work often, things always break, luckily our manager gives whatever flexibility he can to move problems back slightly but there's always a lot of work. 

4. Stuffy corporate office setting, gray cubicles. Feels very suffocating, i legit feel like i have to take a deep breath every couple mins when I'm sitting at my desk because its so god damn stuffy in that office.

My hang-ups with leaving are that i haven't been there long, its my second week. it took me forever to find a job and I.T jobs as a whole seem incredibly unbalanced in terms of the pay and work/work life balance, im constantly hearing of people in I.T going well above and beyond and being paid pennies compared to the value of work they input, having little to no life outside of work, and i want to avoid that. secondly, my family is very old school. I'm a first generation immigrant so I'm always being compared to my older siblings, my parents friends kids, cousins etc. I'm not even sure i want another i.t job at this point.

It's never been this hard for me in life to pinpoint why i feel so lost, but i am completely and utterly lost.",Competitive_Snow_432,12,1.0,9,1749515698,2025-06-10 00:34:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7lajv/just_got_my_first_big_boy_job_and_i_feel_lost/,6,2025

1l7gsoj,How to resign during probation period? Need advice,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation.

I’ve been working at a new company for about two and a half months, still within my probation period. Unfortunately, I’ve realized that the role isn’t the right fit for me — it’s very static, and I know I perform much better in more dynamic environments where I can fully leverage my skills and motivation.

In the meantime, I’ve received an offer for a role that’s much more aligned with what I’m looking for, and I’ve decided to accept it.

I’m torn between being fully transparent (“I received another offer”) or simply explaining that I’ve realized the role isn’t a good fit for me. I’d like to handle this as professionally and respectfully as possible.

1l7gfxg,I’m going to quit my program,"1. Context
I’m currently enrolled in a portfolio program meant to help creatives build 8–10 projects for a book by the end. The instructor came from a traditional agency background and teaches in that style — more of a sink-or-swim model.

2. The Promise vs. Reality
At the start, we were told the goal was to generate big, innovative ideas — not just executions. But then, we were assigned books that focus entirely on executions, tactics, and formats. There’s a disconnect: we’re told not to think executionally, but everything we’re shown is executional. There’s no real framework to bridge this.

3. The Problem with Feedback
Every week we present ideas and get feedback like:

“This is too on-the-nose”

“This is too tied to the insight”

“This is too executional” - most of the students feedback 

“That insight isn’t good”

Even when I research target audiences and use case studies, I get conflicting opinions from the teacher and the TA. The rules seem to change constantly. I once presented an idea that was called “bullshit” for supposedly trying to fight a policy — but later found out the policy already exists. Even then, the idea was dismissed.

What really threw me off is that he later praised a different case study for doing the exact same thing he critiqued me for.

4. No Clear Path Forward
We’re supposed to walk away with at least 8 portfolio pieces, but I’ve only gotten 3 approved. You’re not allowed to build them out unless they’re approved. At this rate, I’m questioning if I’ll have enough to show — and more importantly, even if I do, I won’t understand why anything worked. I feel like I’m guessing each time.

5. The Teaching Style
The instructor said “I don’t owe you anything,” which kind of set the tone. There’s no real instruction on how to dissect a brief, how to work through an insight, or how to develop an idea in a way that isn’t considered “too on the nose.” It feels like you only succeed if you already think like them.

6. Why I’m Considering Leaving
I’m creative. I know that. But this program has made me question whether I’m the right kind of creative for advertising — or just this brand of advertising. I don’t want to spend the rest of the summer chasing moving goalposts or validation. I’m considering walking away to refocus on my own creative work.

Something I want to add is that I don’t think that they even realize this, but a lot of the speakers that were invited to speak to us weekly created delineation between agency creative, and in-house creative, and even freelance creative in terms of how you can approach and even flex your creativity on a project. This program is not for that. I don’t know. I don’t even think any of the speakers would stay in the program either.

7. My Ask
Has anyone else experienced something like this — where a creative program ended up feeling more like a test of how well you can mimic one person’s preferences?
Is this just what agency culture is like?
If you’ve left programs like this, what did you do next?
How did you find your lane or redefine your goals?

I am a area Manager of 2 high volume spas. I've been with the company for 5 years. I climbed the ladder, starting as an assistant manager, then manager, then area Manager. The growth and experience has been great. I have a Health Fitness Specialist Bachelor's Degree as well. 

But my issue is the schedule. I have 0 consistency in my schedule. I often work 6 days straight, get 1 day off, then work another 6 days. Right now I'm on my 8th of 11 days. I'll get 1 day off, then back to work. Always on call, even on days off. If anything goes wrong, I have to drop what I'm doing to solve it. There is just not any work-life balance whatsoever. And no benefits.

I'm getting married in October, just bought a house, and we plan to have kids relatively quickly after getting married. I live in a MCOL area. I don't have any family in the area, so we will be pretty much on our own with raising kids. I can't imagine raising kids on the schedule I have. I'm completely overwhelmed and burnt out at all times and I'm looking for a change.

The problem is, I feel like despite the success I've achieved in this job, I don't really have any options. I work really hard and I'm open to going back to school, but I can't take a pay cut having just bought a house. I can't pursue any additional education with my current schedule, either, so if I need to do that, I need to find a job that can pay the bills while giving me time to study. My fiancee is a school teacher, so we can't live off her income alone.

I've applied to several jobs over the last few weeks but have received 0 responses other than a few rejections. This has never been an issue before. I always got interviews whenever I applied to jobs in the past, but now I hardly even get responses to my applications. 

I just don't know what to do next. I'm getting desperate and willing to take anything that will pay at least $25/hour and give me consistency so I can get more education or whatever I need to do to move up in my career.

1l7eyo2,Legal Assistant on a CDD: Am I Missing an Opportunity or Being Taken Advantage Of ?,"Hello,

I’ve been on a fixed-term contract (CDD) since January, working as a legal assistant in a law firm. I accepted the position because I really wanted to work in this field, even though I don’t have formal legal training (just a bit of experience in a notary’s office).

Context:

📋 How I got here:
	•	In October, I interviewed for an assistant position. I didn’t get it.
	•	Three months later, the firm contacted me again to ask if I was still interested.
	•	They mentioned a 6-month contract for a “more general” role, without a job description or clear details.

At no point did they say this was a long-term position or that it could lead to a permanent contract. (But at the end of my trial period, someone casually hinted that things were going well and they’d like me to stay long-term.)

I accepted because I was highly motivated to work in this field. I commute a lot (almost €150 in gas per month), which I normally wouldn’t do.
Salary: €2,000 gross/month.

🛠️ What I do now:
	•	At first, I worked directly with a lawyer for two months (it went well and was very interesting).
	•	Then, after an internal reorganization, I was moved to reception, where I’ve been ever since. (They didn’t really ask me, and they announced it to everyone during a coffee break.)
	•	I handle phone calls, general emails, and random tasks others don’t want or don’t have time to do. Basically, I’m getting disillusioned…
	•	I’m only in charge of family court (JAF) files, which represent a small portion of the firm’s caseload.
	•	I now do so few legal tasks that I feel like I’m regressing, not learning, and losing the skills I had at the beginning.

💬 Annual review = cold shower:

I expressed my disappointment:
	•	This is not the job I imagined
	•	I feel like I’m picking up the crumbs left by others
	•	I’d prefer to manage some cases from A to Z, with real responsibilities
	•	And if I’m going to be at the front desk, I’d at least like reception hours: finishing at 4 p.m. on Fridays, maybe even earlier some days

Their response?
No real discussion about my work. They didn’t want to share their point of view during the review. It was very one-sided…

Two days later, after I asked for feedback following that review:
	•	They offered me a renewal of the 6-month contract (wait, what??)
	•	Gave me responsibility for labor law cases (even though the firm barely handles any)
	•	And agreed to let me finish at 4 p.m. on Fridays

Their justification:
“The firm is growing, we don’t know how things will go with the trainee lawyers who’ve signed permanent contracts for the fall (and who’ve also been here for months), we’re figuring things out as we go, so we’re offering you another fixed-term contract.”

(Whaaaaaaat??)

⚖️ If I accept:
	•	I’ll still have no job description, no clear manager, no recognition
	•	I’ll have no benefits (unlike colleagues on permanent contracts): no bonus, no staff committee perks, no remote work, no paid vacation… NOTHING
	•	And if they offer me a permanent contract in 6 months and I turn it down, I lose:
	•	the end-of-contract bonus (10%)
	•	and I’ll have spent a year in a precarious role with nothing concrete at the end

❓Your thoughts?

I’m discouraged. I feel like they’re taking advantage of the fact that I’m new and untrained, keeping me in a low-value role.
At the same time, I wonder if I should stay another 6 months to “see how it goes.”

Are these kinds of practices common?
Would I be missing an opportunity by saying no?
Or am I right to set a boundary and look for a clearer and more respectful job?

Thanks in advance for your feedback 🙏

1l7ejc6,dental hygiene or nursing? help!,"Hi everyone! I got accepted into the DH program and will start it very soon! The only problem is that I am torn between DH and ADN. The reason is that I kind of rushed through my prerequisites and didn't study them thoroughly. My goal was to get it DONE and not worry too much about what I was learning because I was short on time for the DH program application.

Fast forward to now, I feel like I know NOTHING. I feel so dumb and ashamed of myself. I used Quizlet to answer my quizzes and tests. Now I have less than two months before starting the program. I tried studying some general classes like chemistry and biology on S.t.u.d.y.c.o.m but I am so scared and anxious that I can't focus. I end up slumped in my chair, feeling overwhelmed.

I was thinking about switching my program from DH to ADN, so I can retake all the prerequisites and actually study this time. Also, is pre-reqs really important??? Is it worth me switching my program I am accepted into for not studying them?

Now I’m also questioning whether I want to spend the rest of my life working in dental hygiene—smelling mouths and cleaning teeth. I chose DH because I thought it might be easier, but I realize that overall, it might be as challenging as nursing.

I don’t know what to do. I am stuck in the thoughts of ""I am so dumb"" ""I am not good enough"" ""I let my parents down and wasted so much time"" ""wasted so much money"". Should I start studying with s.t.u.d.y.c.o.m and pray I absorb all this information? Or should I start over and pursue nursing instead? I'm also embarrassed to talk to my advisor because I switched my program once already (though that time I was a pre-program student).

1l7efp5,"18F, long term future plans","So hey, I’m 18F from India. Im studying at an IIM(IPM) and I’m really interested in finance and invest in stock market.

As of now I think I’m making decent profits(12%) and had a good turnover for these two quarters. I’m thinking to pursue it as my career in long term(forever). The reason why I think so is because my dad currently earns a lot in stock market (in lakhs and he doesn’t have any degree in finance, he is a comp sci prof) and I think combining these skills from him with a professional finance degree and a course will give a good boost and will be sufficient.

But there is a problem, when I imagine how my life will be, it seems like it’s both boon and bane because I might be having a lot of money but then I’ll be sitting at my home just sitting just staring at the screen everyday which might become monotonous.Now a lot of people will say just spend that money enjoy life travel etc. but I feel sitting at home, people take you for granted especially what’s done to housewives in Indian settings. 

TLDR: I think I can make a good career in stock market but the fact that I’ll be just sitting at home staring screens everyday scares me out.

1l7d6t6,How did I get here?,"Hi - looking for some guidance and advice.  

I’m in a role and title that’s respectable.  I think my compensation is okay for the amount of hours I put in, but it could be about 10% higher to match my peers (who I sense work a lot more) in the same organization.  

The products and services this place provides are just not me, the leaders are not what I’m used to, and I would say the worst part is that I’ve stopped building any useful skills a long time ago.  Should have been learning and doing more in digital transformation, but I’ve stagnated.  

I’ve stayed longer than I should have because I’ve gotten promotions along the way, but those have also stopped.   I’ve been at this organization for almost 9 years!  

When I look for other opportunities, I end up not pursuing them because there is either travel involved or relocating, which were not on the table up until recently - and would still be a huge inconvenience but we can make it work.  For the most part this role has been cush, but I think that is starting to change.  

I think if I work another 10 years at this salary level (165k+), I may be able to retire.  If I don’t do anything stupid, I think they’ll keep me here that long.  

But.. what if there is something out there that is exciting and pays better?  What if it doesn’t pay better but is fun, and feels less like work?  

What can I do?  Non-tech, with a background in ops management, supply chain, project management, people leader. ",ArcachonKS,1,1.0,0,1749495498,2025-06-09 18:58:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7d6t6/how_did_i_get_here/,6,2025
1l7ciu6,Is this worth staying for anymore?,"Hey everyone, I just really need to vent and maybe get a little outside perspective.

Back in April, I legally changed my name. My old name was a huge source of pain for me—growing up, I was constantly bullied because of it, and it always made me uncomfortable, especially around men. (men would make jokes of my name asking if i tasted good etc because my name means delicious in spanish) Changing it wasn’t just a personal decision; it was a survival one. It helped me reclaim my identity and feel more like myself.

When I made the change, I sent a text to my manager at CVS to let her know. I didn’t realize she was on vacation at the time, but I made sure to follow up and call her the first day she was back. We also worked a shift together where I brought it up again in person. I even dropped small, clear hints like “My parents updated their contact info” just to reinforce it.

Then I came in for a shift, and she called me by my dead name—right in front of others. I politely reminded her, and she said something like, “Texts and calls don’t matter.” That stung. I had done everything I could to communicate and be respectful, and it was brushed off like none of it mattered.

For more context, I’ve worked across *several* CVS locations over the past year or so, just trying to make ends meet. To survive, I had  been picking up *up to three shifts in one day*.  because I’m overwhelmed, overworked, and honestly scared. I finally landed at a store where I felt like I could grow. I got promoted to shift supervisor—a role that’s supposed to guarantee me 30 hours a week. But I haven’t even been trained properly yet, and I was barely getting 10 hours most week at my old store so this felt like saftey.

Although I was promoted to shift supervisor at CVS, the title also has not been reflected in workday and no notice of a pay update as well

Yesterday was the final straw. A supervisor asked me to handle a task a certain way, so I did—but another supervisor didn’t agree. My manager called me into the office. She questioned how I was planning to “run my shifts,” as if I’d made some huge mistake. I haven’t even had proper supervisor training yet. I was just trying to follow instructions of what someone told me and keep things together.

 I don’t feel seen. I don’t feel supported. And now I’m wondering if any of this is even worth continuing.

If anyone’s been through something similar or just has advice, I’d really appreciate it.",Alynnlol,3,1.0,1,1749493941,2025-06-09 18:32:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l7ciu6/is_this_worth_staying_for_anymore/,6,2025

1l7c73m,FTI Tech Consulting/Ediscovery vs PwC non consulting role,"I’m a college student deciding between two internship paths for summer 2026:

FTI Consulting (Tech Consulting)

PwC (Digital Assurance & Transparency)

I’ve been reading up and I’m torn. I care about long-term growth, exit opportunities (such as MBB, tech strategy, or eventually an MBA), and earning a good income. But I also really care about the people, the culture, and doing work that doesn’t feel dry or repetitive.

FTI seems super niche — more legal/tech-focused (e-discovery, forensics, AI). PwC DAT feels more traditional Big 4, but people say it’s mostly IT audit with not a lot of upside or prestige. That said, PwC is a big name and might open more doors. And they also fly you out to events, do firm-wide trips, and have a big intern community, which makes it seem more fun socially.

1l7bu8i,What jobs are best for what I want as a career?,"I'm a 22 year old Male from Scotland and got a 4 year degree in Civil Engineering. I finished my degree last year and got a job as a technical engineer and hated it, so I ended up leaving it. I never enjoyed essentially anything I did in university and it's not what I want to do, I just did it cause I could and didn't know what else to do as I didn't and still don't have a passion for much. I have a job at a call centre now just while I'm trying to figure out what I want to do career wise. The IT/Cybersecurity field seems to be what attracts me the most and the type of job I want is definitely as remote/work from home as possible and task based. Currently I work from home at the call centre job which is one aspect I like but I don't like that every second of every day I'm being monitored by management cause the whole system shows what we are doing at any given moment. I definitely want a job where I'm given an amount of work to do per day/week/month and as long as I get it done I can essentially use whatever spare time in my shift to chill. I mainly just want there to be a reason to work hard because at the call centre job, working hard means nothing because the calls never stop coming in no matter how hard I work. I want to be able to at least have the choice of being able to get ahead on my work. I think I'm mainly afraid of wasting time at this stage because I feel I've already wasted 4 years getting a degree that I am now basically not using. I've seen some stuff about getting certifications to get IT jobs but can anyone please give me some advice on a pathway I can take to get to certain jobs and what jobs meet the criteria that I stated previously.

1l7bsbn,Serious question: Life & Happiness,"This questions is for those who are either: well-established in their career or older folks (35-40+)

I’m asking if this is all worth it or not. The whole grind. I’m 26, and have been focused on going to the “next level” since I was 18. I don’t want it regret when I’m older - is this fast stressful life truly worth it even if I “make it”, or will I live a happier & more fulfilled life if I just quiet down, kind of move far away and just live frugally? 

I know it sounds like I have an answer for my self, but I genuinely don’t - half of me wants to try as hard as possible in this one life I have to experience true freedom and success, but the other half of me is worried I may spend years chasing this and such, and even if I do get success, maybe not be happy with it and realize I should have just lived a more solitary and confined life on my own. Here’s a little background on me: 

Started out by going to university, did like 8 internships in college, pivoted from environmental science to digital marketing in 2019, was able to get experience and break into that career in 2020. Since then I’ve been focused on moving up the ladder in digital marketing, but last year I took the entrepreneurship jump into E-commerce, thankfully can say am about to launch the brand in a few weeks and see if this works or not. 

So far the fruits of my labor in the ad industry I feel have not paid off, I do live in a nice apartment in a city and such but I just work all day and sleep, I’m just truly curious if this is suppose to be the way it is and if I should be happy with this? Would love a more experienced/older person’s perspective on this.

1l7bn3x,Should I stay for the counter or chase potential life-changing equity?,"I’ve been at my current company for 4+ years and genuinely love the people and the work. It's been a little rocky... we’ve had multiple rounds of layoffs (the last one was \~5 months ago), but things have stabilized recently, and we’re finally starting to see real growth.  
  
My current comp is $102K base + 10% bonus + RSUs (around $115K cash/year). I’ve been promoted twice, once to senior level, and once into a more technical role (though the second move didn’t come with a raise). A recruiter reached out a couple of months ago for an almost entirely lateral role at a high-growth, pre-IPO startup. After a great interview process, they offered me:

* $135K base
* 9,500 RSUs (1-year cliff), which could be worth \~$500K+ if/when they IPO
* No bonus

  
I was initially excited, but also conflicted... I wasn’t looking, and I really do love my current job. So I shared the offer with my manager. Here’s the counter I received:

* Guaranteed promotion in the next cycle
* $130K base
* 12.5% bonus (up from 10%)
* $10K sign-on with 6-month stay clause
* $30K in additional RSUs (begin vesting immediately)

  
That puts me around $150K guaranteed (\~30% increase) with known benefits and stability. I was concerned that I would be the next target in a layoff scenario, but was promised by the ultimate decision maker (our c-suite representative) that they had the opportunity to let me walk and are instead choosing to give me a 30% raise to attempt to keep me. The promotion guarantee also comes from this person.   
  
But that upside from the pre-IPO RSUs is hard to ignore. So I’m stuck... do I take the guaranteed raise/promotion and stay with a team and culture I love? Or do I take the leap and bet on bigger upside and long-term growth in a new environment?  
  
I've been wrestling with the decision since Friday and keep flopping on what makes the most sense for my career and my family's future. Has anyone navigated something similar?

1l7bgb7,What would you do? Corporate vs Family business,"Hey everyone—looking for some outside perspective. I am an early 20s male, just graduated from college. 

The two roads in front of me:

Corporate Sales Engineering / Solutions Architect Academy role
- Large tech company (think Fortune-500).
- Structured 9-month cohort program, clear salary (~$50 /hr, full benefits, ~110k OTE)
	
OR

2. Join small family business, lead new digital solution branch
- high end artisanal products vertical, 7 figures annually.
- I’d head the new eccomerce division—basically the de-facto CTO on day 1.
- Lower guaranteed cash ($50 k) but 60 % of profits from eccomerce D2C (fam biz model is currently solely B2B).

Some more context:
- the family business is very successful, and I can see myself making about 100k total my first year alone with rapid scaling. 
- I am a business major, with strong entrepreneurial skills and a good understanding of the market / business, and am very skill wise ready to take the role on. 
- the roll out for the family business digital solution coincides directly with academy start date, so it’s one or the other.

1l7am0p,Old job wants me back,"Hello! Looking for some neutral feedback. 

Background:

32M, wife, 3 kids (2 jn childcare). 

Old Job structure-
* CFO
* Large Division: 2 managers each with 5 director reports. A few senior roles, mostly base level. 
* Small Division: 1 manager, 5 direct reports

New Job-
* Director 
* 6 reports. All same level. 

About six months ago I left Old Job after 7 years as one of the Senior roles in the Large Division under completely amicable circumstances. I knew someone at New Job and they told me to check out an opening, and lo and behold I got it. 

To tell the truth, I really had no desire to leave the old organization but New Job offered almost a 50% pay raise and better benefits. I felt like I had to when Old Job simply couldn’t match. 

Fast forward to now and Old Job CFO contacts me out of the blue. One of the Large Division Managers has resigned and he wants me back as manager. No interview process whatsoever. It’s mine if I say yes. Salary does not match where I’m at, but it is a 40% increase from where I was. I know for a fact I’d be the highest paid person with the exception of the CFO; in other words I know they’re doing everything in their power. 

I know on paper I should stay, but all the intangibles lean towards Old Company. I never *wanted* to leave, I’d be going back to the ‘status’ of a long term employee where I’m an expert, New Job culture is ‘fine’- I’m not complaining, but I really felt a connection and excelled in Old Job culture/people. But I fully realize liking my colleagues more isn’t a good enough reason itself. 

So, the advice needed- how do I decide when these intangible things outweigh the salary and benefit differences? How much weight on the ‘comfort’ of the old place is too much?

1l78uvi,"Boss put me on a pilot in did not agree to, and do not want to","Hi all,

Working for a bank WFH (fully remote) for Ontario. Months ago we received a general email from a senior director for a new project that involved calling business clients, and having cases assigned. Our Boss/management never mentioned it in a meeting, and jokingly stated a month ago “change can be good.” We didn’t even think that this project would apply to our department. When taking the job we were promised never to be calling clients in any regard

My role is strictly back office, we are very busy with our work load. Just last week my boss mentioned that I had 3 boxes coming and I received them and mentioned it was for a pilot. 

I feel absolutely blind sighted and sickened. Many senior members have privately told me they would quit if this happens and we need to stand up. Management keeps squeezing us for productivity and new tasks constantly, but this project is not only going to have more disclosures, micro management and calls (we wouldn’t be getting any pay raises and I wouldn’t even want one for this)

However the economy is very bad, the bank just did massive layoffs and shipped many contact center jobs over seas. My anxiety and PTSD is high from dealing previously in a different role of calling clients 

This could be a move to force me/some of us out. With zero communication and disregard

Now I really want to share with my boss I am uncomfortable with this pilot project. I would assume that I am one of a few who received this pilot out of a 20-30 person team based on my strong communication skills. 

However I am worried about a target on my back if I refuse.

1l77ulh,respectfully called my boss out on something and she's been giving me the cold shoulder since. should i quit?,"I've worked at a marketing agency for three years. It's a small business, just me and three others, who are all related (mother, father, and daughter). Our office hours are 9AM to 4PM. To me, 'office hours' are the timeframe when employees need to be available and working. Last week, I was told that if I arrive at 9 AM, I have to stay until 5 PM. This directly contradicts the stated office hours and has never been communicated to me before. I have no problem with working an extra hour, it's the lack of communication that bothered me.

In the moment, I didn't push back. The next day, I sent an email asking for clarification and explained that this expectation had not been communicated to me. My boss said that all roles have ""always been based on a 40-hour work week."" I said that in the initial agreement I signed, she never disclosed the number of weekly hours, only that it was a full-time position. Since anything over 30 hours is considered full-time in Canada, I wanted to verify what the expectations were. No response. I walked in this morning and said hi, but nobody said it back. Ice cold.

I’m overwhelmed by the information I’m given and it’s my first month there.

WFH is nice, don’t get me wrong, but it was an opportunity I got offered and wanted to try it. But maybe I need to give it more time as well. I have a part-time job I can lean on, but I would be taking a massive pay cut and have to find a way to pay for health insurance. Which I’ve done this before. I know I want to finish my bachelors so I can start going for jobs that will pay higher, and I just know I have to do it instead of talking about it. For those who have faced something similar, how did you pivot? How did you manage working full time and going to school? What would you do in this situation?

1l76pe6,Burned out after a promotion — stuck between holding it together and chasing a creative career,"Hey everyone,

I’m feeling pretty stuck right now and could use some outside perspective.

I’ve been in project management for 13 years, and recently I got promoted. On paper, it should have been a step forward—more recognition, new title, better pay. But in reality, it’s been like taking on two full-time jobs. There was no transition plan, so I’ve been carrying both my old workload and the new one with little to no support.

Three months in, I’ve already hit a minor mental breakdown and have been trying to recover and find some kind of work/life balance. But the more I protect my time and mental health, the more behind I feel. It’s like I can’t win—either I burn out or I drown in guilt and backlog.

To make things more difficult, I am the sole provider for my household (just my partner and I). They left their job about a year ago to concentrate on growing our businesses. That’s been slow to scale, and right now I’m the sole provider. We’re not in crisis, but we don’t have a huge safety net either.

Here’s the kicker: for the past 13 years, I’ve been doing freelance creative work on the side and that’s where I feel alive. I’ve never held a full-time creative role, but I know deep down that’s where I want to go. It’s just that walking away from a $100k+ fully remote job with benefits feels reckless when I’ve got responsibilities at home.

I know I should be grateful. I work from home, I make good money, and I have a job. But I’m exhausted. I’m watching my mental health and creativity erode, and I don’t know how much longer I can white-knuckle it. I feel like I’m standing between what I should be doing and what I want to be doing, with no clear path forward.

To make matters tougher, it feels like if I open up about this it'll put unhelpful pressure on our personal relationship and on the businesses' lack of progress.

Anyone been in a similar spot? How did you make the leap? Or how did you find peace while still holding it together?

Thanks in advance.

It’s an international company so the hours and job scope are great, the benefits and learning opportunities for skills and professional development are pretty generous. The people and management are okay, and even the things that aren’t so great, are generally tolerable. Everything’s pretty okay except for the pay.

We get yearly slight increases and decent bonuses, but the starting pay and pay cap (which is YEARS, like a decade later for me to reach the cap) is still too low for the cost of living.

Then I learned PHP for 6 month thinking it's useful but never used it after that cause I wanted to be MERN stack dev.

6 months wasted.

Then I learned ExpressJS by watching tutorial, after creating one project I just got some frontend freelance project then just left backend and kept doing those small amount work for a while.

Then decided to learn nextjs but then I got a opportunity which was the highest amount I could make but I have to learn shopify theme development in short time. I just left everything I'm learning and started working on the theme by learning and after over a month, I build it and got paid.

Then I started doing few figma to html projects and made very small income in there but I was happy I made income so just doing it.

Then I decided to learn react native cause web dev is just so much crowded now. Then I started learning react native.

Don't know why I left it in middle too and now I realised, I'm very weak at all my skill and just know enough to barely get work done.

I am so weak at JS that I can't even make a clock on my own and even basic JS projects. I'm not even jack of all trades, 

PHP, NEXTJS, shopify theme dev, react native, Expressjs, etc. I just spend years learning them then only using them for making less than $100!

If I spend time in just one skill I could be so good by now. Feels like I just wasted all those time chasing small things when i could just master one and get a job by now.

Right now i'm paniccking cause I can't clear basic interview questions with my skills and I''m  getting no opportunity. I thought I would do so well or at least get a job by now and I just destroyed it all without knowing just for those small amounts.

No goal and just learning anything I can. Lead me nowhere now.

  
Oh my god I'm 22 and still not skilled enough in even one tech to get employeed. This is just freaking me  out so much.

1l74jcd,Career choice advice,"Disclaimer 1: I post here since the options involves in some ways electronics, computer science or both.

Disclaimer 2: I am not a graduated engineer, I would start as a technician and maybe get the degree later, if I manage to do so.

Recently, I’ve become interested in various topics like electronics, networking, embedded systems, automation, and environmental data analysis. I’d like to figure out where it’s best for me to start.

I know industrial automation is really in demand lately, but it seems like a very stressful lifestyle. Automation in other contexts, though, would be interesting.

Pure networking is a purely IT job, and I’m not sure how well it suits me. Plus, I’ve noticed shockingly low salaries going around lately (<€20k for entry level roles in NOCs in Italy, compared to national mean salary of 33k gross, or 40k+ for IT with some YOE). However, ""networking"" in other contexts, like satellite communications, radio, etc., would be interesting.

Electronics is a broad field... it ranges from digital to analog, from technicians who build or test PCBs to instrumentation specialists (working on ships for a while would be cool).

Embedded: I enjoy Arduino projects and how software connects with the physical world, but working in the field probably isn’t like tinkering in your garage.

I am job searching right now, not urgently since I am still in my current job but would like a change. I work in Healthcare, currently as a Revenue Improvement Coordinator for a large hospital system. I have been here for 3.5 years, before that I worked in a medical office for 4 years. I would like to eventually move on from Healthcare as I just don’t get any satisfaction from it. The problem is I feels tied to it now after almost 8 years plus a degree in Healthcare Administration. 

I have been looking at Financial Analyst roles in other hospital systems and companies but I don’t have a ton of experience there. I work with revenue and volume data, routinely doing analysis in Excel and making presentations but I lack experience in areas likes budgeting , operational analysis, and other tools like SQL or Tableau. Is there another career area that I can use my current experience to move to that would help give more universal skills?

1l73xvm,Seeking Career Advice from Senior Software Engineers: Are CS Fundamentals Enough?,"Hi!

I’m a software developer with 5 years of experience, and I’d love to hear from senior engineers about a career concern that’s been on my mind. I’m at a crossroads and could use your perspective!

**My Background**:  
I started my career with Java/Spring Boot for 2 years, working on layered architecture projects. I loved the structure and OOP principles—things like dependency injection and clear interfaces felt intuitive. For the past 3 years, I’ve been at a company using Python/Django. Python’s flexibility is nice, but I’m struggling with the “try-first, fix-later” vibe, especially since my current company doesn’t enforce strong code structure (think minimal tests, no type hints, etc.). I’m not sure if I dislike Python itself or just the messy practices here.

**My Belief**:  
Understanding REST, databases, or system design feels more timeless than chasing specific frameworks. But I’m starting to wonder: do companies actually value this mindset? Some job postings seem laser-focused on “X years with Framework Y,” and I’m not sure if my focus on fundamentals is enough to stand out.

**My Concern**:  
I’m trying to plan my next career move. Should I double down on Java/Spring Boot, where I feel more at home with structured code? Or give Python another shot in a company with better practices? More broadly, do hiring managers and senior engineers value deep conceptual knowledge, or is stack-specific expertise the real currency? I want to grow into a senior role someday, maybe even a tech lead, but I’m unsure how to balance fundamentals with market demands.

I’d really appreciate any advice, stories, or even reality checks from those who’ve been in the trenches longer than me. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’m excited to learn from your experiences!",Double_Ad6971,2,1.0,0,1749473388,2025-06-09 12:49:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l73xvm/seeking_career_advice_from_senior_software/,6,2025
1l73naj,Career Change to HR,"Hi career friends. Hoping to get some fresh perspective here. Some context:
I was recently laid off from my job leading accessibility efforts for a large organization. It was during a reorg and used as an opportunity to unload a remote employee getting a high salary who would not move to an office location several states away. Probably for the best anyway. It was a brutal job.

Because of this, I’ve really started to reconsider my next steps. I was unhappy for a long time there. I’m in the later part of my career (mid 40’s). I’m trying to find a role that will reignite a passion in me. I’ve always wanted to help others (my work my entire career has centered around accessibility), and I love supporting the growth, learning and development of my team. I’m also a natural public speaker (in that I naturally love it!).

Some feedback I’ve gotten is I should consider a move to HR. However, I lack direct HR experience (beyond leading teams). I have a ton of learning & development experience. 

Are there any certifications or even degrees I can pursue that can make up for the lack of HR experience that will help me stand out in what I assume is a crowded field? Appreciate any thoughts folks have!

1l72gwl,Mba vs Software Engineering,"Hi,

My queries are:

1. I am a Software Engineer with base pay of 21LPA. I was planning to go for an MBA since I feel my management skills and real life skills are better than Software skills(my role as a placement coordinator in my college help me realise/assume this), though I am good at Software too but have high aspirations of learning how business works for building of my own. I am planning to start something of my own in long term, so thought MBA might help me in that. I am a 2024 graduate with 9/9/9 profile from top 3 NITs. I recently realised that I might get OBC certificate too, which can help me even more while applying for CAT. Considering all these will an MBA be worth it for me?

2. Considering I prepare for CAT and get into an IIM, I am more interested in Finance roles but don’t have any finance background. Could you guide me with the planning and timeline I should focus for building my profile in Finance that will help me in IIM for placements. I will appear for CAT this year.

Expecting replies from experienced individuals in the field.

I'm 29, from Lithuania, I worked as a delivery driver for Lieferando in Austria, Vienna for 4 years. But since they are changing to independent contractor thing, I came back to Lithuania and I'm currently working in a place I despise, in a factory, making plastic moulds and garden supplies each day for 12 hours, inhaling all the toxic crap and people here are not any better or friendly. I want to do the job I used to do before (Lieferando in Germany, and Thuisbezorgd in Netherlands), but in a different country, maybe like Germany or Netherlands if possible. I've never been to either of these places, but I do understand a bit of German thanks to being in Vienna for 4 years. I am not sure how to go about it, I've looked up on their site and it seems applying is possible, and I wouldn't mind doing more than 32 hours or so. I used to do 25 back in Vienna per week.
I even asked chatgpt about this, and basically it said I can try emailing the company and ask if they're really hiring, but I think that would be weird. I assume I should first maybe try finding short-term apartment for rent, and then look for a long term one if I do get hired. I'm also not sure how the residence registration would go.. It would be easier if I had someone I knew in either of these places, but I got no one there.

1l70w9y,Should I Start Over or Rebuild? Social Media as an Artist,"I’m an artist with around 4,000 followers on Twitter. Over the past few years, I’ve dealt with persistent harassment, mostly stemming from personal vendettas that escalated beyond my control (in other words, I didn’t do anything cancel-worthy). The harassment never really stopped, but I’ve learned to handle it much better. However, due to ongoing stalking, I’ve become less active on social media and hesitant to engage with others. This has made it difficult to build relationships with other artists and make friends, and I now feel completely isolated.

In the past, people have stolen my art, and for a brief period, I was the target of a small hate campaign. Instead of blocking and ignoring the people harassing me, I would publicly react, which only led to more negativity being directed at me. I now realize that engaging with hate comments not only made things worse but may have damaged my reputation beyond repair. Some people have even told me that I seem scary or intimidating upon first impression, which, as you can imagine, doesn’t feel great. I regret being so reactionary and now understand how negativity can shape how others perceive you.

I feel stuck. I’m physically disabled and unable to work most jobs, so my old account provides financial stability. However, I feel really ashamed of my online presence and worry that my reputation is beyond repair. I’ve been considering starting fresh under a new alias, but I don’t know if walking away from the audience I’ve already built is the right choice.

1l6z8uf,Most resumes get auto-rejected for dumb reasons (not your skills). Here’s what finally worked for me.,"After getting ghosted by 900+ job applications, I finally took a step back and learned from an expert who really understands how the resume screening process works. What I discovered completely changed the game and honestly pissed me off.

Most resumes never even make it to a real person:

* Bots reject anything that doesn’t closely mirror the job description — even if you're clearly qualified.
* Tables, columns, graphics, or “creative” layouts? Many applicant tracking systems can’t read them.
* Recruiters spend around 6 seconds scanning your resume in a Z-pattern (top-left to bottom-right). If your top-left corner doesn’t instantly show value, you’re done.

**What finally got me callbacks:**

* I removed all the fancy formatting. One column, black text, standard fonts (Arial or Calibri), no icons or tables.
* Put 1–2 **clear, quantifiable wins** right under my name in that key top-left space. *(Example: “Saved $200K by renegotiating vendor contracts.”)*
* Switched to strong, active verbs like *Spearheaded, Scaled, Slashed*. No more “responsible for…” fluff.
* Made the **first and last bullet point** under each job really count — those get read the most.
* Added numbers *everywhere*. *(“Improved efficiency” → “Reduced processing time by 30%”)*

**P.s** Most resumes get rejected because they aren’t built for bots or fast human scans. Once I rewrote mine based on expert advice, I started getting interviews within days.

If this helps: I put everything I learned (**ATS tips, Hidden Crisis in Job Applications, The Science Behind Rejection, How Bots Judge You (And How to Win), The 6-Second Neuroscan, The Primacy Effect Hijack )** into a free PDF. No email, no catch ... DM me if you want it. (Mods-approved, 100% free — just trying to save others the pain I went through.)

1l6yhg9,I'm confused between sports career options in India - what path should I choose ?,"Hi everyone, I just completed my Class 12 this year (18F). I'm very passionate about sports and want to build my career in this field, but I'm really confused about which UG course or path to take.

I'm aware of options like B.P.Ed, B.Sc. in Sports Science, Sports Management, etc., but don't know which one would suit me best. I'm also interested in knowing about the real-life career outcomes, college experiences, placements, and what a day in the life looks like for different roles (like PE teacher, coach, trainer, sports manager, etc.).

If you are currently studying or working in any sports-related field in India, could you please share your journey, what to expect, and what you'd suggest for someone just starting out?

1l6ye41,Made something awesome. Need advice on how to leverage it.,"I work as a contractor for a large tech company. I’ve been there for a few years. Last year my team was gutted, leaving just a small handful of us to do the work that was previously done by ~20. 

The last couple weekends, on my own time, I built a prototype of a software solution to help with the work I (we) do. The proof of concept works great. 

This is something that would typically be built by a team of 3-4 people, each earning at least twice my annual salary. Or, it would be subbed out to an outside company as a one-time job for maybe $100-200k. I know this because I’ve seen it done before for things that I had to immediately completely redo myself because the work was bad and not aligned with what we needed.  Oh, I should note that this is something well beyond my job description too. 

Is there any way I can use this thing as a way to advance my own career and/or get more money?

I don’t want to share it with the higher ups, have them say “Wow! Amazing work!” and then have it become my responsibility on top of everything else I do. 

Similarly, I don’t want them to now just expect way higher productivity because of this new tool and dump that much more work on us. 

I can’t just keep it for myself because to take it out of the prototype phase and scale it up to the size that would make it truly useful, it would take more time and would also incur non-trivial compute costs that would draw attention to it. 

So, any advice on what path to take to best capitalize on this?

1l6xpi9,I may lose my dream job if I don’t pass probation.,"Hello all I’m a 23F who started their first corporate role in February. 

I like my colleagues and I love my job, however, my line manager has said I have been underperforming. He has every belief that I’m a hard worker, but because the department is getting new hires soon I need to be really good at what I do. 

Whilst he said I have improved so much, I’m not sure if it’s enough to keep the role. I have less than a month to prove I’m suitable for the role and quite frankly I’m spiralling a bit, everyone tells me “I’ll be fine” but I still make (even though way less) some small procedural errors. 

My role is 50% governance and policy and 50% admin work. 

My confidence has really taken a hit, but I don’t want to throw a pity party - I want to prove I am capable. How can I reduce the errors and prove I am capable?

1l6xor8,Career guidance needed please,"Hey everyone,
I’m a 22-year-old B.Com graduate and feeling really stuck and confused about what to do next in life.

After going through a long and lonely career journey (literally locked inside my house at times), I realized that in the end, I do want to go into business — but not directly. I also want to gain some knowledge, real-world exposure, and most importantly, a social life which I’ve completely lost during these years.

So, I thought instead of jumping straight into business, I’ll first do a course that helps me learn something valuable and helps me build a network or friend circle.

For now, I’ve decided to do M.Com just to stay in the study loop. And if needed, I’ll think about MBA later to improve my profile. But right now, I want to figure out which field I should actually go into. Personally, I thought of areas like real estate or event management, but these fields my family is saying anyone can do even without studying so I'm confused 

So I want your honest opinion:

Is my approach even right?

Or is there something else more practical and better suited?


I just want a life where I enjoy what I do, grow socially and financially, and not regret wasting more time. Would really appreciate your advice or experience.

1l6xa0h,Should I change career?,"I'm a refrigeration machine operator and landed what i thought is the dream job in my field. It is easy job , 90% of the time I sit around and watch youtube or listen to podcast. I make decent money 120k-160k depending on overtime in a VHCOL city. Right now i'm in a good union , great health insurance , 2 weeks vacation , 4 personal days , holiday days and 12 sick days.

Things I hate about my job is that i feel like I'm   rotting my life away, no upward mobilty I'm basically at the top company and position i can be in. The overtime is intense, atleast 60-80 hours a week. The people are crazy and miserable, alot of people in this field are ex-convicts , drug addicts or just have mental illnesses.I feel like i wouldn't be able to do this for another 20 years

I am thinking that when the part time position opens up I'm going to take it and go back to school for mechanical engineering. My wife is in Tech and she has a great career which is part of reason why I want to go back to school . Also I want to move to california.

For full transparency I am alittle on the autism spectrum. Also grew up in a rough neighborhood with abusive parents which depleted my confidence but with therapy I've gotten alot better and which have given me motivation to go back to school and accomplish more in life. 

I just don't want to make a mistake by jumping into something else with whole different set of problems that are worse. Though I feel like sitting a office , doing some meetings , and doing some work on a computer is something I can do.

You are either an assistant editor, editor or post producer, etc…

I may want to go into the account side of things, interacting with the clients and orchestrating things. It comes with more money and more upward mobility. Technically a producer shares some of the same qualities and I can perhaps get into that as well and I wouldn’t need to go back definitely.

For background, I work full-time in retail and go to school part time. I just got a certificate in software development last month and I expect to get my Associates in the same field at this time next year. I got a Bachelors in 2020 but it is just in Humanities. I went for Humanities because my money was running out and I needed to graduate with something (I swapped my major a few times because I didn't like my respective curriculum and teachers)

Once I finish my Associates next year I'm not really sure where to go from there. I've definitely learned some things and have made a few decent projects but just by looking at job listings the chances of landing a job look fairly bleak to me. One option that I've been considering is working on several personal projects after graduation to bolster my portfolio. I've also considered looking into going to a 4 year degree (however, money might be an issue and it might be fairly time consuming as I have to work full time to pay the bills). I've also considered maybe going to school again for a certificate pertaining to computer hardware. I'm not really as interested in hardware as software but I wonder if it might be easier to get my foot in the door in the technology field.

1l6vkf5,"Books, approaches, and tools that improved my productivity and helped me get a (small) promotion","Lately I’ve seen a lot of talking about feeling stuck with work. I was there so just wanted to share some insights that made me feel better.

Back then, I thought juggling more meant achieving more, and with my ADHD, it was worse... I’d wake up anxious, scrambling through emails, slack, and notes. But at the end of the day, nothing get completed. I was exhausted and out of desperation I tried every productivity hack I could find, but nothing worked. I genuinely thought my mind was burned out for good and my career had hit a dead end.

But then, I came across Atomic Habit and found the biggest hack! It was…improving one little thing at a time. There’s no silver bullet. But with every small improvement, my brain stops panicking, my work starts flowing, I get more things done than before and are preparing for a promotion (small one, but it's a huge step for me)

Here are some mindset shifts that actually helped me

* Your brain isn’t made to remember everything. Every time something pops up - an idea, a task, a thought - dump it into a system you trust. Let your mind focus on thinking, not storing.
* Protect 2 hours of your day like gold. Block them off. No meetings, no emails. Just deep work. It's the most valuable time I have now.
* Multitasking is a BIGG myth. Switching back and forth burns energy. Singletasking is how work gets done.

Some deeper resources I wish I'd discovered sooner:

* Deep Work by Cal Newport: Shallow tasks destroy your productivity and deep, focused work can change your productivity forever.
* Essentialism by Greg McKeown: Taught me that doing less, but better. If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will. Apply the 90% Rule: If something isn’t a clear 9 or 10 out of 10, it's a no. Constantly ask: Is this the most important thing I could be doing right now?
* Apps blocker: Forest app. I use this to reduce my screen time and focus on work. Works for me since I don’t want my trees (in the app) to die :)
* Work assistant: The only tool where I can dump notes, todos, emails and it plans the day for me automatically is Saner. Simple design
* Huberman Lab Podcast: Many good episodes, breaking down productivity, dopamine, and focus in practical ways.

If you're drowning in tasks, It’s freaking hard ngl. But just wanted to say that it’s not the end of the world. Try new things, improve everyday (even if it’s small). You've got this.

That’s all from me.

I could use some help with maybe changing my direction of the jobs I'm applying for and I'm looking for advice. I graduated with my Bachelors Degree in **Technology Development and Management, with a focus in Project Management**. I am looking to move to Minneapolis from Florida, is this too ambitious since I would need to find an entry level job that pays enough for rent in this job market? I have mostly been applying to IT adjacent roles or anything that looks like my resume may make sense for. I have had a Computer Engineering Internship, I've worked at a condo place as a help desk (which I put on my resume as assistant property manager, is this a bad idea? I feel like I should since I have that focus in project management on my degree) I also have reached out to many people on linkedin and reached out to people within my network but still nothing back yet. I have been tailoring my resume to each position and using chat gpt to editing it a slight bit for each job application as well. I have not gotten a call back for the last 3 weeks, I had a local interview with a city job for network analyst however they rejected me a week later. I am also almost out of money but I have been rejected from best buy, verizon and a local repair shop so I can't even seem to find a super ENTRY level job. I have now attended 2 career fairs, attended local careersource (local job pairing company) events and asked for help from my school's career assistance (3 times so far) where they gave me leads on possible jobs and resume advice as well as career events coming up which I plan to attend. I look on linkedin and I see entry level jobs for 20 dollar an hour wages with 100+ applicants, 25% of which have a masters degree. ALL of this on top of people telling me AI will replace any career I find and my inability to find a job even though I've come this far is discouraging and honestly horrifying knowing that I am about to be putting my bills on a credit card as well as being 60k in debt. 

PLEASE if you have any advice for generic positions that will hire anyone with a bachelors degree just so I can get my foot in the door it would be so helpful. I'm considering going back to school for a masters degree just so I can get some loan money to live off of, maybe I should get some certifications? Does anybody have good advice for me? I promise I will do my best to follow whatever advice you have.

1l6t6qd,How much for promotion?,"I've been in my role for over 3 years. I am confident, my team trusts me, and I perform extremely well. However, the contract I work on is having financial issues. An old manager (same company) asked if I was interested in working with her colleague, but it would require going to the office everyday, more responsibility, but it would come with a promotion. Promotions in my company are not necessarily huge pay increases (less than 10%). On the other hand, I can stay in my current role which is flexible until I get reassigned or terminated (most likely reassigned). 

The main issue is that my boss is very flexible and I can WFH whenever is needed. Normally, I WFH once every two weeks + outliers for a total of 2-4 days a month. 

Should I stay in my role unless the offer is greater than 10%? Should I take the ""promotion"" for more responsibilities for a 7% increase going to the office everyday increase?

When I started in my line of work I thought this was where I wanted to go, so when the offer came through, I was understandably nervous but excited.

The last two years though have taken a huge hit on me mentally, and I've come to realize that is isn't the role for me. I consistently dread work, my anxiety is through the roof, so I know a change is needed. 

I just am unsure what to do. I don't feel like I have a lot of in demand skills that a career shift may be difficult. As a small organization, I don't know if I can go back to my old role or even how to have that discussion (we don't have HR).

1l6qtit,Would it be a mistake to negotiate starting rate?,"I received a written offer on Friday and had the weekend to look over job description, insurance rates, benefits and offer letter and if accepted, have it signed and back to HR by Monday… I would like to negotiate starting rate. I was told the position was 20/per hour before interviewing but the position only requires an associate’s degree and I have a bachelor’s degree as well as relevant skills and experience in the field… I’m really scared to negotiate because I don’t want the offer to be rescinded. I really want & need the job but feel like I’m worth more than the given starting rate. Should I try to negotiate before signing? Or take what they’ve offered? 

This is what I was planning to say: 

Good Morning _____, (HR’s name) 

I hope you had a great weekend! Thank you for graciously offering me the position as an ________(position). I am very grateful and excited for the opportunity to work for an amazing organization like _______ (company), to work with incredible coworkers and to work in a field I am very passionate about. 

Over the weekend, I was able to look over the offer of employment, job description, mission statement, summary of benefits and insurance rates and it is clear that ________(company) cares about their employees and offers amazing benefits but before I join the incredible team and organization, I am hoping that there is some flexibility in starting compensation.  I see in the offer employment letter that the position requires an Associate’s Degree and I carry a Bachelor’s Degree as well having relevant experience and skills needed for the position such as previous experience working from home, working with older adults, connecting people with community resources, customer service calls, technical skills and data entry. Based on my degree level, skills and past experiences needed for the position would it possible and in your budget at ________(company) to have an increase in starting compensation? 

Again, I am incredibly grateful and excited to join __________(company) and fully believe that working for your organization will help bring more value and growth to my acquired skills. I really enjoyed meeting you and the team and I am thrilled for the opportunity to be apart of this valuable and incredible organization and I hope there is consideration in negotiating starting rate. 

I also have a question regarding the cell phone and internet reimbursement benefit! How does that work? 😊

I look forward to hearing back from you!

1l6qd29,17 years and counting,"I’m having a problem at work that's been frustrating me. I've been with my company for 17 years as a graphic designer, and I've developed a wide range of skills across different areas. Basically I can do anything web, print, video, content, etc. I’ve also kept my knowledge sharp, training in AI since I embrace continuous improvement. Recently, our team got a new manager, and he has been reassigning projects. The issue is that he gave me only one brand to work on, the corporate brand, while a newer designer (who is not very creative) got the other 2 brands.

This feels unfair, especially since I know I'm more experienced and skilled than the newer designer. What's making it worse is that my direct manager is also a designer, and to be honest, I don't think she's very good at it. She doesn't really recognize my achievements, but everyone else in the company appreciates my work to the point of giving me compliments.

I'm feeling underutilized and stuck. I'm not sure how to bring this up with my manager without sounding like I'm complaining or entitled. I want to find a way to express my concerns and hopefully get more responsibilities or projects that I'm interested in. Has anyone else ever dealt with something like this? Is it time to leave?

1l6pmve,"Strategic Role, Shut Out and Undermined – Tired of the Same Cycle","This version is strong—well-structured, emotionally grounded, and clear in tone. Below is your refined version with just a few light edits for rhythm, clarity, and flow. Nothing was removed—just slightly polished for readability if you're planning to post it:

**Strategic Role, Shut Out and Undermined – Tired of the Same Cycle**

I’m in a strategic, cross-functional role—not entry-level, but I don’t manage people. I’m expected to operate across departments and shape high-impact initiatives. Despite those expectations and consistent contributions, I’m repeatedly treated like an outsider.

Leadership has told me multiple times—without me even asking—that I’d be included in major projects. But time and again, I find out later that I’ve been excluded. These are often efforts I helped design or directly influenced. It’s a pattern: promised inclusion, then silence, then exclusion.

When I raise concerns, I’m met with vague feedback about my “approach,” but never any specific examples. It’s just enough to undercut me without helping me grow. Meanwhile, I watch the work I’ve driven quietly handed off to others who weren’t involved in the early thinking.

At one point, a **director position opened up**—directly tied to the work I’d been leading. I was told not to apply because they were looking for “someone with vision.” The irony? Most of the strategy and direction behind that work *was* my vision. I’d been setting the direction while being excluded from the recognition and opportunity.

What made it worse was that during the time that position was vacant, I was effectively leading in the gap—coordinating across teams, providing accountability, and setting direction. Several of the people I supported told me directly that I *should* apply, because I was already doing the job. They said they appreciated my leadership, felt supported, and believed I was good at it. So to be dismissed when the role officially opened up was a real gut punch.

In another situation, I was **yelled at in a meeting** by a developer (not a peer in terms of responsibility or scope) simply for asking to review their work—which is part of my job. I didn’t yell back. I calmly asked why they were yelling. Leadership’s response afterward? A superficial conversation about “getting to know each other better.” No accountability. No resolution. Just more brushing it under the rug.

The emotional toll is real. I’m constantly second-guessing myself, ruminating over conversations, and walking on eggshells. I’ve gone from being driven and enthusiastic to feeling numb and detached.

At this point, I feel like I’m only brought in to fix or guide things behind the scenes—then pushed aside once the work gains traction. It’s a pattern: use the expertise, then minimize the person behind it.

There’s a culture of gatekeeping here. Success seems reserved for a select few, while others are expected to do the heavy lifting without recognition. Collaboration is surface-level; real inclusion is rare.

Despite everything I’ve contributed, there’s been no meaningful support for my growth—no mentoring, no advocacy, no professional development. Just vague platitudes and a revolving door of missed opportunities.

I’ve started exploring roles elsewhere, but I’d be lying if I said it hasn’t worn me down. If you’ve been in a similar situation—where you’re expected to lead without the title, credit, or support—how did you move forward?",FUnderwood_EDA,1,1.0,0,1749424118,2025-06-08 23:08:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l6pmve/strategic_role_shut_out_and_undermined_tired_of/,6,2025

1l6ojeo,I regret my big promotion,"I (28M) used to work in a technical role that required minimal social interaction. It was a ""sales"" job in title only. Rather, I was playing a support role who worked **reactively** mostly by email based on my colleague's requests: quote creation, answering technical questions, provide recommendations, etc. The job was easy and perfect for an introvert like me, but I reached the ceiling with little growth left.

I was very knowledgeable so I was offered a promotion to become an outside seller that paid nearly twice my salary. This new role involves a lot of selling, social interactions, and strategizing. Just to name a few:

* Pipeline review with leadership. I am now the spear that needs to drive new business.
* Face-to-face meeting with customers and partners on-site or at networking events.
* Lead presentations and discovery calls either virtually or in-person.

The only reason I accepted the new job despite being introvert is the salary. I also thought it might be a good opportunity for me to become a more social person. I currently make 2x what I used to, but I have to potential to make 3-4x more as I grow in seniority. I convinced myself that everything would work out because the money is great, but now that I'm 5 months in I dread every single day. 

I am not becoming more extrovert like I hoped to. In fact, I actually become more and more socially anxious. I keep replaying scenarios where I could have performed better. I have trouble sleeping at night knowing I have a presentation the next day. Even outside of work, I hate the sight of my car because it reminds me of when I drove it to visit customers.

Although I am good with the technical aspect of the job, I am very socially awkward. I have trouble building a meaningful relationship with my customers. My interests are very niche and I cannot relate with customers on sports, cars, etc. like my colleagues do. I feel like the relationships I am building are very transactional, but leadership is hoping that ""I sell the person (myself) rather than our products"". If you work in sales, you should know what this means.

I am debating if I should go back to my old job where I was much happier, or should I suck it up?  
If it helps: I will be perfectly fine financially if I go back to the lower pay.

For any introverts who sucked it up, does the anxiety ever get better?  
And for those who took a paycut, do you regret it?",Spongecakeu3,27,0.8399999737739563,20,1749421133,2025-06-08 22:18:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l6ojeo/i_regret_my_big_promotion/,6,2025

Going to college is an option I just can't figure out what I'd do. I just want the ability to come home and enjoy my time with my family. Have the freedom on my off days to take them out. Im seeking work life balance over anything else as long as I can provide for my family.

1l6o658,Reaching out to a full time job that turned you down because you asked for too much money and asking if you can work part-time for a lower amount,"I was laid off 2 months ago and have been looking for a new job for about 3 weeks now. I did an initial interview for a full time job with a company (We'll call it company A) I really like and it went very well. I could tell the recruiter really liked me, but I did not move forward due to the salary I asked for. They said it was too high, which I understood and I thanked them for considering me.

That was about 2 weeks ago. Since then, I got a job with another place (Company B) that I am not as excited about, but the pay is decent and it will provide me with new experiences and expertise. I have been keeping track of Company A's job posting and I see that they have reposted the job again, which I am guessing means they have not found anyone yet. 

I really like Company A and would really like the chance to work for them, but I do want to keep my job with Company B. Prior to my layoff, I was already searching for a part-time job to do alongside my full-time job. Would it be a good idea to reach out to Company A via e-mail and ask if they would be willing to hire me for the job part-time? This time, I would be okay with having a lower pay because I have a full-time job now. 

For more context, both jobs are remote and the job with Company A has 2 shifts on the weekend, so I could work those full time and the weekday shifts would be the part-time. 

Any advice on this would be great!

\- could use as a stepping stone to get into marketing at one of my dream companies in the future. I'd have professional marketing experience on my resume

\- could potentially move to west coast if I wanted to

\- 9 to 5 hours, better work life balance

Cons:

\- Massive pay cut and I wouldn't be getting a salary raise year-over-year until I get promoted. not exactly sure what the timeline is of being promoted either, there is no set schedule.

\- I'd be doing marketing for a product that I'm not that interested in

1l6iws6,"I’m 18, broke, from a toxic family, and I want to make $100M before 30. Is this delusional or doable?","I’m an 18-year-old woman from a toxic and poor background. I’ve seen pain, scarcity, and manipulation all my life — and I’m done letting it define me.

I don’t want to ""settle"" or just get a decent job. I want to build serious wealth — I’m talking **$100 million** before 30. I know that sounds crazy. I know the odds. But I also know I can work harder, learn faster, and push through more than most.

Right now, I have no connections, no money, and no guidance. But I have time, hunger, and the will to do whatever it takes.

**If you had to start from scratch like me today — no money, no network, no family support — but had full control over your focus, time, and energy, what would you do first?**

Would you:

* Learn a high-income skill? (Which ones actually scale?)
* Go into tech, finance, entrepreneurship?
* Join a startup or build your own?
* Focus on brand, leverage, online business?

Also, if you’ve built significant wealth, what would you *never* waste time on again?

I’m willing to sacrifice comfort, relationships, sleep — anything. I don’t care about being “realistic.” I care about being *relentless*. I just need direction from people who’ve actually made big moves.

1l6iofa,How do i know if I really want to switch professions or if it is more grass is greener temporary thought,"Quick background: growing up my parents didn't buy me a console so I played website games i.e. miniclips, arcade, newgrounds, etc. I wanted to learn how to make them my dad gave me a Java book and thus started my programming journey. I took programming in high school. But the thing is my family wanted me to become a doctor so I started as a Bio major in college. I was kinda through some shit and thought engineering specifically software engineering is what I wanted to do so I switched majors and graduated with a CS degree. 

Cut to 12 years later. I am not satisfied with a career in tech and I kinda lost the love for corporate career ladder.  As for becoming a manager I've since learned becoming a manager is a very political thing. I've seen people who weren't ready for it become managers and I've seen people who've been ready for a while keep getting the denied the opportunity. I personally never want to be a people manager. 

The thing is medicine has always interested me throughout my adult life. And needless to say covid really amplified that interest even further. 

Part of me wants to go pursue medicine. But I just dont know if its a grass is greener on the other side feeling. I'm like 34. Due to a poor undergrad gpa(2.5) I'll def have to do post-bacc courses, possibly a SMP as well. If i pursue medicine I want to go to a medical school here in the US not carribeans. Now do note while undergrad is very flexible medical school is not. Should I get into medical school my stubborn ass will finish that school and not quit midway cause it's fucking medical school if I choose I'm seeing my through it. 

I feel like if I start my journey to medicine at 34 possibly 35 I'll be starting medical school hopefully by 37 or 38. And starting residency by 41-42. And again I'm okay with that I'll probably continue working while I work on my post-bacc. So I'll largely be out of the workforce for 4 years while I'm in medical school. 

I'd much rather spend 15-20 years as a doctor helping people rather spending another 30 years in the corporate grind tbh 

But again like do I really want this or is this a grass is greener on the side day dreaming situation",downtimeredditor,2,1.0,0,1749406069,2025-06-08 18:07:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l6iofa/how_do_i_know_if_i_really_want_to_switch/,6,2025

1l6hv1w,21 Year-Old Maintenance Technician- Thinking About Going Back to School- Looking for Advice from People Who’ve Done the Same,"21 Year-Old Maintenance Technician- Thinking About Going Back to School- Looking for Advice from People Who’ve Done the Same?

For context, I (21M) am currently employed as a maintenance technician making $36/h in a low to mid cost of living area. I work a weekend AM shift (sat, sun, mon 7am-7pm.) I enjoy my job for the most part, I work at a relatively laid back plant and I don’t have any personal issues with anybody. The only real issue for me is the shift itself, my fiancé works a regular 8-5 and an eye doctor office. She gets off at 1 on Friday so that gives us time to go out and do a few things together, but I still feel like I’m missing out by working every weekend. 

That leads me to my question for this sub, should I tough it out in hopes to get a M-F day shift maintenance spot (could be 1 year could be 5-10 just depends on who leaves and who puts in for it.) 

Or should I go back to school for some sort of desk job ( I’ve been leaning into the possibility of going for accounting or finance.) I have an AAS so I would think I could have my bachelors in another couple years doing online college courses. 

My only concerns about the desk job route is that I either would put all the time and money into getting a bachelors just to not like white collar work as much as I think I might now, or I would have to take a significant pay cut in get into an entry-level position. 

TLDR: I make decent money and don’t mind my current role as a maintenance mechanic, I work a weekend shift and I’m starting to get tired of it. Should I stick it out and try to secure a M-F day shift spot or completely change career fields by going into some sort of white collar accounting/finance work. 

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. ",Bitter_Object7039,1,1.0,0,1749404048,2025-06-08 17:34:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l6hv1w/21_yearold_maintenance_technician_thinking_about/,6,2025

1l6h9yh,Doctor or engineer?,"So I am going to choose what degree to study soon. I am so confused and I’ll try to explain why. I am confused between if I wanna study to become a doctor or a software engineer. I know these are quite the opposite.

I have for so long wanted to study software engineering as I like computers and programming. I had already even decided that I was gonna go for backend developer. Its not what I have just been saying it’s what I like. I remember when I got my first computer at 10 I was exploring the internet, systems and so on. Was also very interested in hacking and still am. So this is what I want to do. The only thing that I am kinda uncertain about is the math. Although I like math I’m just average at it. 

Doctor - this is something that I have recently been thinking. The first time I was dissecting a heart in 9th grade I knew that wasn’t for me. But I studied biology and also did a biomedicine course in high school and I liked learning that and was good it. Even did a week of ”practice work” at a hospital.

My mom was always sick and I always looked up her symptoms on the internet, although I learned a lot I kind of developed health anxiety. Now I didn’t like blood and tissue but now I am not that afraid of that anymore. 

Now durations is obviously more to become a doctor but that depends on what kind you want to be ofc and I’m having been looking into OBGYN.

Eh, I don’t know what to do. I’m equally interested at this point. If I had to choose 2 years ago I would have chosen engineering but now that I realized I have grown out of my fear of blood and tissue it has come to this :)

40,000 stock options (company isn’t public yet, so value is uncertain)

Great for career growth, strong tech scene, but I’d have to move away from my best friend (who just moved from India and planned to live with me in Tampa) and my girlfriend (currently on the East Coast, unsure where she’ll get a job).

1l6eur4,Looking for advice on navigating a potential job transition while in the middle of a major project.,"
I’ve been with my current company for about a year and a half, moving from a small, privately held group to a large, publicly traded organization. This role appealed to me because it gave me an exposure to this type of organization. I was brought on to expand into a new vertical and take a more active role with a product type that hadn’t been a core focus previously.

Unfortunately, it’s been a tough adjustment. I’ve struggled to find my footing, and performance in the vertical has lagged despite significant effort. Additionally we have put some larger expansion plans into this lane on hold due to the performance of assets in our primary focus. The stress from the dysfunction of the role and lack of progress have started to take a toll on me outside of work where I'm just constantly tense and dreading heading into the office every day.

This past week, a recruiter reached out about a role I was previously offered at a firm that’s much more aligned with my past work—and where I’d likely be more fulfilled. The base pay would increase significantly by about 15% with total comp moving up by almost 30%. The role is also fully remote (vs my current five days in-office) but comes with a more demanding travel schedule (I currently travel 1 Week per Month, with this new role likely increasing to more frequent less lengthy travel).

While it seems like a no brainer, I’m in the middle of a major project in the focus I was brought on for that ramps up significantly over the next 90 days and will probably take until the end of the year to get cleaned up when we bring these functions in house. I was brought in specifically for this asset class, and there isn’t anyone else internally equipped or even logical to take the lead on if I leave. Leaving now would create a meaningful gap as there's nobody else internally that could step in on this project. Cost wise, it could have notable financial impact if we were to have to delay this project or scrap it entirely because I left.

Looking for advice on how to navigate this situation. I want to do right by my current employer, but also need to consider my long-term happiness and health. It seems like a no brainer to leave, but I would just be putting my company in such a bad spot.

TLDR: Have a much better offer for a job I think I would like, but would be leaving in the middle of a big project that would really hurt this company if I didn't see it through.",GoCubsGo0070,2,1.0,0,1749396477,2025-06-08 15:27:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l6eur4/looking_for_advice_on_navigating_a_potential_job/,6,2025

🔍 Honest feedback on how your resume and online profile come across to recruiters. Are you underselling yourself? Do you come across as generic or unclear?

	2.	Message  Optimizer
🧠 Combines keyword tuning, tone/style analysis, and outreach help.
• Aligns your profile to specific jobs
• Improves visibility to recruiters and ATS
• Helps write custom outreach and cover letters (without sounding robotic)

	3.	Interview Readiness Simulator
🎤 AI-powered mock interviews (behavioral and/or technical) with feedback on clarity, confidence, and storytelling.

AI + saturated job market + no opportunities for growth = I WANT TO GET OUT   
During my internship i saw my 30-year-old coworkers at minimum wage, their eyes screaming “Run away”

Now I know what I want from a job. I don’t want a passion job in a “cool” field. I want a job that offers **benefits**, like:

* Stability
* Once I’m out, I’m *done*
* Possibility of remote work
* Salary growth, so I’m not stuck at minimum wage forever
* Employment that’s not completely threatened by AI
* Not freelance/self-employed, I’m way too anxious for that rn

Right now, I’m in a state of panic, unable to make a strategic decision or plan long-term. I don’t know if I should impulsively dive into a 180° career switch or continue my dumb studies without knowing where they’ll take me.

**My options right now:**

**If I stay in my field:**

* Specialize in graphic design for exhibitions (need connections, I have a bit of internship experience already, competitive field)
* Specialize in UI/UX or interface design (oversaturated for juniors, mid-term AI risk)
* Move into coordination/project management in creative fields (stressful, competitive, and usually requires experience)

**If I start over with a career change:**

I was a good student in high school despite major issues with concentration in lectures, so if I go back to square one, I’m thinking maybe a technical degree.

**My strengths:**  
Good memory, I enjoy systems, strong analytical/synthesis/structuring skills, and I really liked biology. 

**My weaknesses:**  
Total disaster in chemistry/physics, not great at math (except stats and I have decent logic).  
I’m worried it’ll be really hard to fit in socially + I’ll totally lose my sense of direction.

**Ideas I’m considering:**

* Ecological transition careers, working in energy, electricity, water, etc.
* Sysadmin, I like the info management/problem-solving side
* Jobs linked to biology? What do lab techs get paid?

Of course, in my head, a career change feels appealing because it looks like a radical escape from my current mess. But I’m aware that I really need to **mature the project**, while also being quick to act.

1l6dt6s,Can I Break Into High-Impact Finance Roles or Am I Stuck in IR Purgatory?,"Hey all, Ive posted here twice already and got no responses, hoping ill get something this time 

I am looking for some real, unfiltered advice.

I graduated in May 2024 with a Kinesiology degree on the Pre-Med Track (minor in Business/Finance) but have been laser-focused on pivoting into finance. I took the first job I could get after months of rejection and I’m currently working as a Financial Analyst at a boutique IR consulting firm.

Before that, I interned at a small Investment Bank and also held a corporate finance internship.

Here’s the issue: I feel like I’m getting boxed into “soft finance” — IR, communications, reporting — and I want to break into more analytical, deal flow involved, high-impact roles like corporate strategy/development, equity research, or even long-term investment banking.

I totally get that many transition into IR from high-impact finance roles. My question was more about the reverse — for those who start in IR (especially at a boutique consulting firm), what does the career path look like? What are the realistic lateral opportunities?

My goal is to eventually break into more analytical, impactful roles — both to build credibility and gain a wider range of experience that'll serve me long-term in finance. Just trying to figure out the best way to position myself early on.

**My questions:**

* Am I pigeonholed by my IR experience? Or could it be a legit stepping stone?
* What roles should I actually be targeting based on my background?
* Should I be doubling down on certifications?
* Is my non-traditional degree killing my chances at more hardcore finance roles? (Should I work towards an MBA or do I need an MSF?)
* What would you do in my shoes if you were 22, driven, and tired of being sidelined?

I’m not scared of grunt work — I just want direction from people who’ve been in the trenches. Tear me apart if needed — I’d rather know now than stay stuck.

I’m currently a program manager in infrastructure grant administration and cover a variety of skills such as project management, finance, GIS, data analysis, policy strategy/government affairs and management. I’d say I obtain a diverse skillset but a master of none. 

I recently passed up on a sales job offering $9k more in base salary and nearly double my salary in commission. Overall, the full package is double what I’m making now (assuming I achieve quota). I truly enjoy where I work and who I work with. I absolutely adore my boss and I promised to stick this out until after 2026 when we achieve a significant career goal and then reassess if I want to leave. I also have Fridays off, full autonomy, remote, insane PTO/sick, valuable connections, and of course job security/stability. Now that I have Fridays off, I really want to work towards launching a business that I’ve been working on for a bit. I feel like this would be my opportunity. 

Eventually I will need to get a higher paying job. I don’t have enough in savings, in debt, and will need to provide more for my family at some point (but not struggling). Am I a fool for passing this sales job? It was a Director role (more realistically account exec) and I know the product and clients. 

What goals should I set for this transition? PMP, Six Sigma, improve Excel? Learn Tableau? Can anyone explain their experience from transitioning out of public to private?

Our family is pretty well off we have a nice house and were able to live very comfortably.

1l67seu,Torn Between F1 Engineering Role and EV Startup – Need Advice on Career Move as a Recent Grad,"Hey everyone, I’m a recent mechanical and electrical engineering graduate based in the UK and I’ve found myself in a bit of a dilemma.

I’ve received two job offers:
	1.	F1 Team – Mechanical Engineer
	2.	EV Powertrain Startup – Test & Validation Engineer

The pay is roughly the same, but the F1 role would require relocating and likely commuting 2+ hours most weekends to see my partner. On the other hand, the startup is closer to home and sounds genuinely exciting – the kind of place where I could grow quickly if things go well.

I’ve previously done a placement year in F1, so I’m not going in blind. I know the environment and the prestige it carries. It feels like something I “shouldn’t” turn down… but part of me is more drawn to the startup. It just feels like a gamble, and I’m worried about what happens if the company doesn’t succeed or if I don’t enjoy the role.

A few questions I’d really appreciate thoughts on:
	•	How much does the company name matter on your CV, especially early in your career? Would F1 open more doors later compared to a startup?
	•	How do employers weigh brand vs. actual experience/impact in the role when hiring?
	•	Has anyone here taken a similar leap into a startup early on? How did it go?
	•	Am I crazy for considering turning down a F1 role?

Thanks in advance for any insight, I’m torn and could really use some perspective from people who’ve been in or seen similar situations.",Anon6737,2,1.0,0,1749373481,2025-06-08 09:04:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l67seu/torn_between_f1_engineering_role_and_ev_startup/,6,2025
1l67lri,Stuck in bad career situation,"It seems that after reaching a certain age or career level, it becomes difficult to secure a role that matches your career level and path if you were unfortunately made redundant from a poorly run firm. This can lead you off your original career path with no easy way back. You also keep encountering recruiters who push you into unsuitable roles, often for their own benefit. It's easy to distinguish good recruiters from bad ones. Therefore, I prefer applying directly to hiring companies rather than through recruiters, as I see no value in a middleman who might misrepresent the job and candidate, ultimately making me a more expensive hire. I found it frustrating that, even when I met all requirements for jobs at the right career level and in the right organization, I was not invited for an interview or was not progressed due to ""fit"" issues, which are usually due to hiring managers' personal considerations rather than the organization's interests. I also found it hard to pretend to be excited about a job when I identified red flags, and I seem quite good at screening bad jobs by asking right questions these days. If a job isn't a right match to begin with, people won't be stable in the role and wont be high-performance. Sorry, just meant to vent. My case probably hard to help except meeting the right job at the right career level and in the right organization.",Ju0987,1,1.0,0,1749372713,2025-06-08 08:51:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l67lri/stuck_in_bad_career_situation/,6,2025

1l65j38,Initial Impressions of Onwardmax – Recruiting Agency/Career Coaching Service,"I recently had a call with a recruiting agency and career coaching service called Onwardmax. They present themselves as a premium service, primarily aimed at executive-level professionals or those looking to advance into higher-paying roles. Since I wasn’t previously familiar with the company, I wanted to document the experience and share an objective overview of the call.

Scheduling: The call was scheduled for 2 PM Central Time and began approximately six minutes late. While not a major issue, punctuality is often noted with services that position themselves as high-end. Once the call started, the representative maintained a professional and approachable tone. The conversation felt exploratory rather than sales-driven, with the rep asking detailed questions about my background, career goals, industry, compensation, and challenges.

Company Overview: The representative provided an overview of Onwardmax's services, which focus on helping professionals achieve significant income or title progression. A key point emphasized was the idea of approaching one’s career as an investment, suggesting a strategic, long-term perspective on job advancement.

He also mentioned that traditional job boards are less effective for those seeking higher-compensation roles, citing volume of applications and preference for internal or lower-salary candidates as common obstacles.                                                                                   

Program Details: The service is priced at $7,500 for a year of support, which includes resume and LinkedIn optimization, access to job opportunities, personalized coaching, and interview preparation. One feature highlighted was a “pause and resume” policy that allows users to suspend the program if they secure a role and return to it later as needed.

To help prospects evaluate the program, Onwardmax offers two trial sessions. This was presented as an opportunity to experience the service without a full financial commitment. The representative noted that there would be 8–10 sessions with a dedicated mentor. It was not entirely clear what professional background these mentors typically have—whether executive recruiters, former hiring managers, or career coaches—but this is something I plan to explore further.

Network: A major selling point discussed was access to ""unpublished opportunities""—job openings that are not posted publicly. While potentially valuable, it’s difficult to assess this claim until one has access to the full platform.

Throughout the call, the representative referenced prior details and appeared to tailor the conversation to my specific situation. The call did not feel scripted, and this personalized approach stood out.

Pricing: The $7,500 cost is substantial, though payment plans are available, including a 24-month financing option. Details were limited in the initial call, but the flexibility in payment may be beneficial for some clients.

Website: The company's website appears professionally designed and outlines their offerings clearly. However, independent online information about Onwardmax is limited. There are few third-party reviews or forum discussions, though the company is accredited by the Better Business Bureau with a high rating, which adds a degree of legitimacy.

I’m at a point where I really want to break into a higher-level role. I’ve been plateaued for a bit, and I know that without help, it’s hard to compete at the top levels. If this service can genuinely connect me to better opportunities or improve my approach, it might be worth the cost.

Next Steps: At this stage, I’ve decided to participate in the two trial sessions to better understand the value of the service. While I’m not ready to commit financially, I’m open to evaluating whether their support can help me progress in my career. I’m also interested in hearing from others who have gone through the program—particularly whether they found the unpublished roles beneficial and if the mentorship was impactful.

My Perspective: There are pros and cons to both routes. The benefit of a company like Onward max is that they might have infrastructure and connections that do it yourself or other programs don’t. Still, the price point is a huge differentiator.

Closing Thoughts: Onwardmax may offer value through its structured support and potential access to hidden opportunities, but the high price point sets a high bar for expectations. I remain in information-gathering mode and will assess the trial experience before making a final decision.",pickatu,6,1.0,5,1749364145,2025-06-08 06:29:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l65j38/initial_impressions_of_onwardmax_recruiting/,6,2025
1l65b73,What should I look for next as a B.Tech CSE graduate ?,"Short: Career Advice for a B.Tech CSE fresher

Hey everyone. Not sure if this is the right place to post.

I'm a BTech graduate, currently unemployed. Honestly, I don't know which direction I have to proceed in. I did an internship in Dynamics 365 CRM, which has a little bit of C# and JS, but found rest of the work too dull. I also have no interest in front-end, realised that when I did the college project. In the project, the HTML, CSS felt too boring, nothing to solve/build-up like the ones below. Feel the same for Android studio front-end, the backend we used was Java and at the time, the syntax/codes were too complicated for me (because I have never seen complex stuff like that during college)

I'm kinda good at basic coding and love to make programs based on algorithms (like programs to find First&Follow, do scheduling, etc...), or my own ideas (for basic things like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc..).

After the internship, having no clue, I went on to take some Java online course just to learn programming in detail, stuff that we aren't taught at the college. (And yes, gained some more knowledge, realized java has so many extra stuff like for eg, built-in packages for Arrays, Lists, Mapping, StringBuilder, Comparator/Comparison, etc....)

If someone asks about my career, I still don't know what to answer. I would like to go into Database/Cloud stuff. But I have zero clue. Whenever I google about those, I get results like ""those are not entry level jobs and I have to atleast be in development side (eg: app, web) and build atleast 2 years of experience in it. Then, I can proceed to shift."" This is the main reason I just selected an online Java programming course to learn it in depth.

I'm still doing that java course, yet I don't know what domain actually suits me. I know I like to code as I have given above examples. Also, I usually proceed to reply ""I'm doing some course"" if someone asks anything related. Idk how much of a bad situation I'm in. Please guide.

1l64k0q,I’m 18 and feel completely lost in life – I keep changing paths and don’t know what to do anymore,"I’m 18 and should’ve been sitting my A levels this year, but I dropped out of school after GCSEs because I really hated the school environment. I was bullied and leaving school early on most days, besides that I managed to pass all of my GCSEs with As and Bs. I started a computing apprenticeship as I took GCSE computing and thought of the potential financially I could have but didn’t enjoy it and quit after a few months. My parents then paid for me to do online A levels privately, but I couldn’t stay motivated and ended up not doing them—I felt awful for wasting their money.

My dad wanted to move to Brazil (my mum is Brazilian and I’m half), so we moved, I knew by moving I could get away from doing the online A-levels I picked and decided to try getting into a university here. I applied for an Aeronautical Science degree because I thought becoming a pilot was my dream (it has been on my mind ever since I was little, but I knew financially in England it wouldn’t be possible) I even did 15 hours of flight training to qualify in Brasil. I got in, even though my parents knew it was still financially tricky too here in Brasil, they encouraged me as they knew this career would set me off in life. But I really struggled—mainly because of the language barrier. I do speak Portuguese, but not at the level of a native 18-year-old, and it was hard to keep up.  Luckily, I made one good friend, but sadly he had the wrong intentions and ended up having feelings for me, which made things uncomfortable. That was my first mistake at uni since it was impossible to get away from him to try and make other friends. I felt stupid sometimes, some teachers couldn’t understand that I was brought up in England all my life or would just simply forget and I think they thought I was rather unintelligent. I felt publicly embarrassed in certain lessons where I would get called out for not understanding the tasks and that as a whole ruined my uni experience here. Additionally, I’ve always been worried about our finances in the family and this course where I didn’t think was benefitting me at all was expensive.

Eventually, I quit the course. I decided I’d just focus on the flight hours to become a pilot outside of uni, which is possible here however some airline companies prioritize those applying with a degree, but even that started feeling wrong. I got put off by the responsibility, even though it was something I thought I’d always wanted. The idea of taking my theory examinations here in Brasil in Portuguese felt super daunting, or flying a plane by myself without my instructor seemed impossible in my head as communicating to the tower was already hard for me.

Now, I’m trying to prepare for the ENEM exam (the Brazilian equivalent of A levels) so I could maybe get into medicine—which I think I’d maybe like—I’ve had interest in surgery too for years but it’s insanely competitive here and I’m once again at a disadvantage with the language. I feel so behind. My parents have been supportive financially, but I feel like I’m just wasting their time and money and constantly letting them down. They’ve even lied to family members about me quitting uni, probably out of shame.

I know they’re worried about me.

Without a levels taking a uni course is impossible in England, so those opportunities are out of the window, specifically in medicine as I’d need higher grades in Science.

I don’t have any friends here. I have one online friend back in England, but we’re on totally different paths. Most nights I cry myself to sleep thinking about how everyone else is figuring out their lives, going to uni, making friends—and I’m just stuck.

I keep thinking I’m broken or a failure for not knowing what I want, or for quitting everything I start. I feel completely lost and alone, and I don’t know where to go from here. All my parents do is support me completely and I couldn’t be more grateful for all that they do, but now it just looks like I’m not serious about anything. If anyone’s been through something similar or has advice, I’d really appreciate it.",Mediocre_Quail5949,4,0.8299999833106995,2,1749360306,2025-06-08 05:25:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l64k0q/im_18_and_feel_completely_lost_in_life_i_keep/,6,2025

1l63a6y,"24, lost, behind, and scared I’ll never catch up-please help me choose a path","I’m 24, from India, and feel like I’m watching my life slip through my fingers in slow motion.

I graduated in pharma two years ago and have done QA-level work at a pharma unit, but nothing that feels like meaningful experience. I didn't know back then what I wanted-but now I do, and even now only vaguely, and the realization came with a harsh clock ticking in my ears.

Everyone around me who figured it out earlier, eithter right after graduating from their bachelor's (I grduated in 2023) or after a gap of one year max. Me? I woke up late. And now I’m panicking. I should have entered grad school this year or the last, 2026 is late and 2027 would be extremely late, by the standards in my country.

I’m caught between two paths:

Doing an M.A. in English, which I love but fear because of low pay, uncertain scope, and a timeline that feels “too late” for people like me.

Going for a pharmacy graduate degree in 2026, which would require me to go back to studying everything from my undergraduate degree and which is not really my area of interest or passion.  
  
Both of which would mean I’d graduate in 2028-four years after my Bachelor's in Pharmacy-and I’m terrified that I’ll still earn less than others who are already ahead, especially if I pivot to a new field.

I constantly feel like I’ve ruined it all-too many gaps, too much indecision, and not enough clarity to confidently say ""this is what I want and I’ll make it work."" I don't want to earn little money forever, and I don’t want to live in regret or self-loathing five years down the line.

I feel deeply alone in this and keep thinking: if I don’t figure it out by 2026, maybe I don’t deserve to be here at all.

I’m scared of being behind. I’m scared of being poor. But most of all, I’m scared I’ll never find something I can be proud of building.

Please, if anyone has gone through this-starting late, switching fields, rebuilding after years of fog-how did you do it? What online courses, portfolios, fellowships, or paths actually made you feel like you weren’t wasting your time and self-worth?

I’m ready to put in the work. I just don’t know where to begin.

Any advice, guidance, or even stories would mean the world right now.",stuckonrepeat21,1,1.0,0,1749355544,2025-06-08 04:05:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l63a6y/24_lost_behind_and_scared_ill_never_catch/,6,2025

I left my last job because I no longer believed the product was impactful as the company claimed it to be. I crushed quotas and exceeded targets and made a ton of money but also at the cost of letting  far too many clients down. Some clients had great experience with the product most clients did not. I was not learning nor growing and it started to become mentally and emotionally numbing. My gut told me it was time to go. Anyway I've been interviewing for the past 9 months and I've failed countless of interviews with highly reputable companies. I know I have a lot of value to bring but I freeze up and word vomit or can't say anything at all. I never had anxiety before this and it's a new experience for me.

1l61hc3,Why I burned out (and you probably will too),"I used to be that person who worked 12-hour days and felt like garbage about it. Took me way too long to figure out why.

It wasn't the long hours. It wasn't even the difficult work. It was doing all that work without knowing where the hell I was going with it.

You know that feeling when you're constantly busy but nothing feels like it matters? When you finish your to-do list and somehow feel more empty than when you started? That's what happens when you work hard but have zero direction.

I spent months grinding on projects that went nowhere, learning skills I never used, and saying yes to opportunities that had nothing to do with what I actually wanted. The whole time wondering why I felt so miserable despite being ""productive.""

Here's what changed everything: I started asking myself one simple question before taking on anything new - ""Where is this taking me?"" If I couldn't give a clear answer, I didn't do it.

Suddenly work didn't feel like torture anymore. Same effort, completely different energy. Turns out when your daily grind actually builds toward something you care about, it stops feeling like a grind.

Don't make my mistake. Figure out your direction first, then work hard. Not the other way around.

1l618ek,"I gave 2 weeks notice - I was let go the next day, but told it's still ""voluntary""","I posted this is r/legaladvice and was told that this is a more appropriate subreddit for my question.

I work at a tech startup in California. I got a new job at another tech startup (not a competitor) that I start later this month.

Here's what happened:

* I gave my notice on Thursday 6/5.
* On Friday 6/6 they told me that they ""accept my voluntary resignation"" BUT the effective date of my **voluntary** resignation will be Monday June 6/9, not June 20 as I had written in my resignation letter.
* I haven't signed anything yet, I'll get the paperwork on Monday.

I have a few concerns:

1. I was counting on getting paid for the next two weeks. Now I won't unless they include two weeks severance. I won't know if they are offering that until Monday.
2. If it's still ""voluntary"" then I won't be eligible for unemployment these next two weeks.
3. My new job still has to complete a background check on me. I told them I needed to give my employer two weeks notice. I'm concerned that when they reach out and hear 6/9 as the ""voluntary"" end date they'll think I'm leaving without the two week courtesy.
4. If I explain to my new employer what happened, they might think that I was a bad employee they couldn't wait to get rid of.

I don't want my next job to be jeopardized by this - I'm not sure if I should be worried. I also don't want to be taken advantage of financially. I'm not sure what my rights are in this instance.

2: Adult Correctional Officer – good pay, great benefits, and aligns with my criminal justice degree. I’ve had long-standing interest in law enforcement, but I’m not sure I’m in the right headspace for a high-stress or emotionally draining job at the moment.

3: Juvenile detention facility – good pay, benefits, small in-house population, rehabilitation-focused, lower stress and less dangerous, also aligned with my degree and interests.

I’m torn between doing something I’d enjoy more day-to-day (but with no security), or taking a stable job that could lead to a solid career but might burn me out.

I know at this level it’ll be hard to find an internship until I’m a junior or senior, but it still would’ve been nice to get some engineering experience. I did interview with one company for a quality control internship, but I butchered it since I suck at talking (currently trying to improve that) and I wrote a follow up email afterwards thanking them for the interview and giving me a tour. I have 2 CAD certifications (SolidWorks and Fusion 360) and next semester I’ll be the flight club treasurer at my university. I update my resume for each job I apply to but I get nothing back. I have volunteer experience too, but I’ve just been thinking about trying to visit different local engineering firms in my city and ask if there’s any opportunities available at this point but I also don’t want to seem desperate. I’ve also never had a real job before and I’m currently 19 (I know sad). I’ve interned at a local airport once but they just gave me scraps of tasks like counting inventory and organizing files, although they showed me around the airport and let me learn to do a preflight and remove a magneto once (since I was also doing flight training there at the time).

Is there something I may be doing wrong or something I should do differently? Should I just work at a drive thru place or retail or something?

1l6035m,Be prepared. Always prepared.,"My spouse had been at their company for 25+ years, great reviews, well respected, and even got a big bonus due to their rating during review time. Then got a new manager who was brought in by the new CEO, and they cleared out the old guard one by one. 6 weeks later, they walked my spouse out the door and the two salary house was now a one salary house. 

It’s a common tale. We had been a two income household for 30+ years. And then one day, we weren’t. 

For the past 5 or so years, we had been banking my spouse’s salary into an S&P 500 fund. We never used it for daily expenses, just used my salary for the household. 

So when the layoff occurred, the savings stopped, but we persevered, because we didn’t allow ourselves to overextend and spent within our means. 

Hence my advice to everyone - a layoff can happen at any time to any of us, even a highly reviewed and highly respected leader like my spouse. 

Save. Save. Save. And save more. Add an extra percent to your 401K. Transfer money to a high yield savings or a mutual fund or whatever. Stop with the frivolous spending. Live within your means. Buy what you need, not what you want. That $40K car works just as well as the $90K car. And, it will work for 15+ years, not just 5-7.

1l5zje7,Put on a PIP shortly after putting in a request for FMLA,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

Hi all,

I have been diagnosed with type 1 LADA diabetes for 9 years now, taking multiple daily insulin injections as well as medicines. Recently, my new endocrinologist recommended I go on an insulin pump to help better manage it (yay!), as well as prescribed me some new medication to take. I told my boss that I would probably have to take some PTO later in the month when my insulin pump comes in, since it is unknown how well it'd work. 

As for my employment, I have been working at this company for about 3 years now, and have never had any real issues with performance or doing my job. 

On Thursday (2 days after I started taking the new medication), my blood sugar levels began plummeting out of nowhere, and I left my work shift an hour early to deal with it. Thankfully, I ended up not needing to go to the ER after having something sugary, but it happened again later that night and left me fatigued and with next to no sleep. I messaged my boss and told them I wouldn't be coming in, and they were fine with it.

I came into work today and put in a request to take emergency PTO next week, since I wanted to see my endocrinologist about what happened (and in case it kept happening). I also sent a message to my boss telling them this, and i said I might need to take FMLA if it becomes more of an issue. I also sent an email to HR to let them know I wanted to take FMLA, and CC'd my boss on it. 

A few hours later, my boss pulled me into a meeting where I was told that my PTO could not be approved since it was last minute. After about 20 minutes after the meeting started, where I was waiting for my boss to return, I get presented with a PIP stating that my work performance is below average, and states a single day from 2 weeks ago as the justification for the PIP. 

This doesnt feel right. Should I get a lawyer? Im not sure what to even do here. ",thisisagoodtempacct,9,0.8100000023841858,20,1749342930,2025-06-08 00:35:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5zje7/put_on_a_pip_shortly_after_putting_in_a_request/,6,2025

1l5xlzd,HR is ignoring me and I’m unsure how to proceed,"Hi, probably a long post as I have a lot to share.

I, 25f, have been having issues with my manager for.. a while now, to the point where it led to a complete panic attack at work that had the fire department called to check on me.

Some background is that I’ve been at my job for 3 years now. My manager is 22. I’m a hard worker and my peers have told me as much, on more than one occasion. Last October I asked my boss for more hours, to which he said he’d give them to me when business picked up. It’s now June of the next year, and during the many months in between, I’ve watched him give hours to the new hires while still keeping my hours minimal, despite telling me I’d get more. This in and of itself has been disheartening. Similarly, I’ve been recommended for and promised a promotion for the last two years, to which he would say he’d get to “the paperwork next weekend,” and it’s never happened. Over the course of two years. But I digress. 

Anyway, this work environment is incredibly laid back and chill. It’s a fine job, as far as jobs go, but my manager has been making me miserable. 

The big problem happened maybe a month ago where I covered a coworker’s shift. I did a dough pull (to those who don’t know, it’s where you take frozen pizza dough out of the freezer and organize them in dough trays, then put it in the walk-in fridge at the end of the day.) My shift lead said I could leave after I finished dishes, and since I was having a rough day, I did exactly that and left after I finished cleaning dishes in back of house. (To be clear, I also have diagnosed autism and took her words literally- that I could leave after finishing dishes.) I did leave the dough rack out, but in my mind, there were still three other people closing that night, with an hour or so left until the store closed. It just seemed like common sense that someone would put it in the walk-in when the night ended. 
The next day I come in and my boss and two coworkers are in the back, and my boss looks at me and goes, in an aggressive and accusatory tone, “Why did you leave the dough rack out last night?” I had no idea what he was talking about and said as much, and he repeated himself. I apologized and said I had been told I could leave after I finished dishes, so I did, and he went on to tell me the dough had my name on it so it was my responsibility, and began grilling me in front of my coworkers. I said to him, “This is embarrassing, doing this in front of my coworkers,” to which he said he’d “do this if it were anyone.” I felt extremely humiliated and embarrassed and attempted to walk away, to which he told me to come back because he was in the middle of talking to me. So I turned back and he grilled me for trying to walk away, then said, “I’ve never had any issues with you before, have I?” And I felt pressured into responding “No,” which simultaneously felt incredibly humiliating. After that was over and he left, I went into the bathroom and cried. An hour after that my coworker (one of the ones who’d witnessed him grilling me) gave me a hug, and I broke down again. The shift lead told me to clock out and go home, because I was basically inconsolable at that point. 

A week later, the new schedule was released and I was only scheduled for one day, which has never happened before, and I’ve been asking for MORE hours, to which I’d been told for the last few months that I would get more (but never have.) This felt incredibly pointed and deliberate, and honestly a little retaliatory, further cemented by the fact that when I went into work that day, the art I had put on the blackboard for work had been completely erased. When I messaged the work group chat about it, my boss said he erased it, and when I asked why, he said one of the higher ups wanted to promote the new catering service on it.
I’ll admit, I don’t buy that. The chalkboard will usually remain untouched for months at a time, with Halloween art and promotions being up for maybe six months, if not longer. My own artwork had not even been up for a whole month before being erased, and as of writing this, a month after the board was completely erased, it still remains blank. I spent five hours on the chalkboard art and still feel heartbroken over this in particular, and again, it feels very retaliatory towards me. 

I did what was in hindsight probably not the smartest decision and took my concerns to a previous manager who no longer worked in the company, explaining what was going on and how I felt like I was being bullied. I also explained how my boss put himself on the schedule for 40 hours and almost never showed up, and when he does, half the time he’s in the back on his laptop, and I’ve even seen him playing video games (and he’ll leave after being at the store for maybe a couple hours.) I never intended for my messages to be seen by my boss, as they were very personal, and I’ve been feeling singled out in a negative way in the workplace and was looking for the input of someone who had both worked here before and had also known my boss. Once I had gotten my advice, I thanked the person I had confided in, and that was that. 
A few days after that, when I came into work, my boss sat me down, with the manager from another store watching in on a video call on my boss’s laptop. My boss went on to tell me he was writing me up for two things: one being “insubordination” after I tried to walk away when he was grilling me in front of my coworkers. He told me how initially he wasn’t going to write me up for leaving the dough out, but he had to write me up for trying to walk away because it “set a bad example” for my coworkers. When I tried to again explain that it was horribly embarrassing being talked to like that in front of my coworkers, he said they were my superiors and would have been filled in on what would happen anyway. I shut down after that.
The other write up was for missing six of my shifts (despite covering them with doctor’s notes and being sick with a virus.) I had been sick about a month prior to this meeting, and had no idea what I did was not allowed, as I had been given no written nor verbal warning. The most I had gotten was my boss telling me if I was going to call out, I needed to either have a doctor’s note or cover my shift, the former of which I had done. He said he “had no idea” this was an issue but one of his higher ups informed him that that “wasn’t allowed,” and thus he “had to write me up.” He explained that I also had to inform him that I’d be missing my shifts, and in my defense, I had let my captains know each time I wasn’t able to make my shift and sent pictures of my doctor’s notes, and each time in the past I would inform my boss, he would ignore my messages and not tell anyone on the team that I’d be coming in. And so I told my shift leads instead, although I know now to tell my manager as well. 
He also told me he didn’t appreciate me reaching out to former managers and accusing him of “bullying” me, and when I asked where he got that info from, he vaguely told me he “knows more things than we think.” He then went on to tell me he didn’t want to hear that I had talked about these write ups or conversation with any of my coworkers or former employees, and I felt pressured to agree. (In hindsight, it felt very much like he was trying to keep me quiet.)
I felt completely blindsided by the whole conversation and after he left, I went out to the back of the building and had a complete breakdown / panic attack. I think it’s worth noting I’ve been having an incredibly difficult time in my personal life right now, and this was essentially the straw that broke the camel’s back. It’s hard for me to recall details, but I remember I had my face covered with my work hat the whole time, I remember hearing the ambulance, I remember hearing the firefighters talking to me and I remember then moving me onto a gurney. I had my mom on the phone when they arrived and she came and picked me up, and I was almost admitted to a mental hospital but my mom and I decided I’d just go home and schedule a therapy appointment. I did not go into work the next day, and that was my first time in three years doing a no call no show, which I’ll admit was not good, but given the headspace I’d been in it was hard to both care or even realize that was something I needed to address / cover.
A few days later when I came into my next shift, my boss wrote me up again for my no call no show. Which I suppose was fair, but there was absolutely no concern nor checking up on me to see if I was okay. And to be clear, I don’t need my boss’ or my coworker’s sympathy; but for him to know I went into the back of an ambulance, there was a surprising lack of concern from him, even IF we’ve been “beefing.” But I digress.

Since all of this, I reached out and explained everything to HR on May 20th, sending them an email. After two weeks of radio silence, I sent a follow up email asking if they had received my first one. It has been almost a month since my initial email, and I haven’t heard anything back; no acknowledgment email, no messages saying “hey sorry this isn’t really a big deal so we can’t do anything” or anything of the like. I feel stuck and don’t know what to do. My company doesn’t have a direct phone line to HR, and I’ve called the company and left a voicemail also explaining how I was having issues and had sent an email to HR. Still nothing. Please help me with how to move forward, or please tell me if I’m overreacting and this isn’t as big a deal as I’m making it. (But nicely please. I’m fragile.) 

Side note but I figure it’s worth adding; two years ago I admitted myself to a mental hospital in order to protect myself, and this same boss let slip to my coworkers how I had baker acted myself. I contacted HR then, and they were swift to respond. I’m unsure how things were handled, however, or what was done as a result. On smaller occasions, he would make fun of my music when I’d play it in the back which eventually led to me to stop playing my music out loud, as well as showed me a clip of a gruesome murder from a horror documentary after I told him I didn’t want to see gore and didn’t handle it well, but those are more “he said she said” situations and I know not much (if anything) can be done about them. But these examples are to show that my manager is not professional and has made me feel humiliated and embarrassed before.

I’m sure I’ve left out details, but the post is long enough as it is and I’m tired lol.

I am not here to be attacked. I just want advice on what my options are going forward, as I am at a loss since HR seems to be ignoring me. Thank you.

1l5wbqg,A career where I can speak/present in front of an audience,"Hi there,

I've worked in software sales the past 4 years and really enjoy it. I recently did a demo of our product in front of 20-30 people. It was completely exhilarating and the biggest high I've gotten after a day of work. 

It reminds me of the same feeling I had with the theater and improv I did in college. 

I'm curious if anyone has any guidance on careers I can look into that cater to this presentation style of work?

1l5vtti,Have i overreacted and should I reconnect with my boss?,"I found out my boss is involved in upcoming organizational changes which will include layoffs. I recently limited contact with him — did I overreact and should I reconnect with him?

While my main manager was on personal leave, I temporarily reported to her manager. It was uncomfortable from the start as he often tried to undermine me and make me feel incompetent. Then it escalated.

He gave me inappropriate looks — like when I walked up the stairs in front of him and when I turned my head I noticed him checking me out. The same when he was holding a door to let me in first. Other colleagues seemed to notice too, which made it even more humiliating.

During one of a regular status meetings, he insisted we go for coffee in a secluded spot. He sat very close, deliberately touching my leg and arm with his leg and arm, and leaned in so close I could feel his breath. I froze — I didn’t look at him or back away, just stayed still, trying not to show discomfort and he kept sitting like that for couple of minutes observing my reaction. 

At our next meeting, he again wanted to go to that same place. I refused and suggested a visible meeting room instead with a display so I can show him my work. After that, I started staying home during the days when w had neetings to avoid any further situations like that or even worse. He began declining the meetings entirely whenever he did not see me in the office, which blocked my progress.

Thankfully my trusted beloved manager returned, I finally got back to having status meetings with her and I was back on track with my work. He still asked me to book regular informal meetings with him so we can catch up. I didn’t. Since then, he doesn’t talk to me — just talks about me behind my back e.g. criticizing delays he partly caused.

I felt keeping distance was the safest move. If he had pushed any further, I would’ve had to react — and that would likely have made things worse. But now I wonder: was I too harsh? Did I misread the situation and should I try to rebuild some contact not to miss opportunities of my career? I'm really scared of this guy but I have great salary here and do not want to loose it in case my intuition went wrong and I am overreacting.",Sea_Engineering_1346,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1749332046,2025-06-07 21:34:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5vtti/have_i_overreacted_and_should_i_reconnect_with_my/,6,2025
1l5vohe,I’m thinking of being a Pharmacist(18yro). How may I achieve this goal quickly?,"
I just finished my Junior year of High School. I’m Brazilian, my parents brought me down a grade when we got here so I could be more familiar with English. Regardless, I’m graduating in December instead of May due to FLVS courses.

I previously wanted to be a Psychology but I noticed it might be too difficult for me since I’m younger, I’m assuming most psychologists thrive when they’re above 30 or so.

Pharmacy looks like a very interesting career. I should be starting college around the beginning of 2026(?) not too sure. I wanted to know if there’s any way I could wrap everything up in less than 5-6 years. I’m not sure if this career requires a Master’s or only a Bachelor’s. This was a very recent decision so I haven’t had much research and I’d like to hear some inputs.

I’ve heard of a PharmD. I’m assuming it’s similar to a Psy.D. I’m not sure if it’s required but I’m aware it requires 4 years. Is it possible I can get a PharmD while working on getting a Bachelors/Masters? My major issue is that I’m very concerned about the time it could take. My parents wanted me to be a Medic, but that would take very long, I’d rather not.

I would maybe like to finish everything up by the time I’m 22-26, but lets be honest I don’t think I’m getting there by the time I’m 22 💔

1l5v2p4,What’s the future look like for SWE’s? (Ai),"I want to be upfront and say I’m not trying to fear monger. This is a real concern I’m having and just want others thoughts on it. 

I’ve been a software engineer for almost 10 years. I’ve been a senior software engineer for the past 4 years. I objectively feel like SWE’s don’t really have a future. Well, not in the way we think. It’s going to take a fraction of the amount of devs to do the same job. Junior engineers will seriously struggle to find work, if at all. SWE’s will essentially become very technical product owners. The best of the best will survive for a while but if there’s no regulations put on Ai and displacing workers (in all fields) then we will end up in a scenario where people with white collar jobs end up moving to blue collar jobs where Ai is slower but surely to impact in the further future. Offshoring is also a growing problem because now companies can justify offshoring with the use of Ai. It’s not just Ai that’s the problem but offshoring that’s using Ai for next to nothing.

It’s just been on my mind lately a lot, companies are so short sighted and obviously just want to make the most money with as little overhead as possible. Not having regulations allows them to run rampant. Job displacement in general is going to be a big problem and eventually? What’s the end result? I’m continuing to upskill and learn but it feels hopeless when Ai can just learn it and do it down the road. I actually started a YouTube channel doing BBQ content and it’s grown significantly over the past year and honestly, I might just have to make that my backup plan lol. Would love to hear other people’s concern or advice on this.

Now what I’m passionate about: cheese. I’ve worked in cheese sales for 8 years now. I really do love it and I wish I had gone to school for microbiology or dairy science. I want to make cheese, eat cheese, market cheese, teach people about cheese. I’m also on the path to get my cheese professional certification through America Cheese Society.

1l5qyjp,From BM to CBDO to CEO,"Hi everyone, M32 from a city in Northern Italy (not Milan). I read you all the time :)

Back in 2018, I entered the IT consulting world as a Business Developer on €22.5k + mileage reimbursement (didn’t even know what “RAL” meant back then 😅).

After a couple of job changes, I landed in my current company in 2021, joining at €35k + company car for mixed personal/professional use.

The situation was pretty bad when I arrived: the previous 3 salespeople had all quit because a General Manager had been put in charge of managing them. So, as the new guy, I was under heavy scrutiny… Over the next year, I worked closely with one of the company partners (a former sales guy who had stepped back in due to the situation), and together we delivered great results.

About a year later, I received a very attractive offer from another company. To keep me from leaving, my company offered to promote me to Head of Sales. In the meantime, two more Business Developers had joined the team.

I had just gotten a raise to €40k, so I asked for €50k + a 10% annual RAL increase for two years (currently at €55k, next year will be €60.5k). They agreed 😎

A few days ago, I was offered the role of CEO (as either a quadro or dirigente — I’m currently at level 1) starting in early 2027, with a proposed salary of €70k. I’m thinking about negotiating and asking for €80k + the same 10% RAL growth as last time, considering the responsibility involved.

In addition to the base salary, I’ve always had access to the company car and a bonus that’s a % of EBITDA (40% of 27%, the remaining 60% is shared among other key staff).

I have two questions: •	Do you think my counteroffer sounds fair? I honestly have no idea about the typical RAL range for a CEO and came up with the number based on some research. •	The option to be either dirigente or quadro caught me off guard.

1l5qcth,Lied to/deliberately misled during the hiring process. About to send this email to my new company. What do you all think?,"Hi (recruiter-who-I-worked-with-throughout-the-entire-hiring-process),

I hope you are well.

I wanted to touch base with you regarding the 8 hours per week telework aspect of this role that I was told would be available to me once I got up to speed. (Team Lead Guy) has been training me since I started Thursday and we briefly discussed telework on the contract yesterday. Now, I want to preface by saying that I didn't expect to be able to telework in the first couple weeks, month, or (possibly) even the first few months, but I did expect to have those 8 telework hours per week available to me at some point down the road (once I was adequately trained/up to speed). However, (Team Lead Guy)'s understanding is that only those individuals who already have telework agreements/hours in place are able to telework, while new telework agreements/hours are not being given. This signifies to me that I will not be able to telework on this contract, at all, maybe ever. I'm also a bit confused, because I brought up the telework aspect of this role in our interview and he didn't mention that no new telework agreements/hours were being allowed. Needless to say, this was a very disappointing revelation for me, as I was told during the entire hiring process, multiple times, that I would absolutely have telework time available to me once I was settled in.

In my previous position with (previous company) my salary was $(old salary), so while the bump to $(new salary) is nice, it's only a 5.7% increase in salary. Additionally, I'm losing a full week of leave (I had 5 weeks at RealmOne), and (new company)'s benefits plan is more expensive for me/my family, so the salary increase is effectively even lower than 5.7% when those are factored in. Had I known there was no telework available in this position, I'm not entirely sure that I would have accepted the offer as this was a major selling point for me.

Are we able to discuss this in more detail next week?

1l5q5jt,Considering dropping out. Lost and looking for outdoor career suggestions.,"This is very detailed. Skip to the end for a kind of TLDR.

28F, previous business owner of eight years. It went way down hill after covid and never stopped, I was also severely depressed and lost my love for it. I needed a change, so I decided to pursue a degree and more stable career/business (with a lot more responsibility and consistency). The problem is, I'm completely lost and still have no idea what I want out of a degree or if it's worth it.

I did have several jobs in between, some could have turned into a career, but either the pay wouldn't be sustainable without years of employment or a second job, or it wasn't the right fit. City mail carrier and working at a Montessori school and was their social media manager, particularly. Loved both. To note, I was a valued employee in all my positions and any of my former bosses can vouch for my work ethic and skills.

I'm currently the site manager at a recycling center, which I love. Three 12 hour shifts weekly. Been here for two years, have great benefits and decent pay, two small raises a year, Christmas bonus, and I work alone most days (preffered). With having 4 days off, going to my local community college full-time worked out. 

The problem with both of these is debt. I financially can't work my day job without having to have a second part-time job, due to my insane amount of bills (a lot of dumb financial decisions early on + one year of college out of HS). So I'm able to do school outside of work, but only with the supplement of loans. I'm already at nearly 8k in debt, and I'm only 18 credits in (dropped a class or it would be 22), currently in my second semester.

I went into school with the intent of working towards my masters in Entomology. Now it's changed multiple times through weighing many different options. After all this contemplation, I don't know that racking up more debt is worth it. And the fact I still don't know what I'm doing.

With that, I'm not sure what to work towards if I drop out. With my job and adding a side job, I'll be fine for as long as I need. But I don't want to work them forever. I'm hoping to get a digital marketing position on the side, and that could play into a future full-time career though.

My only things I 100% need out of a career: being outside in or around nature frequently (something along these lines is what I would pursue out of college if I stayed) not construction or necessarily physical labor, I just need to be outside OR working remotely or hybrid to be able to spend most of my freetime outdoors or on my hobbies. At minimum, I'd like to make 40k starting. With my main job currently, I make right 35/35k. With my skills and qualifications, I think that's doable. I also prefer regular change than the same each day.

I have considered plumbing (my job is dirty, physical, and smelly, I don't mind in the slightest) and turning it into a female ran and emplyed company, but with my work schedule and those certifications available around me, it wouldn't work time wise. 

My three top choices (no degree + business certifications & research) I have considered are: starting an organization business or horticultural landscaping business, digital marketing for a business or cause I care about. But I'm looking for other potential options. Working alone or for myself is what I'm best at, but I'm good at working with others. Use of my creativity would be great too. I just want to enjoy my job and enjoy my life outside of it. Happiness and personal fulfillment is more important to me than making 100k a year.

This is already too long, so I won't go into my skills, but feel free to ask.

It's so specific, so I'm not expecting much. Just hoping someone with a cool or obscure outdoor job comes along and can help me narrow some things down and search for more specific opportunities in my area. A career advisor or coach is not obtainable right now.

Any help is appreciated!",DumbusWumbus,1,1.0,0,1749317023,2025-06-07 17:23:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5q5jt/considering_dropping_out_lost_and_looking_for/,6,2025

1l5pqb1,Am I too old to go for dentistry? (21),"Okay so I know it may sound younger, but here's my concerns.  
I am a first generation college student. I didn't start college right off the bat due to personal matters, but now I'm in my last semester (summer) and I had planned to apply for dental hygiene programs (applications due in January, programs starts every summer), so it will go along with my ""life plan"" but now things have changed and I've come to realize I can only depend on God and myself. I'm considering going the full nine yards to become a dentist, but now I feel a bit discouraged and confused because I have been praying for a job related to my field and I just got offered an oppurtunity to be a receptionist for a dental office by a family friend and they said they would put in a good word for me. The only thing is that if I take this position I most likely will have to leave about a year in bc of the program and I've been researching but it doesn't look like they offer night classes. I was upfront about it and it would look really good on my application but I don't want to make her look bad especially if she sticks her neck out for me.

Another thing: Let's say I take the position and somehow things work out, would it be in my best interest to get my bachelors in dental hygiene or something else? I'm not that great at sciences, but if it was in my best interest I could work towards it? I could also just become a dental hygienist and find other ways to make additional income. My only fears for dental school would be the debt and if I become a mother, I wouldn't want to work the first 5 years of my children's lives. I know I'm probably thinking so ahead, this is literally my first post and I don't really have anyone I could talk to this about.

1l5pn1b,Had a weird job interview.. are these questions normal?,"I had an interview last week. It was a two part interview. I basically passed the first round, they liked me, so I met with the supervisor. The first question the supervisor asked was ""why so late?"" and I thought they meant to the meeting. I guess they were wondering why I had only found this job recently since it had been posted for a while. I explained I had been applying to other jobs, too. 

One of the questions was what my parents do for a living. The pay is bad, and they asked me to basically set my own pay which I was uncomfortable with, especially since they mentioned I would start lower as I have zero experience. I asked what the average estimate was for people who had had job prior, and they responded that I should be able to decide since I'd been an employee before and have gotten hourly wages albeit for different positions. I can share other things but I feel more comfortable DMing. It would be like 9+ hour days, 1.5 hr commute round trip if lucky.

1l5p0l2,Tour an employer’s facility after applying?,"I’m just about (~2 months) to finish my time at a technical school getting some certifications I need to move into a new career path. I just recently applied with a company, and honestly it’s my dream job. If you would’ve asked me my ideal job getting into my new field, this would be it. Keeping it vague, this company provides disaster relief and uses some pretty specialized heavy equipment to do so, and from looking at their social media it appears they’ve done public open houses and tours in the past at their facility which is also pretty impressive itself.

This company is out of state (they acknowledge relocation in the job posting, so they know they’re going to be getting a lot of out of state applicants) and in about a week and a half I’m going to be in the general area for a wedding, roughly two hours away. Would it be weird to reach out to the company so see if I could set up a time when I’m close by to come see the facility and some of their equipment? Outside of even the job search, I think what they do is super cool and would love to see it. Plus, I like the idea of them being able to put a face to the name and I feel that I do very good with first impressions.

1l5otag,Corporate Copywriter Career Crisis - SEEKING ADVICE,"Hellllllloooooo!



I'm in my late twenties and I've built my career as an in-house full-time copywriter for prominent retail/fashion brands. Currently, I work as a product copywriter for a well-known women's clothing brand.



Over my career, two (of the many things I've learned): I love writing but I hate being in Corporate America. The office politics, lack of growth, corporate jargon, and unnecessary meetings. YUCK. Last week, my employer announced RTO (4 full days in the office a week). To put it simply: I. Can't. Do. It. Thinking about being in the corporate machine for the next 40 years makes me, frankly, want to throw up. I've felt this way for years now, but the RTO mandate really has made me realize it's time for a change.



The idea of Freelance Writing has always been in the back of my mind, but I've always been afraid to make the leap and give up the consistent paycheck.



Here are a few things to note/ideas I have:



1. Luckily, I would be able to get health insurance through my spouse's workplace.



2. My current salary is $73K a year. If I could make the same in freelance, that would align with my lifestyle/budget needs.



3. I would also like to open a side business reselling vintage clothing/selling my own clothes (I'm a hobbyist sewist). Hopefully, having multiple revenue streams would alleviate some of the pressure if I were between clients, etc.



4. My plan would NOT be to quit my full-time job at the jump (given how horrible the job market is), but instead to see if I could get some clients, get my side gig going, and potentially shift to full-time freelance if I see success.



5. I would plan to stay in my niche of fashion/retail writing. I have 8 years of experience.



6. I'm SCARED. I'm a risk-averse planner, so all of this scares but excites me. I have the ""dream job"" my English major-self wanted, but now that I have it, I'm low-key miserable and want to make a change.



Now, given everything I just threw at you, any and all advice would be so appreciated. I'm feeling lost and searching for some words from others who have been in a similar position. If my story sounds like what you went through, what did you learn, where are you now, what would you do differently?



Thank you so much in advance!

1l5oq6c,"Should I reject a job over the start date and commute, even though it’s a $20k salary increase?","For context, I’m about a year out of college in the marketing field, the new job would take me from around 62k to 83k (comparing total comp). I’m debating between staying at my current job or taking this new job:

Current job:

- work feels tedious and administrative 
- 8-5 schedule, 40hr work week
- 21 days PTO “bank” for vacation and sick that accrues immediately upon starting 
- Very close to where I live (15 minute walk to work, 5 minute drive)
- Boss that’s nice but hard to talk to and a little micro-manag-y
- Top heavy management, unlikely to lead to growth

New job:

- similar work, but with flexibility to take on projects I would enjoy/progress my marketing experience 
- 9-5 schedule, 35hr work week
- Boss seems flexible, nice, and “in my corner”
- 30-45 minute commute depending on traffic there and back twice a week (hybrid 2-days in, this is a commute in LA btw) 
- Smaller team, likely more growth opportunity 
- PTO: 10 vacation days (accrue after 90 days), 1 personal day, 6.8 front-loaded sick days (usable as vacation); 3.4 sick days can roll over—up to 21 total days possible, or ~17 if no rollover.
- Rushed start date, I wanted Aug 4 start, but they pushed for July 9 which leaves me with maybe 4 days break between jobs after giving notice and background check delays.

On one hand I see how this new job looks like a great opportunity on paper with the salary jump and career progression (it’s also a title jump, assistant-> coordinator). But I’m pretty burnt from my current role and the rushed start, commute, and PTO seems bleak.

1l5lu98,"I think I made it, kinda?","I found this subreddit and figured it would be the right place to put it so I’m sorry if it’s not the correct one.

So essentially I graduated University (2022) during the covid times where everyone was getting their degrees online and what should have been a hallmark experience turned into one of the disappointing moments of my life. I didn’t find any internships , didn’t get to develop a lot of friends and have fellow alumni help with job hunting. I feel like I graduated and mostly just got a degree out of it nothing else besides the fun times before COVID. My degree is in IT , I spent most of my time coding , learning about databases and webs servers. I loved it, I thought the future was going to be amazing. 

Fast forward a year later I was still unemployed and struggling to find a job relating to what I went to school for. I had one good interview with an IT company , was paraded around the office after a second interview and then just never got an offer. The guy doing the hiring ,lets call him “Boey” , seemed to really like me but I just didn’t get the position. They said they found someone better. It was for an entry level support role in IT, really basic stuff. 

A few weeks go by and I see the same company hiring for field technicians , I caved. Decided the corporate world just maybe wasn’t for me and was essentially hired on the spot for the field role due to all my previous interviews with these people. It was an awesome time , I learned a lot about low voltage installations , traveled the country , made decent money with OT and perdiem opportunities but it wasn’t enough for me. I was very dissatisfied with the fact that I went to university for programming and ended up installing televisions for a living. 

I did the install thing for a while , turns out fellow installers thought I sucked or I wasn’t good enough. I’m a small guy, it’s whatever. They moved me to service, I flourished. I’m a monster when it comes to troubleshooting and determining a point of failure. But 70% of what I was doing was still hanging TV’s. I got so good at hanging TV’s , mind you I’m 5’4 and not the strongest. But I’ll get them up there.

So I’m still not happy and they eventually figured out they were wasting my talents , very few people in the company were competent when it comes to the technical understanding of things, specifically in the AV department. Nowadays most AV installs are leaning towards IP’d devices and for a technician to do well he has to have a good understanding of the IT side of things. Out of nowhere an opportunity props up for AV support, the IT guys were getting tired of dealing with AV issues so they spawned a new department for it as the company is heavily AV oriented. 

Fast forward I’ve gotten a few raises from 16$ all the way to 24$, I excelled in my department. Did the office role on the weekdays and collected OT doing service calls in the weekend. I just wouldn’t stop working. At this point “Boey” is now my boss, I love this man with all my heart. But then we grew, exponentially , to the point where my department is slowly becoming the profit center of the company via reoccurring service fees. The sheer amount of clients we have has grown to a ridiculous amount and things got pretty rough , regardless we pushed through, hired more people and we’re still alive.

Eventually I got tired of the hourly wage, I was offered a 55k salary and rejected it knowing that I would make more with OT. I made 57k that year, not sure if it was worth it. I haven’t had an actual vacation in over two years. The experience has been amazing, I’ve traveled , met a lot of clients all accross the country and am recognized as one of the top problem solvers of the company. I love what I do and love the people I work with. 

But money was still an issue, I talked multiple times with the ceo about it and essentially was told it was up to other people in leadership positions, was given the run around for months. I was exhausted, turns out my role , what I currently do which is Av support lead, is worth around 70-85k. My teams lead doesn’t have any field experience and I attribute a lot of our success to my personal understanding of how the installations work and all my hands on experience. So I’ve always felt cheated. 

Anyways, got a few interviews started looking for other jobs and pretty much instantly companies were trying to hire me, I’d tell them all I wanted was 65k-70k and the response was “ oh yeah that’s perfect!” Funny. Ceo caught wind of me taking interviews and asked me to help him with a service call , the service call ended up being write your number on a piece of paper. I said 65k , I got it. 

For 4 years I think I’ve done an amazing job at fighting my way into a good position and decent salary. I’m constantly told no one has ever moved up the company this fast but at the same time I’m just built different. I hunger for the work and thrive in the pool of chaos and stress that is a service department. 

But then we picked up a client. A client so big so powerful that we would never need any other clients … ever again. I’ll just say this, big chain restaurants is our thing. And they started offering me OT on the salary wage which was confusing as hell. Until I went from working 6 days a week to pretty much 7 days a week. I’m told I can’t leave for a vacation or the entire thing will fall apart.

I’m losing my sanity, popping anxiety medication and drinking every day after work. I’m begging them to hire more people to my team but it’s impossible to find people that WANT to do this type of job and it also requires a lot of learning as it is an ever changing industry. My teams lead took a vacation and for the first time I broke down at work. I was the only one in my team at the office, except for the guy that shit his pants and had to leave( medical thing). I can’t leave the company , we’re small and I’ve grown to love these people. They’re all I know and care for. But I just don’t know if I can keep it up , the money situation is great but I feel like if we do a bad job and lose this big client I’ll literally off myself. 

What do I do besides beg them to hire better people ?

1l5lqvn,I accidentally put a weird message in a colleagues leaving card and I'm not sure what to do now,"A colleague of mine was moving to a different team within the organisation, and someone got a card for us to sign. I wrote the message: **""Believe me, you're much better off away from us :) Wishing you the absolute best in your new role!! :)""** — in an attempt to be funny, and thought nothing of it.

The next day, my manager posted a picture of the message in the Teams chat and asked who had written the ""weird message."" That’s when I realised I had forgotten to sign it. I immediately called him, explained that I was just trying to be funny, and that I meant no ill will by it. I apologised sincerely, but I don’t know, it seemed like it left a bad taste, especially since it was *his* manager who had flagged it.

Since then, I’ve felt very uneasy, like there’s a pit in my stomach (to be fair, that’s usually how I feel when I’ve messed something up).

Honestly, I love the team and the work I do. It’s the best working situation I’ve had in my career, and I’d hate for them to think otherwise. Looking back, I can see how the joke wasn’t well thought out, and I really wish I could take it back.

1l5l92s,[Carreer Advice] Switching to DevOps after 3 yoe with a background of Azure Integration Services,"I am confused whether this would be a right choice to do so, but I would like to explain my current circumstances first.

[[Background]]

I'm 25, Total Work ex is 3 years something. I mainly work with Dynamics 365 F&O (Microsoft ERP), my role is majorly QA, integration developer (Azure middleware such as Function apps, Logic apps majorly) ,CICD pipelines (Azure DevOps) and environment Management (Environment Provisioning which is manual activity, and POCs related to the environment etc)

[[My proficiencies]]
I am not even sure if I still count as a technical person at this point, but I don't write much code as for D365FO (Mirosoft ERP) they use x++ and I am not good with it and I don't like it, I am somewhat experienced in Logic apps and I can manage function apps in C#. I have some understanding of the networking, Azure authentication and APIs as QA I mostly test the integrations. 
And I am not a good conversational person either (like not good with Leading discussions as a Functional person).
So my entire profile depends if there is some Adhoc task, integration that needs to be done, everyday its like suspense, being overused or underused there is no proper balance. 

And I don't enjoy this profile at all, like initially I gave everything I had to move into Azure for integrations but now its like repetitive work at this point. 

Due to the D365FO ERP, technologically its not advanced at all, and my org isn't really interested to have something new either, example we don't GIT, we are still with TFS, we don't use PRs. People struggle with the code merging to understand what will the final object be. 

[[College Life]]
Before entering the job market, I was very enthusiastic about the cyber security, I was learning it but too many barriers and my skill was not even that good, Like I gave away my college years on understanding linux (debian) and basics of cybersecurity but didn't turn out that great as I couldn't land a Job in that domain.

[[Traits]]
I am like a person who has not mastered any specific technology till the end, I know bunch of things that I can name and have done something on it but my depth is really low. its like ""Jack of all trades, but master of none""


[[What I Planned]]
Since I had some understanding of the systems and didn't wanted to take too huge of a risk as there are financial dependencies upon me, pretty much tied to EMIs. I was planning for Azure DevOps, I had already started learning the Docker, Terraform, K8s through youtube etc. But at some point in time I realised, working with Microsoft is like windows guy forever. And while pursuing cybersecurity that Operating system switch had already been flipped inside me, like I don't like windows at all, everytime I open my work laptop I am straight away sad, getting to know its windows. Although I am sad most of the time but somehow I started exploring other clouds and Developed a thought ""Every cloud is same"", So I started exploring the GCP, I had taken trial of AWS as well but it didn't clicked much with me and maybe I thought to prioritise Azure and GCP for now, as my Azure is also not much deep like I know things as an integration developer.


[[Confusion]]
I talked to my mentor the other day, his advice was repetitive work will be there in devOps as well at some point in time, which is true. He told to expand my focus more on the Microsoft ecosystem. And he had also switched his carreer so he was of the opinion that it might not be easy, and I will be starting from 0 - but Since I am already had some industry level experience in some of those, so I am thinking as to build some projects and then showcase my entire experience as 3 yoe in the DevOps domain, as I have managed pipelines and all sooo...

I have given only 1 interview for DevOps uptil now and it was not good at all, but I understood what needs to be worked upon as I had done hands on ARM but I couldn't answer much on Terraform and the pipelines he was asking more on code analysis and deployment to K8s which we don't do but if do a hands on, I feel those things will be covered.

[[Question]]
I am still dangling on to mentors advice as he was the one who taught me Azure and integrations, but he is still doing the exact same thing integrations, logic apps etc. 

Should I really follow his advice, or what I was doing was somewhat acceptable and not risky?

Please let me know honestly if I should consider something else",blackslave01,1,1.0,0,1749304080,2025-06-07 13:48:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5l92s/carreer_advice_switching_to_devops_after_3_yoe/,6,2025
1l5klen,I want to leave engineering,"Im a junior in engineering (adult learner). The reason I came to college was because I needed to get real about a career and the future.. I decided on engineering because I enjoy physics. I also enjoy cardiology and neurology but not enough to continue to med school. Ive worked various jobs before this but were always $15-$20. Ive gotten my foot into several internships and Im realizing that the work culture and high stress is something I just dont want to put myself through with engineering. The school work is fine, but the job structure isnt. I understand many jobs come with stress and things you dislike, but Ive come to the conclusion “do I want to deal with this particular stress and structure in this field? “ No. And when I say stress Im talking about sexism, racism, condescending coworkers, boundaries not being respected, work piling up with no direction, many normalizing crying, engineers taking therapy sessions on the clock about the job, and just having to figure it out because “youre an engineer”. My mentor sat me down and told me its gonna be bad like this and you have to know how to navigate it and giving me advice on how to escalate things etc.. I know its dependent on your sector, but I dont want to take a gamble and job hop to find the perfect sector or job, and Im not passionate enough about engineering to deal with all of that.  Ive been thinking about switching to HR or getting a masters for clinical counseling and helping those in marginalized groups because psychology/sociology are things im passionate about as well as business. 

Any job suggestions that arent as stressful as mentioned above, inclusive environments, a decent work life balance that I can research and make sound decisions? I just want to have a career I can find meaning in, be happy about where Im starting a career and take advantage of my time in college to figure this out. I don’t care to be rich, but making atleast 60k is my goal to be able to sufficiently provide for myself. I just want to make the right decision after graduation and not regret by pushing my intuition and mental health to the side

1l5jjdg,New job offer… don’t want to screw over my current employer,"I currently work in clinical research and for the record I love my job, mainly bc I’m passionate about the work I do. I adore my coworkers and my patients, benefits are great as a public employee, however, I do not make a lot of money & there’s no growth opportunity in my role. I will never make above $60k no matter how long I stay, & they don’t honor my degrees, meaning having my bachelors & masters doesn’t help me financially or in any other way (which sucks bc I busted my butt for them). A lot of people I work with don’t have a degree.

Anyway, I have been wanting to get into medical sales for a while because that’s where the $$ is, I think my personality would make me successful there, and that’s a job where my masters degree would help me. I started applying bc I know it takes a long time to get into the industry. Well… a few months into this I received a job offer. $95k a year, work from home except for when I’m at a case, gas mileage covered, a product I absolutely would be passionate about selling, an amazing manager, literally just a fantastic opportunity.

The problem? The timing!! They have a strict July 1st start date bc they only do training quarterly and the training is the entire month of July for this quarter. I would be absolutely screwing my employer over to leave right now. I wanted to give a months notice (typical in my industry) to transition my studies to someone else, esp because they are doing so well right now and they will likely tank if I leave them abruptly with no time to replace me.

1l5ixez,I don't like my manager. Is this normal or actually toxic?,"Just ranting… but any advice is appreciated!

I’ve been at my current job for about 6 months, and while I like the *work* itself, I really struggle with my manager. He constantly makes the environment uncomfortable. 

1. He constantly tries to have small talk but not the friendly kind. It’s stuff that makes me uncomfortable like gender, race, ethnicity, and politics. There’s some comment that crosses the line.

\- One time he asked me (a young Asian woman) if I could tell when an Asian lady is young. I said I could usually tell by facial features, and he replied something like, “No you don’t, some of them dress young, wear uniforms, makeup...” It was so weird.

\- When we were talking about difficult customers, I said jokingly, “I can be mean too.” He turned to my coworker and said, “Mean woman, huh?” 

\- And then there’s the name stuff. I have a non-Western name. At first, he was trying to pronounce it right and I appreciated that. But then he kept asking in a teasing, performative way, and it got weird. He started calling me “Miss J” once (just using my initial), and I eventually snapped and said, “Please just call me by my name.” He responded with, “What’s the matter with you? I was just trying to be nice.” That really threw me off.

2. Every phone call is followed by some mocking or rude comment like “What an idiot"" and something far worse. He yells at customers all the time even when they’re not being difficult. Just asking simple questions. I work with reports and numbers, and I need focus. But it’s hard to concentrate when someone is constantly ranting just a few feet away.

He also tries to pull me into it by guessing customers’ last names, commenting on their accents, even asking where they’re from. “Is that a Vietnamese name?” “Is she the lady with the accent?” I don’t know why every conversation about someone has to involve their background. 

3. He has a kind of weird “father-son” relationship with a coworker. They talk for hours about personal stuff, life lessons, and politics (with yelling involved). He loves it when people bring him drama so he can give advice and “fix” them. He even tried baiting me with lines like “Hey, I’m a very good friend.” “You can tell me anything.” Like… no. You know my SSN. We’re not friends. This is work.

It started early on. I work in a tiny office (4 people total and we can hear each other talk) and on my first week, he and a coworker were yelling and having a long, loud personal chat in his office. I was working quietly next door, and I guess they thought I was out for lunch. When they realized I’d been there the whole time, he said, “You should knock or something to say you’re here.” Like it’s my fault for *being quiet and doing my job*? Well, I thought it is a one time thing but the non-work yelling match in his office has been happened often. I would say once every two weeks or so.

4. I recently asked to switch to part-time not because I can’t handle the job, but because I can’t handle being around *him* 40 hours a week. His constant yelling genuinely triggers me. I grew up with a mom who yelled a lot, and being in that kind of environment again brings up a lot of stress and anxiety.

When I made the request, he got very defensive. He said it was not fair since I have only been here six months and that he worked hard to get me hired. Then he started comparing me to other candidates who had master’s degrees or stricter work visas. I explained that I needed part-time or hybrid hours because the work environment is too disturbing and i feel stress to be in the office. I work with numbers and need quiet to focus. He assumed the issue was that I just do not like customers. In reality, it is his constant yelling, negativity, and overwhelming energy that make this job so exhausting. 

\-------------------------------------------------------  
I try to keep things professional. About 70 percent of the time, I steer conversations back to work. But the other 30 percent I just shut down. I avoid going to his office, don’t make eye contact, and barely respond when he tries to start small talk because it always ends up making me uncomfortable. We have nothing in common and I thought it was okay to just stick to work talk. In my previous office jobs, no one ever crossed my boundaries like this.

I’m actively job hunting now. I’ve been holding on just for the reference and experience, but I’m honestly so drained. I keep asking myself is this actually a toxic workplace? Any advice is appreciated!

Today I woke up and it felt like someone shoved rocks down my throat and my head was throbbing like a woodpecker is inside of it pecking the hell out of it. 

It’s also my birthday, too, which I told my coworker about yesterday, so now I hope she doesn’t think I called out just to celebrate that. I’m definitely not doing any celebrating today. The shitty thing is, I’ve only been working there since last month. My mom kept telling me it’s too soon to call out, Google told me it’s too soon, I even asked another subreddit and they said it would be too soon because of employee culture. 

I only work with one other woman and she has to handle everything herself. That’s why I feel horrible.

After getting a PhD I was thinking I would at least start to work a junior R&D scientist but nothing, no interview or feedback after trying for three years.

The issue is that isn't about my CV. I go and check who they hire, who is working where. Some of them are literal jokes, they have almost no lab experience, having a mediocre education, no  foreign language etc. So it isn't something I can fix, it is something totally about having connections. Perhaps my age cause I'm over 35 now, my gender etc. I'm so angry but also tired. Having a visa and going abroad is super difficult if you aim the industry jobs so that isn't also an option for now.

|Hello, I’m looking for some advice on which career direction to pursue. My background is a mix of communication, design, and support roles. I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree but ended up building my experience in graphic design, social media, and customer support, mostly with international clients and remote setups.

I’ve always been a high performer. Top call center agent at Concentrix, and recently the top image processor for a real estate tech firm. But over time, I noticed that good performance usually meant more workload and pressure, without much support. That led to burnout, and I eventually left my last job because the environment became toxic.

Here’s what I know about myself:

• I’m strong in communication and creatives.  
• I enjoy leading projects and managing tasks.  
• I work well with international teams.  
• I prefer remote work, ideally with a healthy, balanced environment.  
• I don’t want to go back to traditional corporate culture, the hierarchy, the micromanagement, and the politics aren’t for me.  
• I’m exploring virtual assistance, but I feel scattered and not sure how to position myself or where to focus.

I’d love suggestions on career paths or roles that combine communication, creativity, leadership, and international exposure, ideally remote and flexible. Is there a path that makes sense for someone like me?

I hope this isn’t too much to ask for. Thank you in advance for any insights!",caloriedeficit247,1,1.0,0,1749294318,2025-06-07 11:05:18,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5i9ak/career_advice_needed_blending_creativity/,6,2025

1l5h83a,"Need advice, wanting to quit MSc but not sure what path to take.","Hi. I'm 25F (UK based) working as a Learning Support Officer at a college. I live alone and pay my own bills. I'm not really close to family (long story) I am in the middle of completing a MSC in Psychology which I have decided I no longer want to continue. 

I've been studying part time and working full time for the past 8 months. It's been brutally tasking and challenging. I believe I have interest in Psychology due to the work I do in SEN education. However, I believe MSc was more to gain validation from my family (Science  based professionals) I want to be able to develop along those lines, but a MSc is mentally draining with no support systems in my life.

As someone with an Art background (BA hons degree) . Getting this far with a Psychology MSc has helped me understand that I am capable of a lot. Its opened my mind to understanding my self better and others. I believe i've become a better listener and I'm more inquisitive, particularly in my role at work. However I feel overwhelmed with work and studies and I actually don't see myself doing something major in Psychology.

I'm beating myself up about this decision because I'm so close to completing this MSc. But at what cost? For whose validation? 

I would appreciate any recommendations regarding paths I could take.

My mom is around 50 years old and has years of experience in education — she worked as a school principal for over 5 years and has been in teaching/admin roles even before that. She took a break recently and has been a homemaker, but now she really wants to get back to working — mainly for financial independence and to stay mentally active.

She doesn't wana do teaching /tutoring roles anymore. 

She prefers remote jobs with flexible timings. She's also open to learning new skills or getting certified if required. She's fluent in English, great at communication and planning, and has tons of leadership and people-management experience from her time in education.

1l5go44,Ruined Working Relationship with Manger - what now?,"Throw away account because zero trust in the world right now. 
Some context: I’ve changed careers a few times and every time has been the right decision. I’ve now been with a large global conglomerate for a few years. I was recently mandated to relocate for the position which required a move across the country. I was given an insane turnaround time for this to be done and expected to work my full very demanding schedule. I was buying and selling homes at opposite ends of the country.
The situation: I had a fantastic working relationship with my one up manager and felt I could trust them as  my manger and my work ally. They were on a LOA for the 6 weeks prior and week of my move. The weekend before my move our family dog dies and a dear family friend is placed on hospice as they die of cancer. My move begins and it’s extremely stressful and one of the hardest things I’ve ever experienced while in back to back meetings and being asked questions in all directions. The end of the first day I have a panic attack from the stress and anxiety. I then let the team know I need to step away from work and focus on the move because of the strain it’s putting on my mental health and I close up all my key tasks before the next day of my move begins. 
Upon my return to work, after everything that could go wrong did go wrong during my move, my manger is back in office and meets with me. Immediately their tone and attitude is a 180 from how they usually act with me. They don’t ask how I’m doing and how the move ended up they simply jump right in with reprimanding me that it was unprofessional to not leave a coverage plan, accused me of lying by asking if I spent the 5 workdays away on moving, and then told me to use my vacation days to cover the 3 non approved days I took to move. They also shared that they spoke to HR about my mental health to “get me resources”. The trust is gone and I want nothing to do with this person any longer. But I just uprooted my entire life and am not far enough in the role to ask to change.
How do I navigate a working relationship I no longer trust or want?

2 years as Software Developer. 5 years as IT Support.

I feel like changing from IT career to another career (a different sector).

Here are my reasons:

\- I am weak in coding. And I dislike it too. That's why I disliked being a Software Developer.

\- Most IT jobs have shift working hours and need to be on standby during weekends and after office hours. There may be some IT jobs with office hours but they are hard to find. Most IT Support jobs require you to work in shifts 24/7.

\- You frequently have to update yourself with the latest IT knowledge.

The thing is that I have worked for 7 years in the IT sector and I feel a bit sad to leave this sector.

Do you think I should still stick to IT career? Or is it alright to switch to another sector?

I originally went from Manufacturing Engineering in an Electrical FAB area for 4 years to this thinking it would be amazing growth and I could make an impact. It feels like the opposite of growth. Our entire program treats us like technical secretaries for releasing documents and creating PowerPoints. 

I interviewed for a Failure Analysis role for EE manufacturing last week. I wanted this badly that I studied for the interview for two weeks. I was so excited to even be studying the material for the interview…which is something I have not felt here in a while.

I am a physical therapist and I am considering asking for a transfer to a different clinic within the same company. It would be a little farther for me (about 5-10 minutes) but the clinic is brand new and the manager there is great. I like my current clinic for the most part because most of my coworkers are great but my manager is a super micromanage and I have a coworker, who likes to talk shit behind everyone's back at times.

The environment just feels very tense at times because it's an open gym and my manager likes to listen in all of our conversations with our patients. He also likes to criticize us over the smallest things. I've already talked to the manager at the new clinic and he would love to have me on board. I wanted to ask advice on how to approach asking for a transfer even though it's lateral move and a little farther. Also the new clinic is set to open in a month so it’s a little bit of a fast turn around. They asked if anyone wanted to transfer in March but I didn't consider the move until now because I’ve pretty much had it. The manager at the new clinic said they still have two spots available.

1l59rx1,Fancy title but no salary to match. Not sure about next steps,"For context I am in Canada. In 2019 I was working in an Engineering firm as a Sr. Manager for Outage Projects and took a package and quit in december of 2019. One of my friends referred me to a start up IT firm which was struggling with their PMO as they promoted their consultants to PM roles and that was causing a havoc. I joined the place until I worked out something better in my field. I also had to take a significant pay cut as I did not have any expirience in IT and this was supposed to be a stop gap role. And everything changed when the covid hit. All the engineering jobs I could find was on site and this IT job was a remote role and with a pregnant wife a 1 year old at home I decided to stick with this one. 

As luck would have it within the first three months two out of the three PMs left due to covid complications (one with family and one with themselves) and one decided to retire (without giving a reason) and all of a sudden I became the most the only and most Sr. PM. I handled all the project for three months. Worked my behind off to make sure everything stays afloat. Was working about 80 hours a week to keep everything afloat while doing the hiring for new PMs. Once new PMs were hired, I was made the director of PMO with 5K salary increase and the reason given for such a low salary bump was covid. I took the title thinking later on this will come in handy if I apply for another role. 

3ish years later this company lands a big client and the big client wants a proper SteerCo setup with sr. management on our side participating as well so I was made the VP for all implementation services and a 20K salary Increase so we can say we have a VP on the steerco. Again I didn't fuss much as they were giving me the title and my plan was to jump ship in a couple of years and thought the title will give me the boost i'm looking for. 

Fast forward to now. I have been working here for approx 5 years and as a VP my salary is 140K including the 5K bonus from last year which is literally what I was making in 2019 from the engineering job. I have been applying to other jobs but my VP title maybe getting in the way and a more senior director/VP role I only have like 5 years experience in IT (16 in total)which I think is holding me back (or at least I think is the reason) from getting any call backs. Also can't get back to Engineering either with a 5 year gap. 

Just to clear things up, the company I work for is a startup and we do implementation of enterprise software (think ERP/CRM/HR type software) for startups and small/medium size business. The PMs we have are all international and are paid significantly less than what someone in Canada would make. The new director of PMO is getting paid 110K. 

At this point I am kind of not sure what to do. I don't mind attaching my resume here either so you guys can critique that too but I cannot figure out how to to attach it here.  

TLDR: I have a VP title with a salary of a Sr. Manager/PM. Not quite sure on the next steps ",reddit_project,1,1.0,2,1749261995,2025-06-07 02:06:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l59rx1/fancy_title_but_no_salary_to_match_not_sure_about/,6,2025
1l59lzx,Unpaid commissions,"I've been at my company for 3 years. Within my first six months I brought in 2 deals, but the commission contract stated on your first three deals $5000 is subtracted from total commission.

After that unlimited. Barely made anything.
Year 2, I brought in over 10 deals, was a top performer in every aspect. I only get commission when a deal closes.

So my company closed a few of them and I ended up making a fraction of what I was expecting... anticipating these deals closing in year 3.
Year 3, my company acquires a number of assets, and continues to hire more people. All closings come to a halt as we fund this acquisition - commission people asked to hold on and trust management.

Halfway into year 3, my deals are yet to close, although I was given an opportunity to make some side commissions within the company. So I'm getting paid decently now, but still have a very large amount of money owed to me from my deals that have yet to close. Mind you... none of my deals have closed since year 2. The commissions I have made to date are considered ""advances"". As in being paid prior to closing a contract. 

When I bring up the topic of being owed money it is met with resistance, disgust almost, and ""trust us"". My company may be sold, I'm just not sure 
what to do, or what any of this means.

1l59fdh,Leaving a job early due to misalignment,"Hi all, I am M25 with a mechanical engineering background and experience in renewable energy consulting. A few months ago, I accepted a job as a digital solutions consultant for an engineering software company. I took the role thinking that learning sales would help me long-term — I wanted to build business skills and get closer to strategy and client-facing work.

But now, 2 months in, all I’ve been doing is cold calling. Literally just calls, every day. No product training, no involvement in technical discussions, no learning. I hit my quotas, but I’m not growing — mentally I’m drained, and I’ve had zero time or energy left to upskill.

I’ve tried suggesting better ways to introduce the software to the market, but management is all-in on this cold-call campaign. And in my country, it’s not even an effective approach.

I’ve come to realize that, for where I want to go, I’d be better off gaining deeper technical experience or working on real projects again — not dialing numbers for months on end.

So now I’m seriously considering quitting at the 3-month mark. I don’t have another job lined up yet, but I’ve got some savings and still live with my parents. I’m planning to use the time to take certifications, upskill, and get back into technical or energy-related roles.

But I’m stuck — would quitting this early hurt me more than staying? Is it better to cut my losses and realign now, or will this look bad on my resume?

1l57sdu,Two interviews and no call back. Job ad reposted 2 weeks after last interview. advice ?,"I applied for a job at a bank with a big internal presence. I got a call back for an interview about 1 week after applying. the interview was with the recruiter and the VP of the bank.

Overall, id say the vibe was 9/10 she was giving off the impression she liked me and so did he. He told me to expect to hear back in 3 weeks after the hour long interview. When he left, she told me expect it to actually be 2 weeks.

The very next day, the recruiter called me to schedule a coffee chat with the VP for the following week. The coffee chat felt good, didn't really talk about the job it was just a more get to know me kind of thing. near the end of the interview, she told me she had two other people to talk to (it was on a Wednesday so she meant Thursday and Friday). she said you I had her email and to email her if I ever have any questions.

I sent a thank you email at the end of that day and didn't hear back since (it's been 2 weeks and 2 business days). I sent a follow up email yesterday and no response.

1l56xa6,Promoted Above a Difficult Colleague & Now She Refuses to Cooperate,"I was recently promoted, despite having only been with the company for a year. One of my colleagues, who has been here since the beginning and is now reporting to me, is refusing to follow instructions. She often replies to emails and messages with sarcasm, which is creating tension. What complicates the situation is that she has a good relationship with our manager.

Before I took this role, her previous manager had been covering around 80% of her responsibilities just to keep the department running. She made several serious mistakes during that time — one of which resulted in some employees not receiving their bonuses. She denied responsibility, even though the Google Sheets history clearly shows she was the one who altered the data.

My question is: how should I handle this?

1l56ldr,I am really having trouble figuring out what I want my major to be.,"
Today, I met with someone who I haven’t seen in a long time. We went out for lunch. They told me about a way to become a teacher for free, and provided me with resources concerning this (it was very kind of them. They were very helpful today, I made sure to thank them and check in with/on them.) I have finally, after all this time, scheduled a meeting with a college and career counselor (which will take place in late June.) This person, who is very kind, also gave me sound financial advice/financial advice I’ve never heard before and was not aware of (I have $33k saved so far, I don’t pay rent and live with parents.) This person told me that I am good with money. As I’ve had to sign up for courses for fall 2025 (it’s not too late to, I’m just trying to figure out what the “plan” is.) I’ve been forced to think a lot more about what exactly it is I actually want to do with myself in the longrun. I’m growing older, and I feel as though I need to make a decision - I’m twenty years old now. In high school, I wanted to become a nurse. I changed my mind about this, for a variety of reasons - one being that vomit is something I don’t think I tend to handle well (I have a lot of anxiety concerning vomit, I hate it whenever I feel as though I may have to throw up or something of that sort.) I am CPR/first aid trained, but recall that when I went in for it I needed a bit more support with the more “physical” part of it than the other people present seemed to. I don’t typically take summer college courses, but am more intent on furthering my education than I was beforehand so this is likely to change in the future. I do have work experience, first was a childcare job, most recent I was a behavior tech. I will admit/note that when looking at jobs that I’ve also done a fair amount of babysitting. I have found that I seem to work best with kindergarten aged kids, elementary school aged as opposed to preschool. I’ve been depressed as of late due to home/family problems. My community college grades aren’t poor. Am in a HCOL state, may move someday but am trying to figure out what I want to do first. I admit that the salary/pay range for the jobs you can get with an associates in child development in my area aren’t terribly attractive to me, I understand that I’d have to obtain a bachelors to make the most money but am just very uncertain about everything right now. I had moved up from being a floater at my first job. I’d say that I’m introverted by technicality. 

I know that my ultimate goals are to help people, and better my community. I’ve actually been looking into volunteering as of late. I am just becoming very disappointed in myself for not being on track to obtain a specific associates degree.

1l56jt9,Feeling lost breaking into tech. Any advice?,"So I (25M) graduated with a BS in Information Systems back in December of last year and I have been procrastinating with finding a job and kickstarting my tech career.

For additional context, I never got any internships or participated in clubs while I attended college. I was worried about keeping up with schoolwork + GPA, while working long hours at my job on weekends to pay bills and what not. This, plus the way the job market is looking at the moment, and not knowing which direction to take has made me feel bummed out on thinking if I even got a chance at making it. Regardless of how long it would take. 

Despite that, I was recently looking into which specific field to go into. After some research, I ultimately chose to lock in on data analysis. 

But now I am unsure of the next steps that I should take in order to land a job in that field. So my questions are: What can I do now in order to make sure I am on track to eventually achieve that? What applications or programs do you suggest I get proficient in? What side projects could I work on to showcase my knowledge? What do you recommend I do in order to job hunt properly, as well as prepare for interviews? And lastly, any other inputs regarding anything I mentioned?

1l563s3,New job. Feeling deceived. How should i proceed?,"Just started a new job. During (and before) the entire interview process, I was told I'd have one day (8 hours) per week of telework time to flex however I wanted. This was very important to me. It was, quite honestly, one of the selling points of the job for me. If this wasn't touted as part of the job, I wouldn't have accepted, as my previous job was VERY cushy/comfortable and the pay raise was not very much (about 6%, which is nice and all, but not worth leaving where I was).

So I get in and upon asking the lead (who interviewed me!) I'm being told that the telework time is only available for people who already had it, and new telework time isn't being given. On top of that, the job seems like it's going to be quite a bit different than I expected. I expected to be doing technical stuff (i.e. linux & coding), but now it seems more like I'm going to be a liaison of sorts between different teams, and might even have to do training and presentations at some point. I'm only on day two, so I'm hoping I'm not totally correct about these assumptions, but it's not looking great...

Adding onto that, my drive is slightly longer.

I'm honestly feeling depressed, because what I was expecting has essentially been shattered, and I kinda sorta feel like I was coaxed into this job with what now seems to be false promises.

1l554at,Trying to get back in engineering after long break and not sure how to go about it. Am I screwed?,"So I left my engineering job in 2014, to start my own business. (Worked in oil and gas as a mechanical engineer from 2011 to 2014).

It took me a while to get it up and running, so although I was working on it full time, I didn't incorporate until 2016 officially.

In 2019 I was attacked by a patent troll, who got my amazon account shut down. It's a very long and crazy story, but it was a shady character who was trying to steal the patent of a product I was selling, and I got caught in the crossfire. My income was cut off March 2019, more or less. Around June 2019 Amazon destroyed over $100k of my inventory in their warehouses - I lost 90% of my assets in one day. No recourse - I tried talking to lawyers, etc.

I kept trying to get my business and amazon account back until 2020 (unsuccessfully), then the pandemic happened, and I was able to get unemployment, which lasted about a year. I officially dissolved my S-Corp in Dec 2020.

The whole reason I had left my engineering job is because my plan had always been to pursue music, but I was too lost / too much of a pussy to just do it, I suppose. But by 2018 my business was running well enough, and I could work remotely, so I moved abroad to go to music school (much cheaper than in US).

From 2018 - 2022 I was enrolled in a 4 year college music program for Composition.

The whole time I was in school I was still selling things online, and doing small odd-job contracting work.

In 2022 one of my parents had double heart bypass surgery, which happened out of nowhere, so I focused on helping them with that (caretaking).

At the same time my grandma overseas had very bad dementia, is very combative (so we can't put her in a home), and we can't leave her at home because she was leaving the gas on, accidently burning things etc - the house would have burned down for sure. So someone has to live with her to take care of her.

Since my parent with heart issues was doing it, I went over there as well to help them out and relieve them of the duties, etc.

I would like to pursue music... my whole life since 2010 has either been making money with no time to pursue music, or having time to do music, but stressed about money. (I tried working on it on off hours as an engineer. I was up at 6:30am and back at home done with dinner around 7pm... I was just dead by then, would spend an hour or two to just recover, before washing up and sleeping for next day. I did push through that and tried to work on music in those hours, but after a whole day at a engineering firm staring at a computer, my brain was fried and I had no bandwidth to focus on much).

So right now I have a $45k debt from trying to make the music stuff work.

So I'm pretty much screwed it seems.

Not sure what to do.

(I'm pretty sure no engineering job will take me either way (whether I put I was taking care of family, or make it seem like I was self employed from 2020 to 2025). Not sure how to frame my resume... working on that now. I've gotten my Security+ cert while taking care of family, and have applied to hundreds of jobs in cybersecurity, IT, and help desk, over the past 6 months. No responses. Trying to revamp my resume now, to pivot back into engineering, since I already have experience there.))",ChiefRunningCar,1,1.0,1,1749248215,2025-06-06 22:16:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l554at/trying_to_get_back_in_engineering_after_long/,6,2025

More recently, I was accepted into university for a hearing aid practioner program. I started working for an audiologist and she was an absolute tyrant so I went back to the vet clinic again. Living in my small Canadian city I have no other options for mentorship to facilitate my university program and need to un enrol. Moving is not an option as my partner owns a business here.

I love animals but do not wish to pursue RVT as the amount of on-call evenings, weekends, and holidays required are astronomical and so is the dismal compensation in my opinion.

So as the title says I graduated with a BS in information studies back in 2020. I have not used my degree at all, since when I graduated it was the hit of Covid and I didn’t have a job lined up or anything, but my family owns a restaurant that got effected heavily by COVID. So I decided to pick up the slack and work for my parents and that’s what I’ve done for 5 years now, but this shit isn’t a career and we plan to sell the business since it’s not fun or easy.

Right now I’m on the side learning about the skill set of being a data analyst since ik that relates to my degree. So I’m learning SQL along with the specific excel stuff and Power Bi.

It’s not like I’m fully ready to dip on the restaurant even if it sold. I wouldn’t feel qualified or ready for anything, but I also don’t wanna fully start over.

1l53mmq,Need advice for career path. ty!,"Hello, I’m looking for some advice on which career direction to pursue. My background is a mix of communication, design, and support roles. I graduated with a Civil Engineering degree but ended up building my experience in graphic design, social media, and customer support, mostly with international clients and remote setups.

I’ve always been a high performer. Top call center agent at Concentrix, and recently the top image processor for a real estate tech firm. But over time, I noticed that good performance usually meant more workload and pressure, without much support. That led to burnout, and I eventually left my last job because the environment became toxic.

Here’s what I know about myself:

•	I’m strong in communication and creatives.
•	I enjoy leading projects and managing tasks.
•	I work well with international teams.
•	I prefer remote work, ideally with a healthy, balanced environment.
•	I don’t want to go back to traditional corporate culture, the hierarchy, the micromanagement, and the politics aren’t for me.
•	I’m exploring virtual assistance, but I feel scattered and not sure how to position myself or where to focus.

I’d love suggestions on career paths or roles that combine communication, creativity, leadership, and international exposure, ideally remote and flexible. Is there a path that makes sense for someone like me?

However, I would have to commute 3,4, or 5 days a week to get to my internship (I work 9-5). Should I stay in the city and feel miserable and unsafe, or have a great life outside of work with a long commute?

1l52b3o,Employers: Would you be interested in a platform connecting you with formerly incarcerated candidates actively seeking work?,"Hi everyone,

My team and I are exploring the development of an online marketplace that would connect employers with job seekers who have criminal backgrounds and are actively working toward reintegration.

**The concept:** A vetted platform where formerly incarcerated individuals can showcase their skills, training, and commitment to employment, while employers can find motivated candidates for open positions.

**We're curious about your perspective as employers:**

* Would this type of platform solve any current hiring challenges you face?
* What would make this appealing from a business standpoint? (We're thinking: lower turnover rates, access to motivated candidates, potential tax incentives, etc.)
* What concerns would you have, and what features would address them?
* What industries/roles do you think would be the best fit?

**Some potential benefits we've identified:**

* Reduced turnover (studies show formerly incarcerated employees often have higher retention rates)
* Access to motivated workforce often overlooked by traditional recruiting
* Potential tax credits and incentives for fair chance hiring
* Streamlined background check/disclosure process
* Support resources for both employers and employees

This is purely in the research phase - we want to understand the real needs and concerns before building anything.

Would love to hear your honest thoughts, both positive and negative. Would this be something of interest to you? What would make this valuable for you as an employer? Please feel free to let us know in the comments!

Thanks for your time!",Maximum-Reference-93,1,1.0,1,1749240953,2025-06-06 20:15:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l52b3o/employers_would_you_be_interested_in_a_platform/,6,2025
1l5286p,Demoted at work after 18 years. Should I take it?,"So I first posted about this situation a few months ago and now it has come to a head. I have been working for the same company honorably for 18 years and 7 years ago I was promoted to head of a department. I've always received glowing performance reviews and have great relationships thoughout the company. My team is often ahead of the other teams when it comes to revenue or other KPIs.

Last summer my boss got a new boss. The boss's boss, let's call him H, decided for some reason that he didn't like me. This happened after I experienced some personal issues at home where my spouse became extremely ill but I didn't even take any time off. Back in March, H held a surprise meeting with HR and me (but excluding my direct manager) where he accused me of being unprofessional and not knowing how to be a manager. He said that, if I disappeared for 6 months, no one in the company or on my team would even notice the difference. He accused me of sending rude messages to other employees or being unprofessional, when these things were demonstrably false.

H then went on several vacations and I didn't have follow-ups with him. My direct boss said I'm doing a good job and, even though I was never told what I was doing wrong in so many words, I tried to anticipate what H might want by coming up with more reports and doing more meetings. Because no one else would and it was required of us, I worked all of memorial day weekend when that took me away from my family.

Today, two months later, out of the blue he calls a meeting with me and says he's been watching me and I haven't lived up to standards (again, no word on what the standards I was missing are) and he's firing me from my job. I should point out that H doesn't even work in the same office as me and is rarely even in the same meetings as me. I never ever see him.

Firing someone this way also violates company policy. This is in contradiction to the company handbook that says all employees who are subject to discipline must get a Performance Improvement Plan with specific deliverables and 60 days at least to deliver them. The PIP must be administered by the employee's line manager whereas my line manager, who likes my work, was deliberately left out of all meetings.

As a ""kindness,"" they offered me a job working for whatever person they choose to replace me. I would take a pay cut of more than 30%, be demoted two levels, and have no direct reports anymore. I told them I would take the job.

I have spoken to an employment lawyer and he does feel I have a case to sue, particularly since this treatment seems to align with my wife's illness and I'm over a certain age. But I'm inclined to take the job because, to be honest, I can't emotionally handle sitting home unemployed and it's unclear how much severance I would end up with as a result of getting a lawyer involved.

But I just have to say that I feel like garbage. If I had any pride, I'd not take the job, but sitting home is very bad for my mental health. At least this gives me some time to put my resume out, but now my resume looks like I've been massively demoted.",Necessary-Cup9400,60,0.949999988079071,55,1749240751,2025-06-06 20:12:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l5286p/demoted_at_work_after_18_years_should_i_take_it/,6,2025
1l51qzo,I keep getting fired..,"I’m in that cycle where I just constantly keep getting fired no matter how hard I try. For reference I am a 21 year old student on a gap year trying to save up some money for school but I just never make it past a certain mark. It would always be during the probationary period as well, where at a certain point, employers just decide that I’m not catching up to things quick enough. One employer fired me within a week. I just don’t understand, I’m always early, I’m very friendly, customers seem find me very helpful, I pick up on certain tasks rather quickly, I never have sick days, I’m willing to work overtime, I try to go above and beyond- yet it seems that whenever I’m not learning something quickly, and I mean in a timeframe that a regular person might also not get it— I will be discarded no matter what. It would get to the point where I would be so desperate.. I would make notes, study for hours, actively try to listen to things, try to take charge and travel long harsh routes just to be let go. And when I’m let go, it is always very humiliating. I always fall in the pattern where I’d have passive aggressive employers who just constantly belittle, outcast and make me feel unintelligent. I’m just so tired of this. I just want to be a normal person and have a job that’ll last. I do know that i am not the quickest learner but can’t anyone see that I’m trying?

1l4zyar,What would you do if you were in my shoes ?,"Hey everyone, I’m a 19M from India, and I’m looking for some insights from people who’ve been in a similar place. I’ve just finished high school and will be starting college soon, but the truth is I have no idea what I’m doing with my life.

A little about me..

I love the outdoors and wish to see the world someday, Engineering doesn’t excite me at all, but it was the best option I had out of the lot. And when I mean ""best option"" I mean that it's the only one that give you a 'chance' to earn well. In India, when you say “engineer,” people immediately think of software. Naturally, computer science is the most popular choice. But the more I’ve looked into it, the more I know I’m going to hate it.

It feels like most people pick engineering because it’s the only “safe” path forward, and I really don’t want to follow the herd. I can’t bring myself to care about CS or any of the other engineering branches I’ve been offered. Elders push my concerns away quoting that ""In India you complete engineering and then you decide what you'd want to do in life"" and I hate it so much, I don't want to be them.

Right now, it feels like I’m on track to waste four years of my life, and that thought just eats at me. But at the same time, there’s this other voice in my head saying, “You don’t really have a choice,” or “Maybe this is how life works, you hate it at first, and then you get used to it or even start to like it.”

I've been jack of all trades master of none my whole life, and fear that I'll end up mediocre in life too.

Honestly, it’s all a mess in my head.

What I’m really trying to figure out is how to figure out my niche, especially when I haven’t had much real world exposure to the activities that interest me. The most I can do right now is surf the web, read stories, or watch people talk about their journeys.

1l4zopo,Quilts after leaving a job!!! Help!,"Hello there, I’m really needing some guidance as I am feeling extremely guilty and anxious about starting a new job. So I work in real estate for a backstory. I only recently started in this industry about a year ago maybe less. I recently had another management group approach me about getting a manager position, mind you I am only 21 years old and it has always been my goal to be a manager in this field before 22. 

I went and did my interview the same day that they had approached me, and got my offer the next day. However, because this is all happening so fast my current employer has no knowledge of this happening. Besides an email I will be sending of my resignation.  I’m wondering if I should mention it today as it is Friday, or wait until I send the email on Monday.

I genuinely love the team that I work with in the property that I work at currently and have had minor issues with managers, however, I am feeling guilty and anxious. Is this possibly due to it being so fast? Mind you, I was approached on Tuesday, interviewed Wednesday (later in the day as I had work), and got my offer after time Thursday, all of this happened in the course of really 2 days. It is an amazing opportunity as I do get a six dollar raise almost a $10,000 bonus my own office, and get a higher my own team.

Office admin and social service work. A lot of it was decisions I made to make my parents happy. I recently finished my second diploma a couple of months ago. The last few months of it was hell between doing a full time internship (it had an unpaid internship involved as part of the program), working at my job part time and then trying to be the emotional support vessel for my perpetually depressed friend. I was working 8-12 hours a day six to seven days a week. Long commutes. It was exhausting and it completely sucked the joy out of me. But when I finished it all I couldn’t be happier. I could finally get back into my hobbies and experience joy again. It’s been a few months and my job is sucking the life out of me.

1l4xj5s,Seeking advice for my girlfriend (27F) — she's overwhelmed and could use a new direction,"Last night my girlfriend completely broke down in bed, and it’s clear the weight of the future is really pressing on her. I’m doing everything I can to support her, but I’m also feeling pretty helpless right now.

She’s a European immigrant who came to the U.S. seven years ago on a work visa as an Au Pair. Her first placement was with a wealthy family in the Northeast who treated her incredibly well. Even though she hadn’t seen them in about four years (since she moved south with her now-estranged husband), they recently came to a resort about 90 minutes from us and generously paid for a very nice hotel room so we could come visit and spend time with them.

Unfortunately, her soon-to-be ex-husband financially wrecked her — ruined her credit, drained her savings, and left her in a really tough spot. She was also working for another wealthy family down south who emotionally and mentally abused her. She was averaging 70+ hours a week as a nanny, making great money, but it was breaking her down. I eventually convinced her to leave for her own well-being.

Currently, she’s working for a kind and respectful family about 45 minutes away. They treat her well, but even though she’s incredible at what she does, she’s feeling stuck and desperate for a change. She’s one of the hardest working, most compassionate people I’ve ever met, but right now, at 27, she feels like a complete failure — which couldn’t be further from the truth.

She’s been interested in becoming a phlebotomist, but the pay in our area is really low and not a sustainable option. I’m also in the middle of a major career shift myself, doing an unpaid apprenticeship while balancing joint custody of my two kids — so I can’t offer financial support at the moment, though I want to help her however I can.

I’m really just looking to brainstorm realistic ideas and career paths she might consider. Something that could give her a sense of progress and direction while still being practical given our current situation. Any advice, creative ideas, or encouragement is welcome.

I finally found a position with a family run business to get some work experience but in the end it wasn’t really for me as a lot of the time I wasn’t learning about electrics and after a year and a half self employed and on poor money I could not continue. I am now employed again which is easier financially but I am really not enjoying what I am doing and don’t see it going anywhere.

1l4vgwc,"Am I being quietly pushed out of my job, or am I overthinking it?","Hi Reddit, I'd really appreciate some outside perspective here. Some friends think I’m being paranoid, others think I’m right to be concerned.

Using a throwaway as coworkers use Reddit.

I’ve been at this small marketing company for about 10 months. Things started off rocky: I was hired as a specialist, but the role turned out to be more of a 360 consultant. I was clear in interviews about wanting to specialize, so I pushed back and had meetings with my manager about it, but eventually accepted the broader role, though I couldn't help but feel disappointed. 

Then, 4 months ago, I had a serious health scare and had to take 2 weeks off at short notice. It was bad timing for the team because it was during an intense period of high workload, and I still feel bad about it. 

Manager and I decided that I would go part-time for 6 months as I was still recovering. During that period, despite not being at 100% health-wise (I am now, but it took a while), I gained motivation again and worked really hard: took on a ton of work, even put in unpaid hours, and got praised in 1:1s. 

My manager said she wanted me to be the point of reference in my area, which felt like a turning point.

Then a new hire (let’s call him T) joined 3 months ago, also a specialist in said area (it's only the two of us). I welcomed him at first, but quickly noticed things:

* Management *adores* him, the favoritism is obvious as we're a small company. Within a week, they were talking about vacationing together.
* Despite what my manager told me in our 1:1, she made him the point of reference.
* I was removed from my favorite project (they knew this, as I had asked to stay in it during my 1:1s) and replaced by him.
* Manager barely acknowledges me now. She used to check in regularly (she does with all of us), now she avoids me unless absolutely necessary. Doesn't even say hi back when I enter the office.
* In a recent team meeting about learning goals, everyone got input except me.
* Despide multiple days being available in our calendar, she chose my first day of vacation to schedule a team building, saying ""sorry OP I know you can't attend""
* There's a ton of work T is already drowning in, meanwhile, I haven’t been assigned anything meaningful myself.

For added context, I go on holidays in 3 weeks that I booked a year ago, which she's always been aware of. 

Now I barely have 2-3 hours of work a day (I'm getting paid for 5 hours a day), while he seems to be getting all the projects I used to handle. Friends say it makes sense because I’m still part-time and about to go on holidays, so it wouldn't make sense to include me in new projects now, but… it really feels like they’re phasing me out. 

There is a ton of work where I could help out, and I've expressed it myself, but they completely ignore me.

1l4v5f9,What are some GREAT jobs in the criminal justice field??,"I am currently a junior in college studying criminal justice. I had plans in high-school to do forensics and I still wish I would have studied it. I moved two hours from home after high school for college, I couldn’t do it and moved back home and enrolled to a school nearby. The problem was that this school is more catered to doctors, nursing, vet programs. They have no forensic classes AT ALL. The criminal justice program itself is very limited there. I graduate December of 2026, so I don’t have a lot of time.

I planned going to law school after, but can never really focus on that as I work two jobs just to pay my bills and survive. I don’t live off my parent’s money although I wish I could. I am moving out of my dad’s house in August so these jobs I have will have to stay as I will have rent. 

My main job is a law office, working for an attorney and i’ve recently felt like maybe law school isn’t for me. I even thought of being a paralegal and that’s basically what i’m already doing here. I do not want to be a paralegal forever or really at all if I’m being honest. 

I just know that the criminal justice field pays close to nothing in most jobs offered. I really do have interest in forensics, detective work, anthropology, etc. I’ve never worked around those jobs so I’m just assuming that I would be interested. 

My question is, what are great jobs that pay good? I don’t want to have to work two jobs forever. My boyfriend makes decent money, but it’s not enough to keep us both afloat + when we have children, I want to be able to provide them with everything they need without having to work 80 hour weeks like I do now.

1l4t2qq,4 months pregnant and manager told me to I’m “free to leave” if I want a promotion (UK),"We recently did a company-wide survey, which showed that 40% of staff are unhappy with the opportunities for career progression. My manager was told to have a chat with our 3-person team about the results, and the ensuing convo was incredibly defensive and awkward.

I've been in my role as an exec for 3 years and asked what the framework would be for me to be promoted to manager. For context, I travel to Asia and South America alone on business, manage 50+ accounts and consistently hit sales targets - so I'm hardly a junior team member. (I also have genuine friendships with other members of our department, and I'm honestly not a pain to work with.)

My manager told me there's absolute no scope for any promotion as we need ""junior positions"" in the company. Then, to add insult to injury, she said I should ""see it as a positive"" that I'm ""free to leave"" whenever I want. 

I'm 4 months pregnant, which she knows, so obviously not in a position to find a new job for the foreseeable future.

1l4rreb,Looking for advice from others navigating tricky leadership dynamics — especially in marketing or creative roles.,"Yesterday, our COO was looking for me around noon, but I had already left about 30 minutes before my scheduled PTO started to catch a flight (trying to beat airport traffic). I’m a salaried employee, and I had communicated my half-day in advance. I keep my team and leadership informed — even though I rarely get responses or acknowledgment.

The environment is chaotic. Meetings are often thrown on our calendars last minute with no heads-up. Today, she added a meeting during a clearly blocked time on my calendar. When I mentioned the conflict, she basically said “too bad, so sad” — it’s the only time she had.

She micromanages constantly, but the kicker is: I get zero guidance or support from my actual boss, who goes completely MIA for weeks at a time. So I’m stuck between a micromanaging exec and a ghost boss, trying to hold everything together.

I’m doing what I can to stay professional — I even offered to move my 10am 1:1 to make room to talk first thing tomorrow — but I feel like my mental health is tanking. I’m exhausted, constantly overextended, and it’s starting to feel unsustainable.

For those who’ve been here:
	•	How do you navigate a micromanager while protecting your boundaries?
	•	How do you manage up when leadership is either overbearing or completely absent?
	•	And how do you keep your mental health intact in an environment like this?

1l4res9,Petroleum Engineer at Crossroads: ONGC Govt Job vs. IT Switch for ₹5Cr/10Y Goal. Brutal Advice Needed!,"
I'm a recent BTech Petroleum Engineering graduate at a career crossroads, and I could really use some honest advice from industry insiders. While everyone keeps saying ""oil and gas will last 100+ years,"" the job market for fresh petroleum engineers tells a different story.

**My current options:**
1) **ONGC AEE Route**
- 18 LPA starting salary
- Government job security
- Only about 20 vacancies nationwide this year
- Concerned about slow promotions and automation reducing future roles

2) **Transition to IT/Software**
- Lower initial pay (3-4 LPA)
- Higher earning potential long-term
- Better global mobility (especially Dubai/Middle East)
- Could combine with my engineering background

**My harsh reality:**
- Sent 200+ applications to O&G companies - just 2 interviews
- ONGC appears to be the only viable entry point for petroleum grads in India
- Seeing more automation and leaner engineering teams across the industry
- Most entry-level positions demand 2-3 years experience I don't have

**Questions for those in the field:**
1) Petroleum engineers: Are companies actually hiring fewer engineers despite the industry continuing?
2) Is gambling 6 months on ONGC prep worth it for so few seats? Or should I pivot to IT immediately?
3) Anyone made the switch from petroleum to tech? How did you market your engineering background?
4) From your experience, which path offers better 10-year earning potential to reach 5Cr+?

I'd be incredibly grateful for any advice - especially from those who might know of unadvertised opportunities or alternative paths for petroleum engineers. If anyone's company is hiring or knows someone who might be looking for a motivated petroleum grad (willing to relocate anywhere), I'd love to connect. The job search has been tougher than I ever imagined when I chose this degree.",Acrobatic-Tax-3718,2,1.0,0,1749213672,2025-06-06 12:41:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l4res9/petroleum_engineer_at_crossroads_ongc_govt_job_vs/,6,2025

I don’t have close family or friends to turn to for this kind of advice, so I’m reaching out here — please be kind.

I’m 29F, starting over, and hoping for some outside guidance.

I have a BA in Sociology with a Business minor. I graduated during COVID, so I never had the typical post-grad career start. I ended up in the film industry as a project coordinator, working 15-hour days for 2.5 years until the writers’ strike halted everything.

I briefly worked in emergency management doing operations coordination — it was great but temporary. Then I took a role on a development site that unfortunately collapsed due to financial issues.

Now, the job market feels flooded and pay has dropped. I live in BC, Canada (high cost of living), and I don’t have connections or family support to lean on — I’m truly trying to build on my own.

I’ve recently committed to a 2-year full-time Operations Management program, hoping to pivot into logistics and higher-level coordination in sectors like healthcare, government, or retail. 

What I am hoping to ask is- is there anything I should be weary of!? 
Based on my experience are there other careers you would recommend? 

I don’t think AI can completely take over but I could be wrong 

There always fires to put out which is exciting for me.

But I’ve never been happy about my job nor the university I graduated with. I think I found them cheap like the university was very easy and should’ve switched while I can but I didn’t. 

So nevertheless I did graduate. Now, last year I joined grad school for computer science to get a masters degree. But my work didn’t agree with me expecting long hours of work. So I switched jobs just to get another job at another city not wanting me to live the city I work. So my grad school dream is basically dead. 

I don’t know what to do. I make good money wise but the job is %0 satisfying for me. I can’t convince my family to just leave and do a masters degree or I can’t even convince them to just leave my job to find a better one. I’m stuck with daily office nightmare and I’m getting constant micromanagement by my superiors. I told them I didn’t like the job and should switch teams but they didn’t agree and expect me to work better first. I don’t believe my superiors tbh because they constantly being lying to everyone giving unrealistic promises and not keeping.

1l4me3q,Why Switch To BSNL ?,"**Why Switch To BSNL?**

 

In a telecom market dominated by private operators, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited ([BSNL](https://bsnl.co.in/)) continues to be a relevant and competitive choice for many Indian consumers. As a government-owned telecom service provider, BSNL offers several benefits that make it an attractive alternative - particularly for users seeking affordability, wide coverage, and reliability.

**BSNL’s core vision** is to deliver **affordable, reliable, and seamless connectivity** to customers across the country. A key objective is to provide **budget-friendly recharge plans** while ensuring **uninterrupted network coverage** nationwide.

According to reports, **BSNL’s scam protection and data** [**security measures**](https://bsnl.co.in/enterprise/securityservices) are **stronger and more dependable** compared to other telecom operators, reinforcing its reputation as a **trusted and secure network provider**.

To address challenges and improve user experience, BSNL has taken several steps to **enhance its customer service and strengthen its network infrastructure**, ensuring better services for all users.

**In this blog, we will explore the key reasons why switching to BSNL is a smart choice today.**

**1. Extensive Rural Coverage**

One of BSNL’s most significant strengths is its broad network reach, especially in rural and remote areas. While other operators primarily focus on urban and semi-urban markets, BSNL has a strong presence in regions where other networks are either weak or unavailable. This makes it an ideal choice for customers living in or frequently traveling to less-developed areas.

**2. Cost-Effective Plans**

BSNL is well-known for its economical mobile and broadband plans. Whether you're a prepaid or postpaid user, BSNL offers a variety of data, voice, and bundled services at prices that are often lower than those of private competitors. Long-term plans with generous data limits or unlimited usage are particularly appealing to budget-conscious users.

**3. Government-Owned and Service-Oriented**

Being a public sector company, BSNL operates with the objective of service over profit. This often translates to more stable pricing and a focus on essential services rather than aggressive marketing or frequent tariff changes. Customers who prefer supporting government-run enterprises may find this appealing.

**4. Reliable Broadband via Bharat Fiber**

BSNL's [Bharat Fiber](https://bookmyfiber.bsnl.co.in/) (FTTH) broadband service has become increasingly popular, offering high-speed internet at competitive rates. It is especially valuable in towns and semi-rural areas where private internet service providers may have limited presence.

**5. International Roaming and Special Services**

BSNL provides international roaming and other essential telecom services in regions where private operators might still have gaps. For frequent travellers or users in border areas, this can be a key advantage.

To improve its services and enhance user experience, **BSNL has introduced several new features**. These include a dedicated [**WhatsApp channel**](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VbAFLUt3LdQPbQXExp3I) for customer support and updates, as well as **BitV** and **IFTV** services to provide entertainment options to its users.

BSNL remains committed to **connecting people across the country and beyond** by offering **affordable and reliable connectivity**. Whether it’s through mobile services, broadband, or entertainment, BSNL ensures that users can **stay in touch with their loved ones anytime, anywhere**.

In addition, BSNL also provides **cost-effective** [**international roaming**](https://bsnl.co.in/mobile/internationalroaming) **plans**, helping users.

BSNL continues to stand out as a reliable and customer-focused telecom provider in India. With its strong network coverage, especially in rural areas, affordable plans, and growing range of digital services, it offers great value to users across the country.

By constantly improving its infrastructure and introducing user-friendly features like WhatsApp support, entertainment services, and economical international roaming, BSNL is working to meet the needs of modern users while staying true to its mission of providing seamless and affordable connectivity.

If you're looking for a dependable and cost-effective telecom service, **switching to BSNL could be a smart and meaningful choice**.",Nice_Nothing4562,1,1.0,1,1749194617,2025-06-06 07:23:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l4me3q/why_switch_to_bsnl/,6,2025

1l4k55f,What would you have done in this situation?,I had been with my employer for nearly five years but for a multitude of reasons they kept moving me around to different locations and changing my job and schedule. So I went to get a new job and turned in my two week notice. Then as soon as that happened I realized I lost all my accrued vacation which was a lot for me at least. So they gave me the option to step down to one day a week and then take some of my vacation. Well I took it all and then quit effective immediately it isn’t a company I would go back to and I severed ties. Not to mention since everything is at-will. But they are all mad now that they paid it out and I quit on them. Look I earned that vacation and it as accrued and technically I didn’t break company policy because I took it before I quit lol. So they paid me out without paying me out lol…they just made it seem like they are just appalled I did that! When in all honesty when they gave me the option of instead of saying my first notice was final…they said I could step down and I made it abundantly clear I would be taking my vacation then leaving. Would you do the same? I feel like you have to look out for number one and I did nothing illegal and they are all offended I took my own earned vacation and left them. I don’t think they would pull it out either not to mention that is highly illegal and considered wage garnishment given that they are a fairly large company who can afford to pay me I doubt they will. How would you have handled it? I felt like they were being petty about the entire thing.

1l4jxcr,Guilt-tripped by boss after submitting two weeks notice,"I work as an engineer for a small startup. I have a lot of institutional knowledge, but I’ve wanted to leave for some time due to general unhappiness and burnout from being taken advantage of (this is my first job out of my PhD).

I’ve been here nearly 3 years, and lately have felt like I haven’t been able to do much. My voice is not heard and my opinion or feedback is often overlooked. I have two bosses that are only remote and lack compassion or care (working 12+ hours, no paid dinner or Uber, etc.)

I know this is a toxic environment, and while I care about the project, I recently accepted a job offer in a field more directly related to what I want to do. Is it my dream position? No, but it pays better, is easier, and has room for growth/diversification.

I was initially hesitant, but realized I need to move on to overcome burnout and try something new. I gave my two week notice today, and my boss called me not 10 minutes later. He began asking me if I could stay until September, push out my start date or just bail on the offer I signed. He then told me 2 weeks isn’t enough, that the company will fail without me, that I’m burning bridges and won’t get a reference letter, and it bothered me. I have done so much for this project and the potential attack on my character for a lacking reference letter is frustrating.

I told my boss I’ll talk to him tomorrow, but I’m dreading the idea of it. I think it’s irrational to think that one person can ruin my early engineering career just out of spite and vileness.

1l4jdjh,Do I tell my boss about a job offer?,"Sorry for the long post but wanted to add context.

Background:

I’m an engineer coming up on 5 years of experience since college. I’ve been the with same company for nearly 4 years (my current employer acquired my former employer a few years back)

At the beginning of the year, my manager at the time (two levels above me) told me they were leaving once performance reviews were complete and bonuses were paid. They told me it was a good opportunity for me to step up and lead the younger engineers on the team. A few weeks after bonuses were paid, another engineer (same title, less experience) left unexpectedly, leaving the team shorthanded. 

Since my manager told me they’re leaving, I’ve effectively been managing the younger engineers. Once both my manager and the other engineer left, I had a call with my current manager, who I have a solid  relationship with, as they’ve been the team leader since the acquisition and were my manager a few years ago. I told them I’ve been acting as a manager and mentor to the younger team members and I deserve to be promoted to manager. One of the younger team members even vouched for me as their manager, something I did not prompt them to do.

Long story short, after I asked to be promoted, I was told I would have to wait until my ex-manager’s position and the other open position are filled. My current manager told me I go above and beyond what is asked of my position and that I deserve a raise, but the positions needed to be filled and those salaries need to be figured out before I receive a raise. Considering that the departures were unexpected and our team is thin, I accepted company leadership’s plan. The issue is the hiring process has been extremely slow, which has left our team scrambling and overwhelmed. I wake up every day stressed about work and while my responsibilities have increased, I have nothing to show for it.

I recently got an offer in the same industry but a much different company (wasn’t actively looking but a recruiter reached out). It would be a 35% raise in a senior role. I like the relationships I’ve built in my current role, and I’ve definitely made a few lifelong friends, but I feel like I’m not respected. I’m on the quieter side and used to have trouble speaking up at work, and I get the feeling that when the acquisition happened, I was seen a non-leader and put into a box I haven’t been able to get out of even though I believe I’ve grown tremendously in the last few years (my performance reviews back this up). My old manager agrees and thinks my current manager and their boss don’t see me as a leader, and added that if I was going to get the raise and promotion, they would’ve given it to me when I asked.

Even though I feel like I have something to prove at this company and don’t have a strong desire to leave, I don’t see myself there long term. Once we fill the positions, it will alleviate the pressure the team is feeling, but the last few months haven’t been enjoyable and are making me reconsider where I am. 

Do I tell my manager about the offer and give them the chance to counter?

How much can you grow in this field compared to IT? Cuz as far as I've heard, in IT your salary increases in proportion to your experience. Is it the same in digital marketing or is the ceiling way too low compared to an IT job?

1l4hmqx,Should I stay at my current job for a globally known company or take an offer for a career progression and salary increase at a much smaller company?,"I'm genuinely torn between staying at my current job or taking an offer for a new job.

Job 1:

\- Total Comp $171k (70/30 split), $120k Base

\- Car allowance: $7,500/yr

\- Annual Bonus: 20% base salary

\- RSUs

\- I live 3 minutes from the office (I prefer office work over remote work)

Job 2:

\- Total Comp $228.5k (70/30 split), $160k Base

\- No Annual Bonus

\- No RSUs

\- Remote as long as I stay in the city where the job is based with the option to come into the office 25 minutes away.

At face value, Job 2 seems like the better options but this is where the dilemma begins. The total money I can make per year is pretty apples to apples between jobs when you include all the compensation components, but the base is fixed and not left up to chance, which provides some comfort when it comes to Job 2. Job 1 is at a global powerhouse company that just about everyone in the U.S. has heard of in some capacity.

Job 2 is for a company that is 10x smaller that has grown through acquisitions. Job 2 would be career progression, where I would be in more of a leadership role which is my main goal, but again this would be for a much smaller company.

I genuinely love Job 1 and did not think about leaving it anytime soon, until Job 2 recruiter reached out about the role. However, I am bound geographically, and as such, I have basically already hit my ceiling in terms of job growth since you have to be at HQ to move up any further. I have been told I have the potential to move up in my career in Job 1, which would also mean a $160k+ base starting, but that would mean I have to be geographically flexible which I am not able to at the moment. I'm worried if I take Job 2 and end up hating it, I may not have a way back in Job 1 and lost out on a role at a great company. But I also want to move up the corporate ladder throughout my career rather than be an individual contributor.

1l4hgrs,Quitting a job 3 weeks in for a better offer?,"Back in January, I interviewed with a fully remote company twice. I knew going into it that it was a long shot because they generally require a degree for every position and I never finished mine. But my friend worked there and vouched for me to get the interview. 
Two interviews in and I was told the position was put on hold and they would not be hiring anyone. So I kept applying for other jobs. Amidst my job hunt this same company contacted me again about interviewing with the new manager that was taking over that division because they might have another opening. I interviewed again just to be told a week later that the position was put on hold again due to the company restructuring. My friend who works there has confirmed they just moved numerous staff around and restructured extensively. 
I was super bummed but kept going with my job search and recently landed a position working for a sweet older couple running a private practice. I worked my first week and had a preplanned trip for a few days my second week there and they were nice enough to just give me the entire week off.

In a recent 1:1, I was told that I tend to put too much pressure on myself and others by treating every task like it’s high-stakes. I was also told to stop over-delivering and to “pace myself,” because my current approach might be creating unnecessary stress.

It’s confusing because I genuinely enjoy what I do, I don’t expect anyone to match my pace, and I wasn’t aware that my style was creating discomfort. No one had said anything directly — this was just presented as general feedback.

I’m curious: Has anyone else experienced this? How do you find the balance between staying committed and “calibrating urgency”? When does passion cross the line into being perceived as too much?

1l4gs6y,Why do I feel like I'm at a dead end?,"I currently work at a small business as a dual-role position - Analyst and Purchasing Assistant. I wear a lot of hats (do a lot of things that aren't in my job description) and it's become more than overwhelming. I've been unhappy at this job for well over a year, and have been here for almost three years total. I'm finally at the point where I'm ready to move on. 

The main reason I'm looking for a new job is because I was told I'm paid under the state average (which is under the national average) because I don't do everything an analyst typically does. I am running reports from our ERP systems daily and from our CRM system multiple times a week. I feel like I should be paid more being that I'm taking on multiple roles which takes time away from my analyst responsibilities, but my boss uses it as a reason to pay me less. To be clear, I've run every single report I've ever been asked to run, but I've rarely been asked my input on anything or to pull a report and make inferences on the data. I pull them and send them to higher ups so they can make their own decisions on the data. 

I have a meeting in two weeks where we are meant to discuss my goals for the next 6 months to a year, and I am heavily considering putting in my two weeks during that meeting. I say this because I intend on asking for a pay raise and fully expect to be told no. 

I also feel like I'm not really respected here. For example, the meeting we're having in two weeks is the last of a set of 4 meetings regarding my issues and concerns with the company. We had our first meeting nearly 9 months ago. So it's taken 9 months to have 4 thirty minute meetings where we discuss where we're at and where we're going. I think if my concerns had any weight, they would've been addressed in less than 9 months. Also, just to clarify, it was not something where we did like a quarterly update or something structured, it was me filling out a 3-page sheet that asked how I felt about my job and what I want to do going forward. The first meeting was them explaining the sheet, the second was them telling me where they think I'm at + reading my answers, the third was them responding to my sheet, and I guess the fourth is to decide how we're moving forward? Regardless, I feel there's absolutely zero reason or excuse that this would take this long. 

My concern: I haven't been able to specialize in any part of the business and I'm concerned this is looked at as a negative for all of the jobs I know to apply for. I have experience in quite a lot of parts of the business - obviously Sales Analytics and Purchasing (purchasing different products from different suppliers through our ERP system) as it's in my job title, but also things like CRM Admin / Data management, helping setup new employees computers, creating and maintaining customer order forms, maintaining mapping software data, and a lot of miscellaneous administrative work that others either can't do or know I will do if asked (Excel questions, PDF edits, formatting questions on word / outlook). 

I feel great about my skills and ability to learn new programs / concepts / skills, but I feel like I'm at a dead end when it comes to finding a new job. I'm not confident when applying to analyst jobs because I don't have any advanced analytical skills (programming) and I don't have enough experience in the other parts of the business to even apply for jobs in those fields. 

What should I do / what would you do? Thanks. ",Certain-Possible-544,3,1.0,1,1749174973,2025-06-06 01:56:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l4gs6y/why_do_i_feel_like_im_at_a_dead_end/,6,2025

1l4f9k7,advice on workload and overtime issue?,"i (24, f) was hired as a legal assistant at a medium-sized firm about 8 months ago, i was hired to work for 2 lawyers who did probate/trusts and estates. I did a really good job and they really loved my work. Eventually one of the attorneys that i was hired for left, so i just worked for the one. I felt she did not give me enough work, so i showed interest in working for maybe one more. Well, i ended up working for 2, and would help out other attorneys here and there. about 2 months ago, i was promoted to paralegal (I have worked as one before, but in immigration law- NOTHING like these types of laws at all. Before that i had worked in debt collection as a legal assistant) and the same week i was promoted, HR assigned me 2 more attorneys. at the moment, i work for 4 attorneys- the first does just probate/trusts and estates, the second does criminal defense (DUIs, possession, not as serious crimes) among other civil litigation matters, the third does family law/probate/trusts and estates, and the fourth does criminal defense (federal cases, more serious crimes like murder and assault). Honestly, this is a lot. I am not familiar with these laws, and they know that, they know that i will learn as i go. But i feel like the workload is so much, that im not even learning, i am just trying to get the tasks done and get them off my plate. So because i have so many things to do, i will stay a half hour later, and hour later, etc. Basically, every week i have an hour or two in overtime. I know there are rules, and I understand why they are in place. But i simply feel like this shit cannot get done UNLESS i stay late!! HR (mind you we dont have an HR department, its just one woman, and i will get to her later) says that the attorney must ask you to stay later, for it to be okay. In my entire legal career i've never had an attorney ask me to stay later- they just give me the task, and expect it to get done. So, two days ago, i spoke with HR because she said no more overtime. I basically told her that i feel the workload is a lot, and it feels like rather than learning, i am just getting tasks done after task (yes i know thats my job, but i also need to learn to get better and understand everything), she basically said to ask for help from other co workers (cant ask for help with the criminal defense work because im the only paralegal who does it- criminal defense is very new at our firm and no one here has worked in it before), so that conversation went nowhere. yesterday, i let time slip and i stayed late again.. an hour and 20 minutes. Today the HR lady told me i had to leave at 3:40 so i wont be over my hours, she was upset and said ""we just talked about this"". I did not mean to intentionally do it, i was just so friggin swamped and busy that i didnt even look at the clock. Also, I am starting a paralegal certificate program this fall (i have a bachelors in criminal justice but no paralegal certificate), so that i can learn more and be even better at my job, but fuck, how am i going to deal with this bullshit at work plus school after? So i guess my dilemna is- am i just being a baby here and not able to manage my time? or are they giving me too much on my plate?",raggle944,2,1.0,2,1749170263,2025-06-06 00:37:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l4f9k7/advice_on_workload_and_overtime_issue/,6,2025

1l4ei0d,Do I reach back out to a company I applied with?,"Hi Everyone!

I am a former environmental scientist attempting to switch over to the horticulture industry. I also have about 6 years of experience in retail management/inventory management.

Back in the end of April, I applied to be a buyer/inventory manager at a local greenhouse by my house. The interview process was... unique to say the least. Was definitely more intense than I was expecting, especially considering the pay-rate and level of experience required for the position ($60-70k/yr, entry-level). 

April 29, 2025: Initial Application

April 30, 2025: 1st Interview with Company with Purchasing Manager

May 2, 2025: 2nd Interview with Company with Purchasing Manager

May 2, 2025: 3rd Interview with Company with General Manager

May 2, 2025: 4th Interview with Company with Logistics Manager

May 2, 2025: Excel Exam to Determine Excel Proficiency and Ordering Writing

May 5, 2025: Sent a Thank You Email to Managers

May 6, 2025: 5th Interview with Company with Owner

May 6 - May 27, 2025: Radio Silence

May 27, 2025: Company asked for another week to make final decision. 

May 28, 2025: Company had me take a 210 question ""personality/work style exam""

May 28, 2025: Company requested references, never contacted them. 

June 3, 2025: Ended up rejecting me, explaining that they had a candidate with direct greenhouse experience and are going with them. The rejection email was actually very kind, and myself and the purchasing manager were in consistent communication throughout the interview process. 

However, today I noticed that they had reposted the EXACT same job posting on their instagram. So now I'm wondering if:

A) The ""candidate"" they went with ended up rejecting the job offer or dropping out last minute

or 

B) There was no candidate at all -- they just wanted to reject me without hurting my feelings. 

  
Now my final question: should I reach back out to the greenhouse and ask? Or just cut my losses and look for a job elsewhere. I do really think I was a good fit for the position, and would hate to give it up completely. 

  
Thank you! (crossposted to r slash: jobs, recruitinghell, careerguidance, horticulture, smallbusiness, resumes, askHR, antiwork, careeradvice, transitioning)

1l4e61m,Career change for a stutterer,"Hey everyone — I could really use some honest input.

I’m 30 years old and currently a licensed school social worker. I’ve spent the past several years helping at-risk youth and families — work that’s fulfilling, but financially and emotionally draining. I’m now pivoting into finance, and I’m looking for a long-term career where I can make serious money (goal: $400K+ by 40), help people in a meaningful way, and avoid being stuck behind a screen or spreadsheet all day.

Here’s what I know about myself:
	•	I’m great with people. I build trust fast and listen well.
	•	I don’t love math, and I don’t want to sit at a computer all day.
	•	I stutter, especially in high-pressure or group situations — but I’m clear, calm, and confident when it counts.
	•	I value autonomy, purpose, and eventually want to run my own business or practice.
	•	I’m currently studying for the Series 65 and open to getting the CFP down the line.

I’m not trying to be a hedge fund quant or Wall Street analyst. I want to engage with clients, guide them, and build something long-term — ideally with flexible hours and serious upside.

What path in finance (or adjacent industries) would you recommend?

Should I go full RIA/wealth advisor, aim for fintech client strategy, or something else entirely?

Any honest insights, red flags, or encouragement would mean a lot.

Thank you so much

1l4danz,Should I Quit My Job and Go All In on My Finance Degree?,"

I’m currently finishing my 3rd semester studying finance, I am very passionate for the industry and I aspire to be a financial advisor/planner as I enjoy helping people with their financial future. 

I currently work for one of my acquaintances that considers me a friend but he is one of the worst bosses I have ever met. Although, I sub-contract to him, he pays me well, but never on time, I am still withheld around 4K from the past 6 months because he broke up with his partner and must be struggling with income. Yet in the group snapchats he brags about going to the stripclub still and whatever else.. I always get singled out and he constantly attempts to micromanage me even though I’m WAY more capable than him in a lot of areas. 

I have been unfortunate and have a criminal record that’s due to be cleared in roughly 4-5 years. (Planning to finish my degree around this time). 
Should I continue to put up with his shit that leaves me with massive anxiety? Should I just quit, look for a new job related to my industry? Or something related to finance? (Not many opportunities with record)? 
I’m currently a home owner with my partner, my dad recently passed away of a heart attack and the inheritance should cover my part of the mortgage. Should I just take 4 years off work to focus on UNI or is this a stupid idea? Honestly, I think casual at Woolworths would bring me more joy than working as a roofer with shit people. The only thing is I would be taking a massive pay cut $(55/hr ABN) to change industries but to me it seems like it’s definitely worth it. 

My partner finished her degree and started a new job in child services and she loves it. I don’t need to support her at all, she pays for her half of everything & we have a healthy relationship!

1l4d9jn,Manager is draining the life out of our team.,"I need to vent and get some advice. My manager is seriously toxic and it’s starting to wear all of us down. He’s constantly disrespectful, talks down to people, curses at us for no reason, and has major mood swings. One minute he’s fine, and the next he’s snapping over something completely minor. 

He stresses over the smallest things and blows them way out of proportion. Every little issue becomes some huge crisis, even when it’s not important. It’s created a workplace where everyone’s constantly on edge, just trying to avoid being the next target.

On top of that, he has awful communication skills. He barely explains what he wants, constantly changes direction without telling anyone, and then gets mad when things aren’t done exactly how he pictured it, despite never having explained it in the first place. It honestly feels like he’s setting us up to fail.

Today he completely crossed the line: he yelled at one of my coworkers in front of random people, for no reason. It was loud, humiliating, and totally unprofessional. You could tell everyone in the area was uncomfortable and shocked, but no one said anything. 

Me and about 6 others are seriously considering going to HR as a group. We feel like something has to be said, but we’re unsure if it’ll actually do anything or just make things worse. HR hasn’t had the best track record at our company, so it feels like a coin toss.

What’s also frustrating is that we’ve had multiple new hires quit almost immediately after starting, just because they realized how impossible this guy is to deal with. It’s not just us, it’s a pattern.

I’ve got a decent amount of savings, so quitting is on the table. But I really don’t want to give this guy the satisfaction of driving me out like he’s done to others. I like my job, and I like my team, I just can’t stand this toxic leadership.

**Has anyone here dealt with something similar? Is going to HR as a group even worth it? Or should I start planning my exit now?**

**TLDR**: Toxic manager with mood swings, poor communication, and constant outbursts. Team wants to report him to HR, worth it or waste of time?

I also don’t want my peers looking down on me seeing that I’ve taken 2 jobs since college that are sort related to my degree but again, it’s not required. I just don’t want to get stuck in the same position I’m currently in. I don’t know if this position will help me get a better supply chain job in the future or what it could lead to.

I graduated and essentially have two choices.

1l49ij6,"Got my 1st job, realized I hate the work I do. How do I get out?","I got a job at a department store, I was told I would be working in the back and unloading trucks and such which sounds awesome to me I love any work where its physical labor like that but when I got there they threw me on floors and register. The training for registers was poor and I have no idea how to use the system when I have a register shift tomorrow, everyone else with 1st jobs around me are being paid $17-$19 and im being paid minimum wage. I hate it so much, I wish I picked fast food or just did side gigs like lawn work. Im sick of cleaning up other peoples messes and folding because shoppers don't have a clue how. I was given no info on what to do if customers need help so im bullshitting answers and getting tons of people lost. I'm on my 4th week, haven't gotten a single paycheck and ive worked near 50 hours (its 5 hour shifts). But I also need the money since im going to trade school about 30 mins away and need to have gas money, I wish I could find a job to work with my hands or build but im a minor so thats impossible. It also took me 6 months to even get a job interview and I don't want to go through that again and my parents will call me lazy if I quit, I want to work. I just don't want to fold clothes and beg people to sign up for a credit card company for the next 2 years until I graduate and move out.

Any advice on how to make it less miserable, or if its a good idea to just put in 2 weeks and apply for a bunch of jobs (or start a lawn care service)",ThroatSubstantial668,8,0.9100000262260437,5,1749154842,2025-06-05 20:20:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l49ij6/got_my_1st_job_realized_i_hate_the_work_i_do_how/,6,2025
1l49dxm,Torn Between Two Engineering Paths — Need Advice from Real Engineers,"Hi all, I’m 20 and really struggling with a huge career decision, and I’d appreciate advice from anyone who’s worked their way through this kind of thing.

I have two very different opportunities in front of me — one is an apprenticeship with Rolls-Royce in their submarines division, and the other is a degree program with my current employer, Balfour Beatty, where I work as a measurement engineer (track surveying in rail). Here’s the breakdown:

Option 1: Rolls-Royce – Nuclear Technician Apprenticeship (Level 4)
	•	1st year: Full-time learning + NVQ Level 3 (kind of feels like going backwards, qualification-wise).
	•	2nd–3rd year: HNC while working placements in the submarines division.
	•	Final .5 year: EPA (End-Point Assessment).
	•	Salary is slightly lower than my current role, but long-term pay progression is strong (40–50k+).
	•	Possibility to do a top-up degree later (after the apprenticeship), though it’s not guaranteed.
	•	Role is very hands-on and technical — exactly what I’ve always wanted to do.


Option 2: Stay with Balfour – Level 6 Rail Systems Engineering Degree
	•	Degree from Sheffield Hallam University, focused on rail (I’d go down the track pathway).
	•	Work-study balance is better: block release, about one week every two months.
	•	I’d graduate with a full degree in 3.5 years while still earning a full wage.
	•	Problem: my current job is surveying — a bit repetitive, a lot of van driving, night shifts, and not what I’d call “real” engineering.
	•	The salary here caps out at around 30–35k unless I change employers, but I’d come out with a degree that might open doors elsewhere.


What’s Got Me Stuck:
	•	I really want a degree — I care about having it, partly for self-respect and to make my parents proud. But I also hate academic environments and don’t want to drag it out any longer than I have to.
	•	I really want to work for Rolls-Royce — it’s the dream. Big name, real engineering, national impact. I’m scared this could be my one shot to get in.
	•	I do enjoy some aspects of my current job, especially when I get hands-on with the trains themselves — but those days are rare.
	•	I’m worried I’ll regret missing out on either path. If I never get into Rolls, I’ll regret it. If I never graduate, I’ll regret that too.
	•	I’m a hands-on person. My goal is to be on the tools for a while and move into design or systems engineering later.
	•	I’m scared I’ll feel “behind” if I don’t get a degree soon. Most of my friends are already finishing uni. That said, I’d be willing to do the degree later if I knew the engineering experience I was getting now was solid and meaningful.


So, experienced engineers — what would you do if you were me?
	•	Do you think Rolls-Royce is worth starting a bit “lower” for the longer-term payoff?
	•	Does a rail systems engineering degree limit me if I want to move into other areas like aerospace, nuclear, or defence?
	•	If I go with Rolls, how realistic is it to complete a degree later, or will I be too burnt out?
	•	Is hands-on experience more valuable than a degree at 23?

Any insight from people who’ve been through apprenticeships, career pivots, or industry moves would mean the world.

1l497iz,My job is switching deparments- advice?,"Hey all, so I work for an environmental non-profit. We specialize in wildlife conservation. When I was hired, it was for a new role that had just been created that bridged a perceived gap between marketing and education. Much of our work involves educating the public, so it made sense that much of our marketing material is inherently educational. Physically I've been stationed in education, though my work overlaps heavily with the marketing department. I've worked in the role for nearly four years now, and have come to really love and value the education side (working with kids, helping create programs, etc) in addition to the traditional marketing things I do like blog writing, social media, PR and more. 

Well, due to an internal shakeup, my role is being completely moved to marketing, and transitioning away from any education work. Not only am I disappointed because I've become close with my team, but I'm sad that I won't get to do part of the role I originally applied for any more. This was sprung on me with the expectation that I'll accept. I probably will, but I'm unsure if it will be worth it. Right now I have the privilege to work two days from home a week under my current boss, and I'm afraid they'll try to take that away when I switch departments, even though it was a key part of my hiring negotiations. I also expect they will try not to offer me more pay, even though the marketing department staff make more money than the education staff, which is where my pay came from. How can I guarantee things won't change for me too much? Should I ask for more pay? I have a meeting with the head director in a few days and I want to be prepared.

1l48q14,"After 6mo+ of being unemployed, I got this offer and need advice on negotiations pleaseee","I was laid off of my last role in November and I was earning 110k base with 10k bonus. Fully remote - it was a sweet gig that ended after 2 years. Obviously 6 months of unemployement has been brutal... 60+ completed applications weekly, I even took a course and got a certification.... literally telling myself I'll take anything that comes at this point. 

After months of rejections, recruiters that fill you with hope to then ghost you, or just crickets.... of a sudden in the last two weeks I had many companies start to reach out. 

Currently, I have 3 companies that are contenders. One is a local agency (hybrid), the other two are fully remote agencies. I have my 2nd round interview with one remote job and my 3rd round interview with the other remote job TOMORROW, same day. 

The local agency just sent me an offer yesterday for 95k and 10 days PTO - rewind to when we talked about salary in the first interview the HR Manager said that their range was 80-110k because they are making the role a Senior role and aren't sure where the market is. I explained that I was earning 110 in my previous role and that my target was close to that. No further talk of salary until the offer. 

All interviews went great, they made me feel like they really wanted me and even discussed projects that are outside of the scope of the role which I agreed I'd be okay to help with. So when they came in at 95k I was surprised but I countered with 110k and 12 days of PTO explaining that I believe the value that I bring is more aligned with this. 

They're not budging. They told me that ""Our compensation package reflects the specific requirements of the role, which will involve a significant amount of direct hands on keyboard platform work and strong data analysis skills. While your experience is valuable, it aligns more with a focus on data and analytics and less in platform work."" 

I have plenty of ""platform work experience"" and they're acknowledging that my data background is of value. PLUS they were talking about projects that are out of the scope which I agreed I'd have no problem helping with which are due to my data background. They also told me my offer expires on Monday at 10am and they want me to start on Tuesday 6/10.

This left a bad taste in my mouth and I won't hear back from remote agencies in time to make a well-informed decision so I feel like I just have to take it and hopefully get an offer from one of the remote agencies later on to quit and shift over. 


What I am asking:

Should I reply to their firm existing offer bringing up the initial 80-110k salary range mentioned and the fact that I will be of value for these out-of-scope project? Or just suck it up and take it, ride it out and see if something better comes along? 

Am I being rediculous? I feel like I am in no position to be choosy but boy do I hate feeling forced into something! If I had options I'd walk away I feel. 

Please help me navigate this with any advice! Ty guys!

1l48eii,"Stuck in a degree I don’t like, unsure if I should finish or start over. No clear direction.","Hey everyone. I’m a 24-year-old guy currently studying Mineral Processing Engineering at one of the top universities in my country (Turkey). I enrolled back in 2019, mainly because I didn’t really have a plan. At the time, I was struggling mentally and didn’t want to go to university at all. I had a dream of becoming a DJ, so I kind of chose a random program just to get the pressure off my back, thinking I could figure things out later.

I gave DJing a real try for a couple of years, but it didn’t work out the way I hoped. It’s incredibly hard to make a living from art or music in a country with deep economic issues like mine — it just felt too unstable and risky. So, I decided to return to university.

Now I’m back in this program, and I honestly hate it. I have no interest in working in mining or heavy industry, and I can’t picture myself in that world at all. I still have about 2 years left before I graduate. Part of me says “just finish it, you’re already deep into it,” and the other part says “why keep investing energy in something you know you’ll never pursue?”

On top of that, I really don’t want to stay in my country. The economic situation is terrible, cost of living keeps rising, and opportunities are shrinking. I want to move to Europe or the US — and from what I can tell, doing a master’s abroad (in something like engineering, economics, or even an MBA) is one of the most viable ways out.

But then again, I’m completely unsure about what I actually want to do. I’ve always had the feeling that I’d be better suited to something more creative — but I have no specific passion or plan. I also know that I don’t want a typical 9-to-5 office job for the rest of my life. It just doesn’t feel like *me*.

So here I am — stuck between finishing a degree I don’t like, starting from scratch without a clear goal, and feeling time pressure because of my age and finances. If anyone has been in a similar place, how did you move forward? Any advice or perspective would mean a lot.

1l48a36,Seeking career advice after graduating with a degree in accounting. I think I hate it.  Exploring career alternatives.,"I am about to graduate this August with a degree in accounting. After some back and forth of multiple career paths that I could possibly go with, it’s what I landed on as I thought it would be the most promising generally speaking. I pursued this path due to advice from my mother (who is an accountant), believing it would offer job security and a clear career trajectory. At the time, I wasn't entirely certain about my interests, and accounting seemed like a stable choice.

However, as I've navigated the job market, I have been shown the opposite :

Limited Entry-Level Opportunities: Many firms, have reduced their hiring of new graduates. Not to mention all the lay offs I have personally seen people fall victim to. Then comes the whole talk of AI. Which don’t get me wrong I know AI cannot do what an accountant does and accounting is so much more complex than what AI can comprehend. However, l have learned that, that only goes for accountants with higher titles, loads of experience that are CPAs. When it comes to entry level our work can definitely be done by AI with little to no error.

I know you might be thinking, why wait till I’m so far in to second guess everything?  Well to be honest I have been kind of on autopilot for the past few years of my life. My goal was just to make it from one day to the other. I know it’s not an excuse but it’s a reason. I didn’t think it would be this bad in the market and that I would develop such disinterest in it so late on. It may sound silly and I get why but it just hit me that I would be stuck in this profession for the rest of my life. I know there are many things  to pursue within accounting and to be honest I’m not really interested in any of it.

I've realized that tasks such as managing spreadsheets and preparing financial statements do not align with my interests or strengths. I also hate excel and it’s pretty much the entire job.

I’m not interested in climbing the corporate latter or having a crazy high salary. I never have cared for that.

I'm eager to explore new career paths that align more closely with my skills and passions. I would really like to do something where I am making the world better. Something where I am helping people. Something meaningful. I would like a job I could put my heart into. Something that feels like I’m doing something big even if it’s something small. Positions that involve minimal further education. Offer stability and growth potential.Careers that provide long-term prospects and personal fulfillment.

Edit: I would prefer minimum further education but I am totally open to going for more if something really sticks out to me. Please share anything you think fits my situation.

Some background on this: I graduated college in May and wanted a job as Brand Manager for this company. After an interview they offered me a job for 45k.

I’m the only engineer for a chemical plant that is essentially the main revenue for this company that purchased it. We’re far behind schedule on startup following a huge overhaul project and dealing with unprecedented production issues for 2 months now. We’ve been shut down since February and product inventory is now gone and they’re missing sales. I’m pretty important as the only replacement for me is a consultant engineer who doesn’t know the process but can help with process automation changes at least.

1l46rg2,How BS is “I will keep you in mind”?,"
I had an initial interview last week for a night shift position at a company. Yesterday I was emailed by the recruiter that they are moving forward with another candidate for the night shift position, but said that he was just notified today that the company will be opening up a few more of the same position “very soon”.

1l46eav,What to do?,"I was just recently laid off from my job as a purchasing agent on Friday. It has only been about a week and the thing I am struggling with is figuring out what to do with my life and career. I have a bachelor's degree in business management from a small college, but I am unsure if business is the right path for me anymore. When I was in high school, all I wanted to do was help people. That was the path I really wanted to figure out how to take. I wanted to do something in the medical field but as soon as I mentioned that path, my family laughed and said I could never do that. Back then, I was the type of person to just let other people tell me about myself rather than have the ""prove them wrong"" mentality. So that direction is interesting to me again since I was too scared to take it back then.   
I thought about taking this lay off as an opportunity to redirect myself back to what I originally wanted but I do not have the means to go back to school for a full-blown degree in anything. I thought about the path of phlebotomy but in central PA, I am being informed just how difficult that path could be in my area.   
After discussing this path idea with a career advisor, they sent me a career aptitude type test to figure out what direction could be best for me. It was the O'Net test that just gets a general idea of who you are and what you could be best at. After taking that assessment, it concluded that health care is absolutely not the route I should go, but I am not entirely sure I agree with the results.   
I just am at a complete loss of where I should go at this point. I am 28 years old and just feel like a fish out of water.

I am very good with people and speaking to them such as growing and leading them which is basically my day to day routine and growing the business. I am looking for a career change and been looking for a while currently making right around 60k and the reason for the big push is I will be having a child very soon and I am currently engaged and living together. I want something that has a better work life balance and structure and looking for a higher pay raise. Been pushing the cop route, but having second doubts, definitely will make more money off the get go but, the hours will definitely be fluctuating towards working more than the average 40. I have a degree in political science and a minor in Cj and history. I chose what I’d like rather than what could get me towards a high paying job. Tried looking for a job within my degree such as jobs within a law firm to no avail, I had no connections which could be a reason.

1l46d0w,Currently in Class 12 (ISC) – JEE Doesn’t Feel Right. What Are My Other Options?,"Hey everyone,
I’m a student currently in Class 12 (ISC board), and honestly, I’m really confused about what to do after 12th.

Back in Class 10, my results weren’t great, and overall, I’ve always been pretty average when it comes to studies. I chose the Science stream, but over time I’ve realized I’m actually way more interested in creative fields. The problem is, I haven’t seen many clear options or career paths in that direction — especially ones that feel “safe” or acceptable.

Right now, it feels like JEE is the only path people around me talk about. I’m supposed to give the exam in 2026, but I’m not even well prepared and to be honest, I’m not even sure I want to do it.

I feel stuck — like I’m being pushed into something that doesn’t align with who I am. I don’t hate Science, but I’m just not passionate about the JEE route.

1l46bxq,Got offered an opportunity for an exit interview? Is this a trap?,"I left my old job exactly a month ago and woke up to an email asking for an exit interview from corporate HR. I'm not sure if I should do it or not, considering I've read that those things are often used against you. 

But on the other hand I quit my job there because of incompetent admin and management, HR harassment (I have witnesses and a recorded conversation), and another employee had referred to myself and other department employees as a slur and when it was brought up to admin and HR we had a meeting basically telling us all to get along or find new jobs. Several witnesses to that since the whole department was there and witnesses to this coworker calling us a slur. 

I spoke to a corporate manager when he came in to train our new department manager before I left and brought all this stuff up with him but only had about 3 days left in my notice so I have no idea if he took it seriously or not. I'm thinking this may be why I was offering this exit interview or perhaps the fact that within just a year 5 employees (3 management) not including myself have left the department, as I spoke with the previous employees I'm still in contact with and they never got offered this. 

Corporate needs to step in and take care of this location, and I hope doing the interview would lead to an investigation. But again, on the other hand I think this could be used to fuck me over. That location is a 10 minute drive from home and the pay is...good enough.

My colleague has already been made redundant, which means I’m now doing the work of two people in one of the busiest departments.

The thing is, I really like my job, and for the first time in my career (I’m 34F), I’m not struggling with burnout.

I know I could earn more elsewhere with my 10 years of experience, but I’m also struggling with confidence after previously experiencing burnout—even though, on paper, I’m capable of doing higher-paid roles.

I also have three large projects due to go live within the next year, which could be great additions to my portfolio.

I also have a security clearance and handle sensitive information and personal matters with a high level of discretion.

I have a decent salary, but it’s a very plastered role and I’ve been feeling like I should move to the private sector. The problem is, after being out of that market for so long, I honestly don’t know if assistants are still in demand or even what companies are looking for nowadays

I’ve thought about changing careers for a while and last month I decided to bite the bullet and sign up for the rad tech program at keiser university and I was excited and signed up and then I learn that they charge 12k a semester and the program is 6 semesters including prereqs. I love the thought of the small class sizes and the one class a month aspect that they have especially since it’s been 5 years since I’ve been in school and I like how excellerated the program is but i don’t like the cost. I don’t want to be in 72K plus interest in debt. The other option is I go to palm beach state collage and apply to there program that only accepts 25 people every January. The only prereqs they have are anatomy and physiology 1 and the lab before I enter the program if accepted and that would be around 10k. Both are 2 year programs. I currently start keiser on Monday and for PBSC I would need to take anatomy and physiology and the lab before applying and the deadline to apply is October so I would have to wait til next year to apply and who knows if I will even get in on the first try of applying. In the mean time I could take more general courses I guess but it’s still alot of time to wait but alot less money. 

Keiser - be 72k plus interest in debt but start right now with one class a month and I would have a spot in the rad tech program for May 2026 or Jan 2027

PBSC- have 10k maybe 15k at most in debt but have to wait til Oct 2026 to apply and start in Jan 2027 IF I get in on my first try

Hello. As the title suggests, I am currently having dilemma which company to choose between the two. 

🧷Company A:
*permanent WFH
 *graveyard shift
*9:00 PM - 6:00 AM
*13 month pay
*2k additional allowance/month
*Base salary is 5k pesos more than company B

Upon regularization:
*12 VL, 12 SL
*10% night differencial
*HMO (not detailed in JO)
*Annual Increase (maybe)


🧷Company B:
*Hybrid schedule
*2x on-site
*Dayshift
*13th and 14th month pay
*Full private medical and dental coverage
*HMO (2 dependents - parents)
*Group Life and Accident Insurance
*Travel Insurance
*Regular Annual Medical Exam
*Retirement Fund (7% of base salary per month) 
*Christmas Gift Fund (10k)
*Base salary is 5k pesos less than company B
*Maternity/Paternity Leave

Upon regularization:
*18 VL, 22 SL, 3 EL
*Annual Increase 


If I compute the compensation package along with expenses not including the rent, food, etc., at the end of this year 2025, I will have 43k pesos more from Company A than Company B. 

Also, at the end of year 2026, I can gain 60k pesos more in Company A than Company B. 

The deadline for contract signing for company A will be tomorrow and for company B, I still have to submit background vetting form, but I'm positive for it. 

Please help me decide as I both want the job and really aligns well with my expertise and skills.🙏🙏🙏

I like staying busy, being hands-on, and especially enjoy roles where I can move around or be on the go (driving is something I genuinely love). I have ADHD, and some physical limitations (like scoliosis, bad feet, and developing carpal tunnel), so I’m hoping to find something that works with my body and brain—not against them.

Ideally, I’m looking for something stable and not overly mentally draining. I’m open to training or learning new skills as long as it's not a long college program.

Has anyone made a shift from retail/event work into something more fulfilling? What career paths or jobs would you recommend?

1l40gwn,Boss stated I was within my right to file a hostile workplace complaint. I'm debating if I should,"So last week I was accused of some bad stuff by a coworker. None of it happened so it was put on my file but in a way that made it clear there was no evidence. When HR went to tell this coworker, they filed another complaint right then and there. This is also coming on the tale end of this coworker chasing me out of my office twice in the past week that was documented with HR (by my boss who was aware of the situation)

My boss and his boss pulled me aside yesterday to tell me there was another complaint made by that person and the context (but no details yet on what I did) and during that discussion I was told that HR is there to protect the company against litigation, I should not feel afraid to file a formal complaint against the accuser just because there's been complaints against me and that I have every right to do so at this point but he can't tell me to do so or walk me through how. 

I'm reading between the lines he wants me to but I'm open to being wrong. Despite what he said though I'm scared to do so because I worry it's going to be viewed as retaliation. I also recognize though this can't continue and that the situation is untenable because this is just going to continue. 

Is there any advice on how I should navigate this process exactly so it doesn't look like retaliation?

1l4080c,Leaving graduate job after 6 months?,"Hi! I’m a fresh uni graduate and have been offered 2 graduate roles. 

Company 1: starting in 6 months time and is my ideal role at a big company in ux design. 

Company 2: starting asap and is a product manager position at a smaller tech company

I’ve had experience in design so I know I will enjoy company 1, but I am unsure if I will enjoy a product role. However I am just starting my career so am interested in exploring different areas. Would it be bad if I take up the product role at company 2 and quit after 6 months if I don’t enjoy the work? 

Is there way to go about this situation without burning bridges? (Just a bit worried since the ux design and product industry is closely linked).  Or is the best option to just choose the design role that I know I’ll enjoy. 

I just want to know if the company 2 will accept that I may leave because I prefer a different type of position, so I can still maintain a good relationship.

1l3zwtz,Good lofe but job could be much better. Any advice?,"I'm almost 31 and currently work retail.

In the past I started working in our fskily owned business but due to constant involvement in my personal life I picked up the courage and left, I should've done it sooner.

I'm now about 5 years into my 'independance'. In the meantime I bought a flat in the city center, found a lovely woman, finished my degree in tourism and am currently employed as a retail manager in a small tech store.

The thing is that I can't pin down something I'd really enjoy doing as a career. I'm an ambitious person but was quite unlucky with jobs (shit pay and it was mostly project management). 

Since I left the family business I worked in digital marketing, operations manager and project management.

Right now I'm at a spot that's temporary and want something where I really shine in.

Now my question is...

How do I find the right fit?

I don't want to take a job because I need it so I'm taking my time to really research and I have time to wait and see.

Based on my profile what kind of job would you suggest?

bare in mind I live in Europe in a country where the job market is not THAT developed (it is but not as much as the US or other bugger EU countries).

Any suggestions? I probably have a bit of ADHD so I have a lot of interests and hobbis. I'm looking at key account roles or commercial accout roles.

1l3zqqh,Should I put my current role on my resume?,"Hi all! Question about my resume and what your thoughts are on my situation.

I’m a professional in HR analytics and have about 9 years of experience that I currently showcase on my resume. Unfortunately due to layoffs and one contract role, some lasting about a year, some only about 6 months (I have had some bad luck) I look like a job hopper when I’m not. I do have two roles on there where I was at an org for 3 years and then another for 2, so I do have some longevity demonstrated. 

Back in February I was laid off along with 80% of my organization after being at the org for about 6 months again, and I took a new job a few weeks later that I have hated from the start because I had no other option after being unemployed. I have basically never stopped looking for a better fit and have had multiple interviews but it’s taken me longer than I planned and have now been here almost 3 months. 

The job I’m in is relevant to my career and technically a “promotion” for me, but I’m hesitant to put it on my resume for fear of looking like a job hopper even more but I’m not sure if it looks worse to be unemployed for 3+ months at this point or to put it on my resume and try to explain why I’m leaving. 

Hopefully all that makes sense. Curious your thoughts! ",Lilfire15,1,1.0,1,1749131540,2025-06-05 13:52:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3zqqh/should_i_put_my_current_role_on_my_resume/,6,2025
1l3zml1,[25F] Law Grad in India Feeling Lost — Need Serious Career Advice,"**\[25F\] Law Grad Feeling Lost — Need Serious Career Advice**

I’m a 25F, first-gen lawyer from a T2 law school in India. Deeply interested in public policy, so I interned with an MP, NITI Aayog, and a top law school's policy centre. Tried hard to get into litigation — only landed 2 remote internships (thanks to COVID), and couldn’t crack a single corp law internship despite applying everywhere and tapping into contacts.

By the end of law school, I realized corp law wasn’t for me. I sat for two campus placement interviews, made it to final rounds, but got rejected. I eventually took up a prestigious rural development fellowship (low pay, but all I had). Litigation wasn’t feasible then—family moved every 2 years due to my dad’s job (so no home base) and I had no legal connections.

I completed the fellowship in Sept 2024 and shifted to Delhi (family is finally settled here). Enrolled with Bar Council, did a litigation course, applied for every 0–2 PQE legal/non-legal job I could find (civil/criminal/corp/in-house/think tanks/content writing), got a few interviews—got ghosted or rejected with feedback like “great CV but not the right fit.” Also attempted Army JAG—1 conference out, 1 screen out.

Now I’m working in a startup in community management (thanks to my fellowship experience + some metworking). It pays INR 12k/month, no JD or clear direction. Manager is kind and flexible with time off, but I have zero background in digital marketing or community roles. I work long hours but feel like I’m not making any impact. I’m anxious, feel stuck and directionless.

My sister (settled in the US) suggests I do an MBA from Canada and move there for long-term career growth and support system. I’m scared of loans and the “what if I don’t land a job” scenario. I’m still prepping for Army JAG, but 3–4 vacancies for women makes it a moonshot.

What’s off the table: UPSC (family doesn't support the risk) and Judiciary (new 3-year practice rule kills that plan).  
I feel burned out and disillusioned by the legal field—low litigation pay, insane competition, and no family backing in law.

I’m ready to start from scratch in a new profession, work hard, and put in the hours—but I desperately need a structured path, mentorship, and a financially stable start. Any guidance or roadmap would mean the world.",Apprehensive_Nose422,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1749131237,2025-06-05 13:47:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3zml1/25f_law_grad_in_india_feeling_lost_need_serious/,6,2025

1l3x2vk,Need advice Please!!,"Hi there,
I'm currently 20 years old and have been studying for my Certificate III in Early Childhood Education and Care as a trainee for the past two years. I know it’s a course that’s usually completed more quickly, but I faced some significant personal challenges early on- I became the temporary legal guardian of my siblings due to family conflict, which understandably delayed my progress.
Now that life has somewhat stabilised, I’ve been gradually working through my studies with a final deadline in August. However, I’ve found myself becoming deeply burnt out in this field. I’ve worked at two different centres: one was an extremely toxic environment, and while my current workplace (a large not-for-profit) has a supportive team and lovely children, the workload and lack of planning time are overwhelming. The documentation demands spill into personal time, which affects my ability to study-and honestly, I’ve also struggled with procrastination because of the stress.

I’ve been considering stepping away from this career path altogether. I recently started looking for a new job-ideally part-time- in areas like reception or administrative support, or other roles that allow me to leave work at work. I’ve ruled out hospitality and fast food, as I’ve worked in those industries before and they weren’t a good fit for me.

I’m trying to avoid starting another traineeship or study program right now, as my mental health isn't in the best place to take that on. Still, I’m wrestling with guilt and self-doubt. I tend to overthink and people-please, and I feel like I’m failing by considering dropping my studies, especially since people have told me I should just “stick it out” for resume purposes or in case I want to return to the field one day.

I’d really appreciate any advice or guidance-whether it’s career path suggestions or just perspective on whether it’s okay to pivot right now. I'm feeling pretty lost and would love some support in figuring out my next step.",Sad_Form_8287,1,1.0,0,1749123867,2025-06-05 11:44:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3x2vk/need_advice_please/,6,2025

I'm in my late 30s and I recently somewhat wanted to try something tech savvy so I took a coding course and I honestly thought it was pretty fun, and I looked into programs and found UPenn MCIT and  Georgia Tech OMSCS.

However as I participated their admission seminars and after contacting with the admissions personally it seems that without any computer science related work experience or a bachelors degree in computer science it was basically impossible. UPenn seemed to accept STEM or people from prestigious universities, while the OMSCS will accept students who are barely qualified but will only siphon money from them until they give up or barely graduate without knowing a lot of stuff they learned from school. I did try to check out some of the CS degree programs near me and the cost of taking college class was around $900 per course and I was like, that's a lot of initial investment to dump in a high risk career move, and also it was an open university program from a non-US university, which the universities replied ""we cannot confirm that your degree from a foreign institution will be recognized during our admissions process"".

At this point I was thinking of progressing my current career like how I always thought of, getting a CFA and entering MBA/grad school and eventually climb up to a finance PhD program. Right now I'm in the industry but it would be nice to go back to asset management or making derivatives in an investment firm. But I know the CFA is rigorously hard, and since I'm in the industry right now, I don't know if my CFA would take me back to an asset management position.

What would you guys do in this situation?

1l3vzib,i hate my job but what are the options?,"Hi,

I am a 32 years old male from Germany. I did everything by the books - School Education, Went to University and got a Masters degree in Economics. I started my career with an IT-Consulting job.  
Next I went to an web development agency as Project Manager. I switched again to a similar position but as product owner at a crowd funding company. I managed a complete relaunch of their platform. Later on the company went bankrupt and now I am back again at as project manager for a IT Service company. 

I need to mention that I have not much IT skills even though I was working all the time in IT-management positions. I have basic understanding of system architectures, data structures and processes but on a very high level. My skill is in managing different people and teams and just keeping it all together.  
  
But I am annoyed by that. I have the feeling that I don't have any real skills. I am just someone who organizes and tells people what next steps they have to take but almost never do them by myself. I need to speak to customers abut project status but I am always depended on the work of others. I am creating nothing. It's one of these bullshit jobs that in my opinion nobody needs.   
I start to hate the corporate world because almost everything is fake.   


I want to do something with impact, something that requires learning a new skill or at least something that I don't hate every day. I want to have back the drive that I had when I started my career. But I have no idea what else to do.   
  
I have a family with a 2 year old daughter and another child on the way. Going into a complete new profession would mean that I need to cut my salary for some years and invest a lot in a new education. I cannot do that since I have to provide to the family.  


I have many hobbies and interests and think a lot about being an Entrepreneur since a lot of my friends have built successful companies already. But the risk of failure is high and finding an idea with a functioning revenue model is really difficult.  


I know that you cannot tell me what to do. But have you been in similar situations in your life? What have u done to make it better? Have you changed profesions or started a company by urself? What steps did you take. Tell me your story so I can get inspired by it.  
Also if you have some advice please share it.

For some background, I started this job as a super intendant for a general contracting company about a year ago. 2 months in we got hired by a big medical institution to be contracted out project managers. I had no prior experience being a project manager when we got hired out. 

I was cruising doing small tasks in the beginning, but once March hit of this year, I had 5 jobs all start at the same time. These jobs also did not have a general contractor, so I have been the acting gc.

I would have to apply for a three year course here in India and the top university that has a decent three year course is very competitive to get into. It has only 120 with approx 65-70 seats for reservation. Even if I do get into this college I am looking at 3 years of studying after which I would be a llb graduate. And then I had planned on doing post grad. I am 22 as of now and I can only start college in 2026-27. 
Is it worth it? Are there any other streams I can explore? ",tiredreset,0,0.5,0,1749117233,2025-06-05 09:53:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3v7ty/graduated_this_year_but_i_hate_my_field/,6,2025
1l3v6g0,Feeling lost,"Hi guys,

I was hoping someone could help me. I have my pharmacy degree which I got a 2.2 in. I definitely chose it for the wrong reasons as my parents were very much like healthcare is only way! I was never allowed to explore what I liked in school so I chose pharmacy to keep my parents happy. I feel like I chose the wrong degree for myself, I have no passion for it at all. I hated the majority of my time during pre reg working in community. I see other students talk about it so positively and I wish I was like that. I felt like this for such a long time now and it's only in the last yr I've realised I simply do not think this career aligns with me.

As I never explored what I actually like, im completely lost about where my passion lies. I feel so lost and afraid because I know my ppl
parents are never going to let me hear the end of it when I tell them I don't want to be a pharmacist. I have no idea where to go from here. I have a job as an admin assistant at a hospital at the moment so that's keeping me afloat financially. I have literally got no idea how to even find out what I like. 

I LOVE makeup, it brings me so much happiness so i would like to break into the cosmetics industry ideally but i know thats quite unrealistic and i am no one special so probably dont have much a chance. 

Please could someone provide me some insight about how i could break into the cosmetics industry/how to figure out what career path i should go for?

1l3tefd,Career move vs Partner,"I (28F) met my partner (34M) while in college, at the time I told him my plans after graduation was Grad school preferably at an institute I visited right around when I met him that were very interested about my ideas joining two separate sectors (shark research and microbiology). For context during my undergrad I did a two month internship in another country for shark conservation, actively in the water and out. I also have over three years of independent research under my belt, three of those under a Genomics program utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the Genomes of zebra fish with mutations identified by our local hospital (high funding in oncology). 

Through out our relationship I felt like he was proud of my achievements because he would brag often to his friends about his ""scientist"". Though there were rough points, I would spend countless hours in the lab that made him feel neglected from time to time. Eventually I warmed to the idea of him being the father to our children one day (I was solid I would be single and not have children, happily prior to him), eventually he stated he didn't want to be fifty when they turned eighteen (pointed out the math means we should have started prior to us meeting). But I did decide I could get a lower position job with a bachelor's and we could potentially make it work. We also considered I would probably be the bread winner even without grad school, and him a SAHD (he changes jobs every six months to a year while I've had the same Pharmacy Technician job for eight years).

Now there are absolutely no opportunities decent paying in the field I want to be in where we live, he has stated he would love to move away (born and raised here, which is common here), he considers it a vortex and depression here where people can't legitimately leave. Eventually we talked about the plenty of opportunities in California (I spent early development living in Southern California) though the high cost of living is a big factor. Out of no where he states California is trash, okay. There's plenty of good and bad, absolutely. Though the sudden strong response threw me considering my original prospects were in California and he never said anything along these lines. 

In October he was complaining about the polital structure of America, I bring up the possibility of moving to my birth country Germany (American mom, German biological dad). He was down, he even starts boasting to his friends eagerly. I brought up starting to learn the language for him and introducing fun ""tid bits"" of information. Even having a day a week we try to only speak German to help us integrate better, he says we already scrap for our time together and that would frustrate him. Eventually when I bring up taking an actually language course (paying, to work of fluency) he states we should wait on his PCC to make sure we can move (he has a record). 

A few weeks ago we received it back and he's cleared, he didn't seem excited. I brought up how he hasn't started packing (though I just graduated in early May and we talking about our major move happening pretty quick afterwards- within six months). He gets defensive, argumentative, he eventually states he was hoping his PCC wasn't going to be approved. In the heat he even said I should just go if it's so important to me, I suggested maybe Ill go alone, try to set the foundation then when he's ready he joins me. He doesn't like this. 

Seven months of thinking we were making this move and now what, I scramble. Now we are looking at potentially Washington, Oregon, maybe even coastline Texas. I feel as though I may resent him, now or mainly eventually. As far as having children go, Germany is amazing. I'm also thinking of the fact that we purchased a ring for me five months ago, but he wants to be the one to have an official proposal, we talked about having a celebration with our friends but I realized tonight.. when would that happen? 

It seems time and time again I have bent and manipulated my life choices to fit his wants but he hasn't made a single determined action to alter his for me. I know that sounds bad but what sounds worse is I feel like he may be using me as almost a golden ticket in a way? I've asked my dad about the major moves he's made for his career and how he got my mom on board, he simply stated because she already had me and my sister and he was the breadwinner it was a take it or leave it situation, either come with and be provided for or not and good luck. I don't want that kind of relationship, but it feels like he constantly has a major say in my potential career prospects. It's adding to the already huge frustration of finding a really great career opportunity after this long awaited bachelor's completion.

1l3rzik,Took 6 months off after burnout and taking care of sick mother. How do I frame this break without raising eyebrows?,"Taking breaks this early on kills careers from what I’ve heard and I’m afraid I might have done the same, but I needed it to reset. 

I’m 25F, India with about 3 years of experience in marketing. After graduating from a top B-school, I joined one of the Big 3 consulting firms in a growth-focused role. I left after a few months partly due to burnout and partly because my mom had to undergo urgent leg surgery and needed full-time care at home.

What started as a short break turned into a six-month pause where I focused on helping her recover and taking care of my own mental and physical health.

During this time, I wasn’t completely disconnected. I worked with a small education-focused org, supporting them with marketing, outreach, and community programs. I also freelanced with a creative agency, helping them script and storyboard animated explainer videos. But overall, I used this period to reset.

Now that I’m ready to return to full-time roles, I’m unsure how to position this break on my resume or in interviews. I want to be honest without sounding flaky and still show that I stayed engaged in meaningful ways.

If you’ve navigated something similar, whether a sabbatical, burnout, or caregiving break, I’d love to hear how you framed it and what helped.

1l3rn05,Do these type of apprenticeship/mentorships still exist?,"I am someone who is incredibly interested in costume design and fashion design too - mostly haute couture.

I’m pursuing a costume design degree but I find that it’s not 100% what I’m looking for. I’d love to design for operas and ballets and more historical contexts, I want to master more intricate techniques that are done by hand and learn more from people who are masters themselves. I find schooling is almost too vague. 

So I was wondering if there are people who are masters in costuming, someone who has near perfected their art/technique - specifically for opera, ballet and classical theatre, that can take me under their wing and I can closely learn from them? Is that a thing anymore?

I live in Australia so I heavily doubt that’s a thing here but what about Italy? I was thinking since it is the birthplace of opera there has to be someone willing to teach me their craft and let me shadow them. 

I don’t know, is this still a thing? I want to be really good at what I do. I want to take up traditional techniques and learn more about the history of this craft!

1l3r496,I Don’t Know Which Job to Choose,"
So, as the title says, I have two jobs that I am choosing between; however the plot twist is that I am working one of them now and am set to start the other on Monday. 

For context, I just graduated from college with my bachelors degree a few weeks ago. 

While my current job is not in my field, after months of applying, they were the first to offer me a position a month before I graduated. It is hard to find jobs I am qualified for in my city as it is smaller, so I took what I could since I can’t move just yet. We will refer to this job as CJ (current job.) 

Now, the plot twist happened the Thursday before I started CJ. I applied for this job in March, and they didn’t get back to me until May. Despite already having a job lined up, I figured I would go for the interview anyway…if anything, to practice my interviewing skills. I got the job a week and a half into starting CJ.

My dilemma is this: CJ is so unfulfilling. I sit at a desk all day and do the same repetitive task over and over again for 8 hours a day. I am not gaining any skills or anything. It is mindless work, but then again, it pays just shy of $20 an hour, so that is why I took it. Also, for further detail, it is a full time position where I am averaging 40 hours per week.

The plot twist job (which we will call PT) is at a place that I have always loved. The tasks vary from day to day, the people are more likeminded, and it is at a place that has a really good network; however, it a part time position where I would only get 20-30 hours per week, and it only pays $15 an hour. And, once I exceed working 900 hours, I have to take a 30 day break. Although, I don’t foresee that being a problem as I will be looking for other opportunities in the meantime. 

Now, I really don’t know what to do and that is because of one main thing: I reallyyyyy want to move to a larger city, and have wanted to for many years now. If I stay at CJ, I could do it by August, but if I do the PT, I will have to wait until January (for the same amount of funds thereabouts.) 

I am not asking someone to make a decision for me, but any consultation would be nice. I am genuinely so lost. The money is nice at CJ, but the overall mindset I would have, connections with people, and having a foot in the door or a leg up for future opportunities elsewhere due to PT would be better. CJ is wearing me out already, and I am only 2 1/2 weeks in. 

I have to make a decision by 8am on Friday morning. 

What are your thoughts? 




TDLR; I am working one job and have another lined up and don’t know which one to choose.

* Java (OOP, multithreading)
* DSA & problem-solving
* Learning React
* Starting Spring Boot
* Revisiting system design

But I still feel stuck on *how to approach interviews* and *what to prioritize*.

**If you’ve made a similar transition or hired for such roles:**

1. What helped you the most?
2. What kind of projects/interview prep actually worked?
3. What’s the best way to approach companies when your current role doesn’t fully reflect your skill set?
4. How to position CRM background to not be seen as irrelevant?

1l3qn7o,What do I say in this circumstance?,"I’m a young professional who just left their first “big girl job” for the first time due to my own safety being ignored by my company. I’m about to start graduate school and I was hoping to have at least a year or two of experience before hand, but I didn’t feel safe at my company. 

I worked at an inpatient rehab for 10 months. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely loved it. I loved supporting those in recovery and helping individuals get the help they needed to get themselves back together. It was my dream job, and I was over the moon when I got this position. 

Unfortunately, my company did not give a single s*** about my safety to the point where I  had to start seeing a psychiatrist due to my anxiety being on high alert anytime I was in the building. I was almost SA’d by two clients on two separate occasions, I was choked by one, one tried to kiss me, and multiple clients tried to touch me inappropriately. I completely understand that when you work in a behavioral health facility, you will run into individuals like this from time to time. My issue was anytime I brought up these concerns, I was either told I was lying, or that I should expect that to happen. I’ve had multiple coworkers be sent to the hospital due to clients putting their hands on them and nothing ever changed and they were asked to come into work the next day; reason being why our turnover rate is so high

My question is; what do I say to my future employer when I’m asked why I left this job, especially since I wasn’t there for so long. This might be a stupid question and I’m sure it’s a common one, but I’m afraid to give the wrong answer and not get the job. I don’t feel like saying flat out “I didn’t feel safe” is a good idea.

1l3q385,How realistic is switching careers?,"Got a job out of college at 24 at a highly-reputable advertising agency. Been working in post production (editing and finishing commercials for air). My starting salary was actually less than 50K but it came with great benefits and overtime. 5 and-a-half years later, I'm still at the same position but with a higher salary with a base of 65K and I still get overtime. I came home with 70K last year, which I know while decent, it's modest and isn't a whole lot. It's really do to the fact that in the post industry in general, there isn't a lot of upward mobility. You are either an editor, an assistant editor or a post producer, etc... The thing is, I am not sure if I want to edit, and have been thinking about either becoming a producer or transitioning into the account management side of advertising.

I have a degree for film production at a public college. It is a BA and I had to take general education courses to fulfill certain credits. It isn't a BFA but not sure if it makes a difference. I am actually due for a sabbatical which I am taking in the fall. It's 5 weeks and then due to company policy I have to stay at the job for at least 6 months incase I wanted to leave for another role or company in general, or I'd literally have to repay the month off.

I am turning 30 soon. I am wondering if I should perhaps look into an MBA program for business management so that I could transition to the account side. I think I've learned a lot in my time in the advertising world and probably would be best suited to stay in ads. I am just curious what my options were at this point. I could become a producer and since I have a relevant degree along with former internships and jobs. It probably would not be too much of a transition, unlike a full career change with account management.

I still have some student loans to pay, but nothing too crippling and am confident I can pay off even with my current salary down the line.

1l3pln6,"""Resume bullet points should reflect your improvements/accomplishments, not your responsibilities""--okay, but what if our role doesn't allow for improvements?","Hello everyone,

Like many of you, I'm searching for advice on how to beef up my resume and find a new job. A common piece of advice that I see is that your resume bullet points shouldn't simply list your responsibilities, instead they should reflect your accomplishments. Sure, I agree with that, but what if you don't work in a role that gives you the ability to make independent decisions, or automate any processes?

I work in a position that I would describe as glorified data entry. Despite having a fancy title (economist), I spend most of my day hand-checking paper surveys and entering data into a web-based application that my state agency uses. Each quarter, I have thousands of accounts whose data I have to manually process. I also have to compare the current data for each account with the previous quarter's data, and leave a comment on what I think is happening at each firm.

I run into this problem when I'm working on my bullet points where I feel like I'm approaching the point of exaggerating my responsibilities, if not outright lying. For example, I've described survey processing as ""ensuring data quality"", and quarter-to-quarter comparisons of various accounts as ""researching firm-level economic data"". I've been told that I should try to emphasize the accomplishments and improvements I've made, but the fact is, I've had/made none. This isn't due to a bad manager or me working for a company with an outdated tech stack, it's because the nature of state work being slow, bureaucratic, and consistent. We simply aren't able to make any changes, even if you've been at the agency for over a decade.

I guess I'm wondering what kind of angle I should take when presenting my responsibilities. Both ends of the spectrum seem like tough sells--I could just write ""Processed a ton of paperwork by hand"", or I could embellish things by saying ""Processed thousands of surveys each quarter, ensuring data quality in a timely fashion"".  It seems like I'm going between too specific and too vague. I'm at a point where I desperately need out of this position, and while the benefits are decent, I'm afraid that the skills I acquired in graduate school are quickly depreciating.",southaustinlifer,0,0.5,2,1749095394,2025-06-05 03:49:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3pln6/resume_bullet_points_should_reflect_your/,6,2025

I’m in a well-paying remote exec role with decent people and some creative work. But I’m completely burned out. I’ve been grinding hard for years, including helping take a startup public, only to be passed over for a promotion I was in line for when my boss left. Since then, there’s been major brain drain, leadership is a mess, and morale is low.

The job itself is manageable, but I’m stuck in nonstop meetings, I’m not growing, and I’m honestly bored. I feel like I’m just treading water. I have the means to take time off and don’t need to work right now. But I’m scared of what a break would do to my long-term career, especially at the executive level.

To make things worse, I’m too burned out to job hunt. I can’t even read job postings without thinking how awful everything sounds. I’ve been thinking about stepping away, supporting my partner’s work, focusing on self-care, and figuring out what I actually want next. Life feels too short to just keep doing this.

1l3nvcm,"Taking a job at a less prestigious, non financial company?","Hello, I have been working in my current role for 1.5 years now in tax for a top 5 bank in the US.

Recently I’ve felt that this role is not serving me well, and the management is very toxic and disorganized.

I’ve applied to a few internal positions and I am slowly networking to move laterally, but it’s been difficult. My skillset that I’ve learned in tax is a barrier to entry to break into more middle office or front office roles.

Besides this, the location I am in is not the greatest. It has been difficult to live here personally and professionally.

I am ultimately applying internally and externally, but what I would prefer is to move closer to my home state, which is closer to a major city, and it will ultimately be better for me professionally (networking, higher studies etc) and personally (family, friends, support system, etc.)

Long story short, there is a company that has reached out to me (non financial) that is in tax and closer to home, but I can’t help but think “wouldn’t it look weird if I go from company A, which is prestigious, to company B which is good but also mediocre”

Think of it along the lines of going from JPMorgan to Target corporate.

What advice would you give?

While I can try my best to move laterally, it would still mean that I would live in a location that does not serve or suit me, but I would stay in a well known institution that looks better professionally.

If I take this move to a non financial and non prestigious company, I will be paid the same salary, but a bit happier being closer to home. But, career wise, it will feel like a downgrade.

Granted I can always come back to company A at any point.",TheTokenBrownie,3,1.0,7,1749089833,2025-06-05 02:17:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3nvcm/taking_a_job_at_a_less_prestigious_non_financial/,6,2025
1l3ndp8,Would a manager actually stay in touch with me if I asked?,"Good evening!

I just got a job offer today for an engineering role that I am super excited about. It's for a large defense contractor in the exact type of role I am looking for, the pay is good, and the management team seems like a great group of people.

Just one slight hiccup.

I already accepted an offer for another large defense contractor a few weeks ago, and I do NOT want to burn bridges with that company.

My current job, which I haven't started yet, is great for my current situation. Since I'm a fresh college grad, I can live at home with a short commute to work. This means I'm living for free, only really having to worry about car payments and my college debt. Plus, the pay is very good, and the work seems quite interesting.

However, the job I just got an offer for is WAY more up my ally. Only thing is I'd have to pack up and move out across the country for it (And rent is VERY expensive).

I talked with my parents, and we came to an agreement that I should stick with my current gig and see how that plans out, with the added benefits I mentioned previously. However, I want to keep the door open for joining the other manager's team in the future when I'm in a better financial situation.

I plan on giving the manager a call back and basically explaining that, while I really really really really love the position and his team, my family and I decided it makes sense for me to focus on paying off my student loans before I go move out and chase another opportunity.

My main question here is, following that explanation, I plan on asking the manager for his email/linkedin/phone number, and asking to stay in touch for future opportunities. 

If I give him this reasoning, really emphasizing that this is a position I would absolutely LOVE to have once my financial situation clears up, do you think he would actually want to stay in touch with me?

Like if I were to periodically shoot him messages with questions about anything cool they're working on, and then in a few years ask him if they have any open opportunities, would that work out in my favor?

TLDR: Got really good job offer even though I have another job that helps me pay off student loans faster and easier since I'll be living at home.

1l3mutz,No careers “click” with me,"Hello my name is Anthony, I’m 19 and I cannot find a career path that I enjoy. I love cars, I work on my own, and I used to do photography but I would rather do that stuff on the side. The past jobs I’ve had were:
1. Chick-fil-A 
2. Outdoor Go Kart Track (my favorite so far)
3. Flight School
4. Internship On A WRL Race Team
5. Automotive Tech at Volkswagen (Current)

My dream “job” has always been to be a race car driver, but even with the great driving skills I have, it still takes more money to actually race than you make. I enjoy doing photography mostly on vehicles but people don’t really want pictures anymore, the internet is mostly video and that’s not something I enjoy. I also don’t enjoy wrenching on regular traffic cars, especially VW. I was thinking of working at VW, gaining experience and maybe starting my own shop, going to a performance shop, or making my way up to a nicer/cooler brand. I used to want to be a tech for Porsche, but being a technician is kinda just the same thing everyday. I think the fun parts are getting deep in the engine bay, not doing an oil change. 
I feel that my biggest problem is that I want to be “rich” and be able to afford to build my own cars and live a nice life while actually enjoying going to work. As of right now I don’t really get excited to go to work or enjoy working and I’ve only been working at VW for a month and a half. Is this normal?
I’ve looked into other opportunities like starting a dry ice blasting business, own shop, realtor, dealership sales, I’ve even tried flight school but planes aren’t really my thing and I think I want to stick to cars.

I am currently living in Denver working in electrical distribution sales. I spend about 60hrs per week working. If I am on-target this year, I stand to make about 82k.  
I am wondering if it makes sense to move home to rural Arizona and become a CNA, with the goal of becoming an RN. I would start at 40k, and after 2-3 years of working and an accelerated nursing program (and maybe 30-40k in tuition) start as an RN at about 80k.

My current job is very stressful, and the pay is OK given that I work about 60 hours a week. Most days, I hate my job, but it is occasionally satisfying. If I spend another 1-2 years in my current role, it would be possible to make 90-100k and potentially take my experience to work for a manufacturer.

1l3kn5z,"I technically have five years of graphic design experience, but looking to get better and really learn the craft. Should I go to school?","I'm at a crossroads in my career. I was let go from my last job, and am considering a career transition.

I've spent the last five years in Communications roles where graphic design was a primary function of my role. Everything I know about graphic design I taught myself so I could create materials for work. I also have a photography background so I have always been comfortable using photoshop, and I feel very comfortable working in InDesign and Illustrator.   
  
However, I don't feel my portfolio as it stands (https//mariepierfrigon.journoportfolio.com) is good enough for me to get an actual job as a graphic designer. I feel it looks really basic, and that my work is just okay. I think there's still a lot I can learn, and a lot I need to work on in order to actually work towards a career. 

I'm considering pursuing a formal graphic design program (most likely an associates) from a local community college in order to advance my skills. I hoped to get a full time job that will take me through this education, then make a transition into a full time graphic design role (hopefully). 

That said, I realize there are also numerous online resources including Skillshare and YouTube videos. If you were me, what would you do? I would love to hear what folks recommend in terms of school/vs self learning.

I interviewed with a restaurant for serving then got told to wait for a text for when I’d be training. They never explicitly told me that I was hired, rather that I’d hear back from them soon. 

I told them I could start in two weeks and to let me know prior, which i thought was standard. I continue interviewing with other places, told them the same and heard back from the others two weeks prior from starting date. 

Assuming I didn’t get this position, I got hired to work for another restaurant. Then the hiring manager texts me asking me to come in the day after. I send him a text back saying that due to the timing/the fact that I wasn’t reached out to sooner that I assumed I wasn’t offered the job and was no longer interested in the position. 

He never responded back, and flash forward to a couple months later, I applied for the same position again after seeing it was open, and got rejected. Then I applied for one of its other locations and got rejected again, despite my application being accepted before multiple times by this restaurant, so I know my resume isnt the option.

1l3jdz8,Career Fork. Advice?,"Need 100 second opinions on a potential brokerage switch.

Start off with some context at my current place of work before I get to what I've learned in the interview process recently. Made a career change over 3 years ago after realizing my aspirations to own/run a restaurant we're drowned one Saturday night at 3am when I closed the ice cream shop I managed. My fiancé at the time, now wife, dreaded my schedule since we weren't ever really able to hang out anymore. Office settings always made me nervous in what I later out was lack of confidence to compete in the white collar world, but I conquered that fear and got an office job. I of course desperately took an entry sales ops position at an ATX office for a Chicago-based freight brokerage for $40k base + 1-2% commission after 6 months right at the tail end of the covid market. Realized right away my colleagues were both surprisingly a blast to work with and almost 3/4s were stupid and/or lazy. I immediately caught on, excelled, and took a sales/BDR promotion after my branch manager realized I was essentially the main client face on what was nearly 15+ accounts. So, of course the yes man in me takes a raise of $12.5k (7.5k if you factor inflation raise of 5k) + 1-2% commission rate without question probs due to my agreeableness and lack of experience/confidence.

Just like sales/ops, I was pretty much already exercising the aspects of Sales/BDR without the recognition, and killed it there too. Hell, I even played a vital role in bringing in 9 customers over the course of 2 years in addition to the daily work load only to be compensated fix bonuses, not a commission restructure. A couple reps left due to 5+ years of dealing with a toxic culture I was too naïve to realize given my tunnel vision. I was hungry for a couple more accounts, and wasn't going to complain about taking on two billion dollar shippers in my book of business. I was, and still am, motivated because the money (i know the freight market is terrible). I doubled the NR of my current book by 6 months after new additions (new accts included in my baseline). Which led to, low and behold, another promotion: team lead for a group of reps. Most of which were tenured more than twice in my 2-3 year mark in 2024. My base remained the same and my commission increased to 2% of the 160k monthly NR I was bringing in. Dawned on me after a panic attack and a year long weight gain. Not the work, I found out quick sales and relationships were a strong suit of mine, but the sheer work load, poor upper management and a carrier sales/ops team that could not keep up with the volume I bring in. Customers are a pain, but a lack of operational support only adds to the # of BS phone calls I have to talk down due to someone else's unaccounted-for negligence.

So, I begin casually scoping the job market and I guess my resume and few talks garnered a decent amount of attention right away. After a couple months of proper vetting to avoid going to a new hell. I am now sitting on a couple options which are polar opposite. A sales position at a b2b pest control company 55k + 20% commission + yearly bonuses which would on avg translates to roughly 85-100k by end of first year, or another sales/account executive role at a small brokerage for $80k(flex to move this down to lower OTE monthly baseline) + 15% commission on sales above 20k monthly baseline (salary/4) + bonuses but asking for me to bring as much business with me. I was honest and told them I could maybe 20-40k within 6 months from transferring like 2-4 customers of the 15 in my book, and they were intrigued even if I thought it may be a low ball considering my relationships with decisions makers at a decent amount of these companies. Both options to have much better cultures and similar personalities to my own than my current company.

Any advice from some sales vets with similar decisions in the past?

This screws people over in two ways.

2. Going for so long without income tends to lead to people racking up large amounts of debt.

I have job hopped many times, and my current salary is over 100k with no degree.

The chances are pretty high that at least some aspects of your job are applicable to other industries. I have had insanely good luck when it comes to using my previous experience to leverage better job offers. 

For example. I am a truck driver by trade, but with being able to operate a massive truck safely, it was easy enough to convince a heavy equpiment company to give me a shot operating their equpiment.

There are thousands of us out of work. The party is over (or seems to be). A lot of people think (hope) it’s all going to bounce back but in my gut it feels like the writing is on the wall for movies. I know a lot of people losing their homes currently and it’s so bloody sad. 

My skills are so absolutely niche to entertainment production that it’s been a real head scratcher trying to think of other industries/jobs to apply to. I’ve worked on some of the biggest films and TV series in the world and you’d think that would help my employability case but nah. 

I’m (45 m) also older now and as I keep reading ageism seems to absolutely be a thing. 

Some have suggested construction type jobs but they pay terribly and don’t have benefits and in my limited experience the vibe is toxic af.

Are there any other film technicians out there reading this who have maybe transitioned into something else that can pay the bills? I haven’t worked this year and I’m running out of resources quickly. I am actually scared at this stage.

2025 is terrible! Someone save me!

1l3ijbk,Career Crossroads: Tesla vs JPMorgan – Advice Needed for Long-Term Growth,"Hi all – I’m at a major career crossroads and would appreciate perspective from others who’ve navigated similar decisions.

I’m 37 and currently in a corporate real estate role with strong work-life balance (remote, low-hour weeks, decent bonus, and a company car), but there’s limited upward mobility or growth. I’ve received two compelling offers:

⸻

1. Tesla (SoCal-based, Remote West Coast Portfolio)
	•	$150K base
	•	$175K in RSUs over 4 years
	•	$17K relocation bonus
	•	No company vehicle - would need to purchase or lease my own
	•	High-growth environment
	•	Requires relocation to California
	•	Intense culture but strong long-term brand equity

⸻

2. JPMorgan Chase (NYC-based)
	•	$170K base
	•	No equity or bonus
	•	5 days/week in-office
	•	Keeps me close to family and existing network
	•	Clear prestige and stability

⸻

Current Situation:
	•	Remote, NYC-based
	•	~$140K + 13% bonus + company vehicle
	•	Low workload, but flat trajectory and no raise or promotion on horizon

⸻

My Goals:
	•	Advance to Director-level at a Fortune 500
	•	Maximize long-term earnings and equity
	•	Ideally stay in NYC long-term (but open to relocation for the right opportunity)
	•	Maintain reasonable work-life balance

Would you prioritize Tesla’s brand and potential for long-term growth—even with relocation and lower initial comp—or Chase’s stability, higher base, and NYC location?

I’d prefer to stay in NYC long term. Tesla feels like a short-term move to accelerate my career and open bigger doors down the line — with the goal of eventually returning to New York. Curious how others would weigh that trade-off.

1l3iig3,"Burnt out from job hunting, what are some career paths with a clear, structured pipeline into a stable job?","Background: 28M, I work in social media / marketing. Math undergrad from Berkeley. Started in finance, hated it. I do like my current job, but I don’t like the money. I promised myself I’d make a career change this year. I HAVE to get on a different path ASAP, even if it means starting from zero. 

I’ve tried. I really have. I self-studied, sent out hundreds of apps, tried to break into actuarial field (spent 300 hours studying and passed 2 exams, studying for a 3rd now) and CS (gave up after 4 months—it felt impossible). Both felt insanely competitive, with no clear way in although FWIW I had 2 actuary phone interviews. 

What I’m looking for is something structured. A field where you train, follow a set path, and realistically get a job at the end. I’ve heard dosimetry and air traffic control can be like that, and I’m trying to find more options in that same lane. I missed the ATC bid this year but I’m hoping I can catch the next one, though even then, the acceptance rate is low af. I don’t have any medical prereqs yet, but I’ll do them if it’s worth it. Ideally though I would want them to be 'tied' to the program, if that makes sense. (I would prefer not to take them at a community college but idk if that is realistic) I even considered becoming a pilot just because the training path is so direct, but I’m not great with heights or turbulence. 

If anyone knows careers with a clear, realistic entry path and decent long-term stability, I’d love to hear them.

1l3i4ic,"On a PIP, dealing with unfair manager feedback after escalating to HR — should I resign before my next PIP meeting with HR?","Hi all,
I’m currently on a PIP and wanted to get some outside perspective.

I have ADHD and autism (which my employer is aware of and has formally documented). A few weeks ago, I escalated concerns to HR about how my director (who my manager reports to) was giving me inconsistent and unclear feedback. After that, HR got involved and instructed the director to stop giving me direct feedback and instead route it through my manager going forward.

Ever since then, my manager has started giving me similarly vague, last-minute, or unreasonable feedback that makes it almost impossible to succeed. For example, I recently submitted an analysis on time (and addressed all prior feedback), but my manager didn’t say anything for over 48 hours—only to respond saying it didn’t meet expectations and others had to step in to finish it. She cited issues that had never been raised in prior versions, even though I had submitted multiple drafts over the prior week with consistent content and no feedback about those specific issues. I also met with another teammate (who she said had to step in), and he told me it was a “nice summary” and “great commentary,” so I was blindsided by what she wrote.

To be honest, I’m pretty sure going to HR triggered all this. But part of why I escalated was because I thought HR might be more cautious knowing my documented disabilities and not wanting it to look like discrimination. Still, I get the sense they’re building a paper trail to fire me—and I don’t think I can win this.

Right now I’m waiting for my manager to respond to the follow-up email I sent today clarifying the feedback timing and inconsistencies (I attached documentation). I’m considering going back to HR again, but I know that might accelerate the outcome.

At this point, I’m not even that upset if I get fired. I’m already actively interviewing and have multiple final rounds coming up. My main concern is protecting my future job search.

So here’s my question:
If I think they’re going to fire me at my next HR/PIP check-in meeting (in a few days), should I resign the day before so it doesn’t show up on background checks or employment screens? I just want to minimize long-term damage to my record.

Would appreciate any advice from people who’ve dealt with similar situations.",perc_30-s,7,0.8899999856948853,9,1749073681,2025-06-04 21:48:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3i4ic/on_a_pip_dealing_with_unfair_manager_feedback/,6,2025
1l3i3jx,Excuse to get out of work,"Plain and simple I need a good excuse to call in to work last minute(day before). 

It’s worth noting that if I call in , the work load does not transfer to my colleagues nor will it affect them at all. 
My job is stressful. Not physically demanding but it’s mentally taxing. If I don’t take a break soon it will start effecting my performance if it hasn’t already. I plan on taking off Thursday and Friday so that I can have 4 days off of work(including the weekend). I honestly need a full week off but 4 days will suffice until I can take an actual vacation. I plan on saying I have car problems. I considered doing an online doctor appointment and getting a doctors note but I don’t want to use my sick time. What’s the best excuse to miss work last minute? An excuse they likely won’t try to verify. I don’t want to say funeral either😅. My supervisor seems cool but I don’t want to find out that he’s not lol. I’ve never used pto/vacation/sick time so pardon the ignorance. 

I never missed work at any job unless I was super sick which is infrequent. I’m already mentally stressed out in life. My job is stressful. I’m adding more stress because the work-life balance is so bad I can’t take care of personal stuff. I haven’t even been getting sleep and everything is catching up to me. I need a quick break from work so I can mentally reset. I even need to catch up on the basics like sleeping, I need to work on my car, I need to cleanse(stomach pain/issues), even need a haircut. Ive held off on taking any time off but now I need it! Any help is appreciated.

1l3hznh,Competitor offered me a job doing the same thing for the same amount.,"I am at a crossroads. I currently work part time in a dying field. About a week ago our company’s local competitor offered me a position doing pretty much the same thing I’m doing now. Last fall, my company did company wide layoffs, which included both of our full time employees at my location. When I asked about potential raises as I was being given more responsibilities, they told me if I wanted to make more money, I would need to do more off-site jobs. (They are not called offsite jobs, I use that to stay somewhat anonymous.) 

When this happened, I interviewed with this competitor in November /December of last year after they picked up both the full time employees that were laid off. I told them I couldn’t take a pay cut, as they normally offer between 12 and 14 an hour. My former boss works for them after being laid off from my current employer and has talked me up from what I understand, which is why they finally reached out to me.

I truly enjoy my current job, it can be really fun at times. During the off season, I get left alone for the most part. I answer some emails, attend a few meetings here and there (all while working from home). Before this, i had a job I loved with people I enjoyed being around, but the small business couldn’t make enough money and eventually dissolved. i know what it’s like to go to work and not be miserable and that’s all i really want. I did, however, sign a noncompete agreement with my current company and am unsure if it is still enforceable in my state. I am not a high up exec, and have 1.5 years of experience. I don’t work in sales, so I wouldn’t take clients with me. I don’t think there is much they could do to me for violating it.

My current company is going down the tubes. They keep pushing off their bankruptcy to my understanding. My position revolves around local sports, which this other company also covers. I have been in my position for a year and a half. I was warned when I started they don’t give raises. A few days ago the competitor raised the offering starting pay to what I make currently—$15 an hour—getting the same amount of hours I do right now. This company as a whole seems to be growing and doing well, but the division I would be in doesn’t. 

I had a call with the competitor today and asked about cost of living increases or performance based raises (because I don’t get them now). Their response was that they normally pay minimum wage for this job (10.70 in my state), so the fact they’re offering 15 an hour should be a testament to their intentions. They didn’t ever answer if that was something they as a company even do. I’ve had a job where we got cost of living and performance based raises as part time employees, so I know it’s possible. I also would most likely not get those off-site jobs because I will be at the bottom of the food chain with much bigger names above me.

Am I wrong for feeling discouraged by that? The competition has other departments and opportunities, covering several different types of media I have experience in. When I asked if there was potential for me to become full time in that department, they couldn’t answer. I currently don’t have that option in my job.

I could be laid off any day. Could be tomorrow, a year from now, and so on. But right now I have a lot of freedom to write, take care of my sick parent, and have a life. There is concern the company wants to sell our office building after renovating. No one will give a solid answer on that. Come fall sports season, I know one coworker will be let go because they can do his job remotely from a different city. Given that my position is more hand on, it has to be done locally.

I don’t know if I will be happy at this new place. Until now, it was not something I was worried about when looking for jobs when I was miserable.

Until I can write full time, if that day ever comes, I would like to make enough money to survive. Maybe move out on my own, and not be on government assistance if it even still exists by then. It seems like either way the best I can do with my college degree is $15 an hour. What should I do?

1l3ht1v,Leaving a small company that will leave them in a poor position,"So I’ve worked at my job for only a few months. I left my old job to join them, and after a few verbal promises and conditions have fallen flat, I’m really not as comfortable there anymore. 

I get waves of anxiety when I’m working and it gets busy, I don’t synergise with the team all that well, and my work-life balance isn’t where it should be/id like it to be. 

My old job, the one I just left, have told me that there’s still a position there for me - but only for a little while (as they are still recruiting). 
It would have much better work-life balance, the same pay (more pay with overtime), and less/the same hours - plus I still have a good friendship with a couple of them there.
My reason for leaving was the new offer that I had - but the person that made me these offers is leaving anyways.

My problem is, massive massive anxiety about having the conversation with my current employer/manager about leaving.
It’s a very small start-up hospitality business, and I’m one of 2 key players that keep the whole place running (the rest of the team are pretty much all part timers).
If I leave, it would leave the business in a very rocky position, and a couple of the people I actually like in a bad spot. 

I don’t want there to be any bridges burned, or any negativity. I know that I need to do what’s best for me, but I can’t get past this blockade. 

Am I right in thinking of leaving and going back to a place that has better work/life balance? Am I jumping the gun too quickly? 
How can I go about having the conversation of leaving in the best way that softens the blow as much as possible?",RoyalPotential3062,2,1.0,6,1749072888,2025-06-04 21:34:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3ht1v/leaving_a_small_company_that_will_leave_them_in_a/,6,2025
1l3ho3e,Never seen my boyfriend so down over job hunting.,"I need advice. My boyfriend just graduated from college this past December and he is pretty introverted. He has been applying and interviewing with not much luck and I tell him every time that that’s ok!!! The job market is a MESS right now. And it’s even harder because he’s in that weird new grad transitional stage in life where it’s strange for him and no one wants to hire someone with no experience under their belt yet and jobs/interviewers are keen on straight up just ghosting you if you didn’t get the job. He literally cried in my arms today (we have been together for 5 years and I’ve only seen him cry one time before this and it was over a movie not life) after an interview bc even tho he said it went well he said “I just don’t think I can do it…” he said “im 25 and I have no clue what I want to do with my life.” And after I reassured him that nobody really does at that age and that it’s normal he replied “yeah but I just finished 5 years of college and I STILL don’t know.” He struggles with social anxiety and I’m just genuinely worried about him. I made sure it wasn’t to a point where he felt suicidal and once he confirmed that that’s not the case I offered to help him brain storm. But I got a lot of “I don’t knows” which I totally understand. I think he’s also afraid of being stuck in a job where you’re there for most of the day sitting in the same spot for 9 hours and wasting your life away. He has a history of depression so I can see how that might make him nervous.

1l3gdcx,How do you navigate poor/no management as a young professional? How do you navigate and advocate for yourself if you don't have a mentor and you are new to the industry? How do you build your confidence?,"Feel free to disregard what I'm typing here if you want and respond to the Title of this post since this is a long post, but the context behind why I'm asking this question is below. I appreciate your responses if you have the time! I'm sure years of collective experience from the internet would be great for him to read about.

I'm looking for advice on how anyone handles situations where you are faced with poor management constantly (which can have a lot of influences out of our control) and how you avoid letting it impact confidence, mental health, etc. as much as possible? Anything from yoga or meditation, or how you balance working a demanding job while trying to find a new one (I know, very difficult to do in the times we are in). And if you're in the thick of it, how are you dealing with it?!

My husband, since graduation, was so excited to join the workforce and bring his best to whatever company needed him. Bright-eyed and bushy tailed would describe him at that stage, whole-heartedly, like all new grads. At that point when we were dating, he would dress up cleanly, shave, and go stir-crazy if we were in the house for more than a few hours on the weekend because he just wanted to go outside and have adventures. COVID happened the Spring of him finishing his Masters, and his career opportunities reduced/disappeared (retracted full-time position/offer) like it did for most of the world at that time. He was able to get a job at a small startup and get paid less than he was expecting, but he still showed up to work with cologne on and full head to toe business casual lol, even though everyone was virtual.

At this startup, my husband worked like a dog, and he worked with much more experienced ""guys"" who really didn't care about his career progression. My personal opinion is that it seemed like these guys were just pining around to get to retirement a few years away. I remember once during dinner, my husband picked up a call from his ""manager"" (who was never even defined until his 3rd year at this company after he asked upper management to define this almost weekly) who was calling him from the drive-thru of a Whataburger and just wanted to talk about the deal he got on his new truck and brag about his investments. In any case, my husband was grateful for the opportunity that gave him a job, when most people could not find jobs. I like to tell him that he learned ""how not to be"" to others if he was ever in that position, from this experience.

He would ask these ""seasoned professionals"" what they thought of his career plan, if they wanted any extra help or if he could shadow them, and he was only met with ""sure anytime"". He did that for 3-4 years and only got ""can we move this out"" and ""we don't have time for this, it's crunch time"". He knew he didn't want to stay at this company long term but wanted to give them his best until he could find a new position with a manager who would help give career advice or help shed light on their experience.

Fast forward to now - he was able to find another company (still small), where he quite literally has had 5 different managers in under 2 years. This is because the company itself makes a lot of internal shifts and layoffs almost weekly. He tries to continue reaching out to his previous managers but ultimately, they cancel any 1:1's. After listening to him over the years, I think he has been thrown into a downward spiral recently (past few months, but honestly around a year) because he still feels like a new grad even after 5+ years ""out in the world"", and he feels he is not worth being mentored. He wants a leader/mentor who would give more than a courtesy call with a few links to some seminar and then cancel every call after. At his current company, he hasn't had anyone stick around long enough to be a mentor or someone to give him feedback on his performance and what he can improve/what he's doing well.

Over the years, he has worked tirelessly on job applications as well as personal development, utilizing as many tools as he can to gain skill and prove to someone that he's worth it and change his circumstances. I try my best to be his cheerleader, to tell him that good things are coming with all his hard work, and he has to be patient. I try to give him as much time (we have a little one) to work on whatever he wants to do to help (whether that is let off steam or work on something development related) but at this point, seeing his shift over the last few months, I need to try something else to be there for him. I don't mind the unshaven look or the pjs on call (remote), but I know it's not him. He is such a light, and I just feel like others sharing their experience or advice on how they have/are dealing with similar things will help light that spark again! 

If you've made it this far, any advice you have to me as a support partner as well would be great! My husband, over the years, has helped me build my confidence on my appearance, so much so that I feel like the coolest and most beautiful woman ever, my head is huge! I feel like I've failed him. So please, bring your experience and share! I think it's a tough time for a lot of people, and if this post sounds like you, I hope the community can also help you! Someone out there believes in you, whether you know it or not!

1l3fd43,How risky is this relocation?,"I was just offered 68K (72-76K total comp) for a position that is five hours away from where I live. I currently make 43K and love the company I’m with. But the new role sounds good and it really aligns with my past experience and degrees. It could also open doors for future higher paying roles in the future.

However, I’m conflicted between accepting and staying with my current role. My current role is remote (with a slight possibility of going hybrid in the Fall). The new position is in office all five days. My current company is restructuring and I may have the opportunity to move departments (my goal), but the recruiter has been ghosting me for the past month.

If we relocate, my husband will have to quit his job, but will likely qualify for trailing spouse unemployment. He doesn’t have a set career and makes about 40k. I don’t think he would have a hard time finding a job similar to what he does now.

We don’t own a house and currently rent an apartment. Our current lease ends at the end of this month and we’ve already given notice, as we had planned to move to another apartment.

The new position does not offer relocation assistance, so it would be out of pocket to move. But we were already planning to move, so the costs wouldn’t really be too much different. We’ve also lived around the new role’s location before, so it would be like moving ‘home’.

Do all the pros make up for the cons? 

Should I 
•Stay with my current company and hope I can get an opportunity to interview for a position with a similar salary? (Not having to move) 
•Accept the offer and move on, despite having to relocate and my husband have to quit his job?
•Try to find another role in the area I live in? I’ve been looking for 6 months since I got my masters. I’ve applied and interviewed for several jobs and either get passed over or ghosted.

1l3ey0d,What Can I Offer as an Intern at a Small Business,"I offered to intern for the owner of the car wash I work at in some sort of business development/finance role, but they don't have a set program and we are basically creating this role. I'm a finance major at a good public university- what work can I offer to do for him that might be mutually beneficial? I don't have much real work experience in a business capacity so I thought about prospecting new clients, doing financial analysis, etc. I am looking to get a job post-grad in the general finance space, whether that be consulting, sales, business dev or even product management at a f500 company. 

TLDR: Finance major at a good public university wants to create an internship role with car wash owner doing business/finance work. Looking for ideas that would benefit the business while building relevant experience for post-grad goals.

Any and all recommendations are appreciated. ",nick10344,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1749065981,2025-06-04 19:39:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3ey0d/what_can_i_offer_as_an_intern_at_a_small_business/,6,2025

1l3c7yx,Following up- filled out my PIP form today and expressed my frustrations. Boss now calling me a liar,"Long story short - I got put on a PIP last year, and at first for about 6 months things seemed to be moving alright. Then, when I told my mgr that he can’t just keep telling me “well you screwed up some things but overall not bad,” and I needed some concrete feedback on my performance, he asks the one guy on the team who has had a problem with me from day 1 to come up with things I missed. The first time I saw this list was on my PIP— no prior discussion and no real actual feedback, just accusations that I did things wrong. 

So I responded quite verbosely to that as I have documented everything I’ve touched since returning from leave. Then I find out second hand that he had shown this PIP to a team member and remarked “can you believe this? Look at what he wrote..” clearly upset about the length. Fine, whatever. 

I received the next iteration of this form and I had been called out for being super upset on one afternoon, and muttering curse words too loudly. At that point, I figured if he wants to put that on my PIP, then I should also include what I had been trying to discuss with him but getting nowhere and the fact that a teammate of mine had been shown my PIP and boss was visibly upset at the length of my responses to this team member. 

Never have I gotten a response so quickly. First he told me he had never shared my PIP with anyone, and then accused me of lying on that form, at least 3 times, after I said I wasn’t about to divulge this person’s name because I didn’t want to make trouble for anyone else. Eventually he had to go, and said we’d talk about it tomorrow. 

I’m not sure if he just simply doesn’t remember doing this- but I know he did otherwise this teammate could not have known about his irritation to what I put on the form. He is mad af, and I’m keeping my responses to him at a minimum. After being called a liar and swearing he didn’t show it to anyone else, I figure this is not going to end well (not like there was a chance it would prior to today..). But I know I’m in the right here, just wondering if anyone has any tips when he grabs me tomorrow to talk this over? I’m not planning to mention this teammate’s name for the aforementioned reasons. But calling me a liar?? This guy has not been meeting with me regularly as was the case for the first 3 months last year, will ignore my messages, and is trying to find things for me to do after another teammate locked me out of the system we’d all been working on for about a year at this point..

1l3brsm,Need Advice - Help New Job,"I started a new job in HR recently. It’s a significant drop in pay from what I’m use to, but I did ask for the top of their (low) salary range. I needed the flexibility and a job closer to home. 

To help map out the story. I started three days ago. I’ve had no training (which is okay) the access to my systems is jacked and I’m not making a stink about it nor will I. I’m a seasoned employee (no new grad), so I know how these things go.

In a meeting, second day, they started talking about hiring and how many heads we need etc… very much so recruiting. I realized that they use template job descriptions and do not modify them to capture the essence of a position. 

Now, the aforementioned is why I’m here 🤣. This is an HR assistant position. Now that I’ve started they are stated: we will give you safety, I’m recruiting 50-100 employees and they want me to take over employee attendance and address any employee grievances that may arise. Anyone that is familiar with HR knows that’s not an assistants job nor was most of that in the description. That is, Safety, Recruiting, and HRG related task. I’m really the HR manager because I have no on over me. There is no HRG or HR manager in the facility. Therefore, I address ALL things pertaining employees, including benefits. 

I’m tempted to go back to the hiring manager and state this, way for tactful than I did here and ask for higher pay, but we all know that’s ridiculous and won’t happen. What do you suggest?

1l3bkq0,Environmental careers,"Hi, I’d love some advice regarding a career path. 

Qualifications 

I graduate university in three months with an MSc in ecology / zoology (Tel-Aviv university). I also have a bachelors in health sciences (UCF).

My MSc was focused on wildlife conservation, camera trapping, qgis (arcgis certificate), statistical models in R, and writing a thesis (hoping to also be published) 

I will apply to get a wildlife conservation biologist certificate from the wildlife society. 

I also have previous experience working in two molecular labs, where i learned the technicals thoroughly (DNA and viral RNA extractions, PCR, real time PCR, Sanger sequencing, exo-sap purification, karyotyping, flow-cytometry…), and identifications of species with molecular markers (GeneAid, taq-mix), and metabarcoding (PCR amplification, sequencing, QIIME2, DADA2).


Different career paths 

1. Environmental scientist - similar to my MSc, camera trapping, qgis, R…

2. Environmental biologist - obtaining dna samples and analyzing them

3. Environmental consultant 

4. Environmental health specialist 

5. Environmental compliance analyst

6. Sustainability auditor / ESG Associate


Question

I disliked the surveying, it took too much time and energy, for reference, as an environmental scientist I have to wake up at 5 am, travel a hundred miles to separate locations, set camera traps, finish at 10 pm, do it again for a few months, write a report, then repeat, hence why I’m looking for alternate career paths 

Is it possible for me to change to one of the other listed jobs, if I get certifications like ISO14001 lead auditor, OSHA 40 hour HAZWOPER training, OSHA 10 Hour construction safety, SEIR certificate, UNEP-WCMC TNFD& biodiversity disclosure course… 

What would you guys advise? 

Thanks in advance

So I graduate from my social sciences program this year and I am wondering which degree to pursue after, since this diploma is useless without further education. I am interested in a lot of things, from languages, linguistics and teaching to anything related to tourism and travel. Communications, marketing, films and literature also seem like things I could see myself working with for the rest of my life.

Every degree seems to have some pros and some cons, but none of them are a perfect match for what I am looking for. Every social sciences industry seems to be in difficulty, and having a hard time to find a job is a problem for many. However, that is what I am interested in and what I see myself doing in the futur. I also live in Canada, I don’t know if that changes anything. Any advice form people in my situation, or from anybody that can help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1l3bg0j,In need of career advice,"I graduated from college in May 2024 with my bachelor’s in environmental science, and was unlucky with the job search until October 2024. I currently work in insurance, and the company I work for is a really great environment — the people are great, benefits are amazing and the commute is even better! I feel very comfortable here because the work is relatively easy and I never feel stressed, but I don’t feel challenged and just feel like I’m straying away from my original goals. I took this job only because I wanted to be employed, not because I was interested in insurance. 

Though I had an open mind at first, I am not passionate about this at all and often feel unsatisfied with the minimal work that I am doing, and the pay is very low. Because this is a very small company, the department I work in is dwindling down — it’s just myself, my manager, and three other people who are all leaving/retiring in 2 years. If I quit, I find myself putting a massive burden on my manager to service all the clients we have, and if I don’t, I’ll be stuck here for god knows how long. Once I stay here for more than a year, I know that I will become “important” and have a large book of clients that I will be responsible for, which I feel will lock me in to this job even longer. It’s hard because everyone is so close and very tight-knit, many people working here for 10-20+ years and I’m the youngest one there so I know that I would be judged and I would disappoint many people… but I just don’t see myself here for the long term. 

My manager even noticed that I wasn’t super passionate about the work, even though I try my best to seem enthusiastic and eager to learn. She asks me from time to time, if I’m happy and satisfied with the learning experience and the job overall, and I told her that I’m always happy to learn new things. She asked me how long I plan on staying, if its just temporary, and I felt really uncomfortable, because I knew that whatever I said would be untruthful, but I did tell her maybe 3 years? To which she sighed with relief — since everyone else in the dept is leaving before that. 

Since I don’t have much work experience other than a 4 month environmental internship, and the 8 months at this insurance position, I’m anxious to enter the job market again. It’s hard to find anything for fresh grads, so it would be even harder for me as someone with little experience and a side quest! I have been looking at job applications for environmental firms, but I don’t have the heart to apply because I feel so terrible for quitting and bailing on my manager who is taking the time to train me. 

However, I will say that the training experience has not been the best, despite all the good things that have come out of this job. It took me 4 months for them to schedule insurance license exam, and I was placed in a different department in the beginning to do basic tasks. After I obtained my license, I was finally moved to my official department, where I finally started training. However, my tasks are still super basic, and if there’s not a lot going on, I am bored and without work. I’ve spent most of my time here not being useful at all and that’s what makes me so unhappy. Even asking to get trained, my manager makes time for me but she is so busy and overworked herself, it feels like an inconvenience to ask. Because all my tasks are pretty spaced out, I don’t have the repetition to recall every single detail needed, causing me to make minor mistakes throughout the way. Until these past two weeks, I’ve had maybe one or two tasks a day. I understand, because everyone is really busy with deadlines and meetings, but I just feel stagnant here. 


I’m not too sure what I should do. I need some guidance that would help me get back into my career goals as an environmental scientist/consultant/literally anything involving this. I know that the longer I continue this “side quest”, it will be even more difficult to find an enviro job. 
Do I search for a job and quit once I have one lined up? Or should I stay until I’ve worked a full year? Or should I just wait until the job market gets somewhat better, and help out the company until then?

1l3bczs,STEM change. Help.,"Hello! So I am terribly lost in my carrer atm and would would be extremely happy for any and all help. (TLDR in the end)


So, I am just turning 25 this month and I feel more lost than I've ever was in my life. Back when I started uni I wasn't really sure anyway to be fair, and I was forced by my parents to start Computer Science (My brother is a electric engineer and my dad is a electrician, so it's in the family), and while I am extremely good at CS from writing programs to electric stuff, I was never sure that's what I wanted to do (back when I started CS at 18, only real jobs in my country were writing stupid codes for stupid companies, and I just couldn't handle the thought of doing that for the rest of my life). After giving a try for a bit I decided that was just not for me and I decided to do a extreme shift to animation, back when I started that was a great carrer path with jobs just about the same range that stem jobs had (about 100k give or take), but of course between here and then we were hit with Covid and the rise of AI, and now the animation field is HORRIBLE, you either earn close to nothing or you do like video editing or other marketing crap that makes me wanna puke. Not that CS hasn't been taken over by AI as well so not that great either way lol.

After a relatively good start in animation, I am currently without a job outside stupid motion graphics stuff that I just hate, and honestly I've been thinking and I am not even sure animation on itself it's what I want to do. So I've been considering just starting over again in a stem field, that has always been what I liked and what I've seen myself actually enjoying doing, but back when I started college those just weren't options at all in the uni I was studying.




My biggest issue atm is... I don't know what I actually want to study. I literally just like everything, I love physics, electrical stuff, chemistry, mechanical stuff, aeronautics, robotics... and I am just extremely scared to choose wrong, I feel like a carrer change atm is possible but in 5 or 10 years when find I choose wrong? Much more troublesome. But I literally just actually love everything, sometimes I spend weeks and weeks studying and creating a CS project, then I get tired of it and start studying something related to physics for the next weeks just because. I suppose my biggest joy I just studying, researching and creating, learning new stuff really makes me happy and focused, while actually doing the same thing over and over makes me tired and annoyed. Also I really enjoy difficulty subjects and challenges, the harder and more complicated the better.

(TLDR: I am 25, just recently finished my animation degree and I realized maybe that's not really my field, but I don't know what to follow because I love WAY too many stem fields)

I am currently working with a top company from India, which that takes care of airport and expressway branding as in out of Home advertisement. This company also has different verticals which work as agencies ,digital advertisement and advertisement solution providers.
I have currently been working in this company as an intern for the past two months and now they are offering me a PPO (sales & marketing), which in value is higher than the average placement number of my college. 
The company has been awarded with the great place to work certification and has a great environment, no toxicity very well work life balance. My only concern is working in this industry as a sales and marketing person,would I be able to have significant growth in my career or would I be able to switch my career late on.Apart from this if I do not go forward with this job. I will have to sit for a placement season in my college, which will which obviously be a gamble and I don’t know what kind of pay or role will I be getting for sure

The only issue that I thought this company had is that there is a very laid back attitude and the learning curve is not that great. As in the learning is not very good  because the employees are there because of their and experience, and not because of their aptitude

Very confused should take this or wait for other opportunities in college 
Also I am a little inclined towards working in consultancy and opportunities for the same come to my college (Big 4)
Should I play safe or take the gamble the job market is also a bit shaken up

Customer appears to have four full-time employees with desktop PCs and four work from home people who would be ""bring your own device"" laptops and come into the office occasionally. They are a financial services company.

1l3apvv,New FT job only schedules 13 hours/week 😱,"I've accepted a position at Sprouts as a full time Sales Ambassador. I've been excited about the opportunity but have learned from my trainer that most employees get 20 hours per week - including my position. I've completed my onboarding, did 20 hours of shadowing last week, 0 (yes - zero hours) this week, and I'm scheduled 20 hours next week.

I am not able to pay my bills under these conditions. I need a minimum of 30 hours *every* week. I have auto insurance and storage bills due next week and won't have enough to pay them. TBH It's very deceptive to hire someone as full time and then only schedule 40 hours over 3 weeks.

I was really stoked for the great benefits, 15% off groceries where I normally shop anyway, a chance to see if I could advance, higher hourly wage than my former job, and a good starting position for me.

I'm on FMLA leave (now 11 weeks) from the aforesaid ""former"" employer on account of a hip injury. I'm probably ready to go back to the ""former"" employer but I'm going through the VA and they are ridiculously slow. I've held back from giving my resignation in case something doesn't work out with the new employer (like this!).

I've spoken to ""former"" HR (again, I still have my old position) who informed me that the location I was working at IS CLOSING the end of July. I don't think I can transfer somewhere else within the company. There are a lot of seasonal opportunities but permanent full time positions are at least an hour away. There may be seasonal positions but virtually no hours in this current season. Staying with this employer doesn't seem to be worth the gas money whether I get 1 short shift per week or full time as hour away.

The new employer totally sabotaged me offering a full time position but only providing 20 hours/week, with zero hours my 2nd week. It's been hard if not impossible at the end of my FMLA leave. I just don't know what I should do.",VardoJoe,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1749056106,2025-06-04 16:55:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l3apvv/new_ft_job_only_schedules_13_hoursweek/,6,2025

1l3acyf,Working for Schwab over Vanguard?,"Currently I work for Vanguard at a call center. I'm underpaid and the job is miserable (callers are miserable). If I stick it out here for 6 years I'll have a nice 401k match, but the issue is there is not much vertical growth in my department. Each ""promotion"" is just an extra 2-3k a year so not a real jump. Also my department is the armpit of Vangaurd, so most other departments would rather not hire from mine. I'm possibly going to be offered a Client Relationship Specialist role at Charles Schwab. The pay is an extra 6k base a year or so compared to Vangaurd and they actually sponsor you to get your series 7 without a job offer hanging on the line. I'm not sure if I should stay or leave. Vangaurd makes me very unhappy and I feel undervalued and underpaid considering I have two licensees and my MBA and make under 50k. But I know nothing about Schwab and don't know anyone that works there. Is it a good company? Are the incentives good? Is there room for REAL progression in the company?

1l3a1ig,Dental Hygiene? Teaching? Accounting? Nursing?,"I’ll try to make this as quick as possible. I’m in my late 20’s (F), few years left till I turn 30. I’ve been married for a few years now, no kids yet but definitely possible at any time. I feel all over the place career wise. Currently I WFH for a Pharmacy just in insurance. The WFH aspect is decent however the work is hard for me. I’ve literally asked myself before if I was too “dumb” for learning new things. In HS I excelled at History (even taking an AP Gov class), English, and enjoyed media/the arts. Just the “fun” classes however I failed math repeatedly and the only science I did well in was Biology and Freshman science. Absolutely did terrible in chemistry.

Anyways, I’ve worked as a SPED Para at an elementary school shortly after COVID and I remember enjoying it quite a bit however it was pretty exhausting and the behaviors were so intense that I decided to change my major to regular elementary ed and get out of SPED. That being said, I didn’t even continue school and now I’m just at this crossroads. Right now I am an aspiring Dental Hygienist as I have family who works as dental assistants and I like the stability of it as well as the hands on aspect however sometimes I wonder if I’m smart enough or if it’s worth it. I want to go to dental assisting school which is a few thousand and my husband works but I don’t want to put all the work on him when we have bills to pay and DH school would still be at least a year away if I can get accepted into a program. He’s encouraged me and thinks it’s a good idea for me. One concern I have with DH besides the classes required is the lack of benefits. I’m aware there are corporate offices but I am unsure of the quality of benefits they offer. I occasionally have seizures (once a year usually), have poor eyesight, migraines, among other health issues so having health insurance is important and my husband’s current job doesn’t offer any. He wants to change jobs but that could be awhile. I also have considered nursing that seems to be the best option as far as pay and benefits and even starting sooner but than I wonder my commitment to it and if I could handle the emotional aspect.

I have also considered teaching, going back for my degree and teaching as an Elementary teacher. The benefits and retirement opportunities would be great. The pay would be less than DH however that’s not a huge factor for me especially considering all the time off. It’s something I feel confident I could do as I already know the subject information and think I do well teaching it. I am mostly concerned about kids nowadays having some major behavioral issues as well as shootings. That has been a fear of mine and something that’s kept me from schools which is sad but true.

Lastly, I’ve considered business careers such as accounting. I’ve been told that you don’t actually have to be great at math for accounting just have to know basic math. I can kind of get behind the whole Corporate career but at the same time I’m unsure if I can handle staring at a screen all day everyday and I know corporate has a lot of downfalls but the benefits and pay would be decent if I could complete a Bachelors degree. I’m all over the place really. My actual goal would just to be a wife and a mother but not lose my health insurance and in the meantime I just need to find something to help us out and help myself out. If it’s something that can be part time in the future when we have kids that would help too.

1l39h4a,"What are the implications shifting from a Fortune 50, to a very new, small, and unknown subsidiary?","Hi folks,

23M from India, and I work as an Investment Associate at a Fortune 50, with 2 years of work experience under my belt. I work in Infrastructure Investing. Prior to my job, I interned at a very big Infra fund, and in one of its platform companies in the energy space.

Recently, I helped my employer spin off a subsidiary, and sell down stake to a leading infrastructure PE.

Post the deal, I have received an offer from the PE to join the subsidiary.

The change in perks include a 30% increase in my compensation and a promotion with additional responsibilities . I currently earn \~2500$ a month, barring my bonus (It's a decent chunk of change in India!)

As a part of the role, I would be expected to manage the assets owned by the subsidiary, take newer opportunities to Investment Committees, and tie up structured finance.

I am in two minds about the opportunity , as I am unsure on what this change from a known Fortune 50 to an unknown, and very new subsidiary company signal to my future employers, and Adcoms for the US/EU MBA I aim to pursue in the future.

It would be good to know your answers to the questions below:

1. Will it reflect poorly on my CV to move to this platform company from my current role? what sort of signalling effect would it have on employers/MBA adcoms
2. If it does reflect poorly, would the promotion (my second in 2 years) and additional responsibilities make up for it?
3. With your limited set of information, would you make the switch for the money, and the role?
4. Is there any implication which I am ignoring due to my relative inexperience?

1l37lzf,Employment trap that nobody really talks about…it’s real!,"My neighbor Jake used to manage supply chain for a mid-size manufacturer. Made decent money, had his house nearly paid off, was planning his daughter's wedding. Then the company got acquired in March 2023.

Eighteen months later, he's stocking shelves at a big box store for $16 an hour.

This isn't the story you hear about resilient workers bouncing back. This is what actually happens now.

Jake spent the first eight months doing everything right. Polished his LinkedIn, networked at industry events, worked with a recruiter who kept promising leads were coming. Applied to 400+ positions. Got maybe 20 responses. Most were automated rejections that came weeks later.

The few interviews he landed all ended the same way. They loved his experience but were concerned about the employment gap. They wanted someone currently employed. Classic catch-22.

Month nine, his unemployment ran out. By month twelve, he'd burned through his savings keeping up with the mortgage and helping his daughter with wedding expenses he'd already committed to. Credit cards became his lifeline.

The retail job came through a friend of a friend who knew the district manager. Jake was grateful. At least it was something. But here's the kicker: he makes about 40% of what he used to, and half his paycheck now goes to minimum payments on debt he never would have needed if finding work hadn't taken so long.

He tells me the hardest part isn't the pay cut. It's that everyone assumes he must have done something wrong to end up there. Like he chose this path instead of having it chosen for him by a system that's fundamentally broken.

The scary part? Jake had everything supposedly going for him. Good work history, solid references, relevant skills, savings, connections. If it took him this long to find anything, what happens to people without those advantages?

I keep thinking about something he said last week: ""I wish I'd known earlier what kind of work I was actually good at versus what I thought I should be doing. Maybe I would have made different choices along the way.""

I am considering either becoming adept with AI&ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) and get a regular software engineering job ...or focusing on game dev. I don't have any project in either of this right now and programming skills are really bad.

# What attracts me to each one

The one attracting me to AI is the fact that its extremely complex and involves a lot of math (although i am bad at math). I have an attraction to game dev because I play a lot of games and whenever I watch game dev tutorials on YouTube which get randomly recommended to me , I feel like game dev is so awesome and I feel motivated to learn about and make games. I started learning blender (since we need to learn animation for game dev) in 2024 but abandoned it after learning it for 3-4 months since my exams came up and I had to prepare for them.

# Prior experience or background

I currently have 15 backlogs/arrear subjects which I have accumulated for failing in those subjects in the past, in the field of AI&ML (Bachelor of Engineering Course) in a third-tier college in India. I am 5 years into a 4 year course and I am genuinely confused as to what to do in my life. I don't find comfort or happiness anywhere. I suck so bad at everything right now.

# Long-term goals or dreams—career-wise

I just want to have fun while making a lot of money because I don't want to get overburdened with work and get depressed . So I like to do something which interests me , from a long term perspective. I lose interest in whatever I am doing extremely quickly (although i didn't lose interest in animation in blender) and I don't know why.

I was stunned. It’s not like I could just “prove” otherwise. At that point I mentally checked out. They later said I said “I don’t know” too many times. I was honest, didn’t try to bluff, and I guess that was the wrong move.

Qualcomm wanted everything — embedded systems, electronics, audio engineering, software, and customer-facing experience. I somehow made it to the final in-person round. That was over a month ago. No feedback, no rejection, just silence. When I asked about travel and accommodation reimbursement (which I paid for myself), they said they’d follow up. Never did.

The worst part? I doubt either of these roles paid more than £45–50k. So for all this effort, scrutiny, and frankly dehumanising treatment, the reward wouldn’t have even been that high.

So yeah — I’m seriously thinking of trying my luck in finance. If I’m going to be treated like I’m disposable and squeezed dry, I’d rather at least get paid for it.

If anyone here has made the switch from hardware or semiconductors into finance or something totally different, I’d love to hear how it went. Do you feel better on the other side? Was it worth it?

Appreciate any advice, solidarity, or just someone saying “yep, been there.”

Thanks for reading.

1l34qtx,"Should I take the risk on a role I might not be ready for — but that could be the right long-term move? Or stay in the safe comfort zone, that I am fine with?","I'm 31 and have been working as a software developer for most of my career. I also tried myself briefly as a functional analyst, and nowadays I focus on automation — but overall, I’ve been doing individual contributor-type roles.

Now there’s an internal opening at my company for a Solutions Architect. It’s a more client- and decision-oriented role, less about daily coding and more about shaping solutions, guiding direction, and interacting with multiple teams and stakeholders. I’ve never done anything like that before, so part of me feels unqualified. The hiring manager said my technical background would be enough to start, but I still have doubts.

To be honest, I don't see much of a future in my current position — but I’m “okay” with it. It’s comfortable. I know what I’m doing, there’s not much pressure, and I’m not unhappy. But I can’t really picture myself doing this in 10 years either. As much as I enjoy coding, I feel like it’s making me more introverted and isolated. I miss having more interaction with people.

I don’t have a wife or kids yet, so this could be the right time to take a risk — but it would definitely mean more stress, responsibility, and stepping into the unknown.

Have any of you taken a leap into a more demanding role that felt ""too big"" at first? Was it worth it? How do you know when it’s time to leave your comfort zone?

1l33vr7,Go to Japan or Take the Job,"Hello all. I'm a recent engineering grad and I'm at a crossroads. I'm hoping someone has been in a similar situation and can offer any advice.

I recently got an offer (130K) for a great job in a good location doing interesting work. The thing is my spouse (I'm a non-traditional student in my late twenties) recently got moved to Japan for their work (military). They are there for 3 years before coming back to the states. Of course I want to be with my spouse and they're okay with me just pursuing my masters while I'm in Japan if I can't find any work there, which will likely be the case since I haven't been hearing back from anything. My masters would be free (I'm a vet). They support me with whatever choice I choose, the job or following them.

On one hand this feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity to be in a different country with my spouse and traveling so much from there. Not to mention the time difference would be pretty difficult if I were to choose the job - plus little time off at a first job so if I wanted to see them it'd be difficult. I'm also a new grad so I think this is the best time to drop everything to go explore a new country. We don't have kids or any work really tying us down.

On the other hand, it kind of feels like career suicide if I turn down this job. I'm a fresh grad and opportunities like this don't seem to come around very much. After 3 years of little to no experience, I'm kinda worried I won't be able to find anything similar to that kind of pay or work.

I know on my deathbed I'm not gonna look back and be glad I chose a few extra years to work. I'd be happy to look back at all the memories I shared with my spouse - but at the same time, this job would kinda set us up for the future.

I'm at a crossroads, I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation, any advice you can offer?",WetPaint21,2,1.0,4,1749038917,2025-06-04 12:08:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l33vr7/go_to_japan_or_take_the_job/,6,2025
1l33spq,"Resigned for Better Pay, but Now Reconsidering: How to Approach a Rehire?","I worked at Company A for almost 10 years. At some point, I realized that newcomers I was tasked with onboarding were earning 30–40% more than me. I had several conversations with my manager about adjusting my salary, but they weren't able to offer a raise that would bring it in line with the salaries of the newcomers.

Unable to cope with the frustration, I started exploring other opportunities and soon received an offer from Company B, among others. Before accepting the offer, I informed my manager and asked one last time if a counteroffer was possible. Since it wasn’t, I decided to resign and joined Company B in February of this year. During my exit interview, I told the HR representative that salary was the only reason for my departure. I made sure to leave on good terms, and the atmosphere was friendly.

However, after a few weeks at Company B, it became clear that things were very different from what had been presented during the interview process. The company culture is, to put it mildly, not a good fit. The attitude of the people is poor, and the work-life balance is practically nonexistent. Now I’m facing two options: take a risk and look for another job, or try to return to Company A. The latter would only be possible starting in August due to a six-month rehire policy. Returning to Company A is the more appealing option, as I’d be working on familiar projects with familiar people.

I'm fairly certain my previous position has already been filled, but I noticed a catch-all job posting that opened in April. I could reach out to either my former manager or the hiring manager listed on that posting to ask if they'd be open to rehiring me.

1l32r93,Salary + Negotiations,"I am in a LCOL area in Australia. I work in finance for a small hotel group and am currently in the process of moving to a different hotel, part of the same group but more complicated and higher revenue.

Over the past 18 months in this organisation a lot has changed and I have been a crucial part of this transition. The group financial controller and financial controller of two of the properties left at the same time(I will refer to these as property 1 and 2) I was an accounts clerk at the time. I was then left with the task of assisting the new group financial controller with learning our systems and processes to accurately complete month end etc. He also hired a new person to replace the controller for property 2, I also ended up assisting this person heavily.

After two months the new FC at property 2 left and I took their position. I have now been in this role for a year and in the group financial controllers words I have performed above expectations.

Meanwhile at property 1 they have gone through 2 Face, both of which I had assisted in training yet again. When the last FC left the group FC asked if i would take the position, to which I agreed. I have since been training my replacement.

Now my main problem is the salary and how best to negotiate this. In my current role I’ve been earning $80k (the person I replaced at property 2, whom lasted 2 months were on $100k, although I accepted a lower salary as I was inexperienced and we spoke about revisiting my salary after 6 months in the role), the new role has been set at $90k. I know the person I am replacing was on $90k, however the person that left 18 months ago was on $100k (both at property 1 & 2).

I often felt like I was turning into someone else. What I once thought would be a dream job was dragging me down because it turns out, the job was a dead end. The foot-in-the-door I once had turned into a nightmare.

Friday, I will work my last shift, getting up at 3 am and leaving at 1 pm (but I had a forced part-time SPLIT SHIFT, so I only got 30 paid hours a week, at $15/hr). I don't know how anyone does that shift. A couple full-timers, one person was still only making $15.50/hr after 5 years in the same department, after starting at $15/hr.

I learned that all the jobs in my department are structured to make people leave eventually because it's not enough money. Even though we're essential! And part-timers like myself didn't get benefits. And it was Monday - Friday, 4 am to 1 pm.

Granted, what I got from this job was two and half years of work experience on my resume in an industry I was interested in. And dang, I was committed for two years, but I hit a wall basically and couldn't do it anymore. One of the last straws for me was seeing my boss promote someone else and not even give me a chance to become full-time. I an surrounded by passive-aggressive, lazy people but I work hard and definitely deserve better than all this, so it's rime to go.

1l30th7,Were there less obvious signs that you needed to start looking for another job?,"Throwaway account because I don't want this linked back to my main account.

Recently, I've been looking for lateral jobs or better that pay significantly more to justify leaving my current position, which is a working supervisor role that I got unexpectedly promoted into 8 months ago as part of a restructure (still doing my work as an IC while managing others).  The restructure suddenly laid off one of my co-workers in exchange for some of us to get promoted into working supervisors, and the news was made in the same week.  It's gotten to the point that if I'm going to get worked to the bone either way, I might as well get paid more.

On one hand, I want to stay in the role so I can say that I spent at least a year or more in a people management role.  On the other hand, I feel that I won't even get to do that on my terms next year.  I've been with this company for over 5 years now.

I started getting a bit concerned after the timeline that unfolded:

* Recently, my manager's been telling me that they're ""hanging on by a thread"" multiple times from the stress of their job, a major project, and having to deal with their interim manager.  Every time their interim manager pings/emails them, my manager either gives a long sigh or sound of frustration.
* The interim manager was a newly promoted VP who was given our team 1.5 years ago after the predecessor was suddenly let go.  The new VP was said to have high turnover, but that was due to ""high expectations""
* They're an ""interim"" manager after my skip manager suddenly gave their notice for retirement and left the company 3 weeks into RTO.  RTO was rolled back just for our team a week later.  The VP didn't seem sympathetic when questions about childcare came up for RTO and their response was ""Well... you can't make it an everyday thing to pick up your kids;  You have to figure out another way"" even though it was ultimately management discretion
* For 6+ months, anything that went sideways (no $ or no reputation was lost) or wasn't to the VP's liking, they would allegedly ""tear a new one"" with both of my managers or any direct report of the VP's.  It turns out my manager wasn't on good terms with the VP for a long time even when my manager's boss was still here.
* I thought I was the only one giving my manager a hard time with a personnel event that didn't go as planned or that I didn't put extra details into a few emails to the VP despite directly addressing each of the VP's requests.  My manager admitted that they've been ""scolded"" multiple times for their other direct reports for the way they've written emails and who knows what else (I've seen plenty of my co-workers' emails - they're not remotely unprofessional)
* As a result, my manager was given a ""Did not meet expectations"" for the first time in the 4 years they've been with the company.  The VP was responsible for the review and cited multiple instances, including my personnel event, as a failure of my manager's role to manage their own team.  My manager was demoralized from both the rating and what's likely a sub-par merit increase to match, and mentions that the VP will still not live down how my personnel event was handled.

At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if my manager is also looking to leave.  If they don't leave first, my guess is that the VP will set up my manager to get laid off next year once our major project goes live at the end of this year and claim ""performance issues"".  If my manager's gone, then I have nobody to back me.

* Even though I'll be getting a new skip manager, my manager's not enthusiastic about it because the new hire was ""handpicked"" by the VP
* Those of us on this major project were offered a retention bonus (I got $10k, but others got double) to stick around through the successful launch of our project and through the end of Q1 next year.  The T&A states that we will not be paid the bonus if we quit or get laid off before the payout date.  My guess is that the VP's just trying to prevent us from leaving midway, but there's no guarantee that they won't pull a dick move and lay us off once we've outlived our usefulness
* Some of the other team members have either mentioned random experiences with the VP or talk about things as if they're dreading the VP's response if it's not positive.  One random event was a co-worker was having Zoom issues (we can only use the browser), didn't know the VP was on the call, and the VP pinged the co-worker 1 minute after the start time to check if they were going to attend.  My direct report, peer, and my manager got chewed out for a separate event for a slow response to an email even though deadlines weren't missed.
* My manager admitted to confronting their interim manager/VP as a ""micromanager"" with wanting excessive updates, checking attendance, tearing apart how emails are written, tearing apart how poorly formatted some resumes pass their desk, etc, but the VP doesn't see it that way.  I figured there's no way these two can get along.
* The VP didn't like that we proposed a starting base pay for a future direct report of mine that's $1k more than my current direct report.  The reasoning was clear:  That the future direct report had the full required experience + years and my current direct report is relatively new to their lateral role (and consequently ""overpaid"" for the inexperience).  The VP suggested $6k less due to the future hire not having a college degree and it would be more ""fair"" to a co-worker of mine who lives in a lower COL state and their comp-ratio is already 103% VS the future hire coming in at 93% in a higher COL state.  We didn't like it, my manager made their case, but ultimately went along with the VP's decision in order to not rock the boat.
* The team has already deemed the VP as ""Once the VP makes up their mind, they're not going to change it"" so we had to deal with a few choices that didn't make sense to us.  For example, we wanted to move a co-worker to backfill my position because they already had most of the relevant experience anyways but the VP objected, asking ""what value does this person bring to the table?"".  So I spent 6+ months unsuccessfully finding a person who has the relevant experience and provide back-up coverage when needed.  My manager was made a SME for an area of expertise they have zero experience in, but my direct report had all of the experience and could only serve as a consulting role.
* Speaking of the VP questioning the value some team members bring to the table... My manager told me that it took a year for the VP to come around and realize what value I brought to the table by doing the work of 2.5 people on top of being heavily involved in 2 major projects, even though my manager does a good job about praising their direct reports.  This was the last part that made me decide ""Eff this, I'm out"" because it feels like my career here will grind to a halt if or when my manager leaves.",episodefiller,7,1.0,5,1749027844,2025-06-04 09:04:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l30th7/were_there_less_obvious_signs_that_you_needed_to/,6,2025
1l30cvm,Resume Dilemma – Cut It Down or Hold the Line?,"Looking for honest advice from people who've been deep in the job search grind.
I’ve been out of the job hunt game for almost 20 years, so I know my understanding of what employers look for in 2025 is outdated.

I put in nearly 16 years of federal service. Strong record. Multiple national-level awards from top leadership. I even trained the new supervisor who later fired me — claimed “performance” issues, despite me ranking in the top 8 across a dozen states. It was retaliation, plain and simple.

The agency admitted as much. They offered a settlement and agreed to remove the termination from my file. Then the presidential administration changed, executive orders dropped, and just like that — the offer was rescinded. One week we were finalizing terms, the next week it vanished. Now everything’s frozen while the Supreme Court decides if my union can even represent me. That could drag until 2026.

Meanwhile, I’m applying everywhere. But “terminated from federal service” triggers instant rejection. Doesn’t matter that it was political. Doesn’t matter I carried real responsibilities and delivered results. Ironically, companies that hire ex-felons are more willing to give me a shot than corporate jobs.

My resume is 10 pages — it reflects two decades of hard, legit work. A friend says that’s the problem. Told me to strip it down to 1–2 pages and just blend in.

So here’s my ask for those who know the 2025 job market better than I do:
Do I cut my resume and bury my achievements just to fit the mold?
Or do I hold the line, even if it means more rejection?

Not looking for pity. Just real answers.
Is it the format? The termination? The “overqualified” label?

It’s early mornings, 6am start, and means I’m up at 4:40am, along with hubby who takes me as I don’t drive, I also do the odd bank holiday for my current job and it’s not close to home, so I have to take a train home which means it takes me an hour and a half from when I finish till I get home. I do get 3 full days a week off, plus every other weekend, and the rest of my day once I’m finished at work to do as I wish. I have the benefit that it’s a small company there for closer with boss etc, pay is once a month, working out at 12 pays a year at £12.21 an hour. And as I said I love where I work currently.
Hubby has said early mornings don’t bother him, and he’s happy to continue doing them, and I also don’t mind the train home, as it gives me time to wind down before I get home.

The new job would be 9am - 3pm 3 days a week, so no more early starts, (meaning hubby gets a better sleep schedule too) and every other Saturday 9am - 1pm, working an average of 20 hours a week. I’d be paid every 4 weeks, at £13.21 an hour, resulting in 13 pays in a year, meaning one whole pay wouldn’t need to go on bills etc, I could either save the money or treat myself with the spare cash. I would get 3 full days off every single week and a full weekend every other week. I would never work a Sunday or a bank holiday as they aren’t open Sundays or bank holidays and I would be future proofing myself for if I had kids, as these times would mean I can do drop off and pick up, should that be in my future. 
New job would mean me getting the bus to and from work - which I’m apprehensive about as I don’t know the route, and would mean me spending more on travel costs. I would also lose the relationship I have now with my current boss, as working for a bigger company would mean I’m just a number.

To most people - you’re probably all screaming, take the new job, it’s more pay etc.. however.. 

My dilemma is that I’ve spoken to my current boss and he’s said he can find me hours in another store he owns, meaning he can match the hours offered by new job, however, I would still be doing earlies at my current location, along side the new store. I would still be working Sundays every other week and I would still be doing the odd bank holiday. Plus by adding the second store on, I’m likely to be working longer days when there.. so if I was in on a Saturday I’d be doing a full day till 5pm, where as new job would only be a half day, meaning I get more time with hubby when he’s off. The additional location would mean I do a qualification, resulting in my pay going up once completed in 12 months. The benefit of staying with current job would be that I know the new store location, I wouldn’t have travel expense as it’s walking distance and I’d still have a good relationship with boss, I wouldn’t be just a number. 
Also in time he’s said I’d be able to drop the mornings and just be in the new store location, which is closer to home and means no travel costs eventually, but this would be way in the future.. 

Anyone have any advice, or feel from this I’m swaying one way or the other .. please help! I need to make a decision by the end of this week. ",HelloKerry96,3,1.0,2,1749020467,2025-06-04 07:01:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l2z16k/help_help_help/,6,2025

1l2y2hw,Confused Between Two Career Paths – Need Honest Opinions 🙏,"25M from India. I run a small Virtual Assistant business with US clients (night shift, WFH). I know I can grow it if I stick to it.

But now I’ve got a chance to work day shift, from office at a reputable Indian family business in a completely different industry.

🌙 Current VA Biz (Pros):

Good $$

Location freedom

I’m already in it


❌ Cons:

Night shift is killing my routine

No business degree, feel underqualified

Lonely and isolated


🏢 New Job (Pros):

Day shift & social setup

Stability & potential long-term

Reputable family business


❌ Cons:

Starting fresh in a new industry

Might kill my existing VA business momentum


I don’t want to keep switching again and again. Anyone made a similar decision? What helped you finally choose and commit?

Would really appreciate your honest take. 🙏

1l2xs3a,BTech Dropout with 3+ Years Experience as PM – Unsure About Next Steps. Need Advice.,"So I’m at a confusing point in my career and could really use some perspective from folks in this community.

* I’m a BTech dropout from a Tier 2 university in India — completed all 4 years but couldn’t graduate due to a backlog.
* Despite that, I managed to land a job as a **Business Analyst** in a mid-level startup in Bangalore (client-based projects) through personal connections.
* Over time, I got promoted to a **Project Manager** role, currently managing up to **5 projects at once**.
* I now have **3+ years of total experience** in the IT services industry.

The problem:  
The company I’m in feels like a **sinking ship** — unclear direction, toxic work culture, and very little growth. I’m desperately looking to jump to a new job **as soon as possible**, but I’m not confident about what I bring to the table because of:

* My **non-graduate status**
* No hands-on tech/development background
* Lack of clarity on what kind of roles I’d even be eligible for or how to position myself

# My Questions / Doubts:

* **Do I even stand a chance at getting another decent job in IT with this profile?**
* What kind of roles should I target next? BA again? PM? Scrum Master? Product? Or something else?
* Is it worth learning technical skills now, or should I focus on certifications?
* Should I try switching to product-based companies or stick to service-based ones?
* Any tips on how to build the right profile or where to start applying?

I haven’t resigned yet because I’m afraid I won’t be able to find another job quickly, but the current situation is really draining. Any advice would be genuinely appreciated.

**TL;DR:**  
BTech dropout with 3+ years of experience as Business Analyst and Project Manager in a startup. Current company is unstable, and I want to jump ship ASAP but not sure what kind of roles I’m fit for or how to land my next job.

I’m building something I’m really excited about, and I’d love your input to help shape it.

The idea is simple - what if you had a private, voice-only hotline to one person for a whole week?

Someone who could be a mentor, a coach, or just a late-night buddy to share stories, explore ideas, or simply vibe with. No swipes, no DMs, no feeds, just real 1-on-1 conversations, whenever you want, for 7 days.

Maybe you’d call a chef to plan your food truck, a writer to share creative ideas, a marketer to boost your career, or a musician to talk life and art.

We’re aiming for a Fall 2025 preview, and your feedback will help make it amazing.

Would you use this? Who would you want to talk to? What’s the first thing you’d say when they pick up?

I live in an agricultural dense town, so since I was 14 I would be working in the strawberry fields trying to make some money. I would be going to school during the school year… and during summers I would be working. After I graduated… I went straight to a 4-year college. I did the same thing during this time… school during school season and working during summer/winter. I even began working and going to school simultaneously at the end of my school career.

1l2w5gr,Am I wrong for stopping work with a company that hasn’t paid me or given me an offer letter?,"Hey y’all,
I’m a new grad who started interning at this nonprofit from April 14 to May 16. When my internship ended, I felt like I was begging to get paid. When they finally gave me a check, they only paid me half of what I was owed and said I’d get the rest after I worked another week for a big event on May 27. They said it was because of “accounts payable/accounts receivable” (which I didn’t totally get), but I agreed because I needed the money and they were planning to hire me part-time.

They said my start date for part time would be June 1st, but here we are in the third week of no pay agreement, no offer letter, and no clear idea of my pay rate. I’ve asked my boss repeatedly, and it’s been oh we need to have a meeting oh this oh that. Never scheduling a meeting or anything. Am I supposed to beg these people to hire me??? Send me an offer letter????? It’s been stressful because they’re still messaging me to show up to these annual meetings like it’s just expected of me. I told my boss professionally that I’m not working or attending any more meetings until they pay me what I’m owed and give me something in writing. I don’t live close to this place either. I don’t have gas money to keep doing this. 

I’m really stressed because I’m new to corporate and marketing. No one teaches you this stuff in college, and I feel so lost on how to navigate the professional world. I did great work for this company and would love to keep them on my resume and use them for references, so I don’t want to end things badly. But at the same time, I feel like I’m begging to be paid and to be hired.

1l2vknn,I was asked about my last salary after interviews but I didn't have a job.. what does that mean for my interview?,"I interviewed for a large company, one of the best places to work at in the country. After my interview as I was leaving, I got a call. I can safely say that at that point all interviews must've been completed (there were about 16~ interviewees) judging from the time between my interview and the call.

Now in the call a person confirms my name, then the conversation goes like this:

Person: What were you being paid in your last job?
Me: I wasn't employed, this would be my first employment
Person: But you have mentioned here in the applicant form that you worked in x and y before
Me: Those are both internships as I have mentioned there in their job posts
Person: Oh okay okay, right


that is obviously not a word for word account, but that was how it went. Now what would that call mean, and if it is a good sign (which a friend told me), the fact that I clarified those were internships means whoever called thought that those were jobs.. I keep wondering maybe I was shortlisted because they thought those were jobs, and now I am not because now they know they're internships.

It can also be that perhaps someone else from the team called who wasn't there in the interview panel? because I did clearly say I did those two ""internships.""

BUT I know that it's a very competitive field, it's not always guaranteed to make a ton of money, it's not as directly important to society, and it requires a lot of desk work which I don't like very much. 

So, for right now, I'm finding a career in *plumbing*, because it's something I think I can enjoy and do well, it pays SUPER well and is in high demand, it's extremely important to the world, and it is an excellent workout.

With that being said, here's a plan I've come up with going forward to balance my wants and my needs:

I want to take advantage of my body being young and strong and use that to do physical work that will make a difference in the world, so I'll be a plumber for a minimum of 10 years (maybe shoot for 15), and by then I will have made some good money and my body will likely be pretty beat up from all the work, I'll retire from that field and pursue my dream job of animation since I'll probably be more content with sitting at a desk.

I want to know what you guys think of this plan of mine. Is is practical? Is there anything wrong with it? Anything I should change in my approach? 

P.S: I DO want to have at least one kid, which is expensive and that's why I want to make good money and not just financially scrape by",Greenrobot64,1,1.0,1,1749003859,2025-06-04 02:24:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l2ubaw/looking_for_constructive_criticism_for_this_plan/,6,2025

Now, most of the people that developed the core of our product quit at the end of the last and the start of this year so me and a senior dev have been acting as a two man show to keep it running. Now the guy who does all the devops stuff is about to quit and my boss wants me to ""develop"" in that direction and take over. He is the one who told me that i should expect to stick around my current salary for at least another year or 2. Now, ive compared my numbers using multiple portals online and while i wont state anything exact most of them showed my salary to be towards the middle lower end for my current job, considerably below the average.

Now, i like my colleagues and the work has been stressful but fun so far, im absolutely not a fan of anything cli, i like my guis, my windows and clickable interfaces, linux and clis as a whole just never were my cup of tea.

The big question for me now is, should i quit? Look for offers at other companies with a higher salary? My current one is quite large and considering inflation and the whole financial situation im worried that i could lose the safety of that size if i do end up switching.

Im in my twenties have never worked for another company and dont know what i should do.

Any advice? Its much appreciated.

1l2q9ay,Should I follow my gut?,"I started working at a daycare a few months ago. The first day I immediately saw outbursts from my people in my team, throwing papers etc and all the gossip was spilled to me. I asked how they deal with things like this on the work floor and a few days later I found out i kinda struck a nerve. 

A new teammate came up to me and asked me if i was the girl that was stressed out so quickly because i saw an outburst. I told her yes, but it was more so me asking how they deal with those things cause I think safety and emotional control is important around children. We all can experience a outburst like that but how do you guys deal with it? 

My manager put in my vacation days when i tried to call in sick 6x times in a day and they didn’t pick up. When my team and i brought it up in our unitmeeting she told me it’s coming across as if im pinning people against eachother and that a job comes with responsibility. If they don’t pick up it’s my responsibility to keep calling untill they pick up otherwise i’m not sick. 

Now today, for the 4th time since i started working there in february a parent verbally went off on me. The first time it was a mom that was mad because I would let her pick up her child in the middle of crossing the road, 2&3 because a kid keeps playing in water with orthopedic shoes but has difficulty listening to state it softly. To the point that his old group was happy to hand him over to us. & now this dad that was mad because his child forgot his backpack. He took it off after I put it on his back 2x. I was working with 2 fill-ins and had 35 kids. Hé told me he pays me to fix things and doesn’t want to hear anything if i cant do my job. 

My higher ups do nothing, they just tell me keep adjusting and that im one of their best employees and everyone sees that. 

I wanna quit. Am I just too emotional?

If you have been a consultant you know this job sucks (unless you are nuts which then power to you). The stress, the long hours and the stupid amount of traveling.

1l2pkue,Am I about to get fired?,"Coworkers spreading bad gossip and boss covering them up.

So, I've been working for this company for more than a year.

Nice, normal workload stress, and that's it. I had enough time to use other stuff like course and hobbies.

I always had the feeling that something was off with my boss, but never got any concrete, so I thought he was just different. Until last week.

I arrived at the office and found out that someone had been spreading gossip about my work. The type of: i dont do anything. I leave them working alone. I dont collaborate. I complain about my salary. I'm not happy working in that company...

So, needless to say, that isn't true. But since a lot of coworkers who are not related to my department and work (they don't even know what we do) were saying I didn't do any work on a quite important project... well, I got nervous that this could impact my review and possibilities of a promotion.

So, I made the wrong decision of going to my manager and asked him if there was any complaint about my work. He said no. I tried to put it as if I wanted to improve since I've heard some comments about my performance in a certain project. But he got defensive. 

Like really defensive as if I was pointing at him as the faulty one. Then he started putting the blame on everybody, except him and a coworker who is ""perfect, he's so nice that would be incapable"".

I tried to reassure him that I'm not putting blames, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay between the team and me. After he finished with his defensiveness, he brush it off as if it was such a mundane thing with zero worth or importance. 

Which is even weirder.

Now, he's acting weird towards me. And it's quite telling. Even the coworker who my boss was defending so passionately (and who i know now that he spread part of that gossip), is acting weird too. 

I never got an issue with the way i work. Not even in former workplaces. People could say I'm too quiet sometimes but never that I'm a bad employee or a problematic one. Actually, people would say I need to talk more and be ""less productive"".

I want to stay here another year, but... I feel that I just gained two enemies. And my possibilities of growth are nonexistent now. My boss even asked for the first time if I've been fired before and, no matter what I say he has to make it clear that I'm incapable the wrong, even when I'm not. He even tried to give one of my projects to another coworker.

Is there a way to save this? I'm not quite proficient with social dynamics or company politics.

1l2o6sp,Would You Take a Lower Base Salary for a Director Title and Commission?,"Hi all,

I have been offered a position as a Event Director at a country club. I'm incredibly excited about the role, the team, and the potential long-term growth. It's a step up in title and responsibility from my previous position, as an Events Manager, and aligns well with my career goals in hospitality and events.

However, the base salary offered is $52,000, which is lower than what I initially discussed $55,000 to $60,000, during the first interview. When I asked why the salary was lower than discussed previously, they stated they were offering a 3% commission on all banquet sales, paid monthly, with the potential to reach or exceed $60,000 annually depending on my performance. They also mentioned they did salary reviews and increases in the spring of next year, and this salary is on their scale of what they typically offer in this position.

Here’s what I’m weighing on:

* It’s a director-level title, which is a valuable career step
* The environment and team seem like a great fit for me
* I’m passionate about the work and excited about the opportunity to be able to continue in the event realm
* The lower guaranteed income worries me, especially with no clarity yet on what the average commission payout really looks like
* This is a position that is typically long hours/weeks during peak seasons
* I don’t want to undervalue myself just to get the title, but I also don’t want to lose a great opportunity by pushing too hard

Should I try to renegotiate the base salary before signing anything, or take what’s been offered and push for a raise later in the year once I’ve proven myself? Any honest advice or insight would be appreciated. Thank you!

1l2nzvx,"Second interview (coffee chat) after a VP interview at a big bank — haven't heard back in 1 week, and the posting was taken down a few days ago","I recently applied for a position at one of the big banks and, to my surprise, was contacted for an in-person interview pretty quickly. The first interview was at a branch and lasted about an hour with both a recruiter and a VP. The recruiter mentioned I’d hear back in 3 weeks, but when he stepped out, the VP said it would probably be closer to 2 weeks — so I figured I’d just wait it out.

Then, the very next day, I got a call inviting me to meet the same VP again, this time for an informal coffee chat. The recruiter explained that the first interview was “only an hour,” and the VP didn’t get to ask everything she wanted to.

The following week, we met at a local coffee shop, and the tone was much more casual. She asked a lot about my personal background and interests — not much technical or role-specific stuff this time. She mentioned she had two more candidates to meet by the end of that week (the coffee chat was two weeks ago exactly by tomorrow). Before we parted ways, she reminded me that I had her email and said I could reach out if I had any questions.

I sent her a thank you email that same day but haven’t heard back yet. A couple of days ago, I noticed the job posting has been taken down. I’m trying not to overthink, but I’ve only been in banking for about 4 months, and this would be my first move outside of retail banking — so I’m feeling a bit anxious.

Since 2021 I've worked at a grocery store, an entertainment place, and now I work at a museum (greeting people, helping guests, selling tickets, etc.) Getting a job with my degree will be even harder now since I've been out of school for four years and since there are far less computer science related jobs available now.

They tell me that instead of going back for a degree, I should just go take a few more classes at college so I look like I care about my education, and while I'm at college I should talk to the guidance counselors, people there who have job experience, etc. which will help me get a job with my current degree.

I really don't want to be discouraged. I've become super interested in engineering and would love to be an engineer, I really want a plan for my future, I really don't like the current job market related to my degree, and I just want to start over with a new degree.

1l2m0lv,Pondering different career paths but I’m stuck,"Hi all, I have a dilemma regarding what career path to take. For some context, I have been working in customer/tech support for over 8 years and I’m just sick of it. I need something with a more livable wage and more mentally stimulating.

Back track to 2016, I made the worst decision of my life to get a masters degree in cybersecurity. I was very stupid back then and didn’t do any research, just literally applied for the program based on an ad I saw on a bus and didn’t know how much practical experience, labs, certs etc. I would actually need just to even get my foot in the door for an entry level IT help desk job. I was close to giving up on the degree altogether but somehow still finished, but by then, I was so burned out from my then call center job, getting rejected from cybersecurity jobs, and serious mental health issues that I gave up and resigned myself to working in tech support. That decision cost me $60k and has ruined my life. I share this preface not to gain pity but as a warning to anyone considering doing the same thing without doing extensive research on the pros and cons of getting a degree, the trajectory of the industry you plan on getting into, etc.

Anyway, I know my degree is obsolete at this point, so I am planning to pivot to something else entirely. So far, I’ve narrowed down to the following:

1. QA - I already have some manual QA experience and have been learning automation. Pay seems decent, but I don’t see many opportunities as other tech jobs. Would probably be the quickest pivot, though.

2. Full stack development - This would be the longest but most rewarding route. However, the competition is extremely brutal and is very saturated, and even senior devs are not getting interviews. The benefit I have though is that my friend who is a full stack developer has agreed to mentor me for free.

3. Data analytics - I know the least about this one, but seems to be a popular choice among career switchers. Although my only concern is it sounds like I would have to share presentations with stakeholders, executives, etc. which is intimidating.

I start getting enthusiastic about one thing only to get decision paralysis and endlessly ruminate about whether any of these paths are even worth it since AI is picking up at incredible speeds and might replace most junior level roles anyway.

1l2lvel,Career pivot,"I want to learn about people's career pivots.  

I have been in software development, starting as a junior developer in 2018, progressing to a senior role, and then becoming a development manager. My job is now less technical and focuses more on managing people, handling budgets, and meeting with stakeholders. I do want to continue working in this area because it is very rewarding in terms of the impact it has by actually helping people.  

I am seeking a change of pace; I keep thinking about returning to active development. However, I recently had a three-step interview, and the feedback was that I was too experienced for a junior role. Additionally, with AI coming into play, I feel that the traditional developer role is evolving or diminishing.  

I believe that progressing quickly through roles has made it harder for me to become a candidate for traditional development positions.

I’ve always dreamed of being a lawyer or something in forensics, but idk if that’s what I want anymore. It’s disappointing considering I have no idea otherwise. I feel like this job may have ruined the idea of it for me. I do difficult tasks and get scolded if it’s done incorrectly. I make small mistakes and then i’m constantly told “i told you not to do that”, when in reality I was told to do it. I also feel like when I make a small mistake that’s not a big deal at all, it’s made a big deal because I know better and should be avoiding it. When I make a mistake, it’s usually when i’m rushed and then I do something stupid and don’t even realize it until it’s pointed out. It’s just little things and I’m really concerned that these little things are a huge deal in law, because that’s what i’m being told. When speaking with co-workers, these things that are big deals are not from their Pov and if they’ve done it, it’s never been addressed to them as an issue.

And what’s the biggest personal challenge you experience in it?

For example, I’m a psychologist, and one of the hardest things for me is when people expect me to be their “friend” — some struggle to separate a professional relationship from a casual one, like a friendship at a bar. That can be quite tricky.

I’d love to hear your experiences! Feel free to share no matter what area you work in — tech, education, healthcare, arts, etc.

It often requires solving techical issues and I think it's interesting, I loose track of time when I do tasks related to it.

Long story short, I realised last year that I would like to pursue this direction in my career and until last week I thought the company would allow me to progress. On my annual performance review last week, fyi my boss said he gives me an A+ and didn't have anything to improve on except my excel skills lol, I asked my boss if there would be an option to transfer to the IT department to continue my work with the portal and proposed other responsibilities I could take on in the new department (for example working with other customer's and internal portal, I participated in a roll-out project and then hosted training sessions for my department and others- my previous boss didn't understand anything about it).

1l2ikpo,Received negative feedback at work — feeling demotivated and unsure how to bounce back,"I’ve been working as a Data Engineer and recently received some pretty tough feedback from my manager. I’ve been on a task for about a month now, but it’s faced a lot of blockers — many of them outside my control (e.g., waiting on other teams, delayed access, shifting requirements, etc.).

That said, I’ll admit I haven’t been fully engaged with the work. I’ve let the blockers slow me down, and my motivation dipped. I made a couple of silly mistakes that didn’t help either.

My manager said he was concerned — that the mistakes and the pace of progress don’t reflect well on my capabilities, and that he thinks I could do better. It was hard to hear, but also fair to some extent. I know I haven’t been at my best.

I’m feeling pretty deflated and disappointed in myself. I want to bounce back and rebuild trust, but I’m not entirely sure how to approach it — or how to stop spiraling into self-doubt.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you regain confidence and move forward after a setback like this?

1l2iiky,Not sure if I made the right choice,"I’ve been working for around 3 years, and I’m currently in a role that’s not super challenging, but I have an incredibly supportive manager, truly the best I’ve had.

It’s broader in scope and seems to offer more exposure and definitely more learning over time. I consulted my manager and he said it will take at least another year to find me a role that is a better fit for my talent within the company. 

But I’m feeling really conflicted. I know growth is important, but I also don’t want to give up a good work environment and a manager who genuinely supports me and cares about my development. The new role pays more, but the scope sounds like it could still be quite operational at first.

1l2i8e0,My job search experience(and life overall),"
Hi, recent graduate here. I realize that things are hard for programmers right now, and I wanted to share my experience.

Last year, I graduated with honors in bachelors computer science from Jamaica at Northern Caribbean University. I realize that this doesn’t make me terribly competitive in terms of my job prospects and my resume, but I still wanted to do my best to get my foot in the door. 

Enter the company, Revature. I was promised a career in full stack development from this company after participating in their 10 week bootcamp in full-stack development. It has been months after my completion of the pre-training program, and they haven’t sent me offers from any employer. I hate casting blame, but it makes it feel as if the 10 weeks I spent were almost wasted, save for the knowledge I gained.

I’m still unemployed at the moment. I don’t think it’s the joblessness that affects me the most about this situation, but the loneliness. The days spent alone at my computer, working towards a future that I can scarcely see anymore. Needless to say, I’ve become deeply depressed, and I deeply worry about other Revature students who don’t have my support system. Still, I haven’t given up.

While I search for work, I’m working on an app of my own that I hope will give me a little bit of financial freedom if it works out, and taking a data science course at the same time. 

I’m not trying to tell people out there to “never give up on applications and things will be alright.” Rather, I’d say this, and it’s something my mom told me when we last spoke.

Don’t ever let a company feel like they have control over you, because once they do, your life is forfeit. Believe in the possibility that you can do something great without following another’s vision.

1l2gnim,100+ Obscure Job Boards That’ll Save You From LinkedIn Purgatory,"**I just spent my Monday wrangling hundreds of  weird-little job boards into one gloriously over-caffeinated list—so you can stop doom-scrolling LinkedIn and actually get hired.**

**The Obligatory FAQ (because everyone’s suspicious):**

**What’s the catch?**  
There isn’t one. I make exactly **$0.00** from this. In fact, hosting the list costs me money—so technically *I’m paying* for your chance to escape cubicle purgatory. You’re welcome.

**But… why?**  
Because earning internet karma feels better than inhaling another bowl of instant ramen, and I needed a healthier hobby than rage-refreshing my inbox.

**How to Use This Thing**

1. Click the link. [https://www.bammarketingservices.com/post/specialized-job-board](https://www.bammarketingservices.com/post/specialized-job-board)
2. Marvel at the sheer number of hyper-niche job boards (yes, there’s even one for goat-yoga instructors—don’t ask).
3. Apply, get interviews, and stop pretending your “networking break” is anything but procrastination.

Print it out and slap it on your fridge, share it with your chronically unemployed roommate, or tattoo the URL on your forearm—I don’t care. Just promise me you’ll land a gig that doesn’t require chanting “we’re one big family” at 8 a.m. stand-ups.

**Good luck—may your interviews be short, your cover letters single-spaced, and your future boss violently allergic to buzzwords.**

1l2gm3t,"Toxic Boss, No Promotion, and No Way Out—Help!","I’m in a bit of a tough spot. I’ve been at my current job for a few years now, and at first, it was great. The work life balance was perfect, and the pay was a huge improvement compared to my last job. But after about a year, I started noticing some things that bothered me like my manager having a bit of an attitude and being a big gossiper. I didn’t let it bother me much, but by the time I hit my second year, things started getting worse.

My manager has become passive aggressive in emails, and even her own boss told her to be more polite. She’s also really confrontational, which adds even more stress. On top of that, I was supposed to get a promotion based on my experience and performance, but it went to someone with way less experience. Meanwhile, I’ve been there for a long time and have a solid background.

When I went for my review, they told me to wait until mid year since they didn’t have the budget for promotions at that time. Fine, I can wait. But now that we’re almost at mid year, guess what happened? They’ve added a whole new team to my department to “help with my workload,” and honestly, it just feels like they’re setting me up to be replaced.

I voiced my frustration earlier this year about not getting promoted, so I’m starting to think they’re doing this to cover themselves in case I quit or maybe they’re trying to find a reason to let me go. If it weren’t for some bonuses I get, I’d have probably quit by now. But the reality is, I just can’t afford to leave.

On top of that, the stress from work is affecting my personal life. I’m the one supporting my household right now and it’s hard to think about quitting when I’m the one paying the bills. my partner is unemployed but hopefully starting a new job soon. I’ve been trying to look for a new job for a couple of months now, but nothing’s working out. I’m also in a long term lease, so I feel like I’m kind of stuck. 

This job has taken a toll on my health, energy, and relationships. I’m constantly stressed, working long hours, and dealing with a micromanager. It’s even led to me snapping at my partner, and though we’ve talked through it, I feel awful for bringing that negative energy home. I’m also dealing with some health issues from the stress, and I dread every Sunday knowing I have to face another workweek.

So here’s my dilemma: quitting isn’t really an option right now, but I’m so miserable. I don’t know how to keep going, especially since I’m trying to save money for some big life goals (Marriage and starting a family) I just feel stuck. Any advice on how to handle this? How can I deal with the stress and stay sane without quitting?

1l2fugb,Can you help a 40 yr old teacher abroad find a new career?,"**Purpose:** Hi, Reddit Community! This is my first time ever posting on here. I am hoping that this thread will reach others who have taught abroad and successfully transitioned into new careers in the US, career counselors, midlife career changers, people who have transitioned out of the education field, or anyone who ever felt ""lost"" in the career world and was able to find their way. My post might be long and come across a bit like a mini-novel, so please excuse the level of detail - just trying to provide a comprehensive picture to help.

**Background**: I am 40 going on 41 years old. In high school, other than theater and showing excellence in English/Communication/typing really fast, I never really had any career aspirations or dreams. The only thing I knew is that I wanted to leave the small town I grew up in, travel and see the world, and hope to ""find myself"" along the way. I naively thought that just by living life, life would just sort of magically deliver the path I was meant to be on. (ex: meeting someone unexpectedly that would change my trajectory, meeting someone who would be able to see something in me that I didn't see and guide me in a direction, trying out a job and I would meet someone at that job who would then lead me into another job, etc.)

My 20s (early 2000s): Did low-wage insurance office jobs, hated it and had very little money. Got my AA degree. Couldn't choose a major for a BA, so I unfortunately let my scholarship go to waste and thought I needed to just live life and explore careers. Quit my office job to go work on a small cruise line - only lasted 2 weeks. Was working erratic hours on a very small boat in bunk-bed style with zero entertainment, not even wifi available. Worked at a little gourmet market doing light food service. Went back to an insurance office job because it was all I had known and had experience with. Decided to try flight attending. Worked internationally, but my body was a wreck. Sleep schedule was always off - which made depression and anxiety worse. Low pay, so I felt like I couldn't spend money to go and ""see"" the places I was in. Hard to have a stable relationship when you're away for 3-4 weeks at a time. Unhealthy food options. After a year of trying that, I realized I was already mid 20s and needed a degree. Still didn't know what I wanted to pursue, so I just chose Psychology. Worked at a nonprofit part time and liked the mission-driven work, but salaries were dreadful. By this time, I was approaching late 20s. Still lost, a friend told me about how she was teaching abroad in S. Korea. Got me a job. Went for a year adventure, but then I met someone. That person was European and since we were from different countries, I wanted to explore that romance, so I continued teaching abroad. Long story short, I discovered that teaching abroad allowed me to: travel, have decent holiday time, stability of being in one place, and begin to see some small savings for the first time in my life, plus I met someone and wanted to pursue that. And because I never could figure out a career path in the US, it was easier for me to seek teaching contracts abroad in different countries. So, that one year adventure turned into 5 years.

30s: Realizing time was of the essence, I tried coming back to the US to create a career path. Lost. Miracle came through with a contact getting me an Ed Tech job. Tried the job for a year, but I didn't have enough curriculum knowledge to do well, so I had to quit. Lost again. Temped for a short while, then got a low wage part time job in hospitality at a local hotel. Obviously not going anywhere and directionless, so made the decision to go back abroad. Spent 6 more years with my partner abroad - stably employed, making some meager savings again.

40s: Midlife identity crisis. At this point, after 20+ years of living life, still not magically finding a career answer, returned to the US, divorced, lost, mental health suffering, moved back in with parents. Teaching jobs abroad see 40 as ""old"" and discriminate, enrollment is low due to lower birth rates, budgets have tightened due to low enrollment and COVID financial impacts, which have caused a chain of events like way less jobs available, salaries reduced greatly, and schools just looking for young, energetic, and cheap teachers.

Present day: Unemployed the past 11 months. Back in the small town I was trying to escape. Not wanting to teach, but not being able to pivot into something else. Feeling behind in life as my peers have already well developed their careers, made lots of money, have houses and stability. Reached out to career counselors. **Assessments provided this information**:

**Myer's Briggs: ENFP, O\*Net Holland Code: ASC, High 5 Strengths: Empathy, Catalyst, Coach, Storyteller, Thinker, 16 Personalities: ENFP (Campaigner). \*\*Myer's Briggs might have slight variance over time, but generally has been ENFP.**

**Interests:** Travel, Wellness (think wellness retreats), Healthy lifestyle (eating healthy, exercising, pursuing mental health, getting massages), using Capcut to make travel videos as a hobby, DEI (since I am lgbtq), being around creatives though I don't have design talent myself,...Chat GPT just told me to be a travel content creator or a wellness coach, but I am not an entrepreneurial type person...

**Values**: Seeking a job that would offer a good starting salary (at least 50k in Florida) since I feel behind in life already, job security (since coming back, constantly exposed to news of layoffs, AI replacing jobs, entry-level roles paying only 15 an hour and can't even get entry-level roles due to competition), benefits (because of teaching abroad for so long, I was ineligible to contribute to 401k accounts due to no taxable US income and salary wasn't contributing to things like Social Security, Medicare, etc.), work-life balance, and potential to hit at least 75k (in FL) in a shorter amount of time.

**Ideas**: *Radiography, Pros:* 2 year program, specialized training so provides a clear pathway into a job and pretty much guaranteed job after completion, healthcare industry provides job security, potential for a decent starting salary, more if you specialize, job security may allow me to finally move to a different city/state and escape my small town again, hopeful that after a few years on the job it would become straightforward and ""comfortable"" due to structure. *Cons:* math/science/physics not my strong points but trying to keep a growth mindset, getting into programs is hard because they are competitive and limited, not much variance long-term, not sure about ""high pay"" even after becoming experienced, requires licensure in different states to move.

*Marketing/Sales/Communications*: *Pros:* These positions supposedly offer the high pay potential and use my 'people and communication skills'. *Cons: U*nsure of job security from layoffs or AI. Entry-level roles pay so low, like 15 an hour, and no guarantee of landing the right job where you would gain the needed experience or opportunities to grow into a leadership role quickly along with a good salary. Don't even know what industry to pursue. My local area seems to only have: insurance, banking, finance, healthcare industries. Hard to find entry-level roles because so many employers want you to have experience already and other candidates have that. Sales can be hard if you're not good at it, you generally have to start off in inbound sales, and then work your ass off to try and be good at outbound sales. Communications seems questionable due to AI rolling in.

*Human Resources*: *Pros*: Almost every organization needs this department. *Cons*: The same problem with trying to get entry-level roles that aren't poverty wages. Broad field encompassing so many different things. Not sure where to even start with that. Employee relations is like dealing with a lot of drama. Seems like a lot of law involved due to compliance and such. Training and Development seems to be competitive, wants you to have specialized skills in certain programs, and experience.

*Therapist/Counselor*: *Pros:* Have an undergrad in Psych already. Would potentially use my people, communication, empathy skills. *Cons:* Needs at least a Master's and more time in a practicum, supervision, licensure, so education route would be longer. I already have depression, anxiety - could be mentally and emotionally taxing. I still feel like a lost soul, so who am I to be giving counsel to others? Doubts about whether I have what it takes to be a good therapist. Though you can do telehealth and have a private practice, I don't have that confident entrepreneurial spirit. Would helping others with their problems make my own mental health worse?

*Travel Agent*: *Pros:* travel perks, potentially working remotely. *Cons:* low pay, travel agents work more independently I think?

*Flight Attendant: Pros:* travel benefits, no special education needed - just opportunity and passing training, could move to a big city due to base location. *Cons:* low pay and takes around 10 years to have better pay and better schedules, risk of loneliness due to always traveling, risk of emergencies happening, sleep schedule probably not good, etc.

*Teacher in the US: Pros:* job security since teachers are usually in shortage. *Cons:* low pay that doesn't increase much over time, lesson planning is much more detailed here than abroad, stress of dealing with students/parents/classroom management, risk of school shootings or other emergencies, etc.

\----

**Conclusion**: Don't know if this was way too much detail to offer, so I apologize for the long post. But I figured the more detail I gave, the better and more comprehensive of a picture there is to work from. Hoping that someone out there can relate to what it's like for people who have taught abroad a long time and find it overwhelming trying to find their identities back in the USA... or simply anyone out there who has any ideas, feedback, or might be a great career counselor to offer some guidance. Thanks for your time.

1l2fmsj,Applying to same institution multiple times… do I change strategy?,"I am a higher education administrator with close to 5 years of experience in this field. I have what I feel is a wealth of knowledge and a skillset that would be highly desired by employers. I’ve even been told by hiring managers that my resume and cover letters are stellar - showing growth within my roles, displaying prominent projects, and conveying my broad skills. Despite this, I’ve been applying to new jobs for over a year with no luck.

There’s one particular school in my local area that’s viewed as a world-class institution, and many colleagues at my current job move here as the “next step” in their careers. This is the type of institution that once you get a job there, it opens up so many doors and is truly a place where you can comfortably spend the rest of your working life. I’ve known since I was in high school that this is where I want to work.

I’ve applied to 3 separate jobs there, all of which fall within my area of expertise. The first job was “cancelled due to business reasons” so I never got contacted for an interview. The second job, I made it through 2 rounds of interviews before I got rejected. This role was the next step up from my current role, so it hurt a bit to get denied when I felt like I was more than ready. The third job is my exact job that I have currently, and I again got rejected after 2 rounds of interviews.

All of these times I’ve applied through their hiring portal and then communicated only with the hiring team (usually HR or a department coordinator). I always send thank you’s and follow-up’s throughout the waiting periods.

That brings us to now, when the first job that got cancelled just got reposted. I’m going to tweak my resume and cover letter again to match the job description and hopefully capture my desire to work there. But the main question I have is what more can I do?

Should I cold email leadership within the department after I submit the application? Do I get creative and mail them a shoe with my resume/cover letter in it to “get my foot in the door”? That’s a half-joke, but I’m willing to do anything at this point to get hired here.",TotalDimension177,1,1.0,0,1748966333,2025-06-03 15:58:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l2fmsj/applying_to_same_institution_multiple_times_do_i/,6,2025

1l2egbq,Switching Major,"Hey, I know this might seem a bit off-topic, but I really want to get some outside perspective on something personal.

So here’s the deal: I’m currently taking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science on a full scholarship. The thing is, I chose this path mostly for practical reasons—not because I was passionate about it. Unfortunately, I ended up failing because I just couldn’t stay motivated.

I’ve realized I’m a very outgoing, social person. I love connecting with people, I’m passionate about travel, and it’s my dream to explore the world. I’m also very drawn to vibrant, social environments, and I feel like a creative or people-centered career would suit me a lot better.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about shifting to a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, majoring in Marketing Management. It just feels like a better fit for my personality. But my mom thinks it’s an outdated course and wants me to stick with something more “in demand.”

I’m kind of stuck. I’d love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on what course or career path might align better with someone like me—someone who’s extroverted, loves travel, enjoys social dynamics, and thrives in energetic environments.

I'm currently full time employed by a company that contracts with the US federal government... given how the US government is going right now, we're not doing well. We've cut nearly 40% of our workforce, and layoffs keep coming without any sign of stopping. My unit hasn't been hit yet, but my government contracts end in a few months, so the bloodbath is coming. I'm also pretty unhappy with the work I do. I have an opportunity to work for a contract to hire position, but I'm very worried that that contract to hire might put me in an even worse position.

The contract to hire is for a UX Research position (which is what I got my master's in) for a data analytics company in law, and it would be a pay bump.

1l2ckdk,Wwyd? Surprising negative feedbacks from direct manager and 1 team member.,"I have a consulting/advisory background. Recently got a new job as a commercial business partner. 1 direct manager and 1 other team member who had a manager title. Both weren’t from consulting background. 

Things went relatively well. I improved a bunch of internal and external reporting suites (packs, comm, etc) for the team and got overwhelmingly positive feedbacks on how i improved team engagements in meetings about numbers and finances, improved team culture and performance baseline, even some written acknowledgments from the team and senior leadership. 

In this role I had to figure things out myself in many occasions while still doing things that were already supposed to be outsourced (they had a massive outsourcing restructure last year but for some reasons the admin stuff still sits with my role). 
And there are adhoc repetitive tasks that for some reasons still sit with my role and have been taking a lot of my time away from value add work that I should be doing. I had to request several times to have a team that should already be doing these tasks to free up my capacity and only after 3 months into my role i got it approved. 

There was one time i dropped the ball on an assignment bc other team made an error on data inputs so that extended my eta, which i had explained the impact. 

Today i had a first 3 month catch up with my direct manager. I asked for feedbacks. To my surprise the feedback was mostly negative as he said i spent a lot of time on making decks look nice and so forms over substance. And really focused on that one time i f/\cked up instead of the 10 times i had good responses for systems and process improvements. I was also told i sent a few emails at late night (i work flexibly so sometimes i do late night work) i might have had prioritisation issues bc why couldn’t i finish work during the day and he linked it back to his theory that i spent so much time on slides that i didn’t spend enough time on work so had to catch up at night. 

If you come from consulting and advisory background you’ll know about these slide toolkits that you can just pull out visual templates and fill in the blanks. They thought i spent hours on make slides look nice while in reality i’m just really proficient at it. 

My direct manager also asked the other guy for feedback to give me and he brought up things that surprised me even more bc had i known that was an issue for him to begin with i would’ve stopped doing. I have weekly catch up with the guy and he didn’t say anything, but then went around to tell my direct manager instead. 

I left my last job bc of toxic team environment and the sales team i’m looking after now is pretty good but my immediate team is giving me ptsd again lol. What do i need to do? I feel a bit defeated. 

I have another catch up with my manager in 2 weeks so i’m planning to address these points calmly and reasonably. This incident however really broke the rose coloured glass i have for this job though although i should’ve known better and not tried to do better things.

1l2brk8,Manager wants me to assign daily work during his vacation.,"Hey everyone, first post so sorry if it's not standard within this sub.

My manager is going on vacation soon and wants me to cover for assigning daily tasks in his absence. Tasks include maintenance and equipment registration tickets and material requests that need to be handled by our team and thus need to be assigned on a daily basis as they come in. I absolutely do not want this responsibility for many reasons.

- My tasks and responsibilities center around our digital system and its enhancements. I'm a CS major and I work on fixing bugs and new features in the system with our in-house devs. I have absolutely nothing to do with daily tickets or procurement or maintenance etc... and definitely don't serve any leadership role. I was hired to improve the system to handle new needs and introduce automations when possible, but I absolutely am not involved in the daily operations and task assignments.
- I'm the least senior person in the team (some employees transferred from other departments so they have less years in our team but more overall in the company). I don't want any confrontations or conflicts with them about me assigning work unfairly.
- I am an outsourced contractor, and while I'm on my 2nd year and have the same working conditions as the full-time hires, there is no benefit or room to grow or move up the ladder for outsourced hires. And the conversion process to full time has been stopped completely for the entire company for more thab a year. So it's not like this will count for me getting a promotion or a bonus or something like that.

My manager made it clear that he doesn't trust any of the other team members to do this task, especially since they will be working on the tasks being assigned so it will be a conflict of interest. And so he wants me to do it since I can assign from an outsider perspective.

Do I flat out refuse or just deal with it for the vacation period and try not to allow anyone to outstep their boundaries?

I am F22 and graduated from college with a film production degree last year. It's been a struggle trying to break into the industry, having been a newborn photographer for only 5 months because of how the job was structured. That was the only job I landed after college. So, with that, I decided to get a job in retail again (my first job was fast food where i worked there for 6 years and was made an assistant manager), but after falling in love with the work, the people, and the fact that corporate in located in Wisconsin (where I want to end up in), i knew I didn't want to leave.

My goal is to move up the corporate ladder and eventually land a position in marketing where I am able to use my degree. I already use my degree to make stop-motion films in my free time, so it's not like I'm wasting my degree.

My question is this: Would it be better to wait at least a year after my employment with this company to ask about further advancement outside of my current store or ask HR about it without waiting.

1l2biy1,Company is splitting up!,"Hi All,

My current company is going to split into multiple companies over the next two years. I have been with my company and in my role for about seven years now, and my management has asked me to join the smallest company that is being set up. The new role would be a mix of people management and technical individual contributor, along with a pay rise. I am in a dilemma.

**The pros I see:**

* **Pay Hike:** An increase in salary.
* **People Management Experience:** Gaining valuable experience in managing a team.
* **Unique Role:** I will be the only one doing what I do in the new company.
* **Profitability:** The new company is projected to be the most profitable among the ones being created.
* **Learning Opportunities:** A lot of new things to learn.

**The cons I see:**

* **Size of the Company:** It is a very small company (6000+ employees) compared to the original company (150,000+ employees). Bigger companies can handle global phenomena (wars, COVID, etc.) more easily and are less likely to go under.
* **Self-Doubt:** I am not the best in my team, and I wonder why management has chosen me over others who are technically better. Although I have a very good relationship with my management, this thought is continuously on my mind.
* **Comfort Zone:** I have established my place where I am currently.

1l2b1zf,Help: Job vs masters in chemE,"Hello everyone, a chemical engineering grad here. My last sem exam just got over a week ago. I have currently applied to a company that specializes in water and effluent treatment(with a 3 year bond) with an interview scheduled this friday. Originally, my plan was to go straight for masters but after seeing the job postings for masters students, all of them ask for atleast 1 year of relevant industry experience. My college recently shared an apprenticeship program in biogas R&D(unpaid) with a duration of around a year. It's essentially a startup(around months old now). I get an LOR from them and an apprenticeship certificate. My biggest confusion is: should I do a job for 3 years and then go for masters OR should I go with this unpaid apprenticeship for a year. I was personally thinking going with the job but I'd love to hear someone more experienced than me to comment on this.",Technical-Fudge4199,1,1.0,0,1748955010,2025-06-03 12:50:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l2b1zf/help_job_vs_masters_in_cheme/,6,2025
1l2avsi,stop wasting time on promoted job listings — here’s what actually works in 2025,"tldr: stop applying to promoted jobs on job portals. use filters to catch the good ones early. use ai to help you find and apply to high-match roles with confidence (and without lying).

hoi!!

for the past year i’ve been trying to understand why job searching feels so broken, noisy, and outdated. it’s 2025 and we’re still using the same click-scroll-pray methods from 2010. meanwhile, recruiters use AI to scan 100s of applications and instantly rank who’s worth calling and who is not qualified for the job

so for the longest time, I thought… why not flip that around and use tech to help us too qualify jobs?

after a bunch of research + trial and error, here’s what i found that works in the job search (and what got me my current role in tech):

* on all the big job portals, the top jobs are usually promoted ads – not because you're a great match, but because the company paid to put them there
* these promoted jobs often already have 200+ applicants, stay open even when filled, and have weird titles that don’t really tell you what the job is
* better-fit jobs (non-promoted) disappear after they hit \~50 applicants or get buried fast
* most people never see them unless they apply within the first 1–2 days

so here’s what i started doing:

* go to your fav job portal
* filter: posted in last 24 hours
* enter specific job titles or keywords (not just “marketing” or “tech”)
* if possible, filter out promoted/sponsored posts
* focus on jobs <48hrs old that match your background - these are usually high-signal, low-competition listings
* Apply with hyper-personalised applications that stand out - the goal is to stand out
* spend more time applying to roles where youre confident about your match, not random roles

this cut 80% of the bs in my job search. i finally started seeing roles that actually made sense for me and was even excited about.

eventually i got tired of reading 20 job descriptions a day, so i built a tool that:

* scans all new, non-promoted listings daily from top job portals
* scans your CV and suggests job names that match your skills and experience to broaden your search
* matches the job results to my cv + skills + experience without me having to read them all
* gives me a match score (like 83%) so i can focus on the best matches and tailor my applications
* Tells me all relevant keywords I might have forgotten to add to my CV and I add the ones that are relevant for me (no lies)

that’s how i got my last role as an operations specialist, even though my background is business consulting + marketing. my tool flagged it as an 83% fit, and i got the interview and offer fast.  
  
To some extent, I guess, my AI outsmarted their filtering AI and got me trhough the filtering process by just stating exactly what needed to be said on my CV (without lying) to make sure an AI would NOT disqualify my applications and I would reach a human i could impress

if you’re tired of job searching chaos, try this approach. use filters. avoid ads. match smart. if you're curious about the tool or wanna chat about this, feel free to dm or check my profile.

you got this!",LuckiestToast,0,0.5,0,1748954516,2025-06-03 12:41:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l2avsi/stop_wasting_time_on_promoted_job_listings_heres/,6,2025
1l2aoke,Is it wrong to be too efficient at my internship?,"Hi, I’m (18F) currently doing a remote paid internship with a group of classmates/friends. We’re paid $1 per hour and have official working hours from 8AM to 5PM. Most of our tasks are very light, usually encoding that can be finished in 1–2 hours.

I like starting early (right at 8AM), finishing what’s assigned by 10 or 11AM, and then staying online and available for anything else, but not forcing myself to “look busy” for the full 8 hours.

The issue is: the rest of my group usually doesn’t start until 1PM or later. Recently, they told me they’re frustrated because I finish everything too quickly and leave them with nothing to do or report. We had a conversation, but instead of finding a solution, they made me feel like I’m the problem for being ""too fast.""

Now I’m feeling stuck. I didn’t mean to take over everything,I thought I was just managing my time well. But I also don’t want to damage friendships or create drama. At the same time, it feels wrong to slow myself down or pretend to be busy for a $1 per hour internship just to “look fair.”

Should I change how I work to avoid conflict, or stick with what I’m doing? What’s the professional way to handle this kind of situation?

1l2andd,"Haven't seen a job that caught my interest like this one, however there are downsides. Any advice?","***TLDR:***  
I’m 16 in Australia, soon choosing VCE subjects, and searching for a career. I’m really drawn to the Air Force loadmaster job because of the travel, awesome views, and feeling like I’m making a real impact by helping people. But the military’s strict routines, risk of deployment, and mental/physical demands worry me. I’ve also looked into diplomacy and embassy work, but they don’t excite me like loadmaster does. What I want most is a job with lots of travel, responsibility, a unique or “wow” factor, and decent pay - though I’d prioritize enjoying the work over salary. So far, nothing fits like loadmaster, but I want something less physically and mentally tough and less strict.

Hi all, I'm struggling a lot to try and find a job with what I'm looking for. I'm 16 and living in Australia at the moment which means I'm picking VCEs soon, so now's sort of around the time I need to keep an eye out. To start, I am heavily interested in a job similar to a loadmaster in the air force. I love idea of that sense of awe you get when you look out the open door, or dropping of supplies you know will help people. The only caveat to this job is that it is the military - meaning strict routines, potential for deployment, and possible mental and physical strain. Which is why I'm wondering if maybe for a job I'm looking for may not be similar at all to this, and I need to choose a different career altogether. That being said, if all of those downsides are worth it for the end result of the job, I'd be interest which is why I need perspective.

I also looked at the possibility of being a diplomat - maybe a bit too hard to get into for me, who knows. Even just working at an embassy in general; politics, economics, etc. but none of it caught my attention like a loadmaster.

I've tried to get my key wants in a job I want down. Probably travel is a big one for me. I'm sick of staying in one place all the time and if I get a regular job, I will almost have no time to live my life to the fullest, short of a week holiday every one to two years. I really want to experience my life to the fullest, and if I can experience maybe some other cultures and countries while I'm working, that would be amazing. Another is responsibility. I want responsibility to make what I'm doing feel important and impactful to motivate me. Probably another is a wow factor - I don't want to do a general job, I want to do a job that people wouldn't normally think about if possible, however not a deal breaker. And finally, preferably a decent pay, but if I'm enjoying what I'm doing enough I wouldn't mind a lower salary.

Nothing I've read so far scratches the itch that loadmaster gave me, but I'm not a fan of the physical, mental and strict side of things. If anyone has any experience at all whether it be in the military, in political work or just any work in general, please leave a reply - any advice/suggestions is really appreciated!

1l2am95,Team leader keep rolling her eyes at me when I speak.,"Hi everyone,

I joined my current company a few months ago as a junior software tester. While I’ve been trying to learn and contribute as best I can, I’ve been struggling with how my team lead communicates with me.

During meetings, if I make a mistake or speak up, she often rolls her eyes or responds in a way that feels dismissive or condescending — but what’s really bothering me is that this behavior seems directed only at me. She doesn’t react the same way with other team members, which makes me feel singled out and unsure of what I’m doing wrong.

I genuinely want to improve and be a valuable part of the team, but this dynamic is really affecting my confidence. Has anyone been through something similar? How did you handle it without making things worse?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

1l29jo9,"Family death on Sunday, back to work today. Unsure if I was eligible for time off","So I lost my grandma on Sunday morning. I had taken 2 (sick days) off Thursday/Friday to spend with her (I don’t work weekends). I emailed my boss on Sunday to say I wasn’t coming in yesterday due to her death but that I’ll be back today.

I was really close to my grandma, I helped partly take care of her for 4 and a half years of her illness where she was confined to her bed. I’m not posting this for sympathy just to make people clear of the situation that I wasn’t just a grandchild who barely visited and is using her death as an excuse. I now have to help care for my elderly grandpa who has early onset dementia and isn’t coping well (understandably). My grandparents only have me and my mum who is also not coping well with things.

My friends were shocked when they messaged me to ask if I was home to deliver a bouquet of flowers and I told them I was back at work. They said my boss should have given me 3-5 days minimum (I live in the UK for the record). My boss came in this morning and said ‘sorry for your loss’ then asked me when the funeral was to which I replied ‘I’m not sure yet as I had an appointment with the funeral director today which I had to cancel due to work’ and he shut the door on me and left.

He hasn’t spoken to me since, nobody in my office has said a word to me. I’m starting to think I shouldn’t be back to work so soon as I’m stressing about helping my mum plan the funeral as my grandpa does not have 100% full capacity. I don’t know how to raise the issue with my boss as he is awful at avoiding confrontation and actually talking/discussing things. Always says he’s busy with other things.

My only other option I’m contemplating is getting a sick line for a week or two to deal with family matters until things settle down as my grandpa is getting extremely forgetful and we’re hoping it’s just down to grief and not an advance of his illness. 

TL:DR has anyone got any advice on bereavement entitlement in the UK, would I be eligible for a sick line due to family stress to help take care of an elderly grandparent and help arrange a funeral for another. I feel like my work would be mad if I took a sick line and I would get punished.

Because I think that she should do a BCA from normal college also cause we don't want to take education loan because there is no guarantee of job afterall she gonna do it from tier 3 college and education loan just put pressure on her as well as in the family. (we are from lower middle class family) But here is what i am thinking, she should study BCA from normal college just for the degree and also it is somewhere related to computer field and simultaneously she should do a Bsc Data Science course from IIT Madras it will built her resume more stronger.
What is your thoughts and suggestions, what you guys think about tech jobs is it still gonna preference based out of degree  in future or things will change or Am I thinking right or she should do btech not matter whatever college it is.

1l28ers,"Working student with no support, barely any input and no involvement","Hey everyone,

I’ve been working as a part-time student employee at a big car manufacturer in Germany for over a year now, and I’m feeling completely left alone. Officially, my team lead is supposed to be my supervisor, but we don’t really have proper talks anymore, and he hardly gives any feedback or support.

I’m the only one on the team with a media background; everyone else are data scientists and engineers. My main tasks involve creating articles and content for our Intranet site. Before, I was clearly more involved in the project and was basically responsible for the entire comms/media aspect of it. Now the nature of the project changed a bit and I am basically excluded out of almost all meetings. For now I’m supposed to work on a video project which involves creating short videos about data related topics. I get almost no input from my colleague who was supposed to provide the technical content. Now he's on vacation so I won't be making a lot of progress in the next weeks. The project basically came from me, I was not given any clear expectations or a software to this, so had to decide everything myself. My manager gives no clear direction and barely checks in. I am also not given any other tasks since my ability to contribute to highly technical topics is rather limited since I have a very different background than my colleagues.

Communication in the team is poor, my topic has lost priority, and I’m really starting to lose motivation. Next week i'm planning to talk to my boss about the situation and maybe suggest some content ideas that involve less input from others. Since I’m leaving in two months, my time is limited and I still want to accomplish something worthwhile. 

Sorry, really needed to rant about this. What would you do in my situation since I still care about getting a good reference letter in the end.

1l28dg2,Help! Did I make the right choice?,"\*\*\*Which path should I take?\*\*\*

For context, I just recently resigned from my job of \*\* years so I can explore better opportunities, and perhaps discover any ""greener pasture"". At least three months before I quit my job, I made sure to send applications to different companies here and abroad. I was able to make roughly around 30-40 applications, and only a few responded.

The first one was an agency in Ph for job positions in the Middle East, and it contacted me around April. Then, invited me for an F2F interview 2-3 weeks after. Fortunately, I passed the interview and was given the JO. However, along the process, I felt something was off with this agency (can't provide more details here for anonymity), plus I also had some troubles in preparing my pertinent documents. So, I decided not to push through with it.

The next one, another Ph agency that offered a job position bound to my 'dream' country. Everything was going well - I passed the interview and was invited for a training. So, I thought ""This is it!"". The problem is, I was expecting that the JO is set for deployment in the next 3 or 4 months. However, upon asking them via email (because they did not disclose this during the F2F interview), they then informed me that deployment might happen in 2026!?

Now I am left utterly confused whether I made the right decision or not. I am even afraid to tell my family and friends about this as they had already expected that I accepted a JO abroad (from the first Ph agency) and will be leaving the Ph in July/August. My BF was also dismayed about this news and said that I should've pushed through with the previous agency despite the negative things I encountered. What should I do? Please give me some friendly advice, or if you think I need an open rebuke, I'd be willing to accept it, so I can wake up from this nightmare.

Currently, I am thinking of applying to some ESL companies while waiting for the deployment of JO number 2. Can you suggest any ESL company with better pay?

By the way, my previous employer just recently DMed me, and asked if I could stay for one more year in their company. What do you think about this? Is this Divine intervention huhu (teary-eyed)? I have a few apprehensions regarding this, as it may not sound professional to return after just officially resigning and then leaving after a few months to pursue what I initially planned to do.

I'm seeking some guidance for my younger brother regarding his career path. He's currently at a crossroads and has a few options on the table. Here's a quick rundown of his academic status:

IMUCET Rank: 115 (CET route)

JEE Mains: 93 percentile

NEET 2025: Awaiting results

He’s open to various career paths, including the merchant navy (through IMU), engineering (via JEE Mains), or medicine (if NEET results are good enough). We’re trying to help him make an informed decision based on long-term growth, job stability, personal interest, and work-life balance.

If anyone here has experience in these fields or has gone through a similar decision-making process, we’d really appreciate your insights.

Questions:

What are the pros and cons of going through the merchant navy route via IMU?

Is it worth considering engineering with a 93 percentile in JEE Mains? What kind of colleges or branches can he expect?

Assuming he scores decently in NEET, how does medicine compare in the long run in terms of career satisfaction and financial viability?

How do we factor in personal interest vs practical career prospects?

1l26ten,"17, what career should I pursue?","Just graduated from high school. I have a lot of paths here. 

I applied for CS which ideally would be my preferred job, 9-5 which is perfectly sounding for me. 
But gave up with how hard is it to obtain a job in that field.

Then I went for nursing. But the hours can be long and extremely exhausting career. (Wouldn’t be able to take care of my puppy) Good pay though, I like the environment but I’m not sure its something I want to spend a long time doing.

I’m more of an office job person. (Love to work from home too) 
What is available for me in the next 2-4 years for my situation? 

Plan is to go to community college and transfer. But I haven’t been able to commit to a decision. 
I feel like there’s something out there that has not been placed in front of me. 

I want to live off a pay of min 80k a year, while maybe not during first few but making a living with that. Considering it will be my only source of income and I’ll have to purchase a home, not knowing yet if I would have any help. 

(I thought of a legal assistant which is a field I’m interested in, but the pay doesn’t match my expectations.) 

Any thoughts is appreciated! 
I am really lost, and been thinking about this for months before making this post. 

Everyone told me it is up to me but I don’t really know what’s out there that fits me.

1l26j80,Quitting a well paid Job because of a 'non-technical' manager- Rant,"Hi SAP People, 
I am a BASIS guy with 5 yoe. So I have a manager who isn't a basis guy, he is actually an ABAPer with over 10 yoe. He is the so called lead of SAP who doesn't know jack about basis. It's been 8 months working under him and let me tell you, he isn't as good of a leader as he portrays. Tries to belittle me every time there is a discussion of any basis related thing, telling me that I don't know better and he knows it all because he is more experienced and I still have got to learn a lot as I am still in the early years of my career. When I give a solution to an issue and issue gets resolved, he starts twisting his words trying to portray that he has solved the issue and not me and tries to take the credit (he is very good at cutting people off mid-way and twisting words and jumping to different discussions when not even required!) 

I am just so done with this guy. I have realised if I stay here and work with him, I am not going to learn even a single freaking thing. And there isn't any basis work here too! Basis work comes here every once in a while. Usually it is the system stop-start activity for OS patching or the quality refresh every quarter. Other than this, nothing at all. Most of the times I am busy doing his dirty work of closing tickets, opening tickets, sending mails which are of no use to me! He at times makes me work on modules like MM, FICO, SD! I am just so done. Actually the organization itself is shit, they think if someone is an SAP consultant, then they know the entire SAP, which is absolutely dumb! 

I am thinking about quitting without having any offer in hand as I am just so done with this guy and staying here in this shit company isn't adding anything to my skills. Literally nothing, zero! 

I am confident enough in myself and in my skills that I can crack interviews and can last a year without any employment if it takes time.

1l25iax,Need Carer Advice on a Possible Career Transition from Tech Entrepreneur to Researcher (?),"Hi everyone, thanks in advance for reading this long post. 

 I graduated from a top research university in 2013, with a double major in computer science and math. 

Prior to joining college (after high school), I made a smallish tech company, which did okay (peaked at 10 full-time software engineers), though didn't do as well as I hoped for, because I didn't have the expertise to make it work.

Over the past 12 years, I've built a number of tech companies, as a technical founder. I'm about 18 months to 24 months from selling my current company.

I'm considering what I should do next, and I feel that research might make the most sense. I'm particularly interested in research at the forefront of technology. It's hard to be sure though that I should stop making companies, as I know I'm somewhat skilled at that.

My goals are to make the largest meaningful impact I can make in one of several different key human issues:  

*  HealthSpan (how long humans can live healthy lives) 
* Artificial General Intelligence in the direction of responsible human-benefiting AGI
*  Use of AGI to facilitate impact on one of humanity's core issues.

I'm not really sure how to best go about making this transition. I'm considering:

1. Going back to school for a PhD in Computer Science and then doing research at a research university in socially impactful AGI.
2. Working at an impactful company in the healthspan space (there are a handful of them, though many of them have flopped - it's a difficult space to get meaningful results in).
3. Doing a PhD in healthspan related fields, and doing research in healthspan at a research university.

  
I'm also open to staying a tech entrepreneur, but moving my focus to one of the above research focused topics. I personally believe that most of my tech entrepreneur peers are not truly driven by the desire to make an impact in one of these fields, but desire to have large financial outcomes, which makes me a little hesitant. 

  
I would appreciate any feedback. ",Far-Incident822,1,1.0,0,1748934642,2025-06-03 07:10:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l25iax/need_carer_advice_on_a_possible_career_transition/,6,2025

1l24akt,"Need advice on what to do next, please.","Hello everyone, I am reaching out for some serious, unfiltered advice; ideally from anyone who has been through something similar. I am at the verge of burnout and possibly losing everything that I have worked hard for.

A quick background on me: I did my undergrad in international business studies with a couple of internships in research and analytics. I was offered a graduate role as a visual analyst at leading global consulting firm, straight out of college. Since the role focused more on the design aspects of the consulting decks, I moved to UK in 2023 for a masters in marketing in a Russel group university. I graduated with distinction, had one of the best research skills amongst my peers. I had taken a huge loan for my masters whose repayments began last March. 

I completed three internships during my studies: one with the university, one consulting project, and one with a startup (which turned out to be a glorified cold-calling job).    
  
The downward spiral began when I worked in retail for about a year during my masters and later joined a fast paced fast food chain because I couldn't land a graduate job after multiple applications. The Shifts vary wildly (6am openings to 1am closings), and I couldn't focus on job hunting also while having to pay bills and my loan repayment. No holidays, minimal pay, and no savings after rent and basic expenses. I’m on a written warning after taking 3 sick days in 3 months each for job interviews. My mental health has been deteriorating. My arms and wrists constantly hurt from physical labor. The worst part is, it is visibly apparent they make me work the hardest being the only person of colour. I am made to do all the jobs that everyone else hates doing. My friends are frustrated with my complaints. I’m barely surviving.

I’ve made 1500 applications (some applications really tailored and some were a part of mass applications) initially for marketing roles, then pivoted to analytical roles, pivoting my analytical experience from the past. In the last couple of months, I made it to the final stage in three public sector interviews, and each time, was rejected for minor or inconsistent reasons. One role was with a regional council as BI analyst role. I was in the top 3, but got no offer. Received positive feedback. Another was with a city council for a Intelligence Analyst role. I built them a complete Power BI dashboard with accurate KPIs, slicers, and embeddable it into a simulated website got glowing feedback but was told someone else scored one point higher. I was recommended for another role within the same council.   
  
For the follow-up role, I again built a high-quality dashboard and report. The interview panel seemed cold and rejected me over vague concerns, though they loved the dashboard and the report I built them. I have strong technical proficiency in PowerBI, SQL and other visualization tools. I am good at data story telling. I am well versed in consulting frameworks, stakeholder focused presentations and reports. and i am no stranger to technology, I can learn things pretty quickly.

I have a couple of questions  
1) How do I realistically break this loop? Where is my approach possibly going wrong?  
2) Should I quit the fast food job? It’s barely keeping me financially afloat, and it's killing my energy  
3) If anyone has experienced similar situation, how did you pivot things? 

It kills me every day that I am sweeping the floor and cleaning the toilets while I could have done some thing that I studied for, paid a huge amount for. And that said, a huge salute to all the employees of such fast food and retail environment, I can't imagine how much effort goes behind these jobs and doing this continuously over the years and the mental toll it must have on you.

1l2280t,Not enough hours to complete my list of jobs making me feel incompetent.,"Hi, I'm (16m) currently working at a local business msp, with a roster of Mon-Wed, 8-12pm, and Thursday and Friday 8-4pm. Some days I feel like I love my job, and other days I wish I could just leave.

My main issue recently, is that I have been assigned a lot more tickets/tasks to do of recent, tasks that are time consuming and normally take over an hour, and am finding that I do not have enough time in my day to complete them. 

These tasks involve computer setups, NAS setups, general diagnostics of hardware/software, and break/fix for clients.

My other daily roll is being a backup administrator, so checking over our clients backups, making sure they're working, and fixing any of the ones that breaks, whilst also being a primary phone answerer person.

  
Today, I left the office at 1:20pm, which is an hour and twenty minutes over, which my boss was not happy about, as I had also left late a few days last week helping a client.

He said he will have a talk with the senior manager and discuss my work load and see what needs to change. I'm not sure if this means I am in trouble, or what it exactly means. But the way he kindv'e said it, is that I seemed incompetent/slow and not completing tasks I should be able to complete in my rostered hours.

This makes me feel question how hard I am working, and how efficient I am. When I am at work, I do not use my phone unless for work, and stay on task the entire time, yet still fall short.

I've recently also been experiencing increased levels of anxiety, after having made some mistakes, alongside my bosses disapproval of late finishes, and I am now worried for the future of my position.

I know the English and grammar isn't very good, but if you can look past it, and give me whatever advice you have to offer, id be more then grateful.

1l216ot,3 weeks into job and already looking at switching teams - how screwed am I?,"Hey everyone! This is gonna be a long one, but I put a **TL;DR** at the end.

For a bit of background, I've been working as a fully remote enterprise cloud platform / infrastructure support specialist for about 2-3 years now.

Things already started to go downhill when my old company got acquired by another company which was like a few years ago - the downhill part was that the new company really hates remote work and well, the general company culture was crap. But things **REALLY** went south when I got let go due to not complying with the RTO mandate around 2 months ago. There's just no way that I was going to relocate 2000+ miles away to the other side of the country to a very HCOL area just to wade through terrible traffic every day just to sit in an office and do the exact same work that I was doing at home all because a CEO thinks that remote work isn't ""real"" work, and then eventually get laid off a year later due to more ""company restructuring"". I figured I could find something closer to home, so I decided to dip. Severance pay was given to those of us that didn't comply with RTO, but they didn't even have an option for relocation assistance - they just wanted us gone.

Because of this, I begrudgingly applied for a help desk position at a company that I used to intern for, and managed to secure the job early last month. The job technically requires me to be on-site 4 days a week, but they mentioned that they would give me 90 days to relocate (office is 3 hrs away) closer to the office. In the meantime, they're allowing me to work remotely up until that 90 day cutoff.

I was actually planning on relocating; was set on picking out the apartment and everything, but right after signing the offer letter, one of my parents got diagnosed with cancer which pretty much turned me off from relocating up there entirely. It was at this point where I decided to start looking for IT jobs that are local to my city as well as those that are remote and mirror my previous role. I managed to get a few interviews, but they didn't pan out, and there's one that's pending, but I'm not really expecting an offer to come from it. It's much more likely that I will get a rejection email.

I let my managers know about the situation with my sick parent / no longer moving forward with relocating, and they mentioned putting in a request to keep me as a remote employee, but they're 99% certain that the request would be denied by the higher-ups because the position itself demands an in-office presence to support IT equipment (Laptops, peripherals, etc) from incoming employees from our parent company. They mentioned giving me more time to consider relocation, but at this point, I don't think I'm up for it anymore. Also, If I'm being completely honest and thinking long-term, I don't think I really want to go back to doing traditional help desk stuff - I actually think it would be better to keep pushing for cloud / support engineer positions to eventually jump into DevOps or Data engineering. I actually hated my previous role, but at the same time, I learned a ton and it was remote / paid decently. Ultimately, I want to pivot to something like data engineering / data science, but I would have to upskill from scratch and I don't have that much time to do that now due to this other immediate problem.

I looked at my options internally within the company, and saw that there were a few platform support specialist positions open that were fully remote and pretty similar to what I was doing in my previous company. I filled out 3 of those applications as an internal candidate, and I immediately got rejected for one of the positions, but I got an interview with one of the two remaining positions coming up this Wednesday.

My main concern is addressing the **""Hey, you just joined your team 3 weeks ago. Why are you trying to join** ***our*** **team / Why are you leaving your current team?""** questions that will inevitably come up in the interview. I let my manager know that I would be looking and applying internally for remote / local positions, but I can't tell that other team that I'm trying to slide in because the position is remote and my parent is sick and I don't wanna relocate. I'm going to try to focus on the **""My skills align with this role since I did this kind of stuff before""** theme, but I'm not sure they're going to buy that at all, and they may view me as a red flag since I'm switching departments so soon. And another thing is that while I met some of the requirements, I don't think I would be their ideal candidate cause I'm missing some knowledge on IAM stuff like LDAP and Kerberos. Ugh. In the meantime, I'm applying to other local / remote roles in other companies in hopes of getting something.

**TL;DR:**

***Got let go from my job due to RTO bullshit that required me to relocate 2000+ miles away with no relocation assistance. Found another job that requires relocation / commute to office thats 3 hours away within 3 months but parent got sick with cancer and now I'm no longer looking at relocating. Pivoted to focusing on landing remote / local jobs as an internal candidate and got an interview coming up for one but unsure how to deal with being seen as a red flag candidate because I'm switching teams so soon.***

Anyone else deal with situations like this? Any tips?

1l1vy3r,Is the grass greener?,"Im in the Semiconductor industry doing digital design verification. (Common employers would be AMD, Intel, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Microchip, etc).

I landed a solid tech job in Canada after graduating. Pays 80k Salary, standard 3 weeks vacation. Since joining, the company has gone from peak earnings and down through a 2 year down cycle. No bonuses, no raises, no promotions, hiring freeze, short staffed, no budget for team building, etc. Layoffs, voluntary paycuts (mandatory in the US offices), etc. 

My work is great, the people are great, but the salary is not competitive. Bonuses, promotions, etc, is not competitive. I could go else where and make 10-40k more easily at my level, but its comfortable here. 

Today I was expecting a promotion as its very standard at my company to get first promotion after 2 years (its very transparent and structured, not merit based for juniors). My boss said due to down cycle dynamic he doesn't have the means within the budget that is allocated to our office to give me it. So another year, no promotion, no raise. 3 years no promotion, a temporary pay cut (difference was given in stock), no bonuses. Even with a promotion I expect a meager salary bump like 5k, then it would be another 2 years till the next promotion.


Should I leave? It would require selling the house, risking my job security, and all the logistics involved in moving, as I live in a small city. Finding a Semiconductor industry job is common in expensive cities like Vanocuver, or in California which is a challenge financially. Even debating moving to Germany or Netherlands for better quality of life. 

Thoughts?

I have another promotion lined up and have just had a meeting request to discuss this. The culture at the company I work for is quite toxic, a lot of gossiping and bitching as well as poor management above me has led to me looking for another job. It’s more money, but potentially more stress and travel. 

Here’s where I’m stuck. I am “friends” with one of my assistants at work. I use quotation marks because whilst we were close at one point after a lot of drama at work (rumours about us) she seemed to close off the friendship side, and we are now just friendly at work. She has been promised my role when I get promoted, however I have just found out that my boss is not too keen on the idea due to personality issues between the two that have gone on for a while. We all used to be quite close but due to how he was at work (borderline bullying in some instances) and how she has been at work (rude in the office, not always eager to pick up new tasks - this was all around the time when the gossip was at its peak) they no longer interact with each other really. I actually had to sit him down and tell him he can’t carrying on behaving the way he was at one point. Anyway, I now know that if I leave they will replace me and promote above her. Something that doesn’t sit well with me as I was the one (via the company) that promised her this promotion only a few months ago.

I don’t know what to do, if I leave I will be hurting the career of someone I do still care about on a personal level. I find myself wondering if I should stay, after all I do have another promotion coming? The advice I get from my friends is just to leave and not worry about it.

1l1tj43,Previous teacher pivoted to non-profit sector and would like to pursue a Master's Degree.,"Hello all,

I currently have a Bachelor of Arts in Education (specifically in grades 7-12). I was granted emergency clearance that lasted for three years during COVID meaning. I left teaching as I was thinking of doing a Master's in Educational Policy but got cold feet because I thought it would be too niche of a subject to study. I have since pivoted into the nonprofit sector working as a Coordinator and a Case Manager at a local nonprofit for the last two years. 

My current job would likely cap out at mid-level and although I love the nonprofit field, I figured it is now time to pursue a Master's degree in order to leverage a higher paid position with my background. I was thinking either an MPP, MPA, or taking a leap of faith and pursuing the Educational Policy research going down the line and assisting in Ed Policy research.

I am interested in the back end of education rather than classroom teaching and the nonprofit sector, generally just in jobs that help people.

I have it instilled in me to constantly worry about job security and therefore would like to pursue a Master's Degree in a field that would offer a broad range of positions and one in which it wouldn't be difficult to find a career after grad school.

1l1t76e,Thinking about a career change into financial planning/CFP — would love honest advice,"Hi all, I’m potentially considering a career pivot into becoming a CFP and would love input from anyone in the field (or adjacent to it). I’m in a weird in-between place career-wise and trying to figure out what’s next.

My background is in social work — I loved helping people, but honestly, the burnout was real and the earning potential was really limited. Since then, I’ve bounced around a bit. After moving for my husband’s new job, I worked in assistant property management for a bit, and now I’m in a Fintech role. The pay and benefits are decent, but the work is... soul-crushing. It’s very much a dead-end job, and there’s no room to grow or feel like what I’m doing matters.

Recently, I’ve gotten really into financial independence and started learning more about personal finance, and for the first time in a long time, I feel genuinely excited about something career-related. I love future planning, I’m detail-oriented, and I’ve got strong pattern recognition (thanks to being neurodivergent). I’m great with people, not afraid of tough conversations, and I really want to help people — just in a way that’s more sustainable and less emotionally depleting than social work was.

Ideally, I’d love to work directly with individuals and families on things like budgeting, saving, goal-setting, and basic financial education. I don’t want to go into a sales-heavy role or something where the “client” is actually a company. I want to work with people and actually help them improve their lives. That said, I’m struggling to figure out what path makes the most sense.

Some questions I’d love help with:

What’s the job outlook for CFPs or similar financial planning roles?

What’s the earning potential like (especially starting out)?

Is it “AI-proof” (or at least relatively resilient)?

What are the biggest pros and cons of the field from your experience?

Would you actually recommend getting into this field?

Should I go back to school for a finance/econ degree? Or could I pivot with my BSW and go straight into certification? Would that hurt my outlook?

Any advice on how to tailor a job search to find client-facing planning roles (without getting stuck in sales-heavy positions)?


I’d really appreciate any honest insight.",emithefave,2,1.0,3,1748897173,2025-06-02 20:46:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1t76e/thinking_about_a_career_change_into_financial/,6,2025

1l1t1v9,"Laid off, asked to rejoin a few weeks later (with different responsibilities). Should I ask for more?","Hello, I worked at this job for quite some time (little over a year). The pay is pretty good, benefits were awesome, and the work load was manageable. However, a few weeks ago I got laid off (with like 15 other people). The management directly above me did not know about it, so I’m assuming these were part of some huge sweeping budget cuts across the company. So, I was jobless and began my job hunt. About a week later, I get a call from my boss saying that there’s another part of the company opening up, and that there’s a job opening very similar to mine. My boss told me he would get to get me that job, and then said that the responsibilities would be a little different, the communication would be more fast paced, etc. I said I’d be open to it.

He did add something at the end of his email that said something along the lines of “ask HR about what your responsibilities will be. I just want to make sure you get what you think is fair”. 

I got a message from HR today, confirming that I will be receiving an official offer soon. The offer was for the same exact amount of money I was making before.

Now, this is difficult. They did me a solid my hiring me back, but at the same time, I have always heard never to return for the same amount of money. 

Also, I’d hate to end up unemployed, which I guess is the big thing. They gave me a severance check, but it’ll last me a good 2 months.

1l1t1n6,"New grad choosing between two offers (STEM, 82k vs 58k)","Hi all, I’m a new grad whose parents did trades/professional education, and I’m overwhelmed making a decision between two job offers. I have my BSc and MSc, and my ideal career is in some kind of environmental consulting role. 

About me: I got through undergrad working as an administrative assistant, and have additional office work experience with high level professionals (think doctors, CEO etc). I know I’m good in that position, I’m fast and organized, and I like learning how companies work. I also have $20k of student debt and live in a high COL area. 

The options: 

1. 82k (+ benefits) in a STEM company outside of my field, working more as an assistant but with opportunities for eventual internal growth. Learn a lot about how a company functions, pay off my debt, and really pleasant interactions with the hiring team. Seems like a great place to work. 

2. 58k (some benefits) in a startup in a field I want to break into as a scientist. Getting experience that would definitely be helpful towards my long term goals, but I don’t see myself long term at this company. While their product is interesting, from what I can tell there are many places working on the same idea and they have not progressed significantly further. Good experience but eventually I want to work somewhere more established. I don’t see myself as particularly “entrepreneurial” or wanting to give pitch decks/promote our potential research, I’d rather work on the idea itself. However, direct experience in this field would be valuable and the job itself is as a research scientist. 

Job 2 is ultimately more aligned with experience I want to gain, but Job 1 would still be good, might teach me things I don’t expect, and would allow me to pay off my debt quickly and build up some savings. I also prefer the established company culture of Job 1 over startup culture of Job 2. 

What advice would you give someone in my position? What considerations might I be missing? Practically, how important is paying off debt (and the potential for finally not living the “student lifestyle”, taking care of my family, etc). I’m 25 and wanting to explore my hobbies and travel before settling down, but I don’t want to let the temptation of finally feeling debt free and comfortable allow me to make a decision that doesn’t invest in my future career.

Cannot do clinical nursing anymore because of illness (caught covid at work and not recovering from long covid since the pandemic) and need to work from home. Whilst I'm grateful to have a job and to be able to work from home, assessing disability is slowly destroying my soul and quickly ruining my mental health.

There are no admin jobs currently WFH, but obviously if one comes up I will go for it. Need to brush up on MS skills and if anyone has any tips in terms of making myself more employable there, I'd welcome that too. 

However, I need a brand new idea. I like investigating stuff. If it were just my mental health affected I'd go into the police, but physical disability make this impossible too. If I could give up work, I'd get a masters in something, but I can't work and do that so this is out at the moment.

But in all honesty, the past 10 years have ruined my physical and mental health so much it is to the point I never want to help another human being ever again in any caring role.

1l1py7o,Feeling stuck and with no way out? What should I do?,"Some context: M29, italian, graduate in 2020 from a leading business school. 
Got into Big4 right away (doing MBB strategy consulting, Tier 2 or similar would have been a dream, but I never managed to pass the technical interviews = business case). 
In Big4 (advisory) I dealt exclusively with Telco clients (industry in a deep crisis but which I really like) on very varied projects: more strategic stuff (commercial due diligent, market entry), but also less fun stuff like digital transformation and process analysis. 
After three years, a promotion to senior and generally very much liked by management, I decide to change sectors completely and go to a pharmaceutical company, for a sort of ""Chief of Staff"" role to the Managing Director (between """" because the job title is not that, the responsibilities are similar but scaled down - and my seniority of course is what it is).

Although the role naturally gives me excellent visibility especially at the c-level, it seems to me that the amount of work lately has significantly decreased, is rather operational (at times at the level of a Personal Assistant) and that in any case I cannot aspire to further outlets within the company (pharmaceutical - all things considered - does not drive me crazy). 
In any case, for the past year I feel that I have not gained any technical skills, in fact I have regressed.

I would like to retrace my steps, but I feel I have not really focused on what my options might be:

Option 1: Call my Partner in Big4 and ask to rejoin (as a manager? there had already been a contact last fall from them in which they asked me for availability, but I declined due to logistical issues-I no longer live in Milan). However, I remained on very good terms with all colleagues.
 
Option 2: Try the strategy consulting route. Now that I am in corporate, it feels impossible and that I will regret forever. 

Option 3: Move to a telco company, with the caveat that-as I said before-the industry is in a deep crisis and there are very few positions opening up. Also, since almost all telcos are local based, it is unlikely to try to move abroad (almost all of them ask for local language proficiency). 

I am a bit worried, because this situation I fear is severely slowing me down, and honestly it is not having good repercussions on my mental health.

Hey Guys!

I (32F) live in Ontario and have been doing nail art since I was about 11. I started making press-on sets for fun in the last few years and have been interested in doing nails professionally for just as long. I have never pursued it seriously for various reasons—like the lack of medical benefits, not knowing what the job market is like, and my mother, who is a long-time hairstylist, always telling me that I would hate it and likely not succeed to the level I would hope to.

However, I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm stuck. I struggle with holding down a job that I am passionate about, that actually interests me, and that pays a livable wage in Ontario (which is getting to be insane).  
The issue is that I have also been thinking about going back to school for an Esthetics certificate instead. The idea is that I could start there, eventually build up a client base for myself, and pay to get the nail tech certification from working in skincare. But I'm wondering if that's sort of backwards thinking? I know a nail tech certificate would be quicker, allowing me to earn more immediately, instead of waiting another two years while in school. I think being a nail tech is what would interest me the most, but I keep flip-flopping back and forth about it to the point where I feel like I'm going insane.

Any advice, suggestions, or personal stories of your own would be greatly appreciated! I would like to get a more realistic idea of what it's like for people who have gone down a similar path and what to expect starting out in the industry, especially considering I'm already in my 30s.

With applications for Summer 2026 internships already open, I know I need to start thinking seriously about my direction. I’ve enjoyed most of my classes, but I’m not sure how applicable they are to real-world roles. Reading so many posts about how saturated the job market is has only added to my anxiety.

What are some career paths you think I should explore? I really enjoy talking to people, and I’m also pretty good with numbers. Also, what steps would you recommend I take now to improve my chances of landing a good job after graduation?

Thanks in advance for any guidance — I really appreciate it!",Holiday-Law-7354,1,1.0,0,1748884254,2025-06-02 17:10:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1nm84/college_student_seeking_advice/,6,2025
1l1nlj7,Ummm I did not expect this!,"I accepted a new position with a local grocery store. The position that I applied for was full time and I told them I have open availability.

Over the weekend, the associated who trained had told me that they never schedule employees more than 20 hours/week. I worked 20 hours this past weekend and next week's schedule has me working 20 hours again. I can get by on 30 hours/week but not 20.

I'm interested in staying with the company and hope I can move up. I'm willing to cross-train and work in other departments. (I'm still learning my hired role so I don't want to press this yet, but I expressed interest at my interview.) But I'm shocked that a company would hire for full time, provide great benefits, fasttrack enrollment, but not provide the hours I require.

Meanwhile, I'm employed full time with another company but have been out on FMLA leave. I spoke to HR a week ago Friday and learned they're shutting down the location tgat I work at. I have not resigned yet but was planning to. HR mentioned severance pay. The shutdown will be the end of July.

I don't know if I could keep both jobs. My first schedule with the grocery store is Tuesday, Wednesday, and Sunday 9:30 am-6:00 pm. The schedule for the employer with whom I am out on FMLA leave with is Monday-Friday 7 am-3:30 pm.

These two factors make transferring very appealing to me. My family has gotten excited about moving. 

When I press management on the subject, I get conflicting responses. When I first approached my manager he said the division was desperate for staff. There was supposed to be a meeting set up for me to speak with the leadership in Dallas. That meeting never happened. A couple weeks later when I followed up with my manager I was told the new role is now 3-4 months out (this was a month ago). I know that sounds like a long time, but we need to sell a house, buy a house, find daycares, etc…. 90 days is not a long time on that timeline. I haven’t heard from my manager in about a month.

1l1n875,Breaking into tech and AI- is it worth it to learn coding/computer science?,"I have a bachelors degree in the humanities and just graduated. Most of my career experience has been in administrative and executive assistance and I have mostly worked in education (for universities and children’s educational programs) 

I am, as most people are, having a very hard time finding a job. And with all this news coming out about how AI is going to replace millions of entry level jobs, I’m afraid that the type of jobs I’m going for will be first. 

**that being said**, one of my part time jobs in college was with data annotation, a freelance site where you can help train generative AI. I figured out that I actually really enjoy the work and am also really good at it. It’s part time and unpredictable but it’s what’s been floating me along finically combined with my savings. So I figured that maybe this was a better industry to get into to- if AI is going to take over, better get ahead of the curve and get into that industry now.

Here’s the thing- most full time jobs want you to have coding and computer science skills on top of LLM experience. I know Harvard is now offering free classes in coding and computer science, so I’m thinking about starting that. However, I know that even people in tech are having a hard time getting jobs and since I still wouldn’t have a degree in computer science I don’t know if I would be able to compete. 

Does anyone have any insight into if this would be worth it? It’s free yes, but still 8-10 hours of my week for 3-4 months. I guess I have nothing to really lose but, idk, any opinions would still be appreciated ",jmh1881v2,3,1.0,36,1748883381,2025-06-02 16:56:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1n875/breaking_into_tech_and_ai_is_it_worth_it_to_learn/,6,2025
1l1n6fr,"I want to get out of the niche design job I have, where to go from here?","I am currently a truss designer. For those who don't know, I use a CAD-like software to design roofs and floors for residential buildings and apartments. While this is a decent job with relatively good pay, It is not the right job for me at all. 



I initially got into it because I have experience designing models in 3D and I had a lot of the skills required outside of construction experience. I've worked for 3 different companies doing this and each has been super fast paced and wants mandatory overtime. Every single job is a rush order and needs to be done yesterday. On top of this there is never any positive feedback for how any of the designers are doing, just salesmen saying parts of it are not correct and need to be fixed. That coupled with a relatively high turnover rate doesn't make me feel secure in the job I am in.

  
It is a very technical job and I feel like it has a lot of transferable skills but I'm not sure what fields I could look into. There's a bit of 2D CAD, 3D design, working with permits and detailed architectural drawings. Each house (of which I design 20-30 a month) is like it's own self contained project with multiple parts and deadlines. I'm not sure if project management is something I should look at.

  
I have experience in the tabletop/board game industry doing customer service management and 3D engineering for miniatures. I also went and got my Comptia A+ certification a couple of years ago when I though that was an option for me. I have a psychology degree that I am not using unsurprisingly.

  
Right now I'm kind of lost with what to do and how to get there.

1l1mqt3,Stay in Vienna in average job or go back home to developing country and work for Mckinsey for a while?,"Im 27 years old, soon ill be graduating with a masters degree in econ from the University of Vienna and before that i did my bachelors in finance at LSE in London. Originally I am from Azerbaijan but i did not grow up there so there is not a lot tying me to that place except family. I very much prefer living in Europe which is why did both my bachelors and masters in Europe. Now im faced with a choice, stay in Vienna by accepting a not so desirable role in trade finance at a small bank (very operational role), or go back to Azerbaijan and work as a business analyst at Mckinsey for 2-3 years and hope that once I have that on my CV i will be able to find a job that fits me better in Europe.

Taking the less desirable job in Vienna would allow me to extend my visa and after a couple of years i would have unlimited access to the labour market (and my German will also have time to improve) and then after that i could try to pivot into corporate development or consulting roles. Going back to Azerbaijan and working for Mckinsey i could learn a lot on that job, have the Mckinsey stamp on my cv which would hopefully open some doors and it would also be much more lucrative than the Vienna job. But it could be harder to make my way back to the EU as it seems many countries are now tightening their visa policies.

Pros for Vienna: great city, great work life balance, decent salary

Cons for Vienna: job is not ideal and is just a means to an end

Pros for Azerbaijan: close to family, great salary (only cause it McK, other companies pay shit), great for CV potentially

Cons: not a country i want to live in long term

  
Im wondering if i should suck it up, move back home and work at McK for 2-3 years. This would be intense as consulting working hours are high and on top of that we dont have a very good culture of work life balance in general. Or should i Stay in Vienna, work in the average job and in my free time work on my skills that would help me pivot later into consulting or corporate dev.

I realized many roles are only posted on internal career pages and never appear on classic job boards.
So I built an AI script that scrapes listings from 70k+ corporate websites.

Then I wrote an ML matching script that filters only the jobs most aligned with your CV, and yes, it actually works.

You can try it [here](https://laboro.co/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=8) (for free).  

(If you’re still skeptical but curious to test it, you can just upload a CV with fake personal information, those fields aren’t used in the matching anyway.)

1l1m2b6,I need advice,"Hello,

  
I am 34(f) living in London and I still don't know what career to do. Everything I have done until now just really hasn’t lead anywhere and I am still broke and renting. 

  
I have worked in catering (parents are both Chefs) (definitely wouldn’t do this)

I have been a Make-up Artist (loved this but instagram and tiktok turned everyone into one and ruined my motivation)

I have been a screen printer and embroidery machinist (not a big fan of this)

I have worked as a Mental Health Administrator (loved this)

I have worked in a sex shop (loved this)

I currently work as a full time Latex Clothing Maker for a fetish brand (love this but I get paid minimum wage and am not treated fairly at work)

Ive also done the usual Pub and bar work thing but I definitely wouldn’t want a career in that.

I do work in background acting for TV and Film (love this)

My aspirations as a child were to be a Costume Designer or SFX Makeup Artist but for various reasons this hasn’t worked out. 

I don’t have a degree but can’t get one now cause I am unable to fund it myself and am no longer eligible for student finance (dropped out twice for reasons ill explain below)

To avoid sounding like I have just never tried hard enough I will explain that I was doing great until I was 19 and met a boy that I would then spend the entirety of my 20s in an abusive and controlling relationship with. I lost all confidence in myself and my abilities to succeed and had such serious mental health issues that its actually a miracle I was able to hold down a job at all during that time.

  
I left him just before I turned 30 and my life has been incredible since and I have come so far and have rediscovered who I am again. I became a model, a latex maker and I have a drive for life that I just didn’t  have before. I got over years of disordered eating and obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorder (so much of which was resolved simply by leaving him!) 

  
I am desperate to find my career and actually earn some decent money before I turn 40. Id like to not rule out the possibility of having children one day and what I want even more than that is to be able to say I turned my life around myself. 

My options so far are;

\- train to be an intimacy coordinator 

\- try to get onto an MA and see if studying something new will open another door

\- Try to get into costume or makeup 

None of which I can really afford to do so really have to be worth it.

If you were trying to go from nothing to a position of stability and a good career within 5 years, what would you do?

What sorts of jobs are in demand?

I am at a loss for what to do and am now just asking the internet

I’m currently three interviews into the process for an AI Engineer role at a small but fast-growing startup. It’s been going well so far, the team seems great, and I’m genuinely interested in the position. The role involves building AI-powered features, deploying models, and working closely with product and engineering, which aligns well with my background.

However, I just noticed that the same company recently posted a Head of Data role. After reading the description, I realized I also have the qualifications they’re looking for: experience building data infrastructure, leading cross-functional efforts, supporting metrics and insights, and mentoring more junior team members. It seems like a role where I could have even broader impact, and I’m intrigued.

The wrinkle is that I’m being represented by an external recruiter and have another interview scheduled very soon. I’m wondering:
	•	Is it appropriate to bring this up at this stage?
	•	Should I mention it to the recruiter, to the company directly, or not at all unless they bring it up?
	•	Will this make me look indecisive, or could it show initiative and flexibility?

1l1jh4n,"Promo within a strategic role, some contributions are difficult to quantify, how do I explain them?","Title is kind of self-explanatory. I work for a small SaaS company and I've been in a strategic/operations role for a couple of years and I've been crushing it. In both years I've been recognized as a top performer and have had been recognized in my department in two out of the last 4 quarters for excellence.

Snippet from my internal job description/scorecard. The role was created basically FOR me to take on as a ""transformational role."" Necessity is the mother of invention and whatnot... It's an internal facing role focused on building efficiency and reducing risk across the team from their ability to support customers and increase Net Revenue Retention (NRR).

*...contributes to and assists executing the strategic vision leading service delivery for ... organization. This key position will help ensure the effectiveness team members and enable them to deliver maximum value to our customers. ... collaborate with leaders and individuals to devise and execute programs that would enable the teams to execute against key performance indicators such as product adoption within the customer base, and net revenue retention ...*

So I think when I look at that, one key aspect of performance is obviously ""did NRR Retention go up?"" but my impact is implicitly, not explicitly tied to Net ARR (globally, our business metric) when compared to the people actually doing the work. So this is definitely a role that is more Directorial in nature.

The good news is, my manager has my back and is pushing with extra justification, but neither of us seem to have a clear connection to some of the other aspects of my work that can be ""tied back to the business."" We know we'd be up a creek if I wasn't here, but that isn't always easy to demonstrate in numbers for me.

I've been reading a lot about how to quantify better the ""disasters"" I've prevented lately, and learned about the [prevention paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_paradox) and also [counterfactual outcomes](https://www.betterevaluation.org/frameworks-guides/rainbow-framework/understand-causes/compare-results-counterfactual) which I think both summarize my current situation. As to say, it's easier for me to say had I not been involved in a major project (for example, I ran UAT for a tool and process migration that went off without a hitch) than to actually demonstrate those negative outcomes because, they obviously didn't happen.

Any suggestions on how to quantify these (or any) such subjective aspects of my work?",Seastep,2,1.0,1,1748874546,2025-06-02 14:29:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1jh4n/promo_within_a_strategic_role_some_contributions/,6,2025
1l1jfuz,Undergrad student: Confused and lost; What do I do?,"Ok so hear me out, I wanted to pursue fashion because it seemed like the thing I'd happily do every effin day. But my parents got me into a local college with an Honours in English. I resented my college for most of my course. I'm a 4th semester student now (new FYUGP batch yah) I'm coming to terms with how real world works only recently. 

I've heard fashion could be hard to break into. I got no work experience and I don't even know how to land a job/freelance work. And I don't come from a very well off family either. But I feel quite inexperienced even with my other interests with film/tourism. So I might have a dream but don't know the ways well enough to actually get what I want???

Have always aspired to move abroad or at least move out of my home state, either for work or education but I'm quite torn about what path to actually choose ahead.

What would you suggest/ do if you're in my shoes?

1l1jca7,My coworker and boss are having an affair,"I’ll be using fake names 

My coworker (Ann, 40-ish, F) started working the same time as me (Trish, 22, F).

My boss (Leo, 50, M) knew Ann for a long time, they used to play club sports together and attended the same community events (football watch parties). 

Ann had been a SAHM for 10+ years, working freelance as an editor. She had two kids to take care of and her husband had a lucrative job. 

Ann’s husband got laid off, and Ann started looking for work.

Ann and Leo spend a lot of time together. Company policy only requires employees within 50 miles of the office to come in 2x a week. Ann and Leo come in everyday of the week. 

Ann and Leo take multiple walks together everyday for 1hr+ and also eat lunch together (go out or get takeout) everyday. 

Ann is always in Leo’s office chatting with him.

Leo and Ann have many inside jokes together. Once at a company function she touched his thigh while laughing.

Leo got Ann a birthday gift and did not get me one. Leo gave Ann a book that we had all talked about in a meeting. 

Leo often demeans his wife, calling her an alcoholic “jokingly” 

Ann took down all her family photos that she had in her cubicle. 

Ann added her maiden name to her LinkedIn profile. 

Ann removed her sticker with her initials (husbands last name) from her car

And the most damning piece of evidence, my boyfriend used Leo’s phone to take a photo at a work event and saw an “I miss you” text from Ann. And many hearts too

Ann is starting to act like my boss and Leo just listens to whatever she says. I’m sick of it what do i do

1l1iup3,Feeling Stuck as a Social Media Coordinator.How Do You Handle It When Leadership Doesn’t Get It?,"I’d really appreciate some insight from people who’ve been in this role.

I’m working as a Social Media Coordinator, but constantly hitting walls. Leadership expects big results — more engagement, better reach, viral posts — but gives me little to work with. No access to proper data, barely any say in decisions, and no real support or tools. Just vague expectations and pressure.

Have any of you been in a similar spot?

How do you:

Set boundaries or manage expectations?

Show the value of your work when it’s not obvious to others?

Handle burnout or creative block when you’re doing so much with so little?

1l1hm6z,"Company laid me off 2 months ago, now wants me back. Do I consider it based on my situation?","Background: I was laid off (“RIF”) two months ago by a company I was with for 7+ years. I was a Regional Director. Myself and the 3 other department Directors (including my boss, Senior Director) were laid off as well (leaving no dept. directors). I started a new job with a different organization 2 weeks ago. The pay is significantly less (-20%), and I now hold a Manager rather than Director title. A couple weeks after the layoff, the company posted a position for a Director for my former department. Since then, the VP of the Dept. has reached out to me twice about considering the position and returning.

Should I entertain the possibility of returning?

Pros: -The new role would be a promotion (Regional Director to Director of the Dept.). -Pay increase (not listed on job post, but should be a given considering the title change). -Besides the higher salary, the benefits with my former organization are much better (substantially more PTO, much higher 401k match, 3x amount of life insurance). -They seem desperate, giving me good leverage to negotiate.

Cons: -Clearly they’ve demonstrated a lack of loyalty to me as a long tenured employee. -The company is disorganized, lacks transparency, and clearly the decision making abilities of executive leadership is questionable.

If I do consider returning, these are the terms I am contemplating posing to them: -35% base salary increase from my former salary. -Remain vested in my 401k, rather than having to restart the vesting process (after 1 year you are 25% vested in the amount the company matched, 50% after 2 years, 100% after 3 years). -Guaranteed severance. 3 months severance if terminated without cause/misconduct within less than 1 year of employment. 5 months severance if terminated without cause/misconduct after 1+ year of employment. -For consideration-$5000 sign-on bonus with no clawback provision. I did receive a severance when I was laid off of 4 weeks pay, so I am not sure if the sign-on bonus would be an over the top request.

1l1hcqq,Startup Offer vs. PIP: What Would You Do?,"One month ago, I shared that I was offered a one-month contract with a startup. That has now turned into a full-time offer.

I’m still on an indefinite PIP at my current full-time job and I took the contract to see if the startup could be a long-term fit. It’s an early-stage company and while the team is great, I’m concerned about financial stability and burnout. I don’t see myself lasting more than a year there.

They initially offered $10K less than my current salary but I negotiated it to just a $5K difference. Still, taking a pay cut while already on PIP (with no raise or cost-of-living adjustment) feels like a step back, especially since the startup work isn’t aligned with my long-term career goals.

I’m actively job hunting but it’s been slow. I do have one phone interview lined up tomorrow though. 

Would you:
	•	Accept the startup offer, quit current job, and keep job hunting?
	•	Decline, stay at your current role, and ride out the PIP while searching?

1l1h7qt,Where is engineering headed as an industry — and what should someone actually do about it?,"I think I need a bit of guidance, or at least some perspective, on where engineering as a whole is heading as an industry — and more importantly, what actions someone should be taking to actually make the most of it throughout their career.

This past year there have been some major developments in my life. I’ve been lucky enough to find someone patient enough to marry me (I know, I’m just as surprised as you are). I bring this up because it plays a key role in where I see my career going.

I’ve been in the same industry (civil infrastructure, traffic signal design and control) since I started out about 10 years ago. During that time, I managed to get both my HND and my BEng in Electrical & Electronic Engineering. The only issue is that my job barely touches EEE — 90% of what I do day-to-day is basic CAD drawing.

Recently there’s been a development where I might get to work with the street lighting team, which would hopefully give me some exposure to electrical design. Fingers crossed.

But if I’m honest, the real issue is financial. There *are* parts of my work I genuinely enjoy — but lately, I’ve found myself just counting the days till Friday. When the weekend hits, I feel more down than relieved, and I find myself constantly questioning if it’s all worth it.

The salary definitely doesn’t justify the amount of work I’m doing. A few weeks ago, I was troubleshooting CAD software issues for my teammates — teammates who earn more than me. That really rubbed me the wrong way. I’ve never cared about that stuff before, but it hit different this time. I used to have a fiery passion for engineering — I saw myself as a *real* engineer. But lately? I’m not so sure anymore.

To add some context: a few months ago, my younger brother got made redundant. He was a hardware maintenance engineer for a tech company specialising in robotics for retail. He doesn’t have a degree — just a BTEC from college — but he worked there for 7 years. Since being let go, he’s been applying to everything he can think of, and all he gets back are rejections. He’s got a child on the way and it’s been hitting him hard.

He’s been thinking about doing an electrical installation course — he’s shown interest in the past and likes the idea of becoming self-employed. Honestly, even to me that sounds more appealing than sitting behind a desk for 8+ hours a day, slowly losing the will to live.

For some more background: we used to have a family business — a fast food place in our city that was fairly well-known and popular. But it was back-breaking work, and you really had to be made of something to keep at it. We sold it just before COVID because we were all ready to try something different. That includes my older brother too — he worked with us for over 20 years after getting his business degree. He’s now 40, working as a car salesman, and he’s just as lost as the rest of us.

Even with all my frustrations at work, the recent wave of redundancies has really shaken things up. It’s made me stop and think about where I’m heading — and what I need to do to secure my future. Which brings me back to the wedding. Like my brother, my partner is from abroad, and bringing her over to the UK is incredibly expensive. That’s been my biggest motivator — finding something more lucrative, more stable, and more promising long-term.

Right now, going blue collar and ditching the white collar lifestyle is starting to look like the only viable option.

1l1gddw,Struggling to find a job and balance childcare,"Hi everyone, thanks for taking a second to look at my post.

  
My wife has been looking for work, but most places has rejected her due to work schedule limitations--someone needs to be home with our 15 month old. My daughter can be at daycare between 6AM to 6PM on the weekdays (excluding holidays). 

I work in a hospital, so I work 12 hour shifts, 3-4 times a week, from 7AM to 7PM, with about an hour commute each way. I am able to watch my daughter on my days off, however, being the low man on the totem pole at work, I don't have have a set work schedule yet. I am required to work every other weekend, which limits my wife even more.

She has applied to and interviewed with Target and Walmart, but like restaurants, they're looking for evening and weekend shifts. Part-time seems to be hard to come by as high schoolers are now on summer break here. 

We don't have any family nearby, so childcare is our top priority. While she doesn't *have* to work, she wants to be a career driven woman and set a good example for my daughter.

I have suggested trying to go through a recruiter/agency, but I'm not sure if she has followed through with that suggestion. 

She's considering going back to school (currently has a BA in communications and a certificate in marketing), I'm not sure for what. She is hesitant as she would have to pay the international tuition rate because she has a Green Card.

1l1exhq,How do I take paternity leave in the midst of inherited failing projects? TIA,"TL;DR - Inherited a project right before the birth of my child, have been working since. Project has been stalling, and my health is deteriorating taking care of the newborn and project. How can I request paternity leave in this situation?

Hi, TIA.

I started at my new company late last year, and did a fair/ok job, so I started inheriting teammates assignments (we code).

My senior teammate (didn’t get to spend much time with them due to teammate being OOO for a good portion of Q4) left the bank in Q1, and transferred their a project code body and materials to me.

It was around their departure time that I let work know I was expecting a baby at the beginning of Q2. Given that I was relatively new, and our FTE count was down due to this departure, I agreed to help complete their outstanding projects with the expectation of taking time in July (I know, I know…this was a bad idea, had a known the complexity would have refused or resigned).

Baby came at the start of Q2, and the project has experienced setbacks — I learned after the fact that the knowledge transfer wasn’t all that complete, and the block of code i recieved in transition will probably require major rework thru validation. I can easily see this going thru Q2 and into the beginning of Q3.

Issue is I’m not sleeping due to the baby schedule, and I have a chronic condition I am managing privately. It’s not an issue usually, but I a an exhausted and starting to experience burnout. My partner is also starting to wear thin, and is requesting my presence with the newborn and our other children. We are entitled to a large amount of paternity leave at my company, but I feel this would almost be considered abandoning my project. I’m currently stuck between not wanting to fail work/losing employment and being there for my family.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks again.

1l1ek4b,"I’m Shaking, I Have 10K Left, No Job, and No Idea What I’m Doing","I'm honestly scared, and I would really appreciate some help.

I'm a 25-year-old student, and the only reason I'm still studying is because I'm deliberately stalling. I'm from a third world country, and studying abroad is my only real chance to build a life elsewhere. I did my Master's in Economics and Entrepreneurship in Italy and also spent some time in France through Erasmus. I'm currently in my second year and planning to graduate next year — I still need to complete my thesis and an internship.

Right now, I have about 10K saved up from my dad and scholarships. I managed to open an Italian bank account and a Revolut account, which honestly felt like a small dream come true, because one of my goals was always to live abroad and have access to international banking so I could start working somehow — online or offline.

But here's the truth: I have zero real work or internship experience. I’m terrified that I’m incompetent and that I don’t bring anything to the table. I realized recently that what I want to do in life is business consulting, but I have absolutely no idea where to start. I don't know what I need to learn, what steps to take, or even how to build experience in the field.

Right now, I'm back in my home country to save some money, since I'm staying at my parents' house. But it's really complicated. My dad, who financed most of my studies abroad, is very abusive. I feel like I have to get my family out of this situation. They depend on me, and that pressure makes me feel like a failure sometimes.

I’m totally lost. I don’t know if I should:

Buy courses online? which ones?

Try to work or start an internship here in my home country although I have to leave?

Try to find an internship in Europe and do it now not later?

Try something like dropshipping or a small business?

The only things I’m sure of are:

I speak English, Arabic, French, and I’m learning Italian.

I have a Bachelors in Management by a French university.

And I want to build a real future.

But I feel like I don’t even know how to teach something, or how to begin anything. I wish I did. I’m just... confused.",serineeeee,49,0.949999988079071,10,1748860171,2025-06-02 10:29:31,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1ek4b/im_shaking_i_have_10k_left_no_job_and_no_idea/,6,2025

1l1dvh9,Struggling to find my way,"Dear Redditors, I need your help and advice. 

I am a 26 M soon to be 27 living in Belgrade, Serbia. I have a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and last year I started my Master’s degree in industry 4.0 hoping to transition into the IT industry. Because of the student protests going on since November last year, my studies have been abruptly stopped. This left me lost.

  
I have many interests and for years now I am not able to choose where to focus my energy. The thing I enjoyed the most at uni was CAD and 3D modeling, I am interested in 3D modeling in general like Blender, Unreal Engine, but I have no knowledge in these fields, programming sounded interesting, but I am not able to get out of the boring beginning and into doing something legitimate. I feel like the time is running out for me to start my career. Do people really find their first actual job at 30? 

For me the choice is between these 3 options or something similar. I love studying and would love to deep dive into all of these fields, but I just can't choose.

There is an option to go study abroad and finish my Master's in Slovenia. I am afraid of this option because I am getting a bit old.

Currently, I am working part-time as a Personalized Internet Assessor at Telus Digital, this is an awfully boring job and made for earning extra money. On top of that I play bass guitar in 2 bands, one is a tribute band that earns me about 100 euros per gig, but the gigs are few and far in between. 

I have some professional experience creating models and drawings in SolidWorks and AutoCAD for a company that builds mechanical parts for theaters. 

This post is probably constructed badly, and the information is scattered, as are my thoughts. The only thing I want is to choose something and give it my all, the illusion of choice is killing me, who says I could even succeed in any of these things.

1l1cux8,How should I handle a boss that blamed me and is now hostile?,"Other than looking for new jobs, which I’m doing now, what should I do? How can get I get the courage to confront my boss, and is it worth it? I have terrible anxiety, and I'm going to therapy now for help. I'm going to be vague to not give away too much details. I hope it's not too vague. Please let me know if it is and I'll provide more details. I'm calling the incident a task. Hopefully you can get the gist.

My boss blamed me for team performance being low and potentially the whole office. That's very unfair to say because so many factors are involved and most of the blame can't be on me. I'm not a supervisor. I did not complete one task, but they did not give clear expectations and full nature of the task or the  priority level. My boss didn't prioritize or value previous similar tasks associated with a specific team in my office and said to take what one member says ""with a grain of salt."" Also, the term used to call the task does not make it sound mandatory. With all of this precedent, I didn't prioritize it.

Also, my boss said false info that I never said there were issues with the task when we discussed them multiple times, and they never escalated or investigated them. And they said I didn't communicate when I was overwhelmed. This is also false. We've talked about it in person and via text and email multiple times over the past year. I spoke to HR for advice and to write a professional and respectful script to help me confront my boss, but I'm very scared. Can't help feeling so anxious and depressed, and I'm scared I'm losing my job in the next few months over this. And now my boss speaks to me with a lot of hostility (similar to how she speaks to others on my team) and I'm afraid to ask questions or raise concerns, which makes me feel incompetent. They're also penalizing me for all this, too, by delaying one of my benefits that would help with my potential promotion and career progression. Please help.

1l1cp02,"Need some input, Conflicted","Hey all, I am a few years into being a Pharmacy tech and I’ve worked at a few different places, but mostly spent my time at Rite-Aid. Their subreddit has a policy about needing a certain amount of karma to post there due to some unfortunate circumstances, so I come here to make this. And apologies in advance if the formatting is weird, I’m on mobile.

So, where to start?

I didn’t expect the second bankruptcy. I was hoping that the rumor mill was just that, all rumors. May 5th hit hard, my coworkers shocked that it was just dropped on us with no extra information, the ever expanding gloom as each of us were informed and then just, didn’t talk about it for days or weeks. I know it’s old news at this point, but I’ve kept to myself about it.

I’ve worked here for 3-ish years and fell in love with it. The people coming in, the many coworkers, and especially the prescription management system. This place and my manager have given me a huge opportunity and it has changed my life. Sure it’s given me its fair share of problems, but I always had the crew beside me. I guess the hardest part is, is that it isn’t going to last much longer. Within a few weeks, it’s all over. Gone.

Where I’m at is closing soon (as are almost all Rite-Aids that aren’t being converted into CVS) and I’m just… unsure of when I should throw in the towel and call it quits. I’ve already got a nice job lined up, just need to take the final steps into my new world. I don’t know if I should just ride out the storm and party in the pharmacy after the final closing details are done or if I should just peacefully exit and be done with it.

If you are taking the time to read this, I thank you. If anyone is here and you’re also from Rite-Aid, I wish you the best of luck. We all need some.

1l1at26,Why pursue a career which is not as fruitful as others?,"Hello everyone,

I hope all is well. I am writing to ask why do people pursue a career which is not so fruitful?

Context:

I am a fresh 24yr old mechanical engineering graduate with 2 years of experience working in the south of Europe. The b.eng course was not so easy to finish and once I acquired my first job I quickly realised how bad the pay was (I understand that you start off with a lower wage). The issue is that the wages do not increase drastically unless you job hop here and there (how do I know? I asked engineering which have 10+ years of experience of working). 

Today’s issues:

I understand that there is a degree of passion when it comes to such a profession but in the end of the day you have to be able to feed yourself and have something left for a rainy day. 

My issue is that I also spoke with other individuals who work in different streams of work (Finance, medicine, nursing, computing etc). It seems to be that all of them make more money than even a skilled engineer (and a drastic salary gap at that). 

Additionally, since I am a junior engineer, work is relatively boring and lacks the possibility for me to improve on my
Skills such as design, building, assembling etc as no work is given (Yes, I asked for more work). 

So I want to ask what’s the point of continuing to pursue such a profession when good pay takes 7+ years of experience to acquire? (And even that, the pay is still way too low compared to other professions)
 
I am not the only one complaining about such fruitless work and what makes it worse is that my country brings in 3rd world country nationals which accept lower wages and in turn cause locals such as myself to have to accept a lower wage.

People say engineering is vast and always needed and you will find jobs which is true but the idea that those jobs will pay a decent wage is kind of a lie. 

I posted this on this subreddit instead of a mechanical engineering sub-reddit because I feel that most people on those reddits are biased towards engineering and most are also Americans. 

I wish to gauge your opinions on the matter.

1l1an1i,giving up after years trying to land new entry level job,"Graduated college in 2020 with anthropology degree and have never planned life outside of college. I never had a dream career and studied what I felt was most interesting to escape suicidal ideation. 

Moved back home during first quarantine and took some time after graduating to relax and focus on my mental health. 

When I was ready, I took some time to do a lot of research about what career I want to step into. Though anthropology seems limiting, there are various ways to flip the formal training in the professional world. I liked the idea of design thinking and service design but knew it was a very exclusive field. I met with a few people after connecting on LinkedIn and gained so much insight about different field, workforce management, museum industry, consulting, etc. I felt excited about my standing as a new graduate in the remote sphere. That energy was halted after the 4th month applying for jobs. Prior to the pandemic, I had to problem getting interviews within a week of applying. I was shocked and honestly felt so insecure. 

In 2022, I finally got a job. I’m still working there. It’s remote customer service. The team is great but I hate the work. I’ve progressed in my department but it’s a dead-and. I’ve tried to move internally but no one wants me. 

Just got rejected from an operations enablement position after the 2nd round. It was a perfect opportunity: internal applicant, so many transferable skills and experience and operations would look good on my resume for future role as operations analyst or project coordinator. The entire application process, I did feel something telling me it wasn’t gonna work but I thought it was just doubt. 


I’m trying not to beat myself up but I thought I was ideal for the role.

The reason I mentioned operations looking good on my resume is due to a career path I’m finally realizing I want for myself. I love the idea of care coordination, health equity and precision medicine. I figured working for a research org, non-profit, or clinic as an operations coordinator or project coordinator would be a great step in the door for the new path. However, this rejection has really tanked my spirits. 

I don’t have health industry experience or time to go back to school and I’m just at a loss on what to do with my life. I can’t stay in this customer service job for long and it seems like there’s nowhere for me to turn. I don’t want to spend another 2 years trying to find something else but it seems like I’m not a good fit anywhere.

I have experience in systems thinking, cross-functional collaboration, leadership, some CRM programs, and I am passionate about service but no one wants to give me a chance and all opportunities I’d love to go for are not within my reach.

I need to change my life but I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been told I need to think creatively but what does that even mean besides cold emailing and entrepreneurship? 

This is long winded bc I’ve never shared this with anyone but I’d just thought I’d share here in case anyone had some advice, input, or criticism for me.",Previous-Fondant-781,6,0.8799999952316284,6,1748844530,2025-06-02 06:08:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l1an1i/giving_up_after_years_trying_to_land_new_entry/,6,2025

Even the reviews online from previous employees say to avoid this place and how toxic the environment is. I’ve been there for 2 years now and naturally I am a very empathetic and nice person. At the beginning when I first started I tried to be nice to people and just give a head nod and say a simple good morning or hey how’s it going but they would completely ignore me like I didn’t exist or like I wasn’t worthy of their attention. Over time I stopped being nice and avoiding talking to anyone at all. Since the turnover is high there is a lot of new people and a lot of people that I started with have quit. The toxic employees now tell the new hires that I’m a rude asshole who doesn’t like anyone and is snobby because I don’t talk to anyone, when i’m just giving them the same energy that i’ve gotten from them.

Though, in 5 years from now I think a lot of therapy & learning will be administered by AI and the industry risks being oversaturated.

Already we can see people are turning to AI as an alternative to $200 psychologists that many struggle to afford. And rather than in person training people prefer to study from home.

Keep in mind AI is a new tool and in 5 years from now it's going to more competent than many therapists/educators - and more affordable.

1l16udh,"Should I give CAT a try? Need deep and realistic guidance – weak in math, average academics, no work ex","I'm seriously confused and would appreciate real, honest advice – not the usual ""hard work makes anything possible"" stuff.

Here's my background:

Got 54 marks in math in 10th, always been weak at it.

I'm from a commerce non-maths background.

Currently finishing B.Com from a local, non-reputed college (final year).

Academic scores are 7/8/5 (10th/12th/grad CGPA approx).

No work experience, no internships, and honestly no certifications either.

I’ve tried CA earlier and failed twice, lost a lot of confidence after that.


Now I’m considering giving CAT seriously. Not aiming for IIMs — just hoping to get into a decent Tier-2 B-school that could lead to a good career and a respectable package.

My questions are:

1. Is 6 months enough for someone like me (especially with math phobia) to prepare for CAT and have a shot at a good Tier-2 B-school?


2. Can someone with my academic profile still get decent placements and a good salary package if they do well in a Tier-2 MBA?


3. What is the dark reality of graduating from a Tier-2 B-school? Are placements only good for the top 10-20%? What happens to the average students?


4. Should I even try CAT, or would I be better off learning a skill or looking for a job and figuring things out from there?



I'm not afraid of hard work – I just don’t want to waste more years chasing something that might not be worth it in the end. Please help me understand the real picture, especially if you’ve been in a similar situation or know people who have.

I'm a mid-career professional located in the US who is currently a non-technical Program Manager by my official title. I've been a Program Manager for the entirety of my career and worked on Tech and financial services programs predominantly (including data, reporting, process improvement) before this although I do not have formal tech education or any sort of coding/technical background.

I have predominantly made a career out of being able to translate the information and concerns relayed by technical resources into business-friendly terms to get the necessary support and buy-in and help technical folks I work with think in product agnostic terms and long term for more sustainable solutions. That being said I've also done components of what now fall under the purview of Product Management (write user stories, help lead architecture discussions etc).

I've had a string of 3 years without any sort of upward mobility in my career recently in programs which are predominantly non-technical and want to pivot back into the technical space but find myself not meeting the requirements on those Job Descriptions (Computer Science degree, coding knowledge etc).

I am spending any spare time reading up on system design interview material, data structures so I have a very basic level of grasp on the technical details. 

I am considering the following options and would appreciate thoughts:

* Pursue an online bachelor's in a degree with technical rigor like Computer Science I have the means to be able to pay for this out of pocket via an institution like WGU which will offer me flexibility. Unfortunately due to extremely poor undergrad GPA, pursuing a master's is not an option and I'm too old (39) for an MBA.
* Be realistic about ROI and aim for individual certifications that will set me up for more mobility in the Examples include PMP, Product Management certification (product school).
* Given my generalist, non-technical background, accept that technical program management/product management roles may be out of realm of possibility and focus on non-technical program roles (e.g. HR oriented)

1l147fa,"Bad review, I think boss may have it out for me","Hello everyone. To start, I’ve been working for this company for almost a year. I received an 11 month review right before my annual review and it was BAD. My probationary period has been extended. 

I want to be known that this new boss has been here for only a few weeks. My team has been without a true manager for around 8 months. So we have been managing ourselves. 

I have had an only one review in the year I have been here, and it was pretty positive. I was given a few objectives to complete and that was it. I never received my review paperwork, so of course I forgot what those objective were. And that’s on me. 

My bad review consisted of me not meeting those objectives, I’ve been listed as disrespectful to my new manager and they are saying I am unable to do my job without help. The thing that bothers me is that the interim manager who was sort of managing us was not invited to this meeting, so all this information seems to be based off my new boss’s 3 weeks of knowledge. Everything on this review was news to me. Im always open for constructive criticism to better my job performance, but this was crazy to me. 

What can I even do about this? Am I crazy for thinking this new manager may have it out for me? Any advice is helpful. ",applerealm,3,1.0,4,1748823544,2025-06-02 00:19:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l147fa/bad_review_i_think_boss_may_have_it_out_for_me/,6,2025
1l144lu,Should I take a 60-hr/week job in a workaholic culture or stick it out at my current slow-but-uncertain role?,"Hey everyone, I’m hoping to get some advice on a tough decision I’m facing.

I’ve been studying day trading seriously for a while now and have been actively trading equities. I feel like I’m on the verge of a breakthrough—within the next 6 months, I believe I can become consistently profitable and move toward my dream of trading full time.

Currently, I work in SaaS platform implementation consulting, but things have slowed down significantly at my company. Half of my team was laid off about a month ago, and while I still have my job, there’s not much work left. It’s very laid back now, but I’m constantly worried I’ll be next on the chopping block. To make things trickier, the platform I work with is very niche, so finding work in this area is tough.

That said, I might have an opportunity at another company in the same niche. The problem? I’ve been told they expect 60-hour weeks for the at least the first 5 months, and the culture sounds extremely workaholic. According to multiple Glassdoor reviews, working just 40 hours is considered underperforming. Some people even mentioned having meetings as late as midnight. Taking that job would seriously cut into my trading hours.

I know it’s a bit embarrassing, but I’ve decided to move back in with my parents to save on rent while I navigate this uncertainty. I’ve got about $70K in savings, and I want to be as smart as possible with it, especially if I’m going to make a serious push toward trading full time.

At the same time, I worry that if I lose my current job, my fallback options might be limited. They are the only company hiring for the niche SaaS implementation. My other skills are in data analysis, SQL and Power BI, but I’m not sure how competitive I’d be in the broader job market compared to others because I haven’t used it in 3 years.

To make things more complicated, if I **turn down this offer**, I honestly don’t think I’ll find another company that needs this niche SaaS implementation skill. This may be my last shot to stay in the industry I’ve been working in for the last 3 years.

So I’m torn:

* Should I **take the new job**, knowing it’s demanding but stable and within my niche?
* Or **stay with my current employer** for as long as possible, enjoy the flexibility to focus on trading, and risk getting laid off? If I do get laid off, I know I can collect some unemployment and trade full time for about 6 months. My expenses will also be low since I’ll be living at home.

1l13run,How to handle gossip…,"I had to take a lot of time off at work recently, I had three days off planned, but then I also had a graduation, a funeral, and a surgery on top of that that all kind of ended up close together. My boss approved all the time off I requested with no comment, but my coworkers are whispering about it and I’m getting dirty looks. I overhear gossip about me behind my back and I’m not sure what to do. I’m not planning on taking any more time off but it’s kind of already started, and I don’t think they like me very much. 

For context on why they might not like me, I do my job well (I’m pretty sure) but I’m the newest person and I’m clumsy in the social department. I can kind of see when people at work don’t like me - my boss asks me how a training class is going and I say it’s great, she starts to smile, I know I should restrain myself but I kind of forget to and I share a random fact I learned from it - and she immediately starts to scowl.  

I can see how that comes off as know it all, but I was genuinely excited about learning an interesting fact and sharing it with her. Maybe that doesn’t change the above statement. Maybe I should have just said it’s great I’m learning a lot, thanks for enrolling me. 

Or another coworker (who has worked at the center longer than me) is talking to me saying “I know I’m not in this room as much as other people so I might not be as good.” And I almost made some sort of noncommittal agreement, like oh sure. But I stopped and said oh well you’re pretty good for not being in here much. And she agreed with me and said she’s been around for a while, and I realized that my compliment was expected. And then I realized how close to offending her I was by almost agreeing with her the first time. 

Sometimes I think I’m slow in the social department 😬 or maybe I’m kind of self absorbed idk but I genuinely think my coworkers don’t like me because of it. Any advice for how I can be a better coworker or nip this gossip in the bud?

1l13fqv,Should I tell my boss “this isn’t what I signed up for” or just start planning my exit?,"I have been at a large media company for almost a year now that has a marketing side and then radio said. I work in a sales supporting role but on the marketing side. When I took the job, I made it very clear that I wasn’t interested in constantly doing admin work (a huge reason I left my old job) and that I wanted to grow. Also, this job was advertised as hybrid which was a strong selling point for me and I wouldn’t take a role if it wasn’t remote or hybrid.

Initially I liked the job and was learning a lot, but within the past 4 months the job has become everything I didn’t want. The first thing is, I was hired hybrid but then it was disclosed after I was hired that the first 90 days are all in person except for Friday. This has just continued at this point and I let it go despite it bothering me that I was baited and switched like that because I did like the job. Friday was always remote for everyone in the company aside from upper level management but now my manager is making the marketing team (there’s 3 of us) come in 5 days a week when every other team (sales reps, sales assistants, etc) are not required to do so. He told me that this is because upper level management is pressuring him to do so, but it doesn’t make sense when no other team is being required. I also am only doing admin work lately and sitting at my desk allll day long which is the main reason I left my old job to come to this company as I was promised “it isn’t like that here”. Another thing is when I was offered the role, during my last interview, my manager was talking about how they always have lunch catered by clients and all these benefits to the office but I have yet to see that in the year i’ve been here…

I understand these changes he’s enforcing partially as our sellers have not met budget for the past two quarters and I am in a revenue driving positon. The thing is though, marketing is almost meeting budget, while radio is far from it - and the sellers and radio sales support all get to continue to work remote on Friday and not be micromanaged. My manager has also told me repeatedly that I am doing an excellent job and even said there is nothing more I can do at this point. I also have received nothing but praise each quarterly review from him. He also has made a point multiple times (since december) to tell me changes would be happening in the company with the sales talent that have not ever happened despite no one being able to meet budget.

I feel so burnt out and miserable lately in this job and I don’t know what to do. Not only are these new “rules” and expectations affecting my life but I also haven’t received a bonus for the past two quarters. Part of me wants to speak up and advocate for myself but another part of me is scared that if I do, i’ll be fired.

1l12uwp,My role doesn't have clarity but teammate wants ideas from me,"Hey everyone! Would appreciate some advice—this is a bit long, so thanks for reading!

I work at a large electrical company. I interned here last summer, worked through fall, and was offered a full-time role. My background is in Computer Science + Engineering Management (Master’s), and I was originally more interested in project/program management roles. My internship manager suggested this role—focused on innovation and building tools using Power Platform—as a good opportunity.

Three months in (fully remote), I’m in a very small team. My manager pitched it as a growth-heavy role with mentorship from a teammate who’s been with the company 25+ years, has a strong electrical background, and now builds tools solo. So far, I’ve been doing what's asked—building dashboards, small automations, learning the tech stack and basic electrical concepts.

Recently, I volunteered to help onboard new interns since I was one last year. My teammate seemed disappointed (not sure why), but my manager was really impressed and even asked me to present about it to the wider team. Since then, my teammate has been hinting at whether I still enjoy this role or if I’d prefer to move toward PM—they’d support either path. He also wants me to pitch tool ideas randomly, even though I’m not included in many key discussions. Despite my efforts to be helpful, he works mostly alone and a lot of our tool work is being pushed back for being too complex.

In a 1:1, my manager said this is a long-term plan that could take a year+ to really take shape. My teammate suggested I move around, learn basics from different teams, and come up with ideas from that exposure. He also said he is looking in other directions with all the pushbackd he had been facing. 

But honestly, I’m starting to feel lost. At this stage in my career, I really want visibility, growth, and to feel excited about what I’m doing. I don’t want to be stuck in a role where I’m unsure of the end goal, especially when I’m not enjoying the work that much. I feel like I’m not contributing meaningfully or learning in a way that aligns with my goals.

Not sure whether to stick it out, push for a move toward PM, or start looking elsewhere. Would love some advice!

I’m currently working as a Front Office Supervisor, overseeing operations across three properties within the same hotel group. While my official title is front office supervisor, my role also involves managing group and corporate reservations, sales, and other cross-functional projects, especially since we operate with a small team.

I’m now looking to transition into a travel consultant role, preferably with a corporate travel management company such as Corporate Travel Management (CTM), FCM, or similar.

Why I’m Changing Careers:

* I feel my career progression in hospitality has plateaued.
* I’m seeking a non-customer-facing role while still utilizing my travel and coordination skills.
* I enjoy the logistics and planning aspects of travel more than front-desk operations.

# My Questions:

1. Has anyone here made a similar transition? I’d love to hear your experience.
2. Many job postings for travel consultants mention Sabre and Amadeus GDS.
   * Where can I learn these systems?
3. What is the starting salary range like in this field in Australia?
4. What are the career progression opportunities like in organisations like CTM?

So essentially here I'd to resign (2 weeks notice) before it all finishes. I could wait it out but because I can't be in 2 places at once that would also be risky for my current role. Like I cant just not show up for a few weeks and I dont have that much PTO.

When I took this job I told them I knew how to write some intermediate level queries and had a good foundational knowledge of SQL, but told them I have no idea how to manage tables and entire databases but I could work alongside an IT team to communicate changes that should be made.

There is no team available to help manage the databases, we all do it alone. Ir doesn’t make sense that I am expected to do this when there was no indication in the job description that I would be in charge of such a laborious task. I only make 76k and have a responsibility as an individual that I feel would be handled by a dedicated team (database administrators). It’s less about being compensated for it and more about how much stress this is putting on me and a bosses’ boss that won’t recognize this.

I only started the job in December, it is my third job since graduating college in 2022. I have spoken to my direct boss about this and he understands my frustration but didn’t really offer any solutions.

1l10moj,Should I keep working after they tell me I can leave?,"I just started a temp job as a Budget Analyst and I’m hoping it turns into something more permanent. In my past roles and internships, I’ve always had a strong work ethic. I’d usually stay late, often waiting until after my manager left, just to make sure everything was covered.

At this job, though, they keep telling me I can leave early. Sometimes it’s 30 minutes, sometimes over an hour before my shift is technically done. Even when I offer to stay and keep working, they encourage me to go.

I’m torn. On one hand, I don’t want to overstep or mess with their budget. On the other, I want to show I care and that I’m reliable. I really like the team and would love the chance to stay on after the contract ends.

1l0zxrp,"27F, Should I move into Sales?","Hello All,

Hope you guys are doing well.

I'm a law graduate who decided to not practice or get into law. (Did many internships, reliased the only place I would wanna be is the other side of the bench i.e judiciary)

I got an offer from one of my professors from law school, he has a family owned boutique search firm and they do executive search globally. Worked with him for 3 years, have hired for all kinds of roles, from a SE to a CEO. I'm now looking for a change, however, what I've realised is the other gamuts of HR don't excite me as much as recruitment. I like the adrenaline it gives me that I may not get from the other functions in HR. I'd rather join another consulting firm than do internal hiring for a corporate, it wouldn't give me as much joy.

I belive I would really enjoy sales. Since I do not have experience in sales, nobody wants to even interview me, I finally found an Edtech company that was ready to interview me, they were impressed (I studied very hard) and have offered me a job in EdTech Sales.

I also have offers in Recruitment. I'm now in a conundrum. Everybody in my circle has scared me saying Sales is hard, it's target based, it's stressful, it's very demotivating and the list goes on .............. and that Marketing for me would be better if I wanted to get out of Recruitment and not pursue anything HR.

I believe now is the time I can take that leap and figure if I wanna do sales at all or no.  
A. It was hard for me to get an opportunity in sales now, if I don't do it now and wanna try later, there's no guarantee anyone's gonna give me an opportunity then.  
B. If I don't like sales or can't crack it, I've a cushion to fall back on and I'm sure to find some opportunity in Recruitment. I'd rather take that risk now when I'm 27 and not have any responsibilities than later when I might wanna get married, have a family or financially support my parents.

I'm torn, need advise. More than advise, I need a different perpective.  
I really think I'd enjoy sales, people who have been in sales and don't do it any longer, please please tell me what it's gonna be like.",Munchies_101,2,1.0,6,1748812042,2025-06-01 21:07:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0zxrp/27f_should_i_move_into_sales/,6,2025

Well, where do i start? How do i start? I dont know, so i will just write in random order.

Part 1: The Beginning
Basically, im a teenager, who is now going to middle school, and i have to choose to which i will go. I have, lets say middle grades, not bad but not good. Recently they started slipping, because i am 100% focused on my business. I dont really care about school becuase i for sure am not working and earning someone money for 50 years, while listening when i can go take a shit or eat while they pay me 1% of their earnings. No thanks. Also, i do NOT want to play it ""safe"". It is either my business thats going to work out, or nothing. It actually doesnt nesseseraly have to be a business, i will work hard on anything just to get rich.

Part 2: The Reason
The reason why i want to get rich is ever since i was born, my mom stopped working, because her parents (my grandparents) said that they will take financial responsibility and told her to worry only about raising me. My grandpa had his firm, that he sold for around 500k, and built a very nice cabin in the forest where its the best place ever. Thats my childhood home. I will do everything to protect it. Now back to the story, part i didnt mention was that my mom and dad were separated when i was around 3 ( i say separated because they werent married). My dad went to work in other country, and comes see me every month twice. After few years passed, when i was around 8 my mom met another guy, who was secretly a psychopath. They had a kid (my stepbrother) and today they are in court fighting for custody. Then, my mom got breast cancer. Situation cant get any worse, right? Guess what, we are running out of money, and because of my moms cancer she cant work. My dad pays 300$ a month, which is for clothes, and etc. And for my stepbrother, its around same. While my grandparents are paying for rent and food and everything else, and they are using savings which now we almost ran out of.

2nd Part of Part 2:
Recently i found out my mom has casino and has been borrowing money. Lmao, i swear it cant get any worse. She owes around 2k while we are barely fucking scraping by. I honestly dont know what to do. I just want my business to work out. Or whatever. Now, school is ending and on summer im working 15 hours straight every day while others are having fucking fun.

It would mean a lot to me if you read it all.

1l0zgai,Deciding between two jobs,"Background: I graduated about a year and a half ago magna cum laude with a degree in Computer Science from a large state school. I took a gap year after college to develop and release a video game I had started as a side project in college with some friends. It performed very well at first and had good revenue, but unfortunately lost momentum in the market and stopped being sustainable at the start of this year. 

Because of this, I spent the first part of this year looking for jobs in the games industry, made it to the final round at a few places after months of interviews (one of them was 6 rounds, one every week and a half), but ultimately fell short. After I exhausted all my options in the games industry, I expanded my search and have received two offers.

Offer one: SWE at a Fortune 500 defense contractor working on legacy low-level technology on a military base in a small town on the other side of the country, in the middle of nowhere. Pays 10k more, has more flexibility with the working hours, a few more days off, but is contingent on getting interim security clearance. I am worried about my ability to do this since I used marijuana about 10 times in college and purchased it once. It has been over 2 years since I last used it. I am also worried about moving to the small town and my ability to have a fulfilling social life in my 20s there. I also interned at a different defense contractor in college and didn't love it.

Offer two: A position as a consultant at an IT consulting firm that does MDM (master data management). It isn't software engineering, but it is fully remote. I could stay near friends and family if I took this role, and I also like the social aspect since I live 90 minutes away from the office and can attend social events. I am worried about my career prospects long term since I am more passionate about SWE, but I interned at this firm in college, and it is a very cool place to work. The pay is 10k less, but I can rent a place cheaply in my hometown, which would offset some of that. The thought of not working in a cubicle and also living in the city is very appealing. 

If I don't get interim clearance with the defense contractor, I will have a very hard time finding another job in this market. I studied game development and low-level programming in college and didn't touch anything web-dev related because it didn't interest me. I would have to spend a few months learning web development to be eligible for most of the jobs I've come across. This doesn't excite me. My mental health has already taken a huge hit in this job search, and I'm worried about having to continue it with no end in sight. If I go with the consulting firm, I am worried about my long-term career prospects if I don't find MDM interesting after a few years (or decide I hate consulting). I would like to eventually break into the games industry, either by joining a company or starting another studio, and would continue game development on the side regardless of where I go. Does anyone have any advice?

1l0zbkt,Torn Between Two Job Offers — Need Advice (Derm MA vs. Desk Job),"
Hey everyone, I could really use some advice.

I’ve been offered two different jobs and I’m feeling pretty torn between them. I have experience as a medical assistant (MA), and my original plan was to apply to PA school. But lately, I’ve been feeling burned out from working in clinical care, and I’ve recently started considering a career change — possibly pursuing a doctorate in psychology instead.

Here are the two offers:

1. Dermatology Medical Assistant Job
- Schedule: Monday–Thursday
- Location: Monday is 15–20 minutes from home, Tuesday–Thursday is about 35 minutes away
- Pay: $24/hr
- Perks: Full benefits + 50% off derm procedures after 3 months
-Role: Clinical setting, working directly with a PA
This aligns with my current experience — I’m used to being on my feet in CNA/MA roles

2. Desk Job (Non-Clinical)
- Schedule: Monday–Friday, 9–5
- Location: 15 minutes from home
- Pay: $26/hr, with potential to make an extra $1,000/month by being on call (just answering scheduling questions from home)
- Perks: No benefits
This would be my first desk job, and I’m unsure how I’d adjust to sitting all day

For context, I graduated last May with a Master of Science from Johns Hopkins, but I haven’t been able to find a job in my field since graduating. I’ve been taking lower-paying jobs just to get by. Ironically, this desk job is the highest-paying offer I’ve received so far here in Florida — even though it’s not related to my degree and doesn’t offer any benefits. That’s part of why I’m so conflicted.

The derm job feels more stable and familiar, with great benefits, but the commute is longer and I’m not sure I want to stay in clinical care long-term. The desk job pays more and might give me more mental space to work toward a new career path, but I’m nervous about the lack of benefits and the fact that I’ve never worked in an office setting before.

Would really appreciate any thoughts — especially from anyone who’s made a similar pivot or had to choose between short-term stability vs. long-term goals.",Successful-Ball-7293,1,1.0,0,1748810527,2025-06-01 20:42:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0zbkt/torn_between_two_job_offers_need_advice_derm_ma/,6,2025

Although they do have a nice bonus structure which I don’t have at all at my current job. But as always, bonuses aren’t promised. Should I counter offer for 135? I will say this is a very specialized role and they seemed very excited to give me an offer but I am just confused why they didn’t offer me what I initially asked for. I did already negotiate my start date to a later date due to a big trip I am taking.

During my time in college I tried to spend as much time as possible working on this novel because my plan was to be able to find an agent and get it published as soon as I finsihed school.

1l0yqhr,How to approach my next steps?,"So I've working for this IT consulting firm for 4y now. I have been executing activities above my job description since I joined the company. All my time here I work with the same customer, and manage the team, and also am the technical leader, I architect their systems and whenever I have some time left I develop as well.

Last year my bosses screw up and my yearly evaluation was 3 (Out of 5), which made me upset, as I had taken more and more responsabilities, got only excellent feeback and even an internal award with a little money prize. I raised this to my bosses told them I was expecting at least 4 and planned to used this to discuss a promotion, at that point they all got desperated, they knew they could afford to lose me and even though they ""tried"" to fix it, nothing came of it.

Well this year the same thing happened again, but this time I have even more responsability, an even bigger team and a customer who would freak out and possibly, although it's not guaranteed, drop the contract with my company if I leave.

When the rate came I immediately called my direct supervior and my project account manager to a discussion and basic laid into them, told them how I was feeling disrepected, the second year in a row they were screwing me, and basically said I was going to leave, they either get a promotion and at least a 15% by the end of the month (that was mid feb). 

They promised to promote me, start moving right away but took longer than that, in parallel I've looking for another job. They were always giving me updates in the hope of getting more time and finally at the end of May, last week the promotion and the raise came, only for me to learn that the raise is half of what I asked. 

My supervisor let slip that they increase how much they charge the customer for my work significantly more (I'm guess 40 or 50% more, but have no proof), which made me even more annoyed, not only they are again disrespecting but also making extra money on top of me. I know I wouldn't expect the increase to be 50% and for me to get a 50% raise, not my point. 

My point is, I want to leave, I'm looking for another job, but even working in IT, with so much uncertainty economy and AI wise, I'm not finding many positions that suit my skills, so I won't just up and leave before I have somethig else.

What I want advice is, I'm thinking on calling my point of contact with our customer and tell the truth, that I'm increrible unhappy with my company, I love work with them, and I'm thinking on leave due to the low raise, and inform everyone involve that I wish to reject my promotion and to be assign to activities on my job description which is to be a developer.

Thoughts? Advices?

Sorry for the long post, I guess I'm too annoyed with the whole situation and am ranting too much, I wrote a much longer post last night, but didn't post it, as I realized it was too long, too many details and probably no one would be interested, so this is my attemp at a shorter post.

1l0ymbq,Quitting the same job twice,"Hi,

I was originally with my company for about 3.5 years when I quit to be a stay at home mom with my second child. The understanding when I quit was that I would like to come back at some point. Then my second ended up having extremely bad colic. I got into a postpartum depression hole and asked to come back at around 8 months postpartum. I was welcomed back warmly, even with a raise. They were extremely accommodating with my desire to work part-time and from home (which isn't typical in my field). However, if I were to do it all over again I wouldn't have gone back so soon. My second is much easier now and I wish I had more time with my kids. I learned I was pregnant again shortly after I started. I went on maternity leave again 7 months after re-starting there, and I have 3 weeks left of my leave. I am considering not going back, but I truly love my company and the relationships I have there, and I don't want to let anyone down or leave them in the lurch. I also don't want to lose them as a positive reference. I feel like if I went back I would be doing it just for these reasons. I have no intention of trying to get re-hired there if I left because I understand they would not be able to view me as dependable.

  
My questions are, how bad would it be if I didn't go back after my leave (I am part time and don't receive any benefits through them so there would be nothing to pay back). If it's better for me to go back, how long would be reasonable before I could leave on good terms?

1l0y1qw,Do I still have any future at all in this company?,"So I've been working at this company for about 2 years. I have done fairly well and have always been in the top performing employees. 

My manager has always been very fond of me until recently, unexpectedly, she exploded on me in front of other employees. It wasn't about one particular big mistake, but just about how my standards had degraded for about 15 minutes. It came out of nowhere because previously she had always been complementing things (that were even a little personal sometimes) and avoided criticizing me as much as she could. She even treated me a little too well, I might say.  
  
Few moments after her crashing out, she told me she didn't mean any of it and didn't want to do it the way it happened at all. 

I was, however, already tired of the workplace for long and this was the nail in the coffin. I handled it with grace that day but it did mess me up and the next day I put in my two weeks. She tried a little to talk me out of it but then also seemed a little offended and just accepted it coldly as if ""You wanna go, huh? go then"". 

This is where I messed up. I was stupid and acted emotionally and then later asked her to cancel my resignation. She did and we continued like nothing ever happened. 

However, now I know that damage has been done. I'm the ""emotional/sensitive"" guy now who cannot be trusted with bigger roles because he can flip any moment and leave. 

Should I just move on and find something else now? I hate working there btw but I need time to find something, a few months.

1l0xg78,"Wasted a Year, Hate Sales, Dreaming of UX — Is It Too Late?","Hey Redditors,
So I graduated with a BCA in June 2024, and honestly, I was super lost career-wise. I had no idea what to do. But now I finally have some clarity—I know what skills I want to learn and the direction I want to go in.
I was planning to do an MCA this year, mostly just to delay getting a job. But due to some family issues, my mom told me to start working and at least cover my own expenses. The thing is, I don’t really have any solid skills right now, and yeah, I kinda wasted a year.
Now I’ll probably have to take up a sales and marketing job, even though I really don’t like that kind of work. At the same time, I’ve decided to learn UX Design through an online course. My plan is to work this job for 6 months, build up a strong UX portfolio on the side, and hopefully switch to a UX role after that.
But I’m honestly feeling super anxious. I’ve already lost a year, and now I’ll be stuck in a job I don’t enjoy. I’m scared that this path might hurt my chances when I apply for UX roles later. What if I never get out of sales and marketing?
Would really appreciate any advice or motivation from people who’ve been through something similar.

Graduated with BCA in 2024, wasted a year being lost career-wise. Was going to do MCA but now have to take a sales/marketing job due to family problems.

I'm a 39 years old professional, and i would love to get your perspective on 1 or 2 critical moves i could start, to boost my career.

My profile:

* a Master Degree in International Relations + various online certificates
* 20 years of experience in various tech verticals as a generalist project/product manager

Currently employed in a big company as a project lead, but i want to accelerate my career. I have a few goals:

* I'm in the gaming industry, where the opportunities seem limited, where the industry itself doesn't feel super mature, and where the salaries tend to be less high than in tech. I would love to be in a big tech company or rising startup, for projects and products serving more people.
* Reaching a Director and even VP and then exec levels of responsibilities and compensations
* Being less of a generalist, and having some deeper expertise, potentially in:
   * Data science: i love using metrics to help decision making and activate teams. i love visualizations. But i'm not super proficient at data collection and analysis, SQL/Python stuff, data programming & co. I like the idea of being better at those on those on paper, but not sure i would enjoy it, everytime i tried to learn programming like on codecademy, i dropped after a few weeks.
   * Tech in general: love talking to engineers, being a bridge between them and the rest of the teams. I'm usually good at helping them through asking the good questions. But i'm not super technical, so would love ""on paper"" to reach the next level in terms of ""full stack comprehesion"" (again, not sure i would enjoy it though)
   * AI, especially for applications in management, production, and creative industries

Request for advice: what are the top 1 or 2 strategic moves you would do? Think professionally (in my current job, or in another company), learning (taking more online courses? Perhaps taking another Master but more in tech, AI? my company might be able to fund a part of it), and any other aspects.

1l0vds6,Is change REALLY possible??,"I've spent nearly 5 years in the case management field, and lately, I've been reflecting on how I got here every morning as I start work. The daily routine has me contemplating leaving my job behind.

My caseload has recently increased to 36 clients, with five new cases added, and I'm feeling burnt out. The work is repetitive and emotionally draining, juggling treatment plans, notes, trackers, and individual client needs. It's made me question the purpose of it all, especially considering that my job in New York doesn't cover my basic needs. Despite this, I'm constantly pushed to do more by clients, additional providers, and higher-ups.

I've been exploring new career paths since this wasn't my planned field after graduation. I'm interested in transitioning into marketing or project management, as I believe I have the transferable skills and technical knowledge to excel in either area. However, it's been a struggle to get noticed by recruiters. I find myself tailoring 1000 resumes and cover letters daily, but I receive no response.

I'm seeking advice from anyone who has successfully pivoted out of case management. Do you have any tips on making a career change or recommendations for courses that might aid in my journey? I feel like I'm running behind on this pivot, but I refuse to lose hope and remain stuck",ExpressionCreepy6669,2,1.0,3,1748800773,2025-06-01 17:59:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0vds6/is_change_really_possible/,6,2025

My only problem is that I'm unsure of the course that I picked: International Relations. I always feel ashamed when I have to tell people what I picked, and from what I heard, IR is pretty shit in the job market, and working in the UN (which is my primary goal) is allegedly very bad, as in the working conditions are bad and you need to live in underdeveloped countries as part of your career. My other goal is to just get a job in my country's govt and secure a pension lol. I don't really want to go into politics cuz its not very safe/its polarizing, and I understand IR is just that, but I genuinely want to make a good difference in the world, especially climate change (green politics), so that was partially my reason for choosing IR. The other reason is that I'm really good at/LOVE humanities, especially history, and my STEM is kinda weaker in comparison, so there's no point in me going for medicine or engineering if I'm barely passing HL physics. Realistically, I don't think I could change anything at the moment anyway, but I'd like some honest to god advice if I made the right choice or not. I want to be able to have a stable career with a good income, but I'm not really educated in careers and the job market, so I don't know what degrees are versatile or genuinely useful. I don't want to waste three years of my life on a purely theoretical degree with no practical impact.

1l0u1fa,Would it be worth it to get a masters in finance if I have an undergrad in CS,"Hi guys, so Last year I completed my undergraduate degree in Business Computing, which combined business and computer science, but I realised the tech side of it just is not for me. Coding, debugging, and technical work left me feeling drained and disconnected. I tried looking into non-coding roles in tech like support or compliance, but nothing truly clicked or felt like the right fit. Over time, I have become more interested in finance, especially roles like retail banking, client service, compliance, and wealth management support. I enjoy structured environments, working with people, and solving real-world problems through communication and logic.

The challenge is that I do not have a background in finance or strong work experience in the field. I am considering doing a Masters in Finance  to build a proper foundation and improve my chances of starting a career in the industry. I am not aiming for investment banking, just something that aligns with my strengths and gives me space to grow long term. Do you think pursuing a Masters is the right move in this case, or is there a better path I should consider?

1l0tbe4,Should I leave my current internship for a better one?,"Hi all, I’m currently two months into an internship at a very small, niche company with no LinkedIn presence and a long commute. There’s no real mentorship, but I’ve taken on a lot of responsibility, including leading a system migration and automating internal processes. They’ve verbally offered me a full-time role after the internship, and I have four months left. On top of that, they’re getting half my wages subsidized through a government program, so I know it would be hard for them to replace me.

On Friday, I got an offer from a much bigger, well-known company. It comes with slightly better pay, a shorter commute, two days of remote work, and structured mentorship. It’s everything I’ve been hoping for and aligns better with my long-term goals.

I’m really torn. I feel guilty leaving after everything I’ve contributed, especially knowing they invested in me and want me to stay. But I also know the new role would likely help me grow more and look stronger on my resume. The only thing holding me back is the lack of a return offer guarantee at the new place.

1l0rrka,Considering AAPC Certification While Finishing My MBA — Worth It?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently finishing up my MBA and have been working in a hospital for about a year. I started as a unit secretary in the mother/baby unit and recently got promoted to a role titled Clinical Project Coordinator. Realistically, what I do now is sort incoming faxes, manage referrals for certain departments/physicians, and schedule new patients.

When I started my MBA, I didn’t have a strong direction — I just knew I wanted to open up more opportunities for myself. Now I’m seriously considering getting certified through AAPC for the CPC/CPB program. I’d have to take out a small loan to cover the cost, but I don’t have many other bills and the monthly payments would be manageable.

The ROI seems solid based on what I’ve seen, especially since I already have some exposure to healthcare workflows, referrals, and scheduling. But I wanted to hear from people who are actually in the field:
Was it worth it for you to get certified through AAPC?
How hard was it to get your first coding/billing job?
Is demand for these jobs really as strong as people say?
Any tips for someone making a transition from a hospital admin background?

I am considering doing a t-level in animal care and management (as that is my ultimate dream) and possibly an apprenticeship, but i know this career path is extremely difficult and underpaid. 

I want to know people's opinions if I should do the t-level and risk it, or if I should just try in a-levels, or if I should pick a different t-level/apprenticeship.

My only problem is that no other t-level appeals to me as they are aimed towards people with lower grades whereas the t-level I want requires at least grade 5s in I think 4 or 5 different subjects (where I am predicted 7s and 8s)

Also, I'm not sure how useful t-levels are in comparison to a-levels. It is said that a t-level is equivalent to 3 a-levels, although I feel as though universities will always favor a-levels so I worry that I would struggle getting into a university where I could continue any sort of animal studies.

I haven't really got a specific job in mind (as I know this is a large field) but honestly I just want something that pays a decent salary and includes working with animals (wether that be cleaning up faeces or being face to face with animals, I really don't care!)

1l0pe2e,Need advice: Should I join a 17 LPA startup dev role or a 3.6 LPA service-based job?,"Hey everyone, I’m a 21-year-old recent graduate, and I’m currently stuck between two very different job offers from my campus placements. I’d really appreciate some honest advice from people who’ve been in similar situations or are already in the industry.

Offer 1: Service-Based MNC (3.6 LPA CTC)

This offer is from a well-known service-based MNC that hires in bulk. The role is titled System Engineer. Initially, there’s a training period of 4–6 months outside of a place where I live, where I’ll be paid a stipend of ₹16–17k per month. After training, the salary increases to ₹25k per month.

The company provides accommodation during training and I’ve heard the campus is great. After training, I’ll be posted to a location like Hyderabad, Bangalore, or Pune — not confirmed yet. Work hours are 9 to 5, five days a week. However, there’s a chance of late onboarding, delayed offer letters, and even being kept on the bench without projects for a while. Growth is slow, and transitioning into a proper development role might take time.

Offer 2: US-Based Startup (17 LPA CTC)

This company is a US-based startup offering a Software Developer role. The total CTC is 17 LPA, with 9 LPA fixed and the rest distributed as variable pay, bonuses, and stock options. The role starts with a 6-month internship. For the first 3 months, the stipend is ₹10k per month, then ₹15k per month for the next 2, and finally, all pending stipend plus the last month’s ₹30k is paid at the end of the internship. This is a retention tactic so interns don’t quit early.

There’s no physical office yet. The work environment is remote, fast-paced, and reportedly hectic. The work hours are from 10 am to 11 pm, including Saturdays. There’s no established culture or structure. On the plus side, even if leaves are canceled due to workload, they don’t deduct pay.

One concern is that when this company previously visited our campus, only one student from that batch is still with them. The rest resigned. That track record is a bit concerning and makes me wonder if I’ll be able to survive the pressure.

About Me

I’ve spent the last few years learning and working on full-stack development. My skill set includes full stack development, RestfulAPIs, little knowledge about cloud and devops and problem solving through DSA.

I enjoy coding, building projects, and problem-solving, but it's not something that I am particularly obsessed with, if given a task I'll do it. My long terms goals are still uncertain but I can see myself growing in this field.

At the same time, I come from a family where financial support matters. I want to contribute to my family’s expenses, help with my sister’s education, give back to my parents, and maybe even get married by 24–25. I live in an independent house and dream of adding a new floor to it within a few years.

My Dilemma

The first offer is safe and stable but slow in growth and low in pay. The second one is risky, demanding, and intense, but the starting point is much higher. If I manage to stay in the startup for 1–1.5 years, I feel like I’ll have much better offers lined up afterward due to the higher base and dev role experience.

But the fear is — what if I can’t handle the stress or workload? What if the company isn’t stable and I’m left with burnout and no fallback? On the other hand, if I take the service-based job, it might take 2–3 years just to reach the level I’d already start at in the startup.

TL;DR
Should I join a 3.6 LPA safe job in a service-based company where growth is slow but stable, or take a 17 LPA software developer role at a startup that’s intense and fast-paced but offers high pay and experience early on? Long-term goal is to become a strong software engineer and financially support my family.

1l0o15n,"Job Offer Help: $7K less but remote, better company/culture, new industry. Should I make the jump?","Hello! I’d love some outside perspective as I weigh a recent job offer.

# Background:

I just received an offer from a very well known Fortune 150 company with excellent Glassdoor reviews and a strong financial position. The role is fully remote (confirmed with the hiring manager), with about 10% travel, mostly optional visits to HQ. I'd need to be onsite for one week during each of the first 3 months for onboarding, but after that, it’s completely remote with some supplier visits (which I do in my current role).

The offer is for an individual contributor ""Lead"" role in a business function like Finance/Procurement/Ops. No direct reports, but a lot of visibility and potential to grow internally.

# Current Job:

* Company is financially unstable and not operationally strong
* No clear growth or advancement opportunities
* In office **4 days a week**, which I find draining since I do not work with many people in the office and even in the office we use Teams calls instead of meeting in-person
* Medium workload (only \~4 hours of real work a day) and lowish stress
* Best boss I have had in my career, which makes it hard to walk away, however, he's on the way to retirement within a year or two

# New Offer:

* $7K less in base salary, but I’m personally financially secure so it’s not a dealbreaker (will try to negotiate, but they seemed pretty firm on salary). Salary is still very good ($100K+) and I live in a medium cost of living area
* Slightly higher bonus % (in my current role we get the floor of the bonus due to company financial struggles)
* Fully remote, with occasional HQ and supplier travel (\~10%)
* Unlimited PTO; and they actually encourage people to use it (per interviews and Glassdoor reviews)
* Strong Glassdoor reviews and employee satisfaction
* Breaks me out of my current industry. I’ve only worked in one industry my whole career, so this opens up new networks and growth paths
* Much more financially stable and better-run company (Fortune 150)

I know I'm giving up a cushy, lower stress job, but it's a dead end in terms of career growth. The new offer is a slight step down in pay, but possibly a step up in career growth, quality of life, culture, and opportunity.

Also as a note, I've dealt with cancer three times the past three years (should be cured now) so being in an office four days a week seems like it's a complete waste to my life, and I'm also very involved with extracurricular activities and have a large social circle.

1l0nuk1,MNC to UPSC to AI Startup – MS/MBA or Join Family Real Estate Business?,"29M. Graduated in IT from a Tier 2 engineering college in 2018. Worked 2 years in an MNC, then went all-in on UPSC—gave 5 attempts, reached the interview stage twice, but didn’t clear.

Currently working at a tech-first AI startup to gain experience and rebuild my profile. The idea is to eventually pursue an MS/MBA from a top university with a strong story.

Meanwhile, my father runs a small real estate business—unstructured but with decent (though inconsistent) revenue. He’s asking me to join and scale it up into something more formal and sustainable.

I’m torn between:

Continuing on the startup + MS/MBA path

Or joining the family business and building something big from the ground up


Would really appreciate thoughts from people who’ve faced similar crossroads. How should I decide? Is real estate worth betting on?

1l0njvu,Mechanical Engineering Student Thinking About Becoming a Doctor and Feeling Lost,"Hi everyone,

I just finished my third year of mechanical engineering and tomorrow I start an internship as a thermal engineering intern at a semiconductor company. I'm 21 and have about a 1.5 years left of school.

Since January of this year, I haven't been able to stop thinking about the possibility of pursuing a career in medicine. At first, I thought it was just ""an itch"", but it's June now and the feeling hasn't gone away. I watch videos of medical procedures and conditions late at night, my Instagram feed is full of ""day in the life a doctor"" videos, and I am constantly thinking about it.

I feel so confused. I don't know if this is just another phase for me because when I started college, I was studying civil engineering but switched after feeling like I didn't belong. I did a lot of research before switching to mechanical engineering after my first year. I talked to a faculty advisor for mechanical engineering, my uncles (who are also mechanical engineers), and I did so much research on the possible career paths that mechanical engineering has to offer. The career path that stood out to me was biomedical engineering. 

Now don't get me wrong, I really like mechanical engineering but something inside of me is telling me to do medicine. I feel so conflicted and lost. I know becoming a doctor is not easy and I'm aware that it will take a lot of work but I can't seem to get this idea out of my head. I don't know what is drawing me to becoming a doctor but I need to get this off my chest. 

When I switched from civil to mechanical engineering, everyone around me like my friends, boyfriend, and family were very supportive. But when I bring up the idea of going into medicine, they seem unsure or hesitant.

I'm just feeling so conflicted and lost. I needed to get this off my chest. Has anyone else gone through something similar?

P.S. It's currently past 5 a.m. where I'm from and I'm still up thinking about this lol.",Funny_Personality372,3,1.0,3,1748780223,2025-06-01 12:17:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0njvu/mechanical_engineering_student_thinking_about/,6,2025

One thing I’m really trying to get better at is expressing my needs or concerns in the workplace — whether it’s asking for support, clarifying expectations, setting boundaries, or giving upward feedback.

I often hesitate because I don’t want to come off as complaining, difficult, or overly sensitive. But staying silent also leads to frustration or burnout.

So:

* How do you approach difficult or honest conversations at work?
* Any phrases, mental models, or frameworks that help you speak up clearly?
* How do you balance being assertive while still sounding professional?
* Was there a moment when expressing yourself really changed your work life?

1l0ie4o,How should i handle a manager from another team keeps criticizing me?,"I joined my current department 8 months ago, and it has three teams: A, B, and C. I’m part of Team A and report to Manager A. About two months ago, Manager B (from Team B) started sitting near our team and has been repeatedly commenting on my work in the office and in the meeting where everyone is there, even though I don’t report to him. 

Some examples:
	1.	He criticizes my working hours (I once came in around 9:30am and leave around 4:30pm). My direct manager is okay with this as long as I get my work done. Manager B said I didn’t work for 8 hrs a day.
	2.	He points out minor issues, like when I’ve finished a task but haven’t moved it to a final sheet yet.
	3.	In a team meeting, when I outlined my tasks for the week, he interrupted to say, “We’re talking about the steps,” even though I was doing just that.


My boss who’s managing the whole department said Manager B would lead the whole department in future. And my manger A said he didn’t think so.

Has anyone dealt with something similar? How would you approach this?

I had a rough December and beginning of the year. I was constantly getting sick back to back and snow storms prevented me from  traveling safely to work. I had a good stretch in March and April where I went everyday, however at the beginning of May I just hit a big wall of burnout thanks to my co-worker not being a team player and pushing all shared responsibilities on to me. I had reached a point where the weekend simply was not enough of a mental break and called out sick for three days, and when I came back I was fired at the end of the work day.

1l0fv3o,Which would be the optimal opportunity?,"So I’ve completed interviews with 2 companies both needing a builder/strategic person in the seat to help with their forecasted expansion. Everyone that I’ve met with have been fine and I can see myself working with them.

Company 1
The pro is that it’s in a stable industry and closer to home, but the total compensation is lower than what I discussed with the recruiter at the beginning (seems like their negotiation is to low ball me (last discussion) and during the interview process, the salary band has been changed twice each time with a lower max). Not the most positive experience. 

Company 2
Awaiting on the offer, but the opportunity was originally wfh until the new CEO joined and is will implement a hybrid schedule which is over an hour commute each way (I planned to stay in a hotel during those days). The total compensation should be a lot higher than company 1. 

Right now, I’m able to freely live anywhere and can work any schedule (company 1 is 5 days in office). I probably would relocate for company 2 soon which would make me further away from my family. The dilemma is that I help support them for various reasons. My plan was to buy a home nearby company 1 since it’s closer to my family and friends.

I’ve been going back and forth on what would make the most sense. I understand I won’t truly know until I actually work in the environment, but the other factors buying a place, being closer to family are factors I’m considering.

I have about 12 years experience in various customer service, tech support, and IT roles (pretty much just helpdesk with some networking exp).

People tell me to get some certs but there are so many I dont even know what direction to go in.

She is a big spender so usually just goes right into another contract, but I am not so would utilize this time to go on fun adventures. I dont think im cut out for nursing but have done some research and came up with a list of similarly flexible roles. I will list them below and am looking for insight from anyone who works or has worked one of these jobs. Or just any general insight that might be helpful. Thanks!

  
X-ray tech - healthcare field with monthly contracts. Less bodily fluids involved than with nursing.

Truck driver - might have to put a year in but then could become and owner operator and schedule my own trips.

Merchant marine - get to explore the world and work 2-3 months at a time with lots of OT.

Forest firefighter - have a friend that does this and enjoys it. Works 6 months a year with lots of OT.

Contract IT - this is very broad but I could be open to it as long as it is more hands on for a specific project.

Insurance - I forget exactly what the job title is but they travel alot, usually to areas where there has been some sort of incident or disaster and assess claims for damaged property.

Teacher - not sure how good I would be at this, especially teaching young kids, but could teach english and travel doing that.



Please let me know what you think or if you know of any other jobs that might fit this criteria. Thanks",seant4864,2,1.0,6,1748738692,2025-06-01 00:44:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0c7jv/possible_career_change_list_of_ideas_and_looking/,6,2025
1l0bzen,Has anyone worked as a Field Service Engineer or something similar as a career?,"If so, I was wondering what the working environment is like, or scheduling; what the typical working hours are per week. The job post advertise overtime and weekend when necessary with 50% travelling. It is advertised $80,000-$130,000 in salary. I feel like there’s a catch that if I ask the bare minimum or at least $90,000, they got themselves a bargain with the amount of overtime hours of work they may not want to disclose. My gut instinct tells me to ask for max salary $130,000 full benefits with 1 month vacation. Keep in mind, a director from a bigger company reached out to me by email from connections who is really impressed and interested in hiring me due to my 6 years of knowledge and experience maintaining, troubleshooting and testing equipments, familiar with all models even from their company who manufactures it. I work with a much smaller sized company making less than $60,000 with full benefits and 1 month vacation. It’s smaller salary at my current job but I really enjoy the stress free environment, managing my time, working at my own pace, flexible hours, having time to do what I love as a hobby and interest outside of work, and spend more with family and friends.

1l0bkpy,At a lost for what to do in regards to a career change,"Hello to all,

First, excuse me for being vague, my current job is semi-public facing, and I have worked with thousands of students, many of which I have occasionally seen post their personal work on Reddit.

A little backstory, in 2019, I graduated from High School and began working for a local company as a contractor. The company's staff is incredibly small (only 5/6 people at any given moment). When I began working, I was making on average around $14 an hour after taking into account my costs associated with completing the work (mainly travel). Since then, I have earned my Bachelor's degree in Film, and my pay has increased to around $72,000 USD a year. Now I'm at a crossroads:

While I do enjoy a lot of the work I do, there are very difficult times. For example, this week I put in about 35 hours in 3 days, and worked about 54 hours this week alone. There is a lot of internal turmoil regarding focus, many times I will be pulled from one project to work on another, only to get reprimanded for not being able to complete the original in a timely manner as well. Due to being a contractor, I do not receive any OT and only get sent a monthly salary check. I am NOT complaining about my pay, I believe I make great money for the work I do, my real issue having to work so many hours straight. If I ever bring this up, I am just told that that is what is expected of me and the reason I get paid what I do... but honestly, I'd rather take a pay cut than work another 18-hour+ physical work shift. The work isn't very difficult, but most of it does require a lot of technical knowledge, which is a mix of public and internal information. It can be physical, resulting in me being both outdoors and indoors constantly, and traveling around my county (I drove north of 25k miles in 2024 just for work). I don't have a written or exact contract, .but my boss is expecting me to stay with him until the end of the calendar year (I could leave early at the end of August). Or even modify my involvement for the remainder of the year. Now, I'm looking for a change.

I would love to go back to school and get a degree in computer science, It's a subject that I experimented with when I was younger and took a few classes while I was still in college, which I did fairly well in. I attempted to get a minor in the subject, but my counselor denied my request to do it (the school I went to did NOT allow students to take more than 4 years to complete their degree unless they had an extreme circumstance). From what I've seen, the master's programs around me require a degree in the subject or a similar subject,t already preventing me from even applying. I love solving puzzles and figuring out solutions; that's what drove me to my current job today. I'm not sure where to look or find my opportunities. I keep feeling like I failed by going into filmmaking. I still live at home and get belittled by my mother constantly, and she expresses to me that she believes I'm a failure.

Any advice?",TheYdna,2,1.0,2,1748736699,2025-06-01 00:11:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1l0bkpy/at_a_lost_for_what_to_do_in_regards_to_a_career/,6,2025
