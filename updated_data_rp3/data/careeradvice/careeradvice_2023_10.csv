17kz5pg,I want to build websites for independent healthcare clinics and professionals. What would be the best way to do this?,"My previous job required me to work with healthcare professionals and work on our clinics website. I enjoyed the work a lot and got the idea to start my own business. 

I don’t have any knowledge of coding and most of my experience comes from website builders like WordPress and Squarespace. I come from a design background, so I am able to build pages that match with my client’s vision. 

To start I would reach out to previous doctors I’ve worked with and visit local clinics that have outdated websites.

17kxcre,Degree for Environmental/Sustainability Business jobs?,"My thoughts: I have always enjoyed the idea of eco-entrepreneurship, but as we all know, that's a long shot. So I figured working in a similar space as a consultant, strategist, researcher, auditor, or director would be a good spot to at least start. 

Getting a dual degree in environmental science and business would take much longer than I would like (I'm switching out of electrical engineering almost half way through). So I figured I have to pick between the two. I can get a quantitive analysis (business) degree and take the core curriculum requirements behind an environmental science degree, but then on my resume I could only show a degree in quantitive analysis and I'd have to explain my background in environmental sciences (my college does not offer a related associates or minor). I could also get the QA degree and pair it with a ""undergraduate studies major"" (build your own major) and claim I specialized in environmental science economics. Or, of course, I can get an environmental science degree. Either way, I plan on getting an MBA, but don't know if the undergrad degree will hurt my future prospects after the MBA. Will they care about my undergrad if I have an MBA? What would employers want to see? Should I just get an environmental science degree?

...I'm worried about the low pay and career ceiling on environmental science careers, so I'm worried about getting an undergraduate in it.",Peanut-Rickey,1,1.0,0,1698791604,2023-10-31 22:33:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kxcre/degree_for_environmentalsustainability_business/,10,2023

1. I would like to travel (I know its not vacation).
2. I love science and tech but don't enjoy theoretical or abstract uses of math.
3. I naturally gravitate and excel in leadership positions.
4. I would prefer that my work does something to help the world in one way or another.
5. I enjoy having my time structured (this is what I consider positive stress, I work well under it).
6. My biggest strength is my creativity, I would have been an artist in another life (or this one, who knows).
7. I tend to enjoy focusing on big ideas, but can still find myself to be fastidious with details
8. I am money motivated (unfortunately... this one causes the most problems in relation to the others).

17kx1y2,Possible industry switch advice?,"
Hi! So I (22F) have been going through an internal debate for the past few weeks now. I graduated college in April and was fortunate to have a great job lined up and started in early June. I work in health policy and I make about $57k (mentioning only bc finances are a big factor).

Fast forward ~5 months and I really don’t like my job. It’s very monotonous and not intellectually stimulating (for example, my daily tasks include putting random stuff in excel, ad hoc project management stuff, and sitting in random meetings taking notes for half the day). I also work from home, so I find it hard to connect to coworkers. I also tend to get distracted at home. But, I live 1.5 hours from the closest office so going in isn’t really feasible for me. So, in turn, my mental health has not been the best. I get that I won’t love every job, especially my first, but getting up and working is so painful.

The only reason I’m in this industry is because I had no idea what I wanted to do in school. I was originally a bio major but switched to health administration. I’ve always been really interested in science and health/medical related things, but am a little squeamish with things like wounds (so no nursing haha). I also have a pretty good career path laid out in front of me in terms of salary, assuming I would get my MPH, but that honestly sounds awful to me. 

I’ve been thinking about going back for a MS in occupational therapy. My mom is an OT and really likes it, which is why I’m thinking about doing that. It also is medical, but not ~super~ medical like a doctor if that makes sense? But at this point, I don’t know if the benefits outweigh the cost. The MSOT would cost anywhere from 50-100k, depending on where I went and cost of living expenses. I probably wouldn’t be able to keep a regular, well paying job due to fieldwork and courseload. Sorry for the super long post, any advice? Should I stick with health policy and maybe just look for other jobs? Any advice is appreciated, I just feel so lost.",Ltf1213,1,1.0,1,1698790790,2023-10-31 22:19:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kx1y2/possible_industry_switch_advice/,10,2023

17kvg1q,Would you recommend a coworker who underperformed?,"In May, we hired a junior Analyst for our team. The onboarding process lasted 3 months, during which we noted she had a hard time with some software engineering concepts, and took her a while to finish basic tasks.

For the following three months she didn’t improved. We gave her a 2-month training plan (extra) to get her up to speed. However, last week, she submitted her resignation letter, explaining she didn’t feel she has the talent to keep working with us.

To be honest, she indeed struggled a lot with the job. She delivered several tickets late, and messed up with some clients. I think her biggest issue was she does not have attention to detail, and lacks creativity to solve data analytics problems.

Today she asked me for a recommendation letter, which at the beginning I was okay with. After thinking about it for a while, though, I don’t feel comfortable recommending her without knowing what job she intends to apply to.

17ktt7k,Lost and demotivated. Finished in life?,"

I’m feeling very scared. I feel like I’m lagging behind so much in life. I started working at 21 and today I’m 24, in the last 3years, I have seen no growth in my life, professional or personal. I’m only going down. I don’t have a plan, my health is at its worst, I don’t feel any motivation at all. I opened LinkedIn today after months and I swear I don’t compare myself with anyone but today I did. I felt so lost that I’m not doing anything in my life. 

Im depressed, nothing concrete is happening since the past 3years and I’m so exhausted. I don’t feel the energy to even walk for 10meters. I feel suffocated and trapped. I’m about to be 25 and I have done absolutely nothing in my life. And whatever I’m doing right now, I don’t enjoy it at all. I earn a decent amount of money, finances aren’t an issue but it does not make me feel content for some reason. Deep down I do want more money, and I don’t want to be a corporate slave. 

I have been thinking about UPSC and a Masters/PhD abroad if the former doesn’t work out but I just can’t study. And I have been a topper most of my life. So studying long hours hasn’t been an issue in the past. But I have become so lazy and I procrastinate so much. I haven’t felt more lost and demotivated in life. I just lie on my bed throughout the day. I feel disgusted by myself. Some degree of self loathe has developed. Im aware that there’s a lot to be grateful for in my life, to a little extent I’m privileged, but somehow even that is not working. 

I WFH and my family is dysfunctional since my childhood. I’m so saturated with the fights that the moment I listen to an argument at home, I just go to my bed and don’t feel like coming out. My parents are also extremely disappointed in me and that furthers demotivates me. I don’t know how do I get my life back on track. I don’t feel good at all. I just feel like running away. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and was on medication and therapy for the same but with doctor’s consultation have quit it because I was experiencing side effects like memory loss, bulimic tendencies etc.

17kpms4,How to navigate an alliance where I feel there is little trust?,"I’m looking for advice on navigating a current work relationship.

Myself and R are at the same managerial level at work, and we run different areas of the same department. 

My boss wants us to stay aligned on decisions. 

I’ve recently loss trust in R due to them agreeing and being aligned with my decisions during our private conversations, but then publicly disagreeing with the decisions in a group meeting, which I went into thinking they had my back.

I’ve raised it to my boss, and their advice has been to work on communication.

R’s communication style is generally sending passive aggressive group messaging and emails about things they want to know more about or disagree with, rather than coming direct.  I don’t like this communication style as I feel I need to defend myself in the group response, rather than just being able to collaborate and discuss it, if they had come direct.

Should I have a conversation with R directly about the loss of trust, and my dislike to the communication style? Or could this potentially cause more disrupt? Should I ignore them, and continue focusing on getting my projects done?

Any advice on how to navigate moving forward?",cassie70007,1,1.0,0,1698771274,2023-10-31 16:54:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kpms4/how_to_navigate_an_alliance_where_i_feel_there_is/,10,2023
17kpio0,My job makes me want to die (Context I’m 24 turning 25.),"I have the most normal 9 to 5 job. I graduated from a top university with a HR degree within Bachelor of Arts. I only chose HR because I didn’t wanna graduate with no job. I only went to university because with my Asian background, not having a top university degree pretty much means you are a failure. The only thing I liked about university was philosophy classes and ethics classes. 

For some context, I grew up Asian and if doing something you are actually good at means art/music/dance, your parents will try to kill themselves in front of you. Not to be dramatic but my family pretty much threatened me when I already had abandonment issues to not pursue music/dance even though that was my one and only passion my whole life. 

Here’s the kicker. I immigrated to America by myself when I turned 15 because I couldn’t stand my unstable home environment and I have adhd which gave me severe depression and compulsive suicidality. I got bullied in school and teachers hated me so my self esteem was already 0. This made my life hell in so many ways and it didn’t help that I got abused all throughout my teenage years as a young immigrant. 

I somehow managed to graduate on time and now I am 10 months into my full time job. I pretty much want to die and I have no enjoyment in this job. I make 55k which gives me couple hundred bucks a month after I spend it on essentials and expenses. If I quit my job, I won’t have enough savings to last more than a month, (I was also consistently investing for retirement for some time so it’s not cuz I’m a compulsive spender).

My boyfriend whom I met 5 months into my full time job, is very work oriented and unintentionally makes side comments like “art doesn’t pay the bills”. Etc etc. I love him very much and don’t want him to know how depressed I am.

I’m not saying I will immediately quit my job and pursue my creative career, especially because I barely got to spend any of my energy working on my talent the past 10 years because I was too busy being depressed and suicidal. But when I was young and naive, I never had stage fright and I used to perform any chance I got, and people really thought I would grow up to be a singer/dancer.

Now what do I do???? I need a coach or a mentor. Not a therapist. I got therapy for 5 years. I need to change my life not just cope hoping I won’t wanna die tomorrow. 

P.s. My adhd absolutely kills me. Even though I take medication for it, after work I am completely burnt out and stuck in bed until the next day alarm rings. Weekends are spent with boyfriend because he makes me feel better and forget about my depression. I also have thyroiditis so I only have like 10 minutes a day when I’m not either (1) working (2)commuting (3) doing chores (4) in bed - absolutely exhausted and burnt out.

I don’t want to make excuses and I want to do something to escape my job and improve my mental health. But I don’t know how and I feel stuck.

Hello all, I am a 24F and I have two associate’s degree: 1) Science Laboratory Technology in Biotechnology concentration 2) Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT)I love the idea of working in a laboratory but after transitioning into the medical and hospital setting I quickly realized it’s not for me. It’s so stressful, no work-life balance, not really good pay, and I am burnt out. I’ve only been working for 9 months in the MLT field, graduated last December and took the board exam and all… and now after working in TWO different Laboratory settings (Hospital lab and privately owned lab) I do not think this is for me. Even though I love the science aspect, the toxic  environments and poor management, and having to babysit machinery that we rely on for everything, it’s too much. I feel like it’s too soon for me to want out. My job now sucks because I don’t have any benefits besides health insurance. I have no clue what to do from here. I was going to do a bridge program to get my BS in MLT but I dropped out from the last prereq courses because I figured that I was wasting my money and time on a degree that I don’t want to use. Healthcare isn’t for me. I’ve tried career quizzes but they all say different things.
The only other things I would do is Permanent MakeUp  or being a Teacher grades 1-5???  
I have done freelance makeup during my high school years and college to help pay for my expenses. I don’t have any social media and don’t want any so that won’t help me grow a business if I wanted to go into microblading or cosmetology. I do love working with children and I’ve been told it would suit me. But my husband works for the school board and he sees how different the kids are nowadays. Maybe I won’t have thick enough skin for it? 

I feel like I wasted so much time. I feel like a failure. I feel stuck. 

Now as a soon to be mom, I want to be able to be with my baby and be there for him. In the current field I am in, I don’t have a life. Your life becomes your job. I don’t want that. 

Any insight or advice would help. Thank you.",Silly-Car-1088,1,1.0,0,1698769568,2023-10-31 16:26:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kp09m/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,10,2023
17kowjn,Wanting to switch jobs but feeling stuck due to future maternity leave eligibility.,"I've been in my current job for over a year now, so I'm eligible to take maternity leave. My company provides 18-20 weeks. From my understanding, it is paid as long as you have PTO and then once that runs out, it is unpaid unless you manage to get on STD. 

I currently get 30 PTO days a year, 12 holidays, and am hourly at $22/hr with no bonuses (starting pay, no raises yet). The job I'm looking at is pretty similar to what I'm doing but pays $26/hr + annual bonus, has 10 holidays, 22 PTO days, and 4 weeks of fully paid maternity leave. 

Obviously, 4 weeks is not enough time. But I'd trade 8 PTO days for a higher base pay + bonus. I feel stuck because even if I left now, I'd have to wait 12 months to be eligible again and then it would only be 4 weeks. I'm planning on having kids sometime in the next 1-2 years.

17kospw,"Starting to dislike my job and looking for a change, any advice?","Two things I’m looking for advice for, short-term and long-term.

Short term: I currently am working for my city doing grant work. Job involves a lot of boring tasks and documents i don’t care about. I’ve worked here for a year and 3 months and the first year was pretty good and I wasn’t bored of the work. Last three months have been pretty tough, difficult for me to start and finish tasks, find motivation to get things done, generally bored and understimulated. As a result, I’m pretty behind on my work and it has become a fairly significant stressor in my life. For context I have ADHD and a very hard time getting tasks done when I’m not very stimulated by them. Also a huge procrastinator and tend to avoid problems. Also have depression and it has been flaring up a lot recently. Is this reason enough to start looking for a new job? Everything else is great and gives me no reason to leave, coworkers, benefits, pay, schedule, etc. I’m just feeling burnt out by this job and am starting to feel like I want to avoid it and run. This is the second time I’ve felt like this (had a previous, worse job for 3 months and quit for similar reasons).

Long-Term: I’m looking for something that can potentially stimulate me enough to stay around for awhile. I have a Bachelors in Economics and Finance. I am exceptional at math and want to have some sort of job based around crunching numbers all day. I thought my current job would be more math based but it is not. I have pretty good social/communication skills but am starting to hate people lol so not ideal to have to interact with people super often. I’ve thought a lot about potential career options but nothing sounds super appealing/realistic. Have considered financial analyst (most boring likely), fantasy sports analyst (not sure if this exists or is viable), math teacher (no education degree), something in investments/portfolio management (generally scummy jobs from interview/your experience), and have even thought about going back to school to become a therapist/counselor (I do love helping people and have basically been a therapist to numerous friends for years). Are any of these options realistic? Are there other jobs I don’t know about that might fit my math-focused/ADHD personality?

In short term and long term just feeling very stuck and do not know where to go. Any advice or sharing of experiences would be super helpful to me.

17kor7f,Is quitting the new job too soon considered a red flag for future employers?,"Hello everyone!

I am currently in the situation where I have two secured job offers.

One is considering starting soon, a job that I like, with a really low pay, and the other is well-payed ""dream"" job of mine which would start in 6 months. 

But since the dream job is 6 months apart (and probably not 100% stable because in 6 months many things could happen), I would like to start doing the low payed job for a couple of months (to earn some money) and then leave that company for my dream job.

Is this kind of action considered a red flag in CV? I mean leaving a company after just 2 months or so for a better offer. 

For me personally it feels like ""using"" the first company and I feel a bit bad about this but would love to ask for your oppinion and experience on this.

I wouldn't consider it toxic in any way. I just hate the work and get no satisfaction out of it, and I've felt this way since the beginning.

The sedentary office job life just is not for me. I can't imagine how it's for anyone. The way my body feels is unreal -- I'm literally in the worst shape of my adult life, and I'm pushing obesity for the first time in 8 years. And even though the workplace isn't toxic, I feel so mentally drained that I can't enjoy any of the creative stuff I used to enjoy. It truly makes me wonder what the point is if I can't enjoy my passions anymore. 

Idk how any of you are working boring, sedentary corporate jobs 40 hours a week. Yall must have a really great ""why.""

17kjwbv,Attempting to establish myself in HR.,"Seeking advice/opinions from HR professionals.

Good morning! (Following 2 paragraphs are context to help you give me advice and/or opinions!)

I’m a 27F in Canada in a 2nd tier city and have an associate’s degree in Business Administration with Marketing as my major from a Canadian college. I went to school up to grade 12 in Dubai, UAE, where you are required to choose between Commerce, Arts & Science in grade 11 and then you also have to pick a “specialty.” At the time, I was sort of talked into Marketing so due to this, my family made me see Marketing as the right choice for a major in college in Canada. 

However, up until 2021 March, all my jobs were based on immigration requirements to become a permanent resident of Canada so I never actually worked anything directly related to Marketing. But the jobs I did work led me to do retail recruitment & employee development as well as call centre team lead roles that allowed me to up-train employees. This work experience along with actually taking the time to read about it as much as possible led me to finally figure out at age 26 that HR is where I want to be!

Sorry for the rant but basically, I am looking into an HRM Certification that allows me to achieve the CHRP designation. I would be starting it in December 2023 itself. But I don’t have any friends or family members in the field of HR and would greatly appreciate advice on whether doing said certification is the right step or if I should invest in a Bachelor degree that specializes in HRM or there’s something else entirely I should be doing that is the right move but I’m just clueless? Main thing I’ve read is that “the first job to get your foot in the door is key” and that is my immediate goal but it’s a work in progress at best.

Currently, I work as a CSR for Group Retirement Services for Canada Life. My job entails discussing & handling employees’ RRSP, RPP, DPSP, etc. that they have via their employers - contributions, withdrawals, restrictions, investment instructions, etc. I am greatly enjoying my benefits and the work environment and getting to work for HR in this same company would be great! But I’m open to anything that helps me step foot into the industry as successfully as possible.

17kjj16,Unsure Between an Internship or a Business Ownership,"This is one of those times the pros and cons list did not help me much.

I'm a 2nd year Industrial Engineering student and, along with college, I'm a partner at a startup in the financial sector - I'm responsible for the organizational and operational management there - that is currently looking to attract investors, which means it's not profitable at the moment.

Recently, I got an offer to participate in an internship in the management area of a big construction company. The salary is good, the position is good, but they would require 6 daily hours, which would leave me with \*very\* little time to attend classes, study, and manage the company of which I am a partner right now. In the best scenario, I'd be stretched to my limits.

My dilemma is whether to keep on pursuing this business (I've always dreamed of becoming a business owner) or to accept the internship in order to make some good money and possibly achieve good positions within the construction company. It's that choice between entrepreneurship and employment.

The thing I'm most worried about here is the fact that an internship can define a career, and that I'm afraid to not be able to get internships if I keep on rejecting offers. Also, would my experience as a business owner, even if the business doesn't work out, be as good for my curriculum as an internship would?

I’m in the UK and I’ve just completed my 2 year long apprenticeship and received a distinction. In those 2 years, I have done a lot more than my job description and happily took on extra responsibilities in the name of progression and experience opportunities. 

Now that I’ve finished this apprenticeship, they’re offering me a permanent contract and a fancy new job title, the catch is that someone has just been made redundant in a role higher up than mine, so they think I’d be a great replacement, but of course all on top of my current role and responsibilities. I’d be taking on what the other person did in their 40 hours a week, on top of my 40 hours a week of work. Whenever I ask about salary reviews, they explain I’m already paid in line with average salaries for my job title (I’m paid minimum wage).

I can’t afford to even go 1 month without a salary as I wouldn’t be able to meet basic expenses, I have no savings and this apprenticeship is my only formal qualification. 

I feel trapped in this role and forced to accept to do 2 people’s jobs at the same time, could anyone give me any advice? 

There are a few benefits to my role that I might not get elsewhere such as full time home working and it seems most places are offering Hybrid only roles now, so I’m very cautious about finding a new role",HumanKitten1,1,1.0,0,1698753072,2023-10-31 11:51:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kj6pp/is_a_promotion_without_a_pay_rise_normal/,10,2023
17kj037,"25, moved from The UK to Australia Looking to start a career fresh and need inspiration?","
Since emigrating countries I have felt a lack of purpose and drive due to not having a career, goals to work towards, future prospects etc. I guess I'm mostly looking for inspiration and ideas?

For context in the UK I studied product design at university, something which I am not naturally talented in, scraped through the degree and can't see my self ever working in it and l've worked a variety of unskilled jobs to tie me over such as hospitality or customer service.

I was previously more interested in following an engineering career however I struggled with some of the maths? I have a passion for health, food, nutrition, technology and craftsmanship such as various trades, I want to use my brain and feel satisfied.

Have thought about FIFO in the mines here but not sure how possible that is for a foreigner with no trade skills?

I'm looking for something that has high earning potential in the future maybe 5-10 years down the line.

Also since I'm only in this country on 3 year visa it's giving me even less options such as not being able to get an apprenticeship and want to avoid returning to England if possible.

I am currently studying in a Master's degree in software engineering, and I am aiming to start freelancing in my free time.  
I usually conduct small personal projects in various technologies in my free time, but after undergoing internships, I began to have a strong desire to work for actual clients to match a real need. Of course, I would also like to make money and gain skills in the process, being a student can be hard in terms of money sometimes.  
I already have a portfolio site, CV, fleshed-out GitHub etc. But I have no idea where to start freelancing, on which platform, how I should do it, if I should focus on certain techs or apps.  
I know this will be hard and I might fail but I want and am prepared to make the step.  
Any freelance software developers here could please give me some advice ? Maybe tell me about your own career.  
You would be doing a soon-to-be junior developer an enormous service.

17ken99,How do you know what is worth pursuing?,"I've had over 10-15 ideas on profitable side hustles Later down the line, I come up with a completely different idea in a different field on a different topic.  
I've even thought about selling my ideas... is that even possible?  
My pursuit is in writing, music and design.I've thought about getting into video essays, writing blogs, music producer and designing based on my interests and build a community.  
But then I think it's not profitable so it's better to help a business with video editing, scriptwriting, sound designing and copywriting.  
Then I ask myself how realistic that would be considering I have ADD and my interests in things don't last for too long.  
So I ended up going back to square one and creating a new idea that can answer my pursuit. I detail these ideas like blueprints from the niche to the problem to the solution. Unfortunately, I lose the pursuit as soon as I get started thinking I could create something better and you can't do all 10 ideas at the same time.  
Nothing is worth pursuing unless it brings results and so that makes it harder to find what is worth pursuing.

17kejxh,My manager... isn't actually my manager?,"I have a really weird situation.

TL;DR my manager lied to me about being my manager. i actually report to an executive. due to his lies everyone including the exec seems to think he's my manager, partially because i've been telling the same story. and, he threatened my job today. what do i do?

My company doesn't believe in org charts, or at least not in sharing them with employees. When I got hired on to this role, I thought I'd report to an executive (we'll call her Marie) and partner with one of her direct reports as my peer (we'll call him Allen). Allen told me he advocated super hard for me for this role, for which I'm grateful. 

A month or so later of reporting to Marie, and Allen steps in and says I'm actually reporting to him now, and that it's all worked out with HR. I was confused and anxious, but he assured me it was not due to my performance but just the way ""it was always supposed to be."" That is 100% false but at the time I didn't really care so I just went with it.

Now three things have happened: I got stellar performance reviews for the quarter across the board, and the Marie is the one who gave me my performance review and she was absolutely effusive with her praise; Allen called me separately and said I was doing all right but there was still a lot of work to do, and that he wasn't sure he could justify my full-time role; and HR just reached out to me letting me know Allen was going to try to become a manager this year, and they wanted my feedback.

I've come to terms with the fact that Allen is manipulating me and sabotaging my career for whatever reason. But how on earth do I handle this? I just assumed Allen had actually become a manager and I was part of his team, but that is actually false.",SecurityBabe,22,0.9200000166893005,11,1698733147,2023-10-31 06:19:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kejxh/my_manager_isnt_actually_my_manager/,10,2023

17kdmep,Advice please. Deciding between 2 jobs.,"Advice please.

I'm 24, did my undergrad and I also have 5 years of work experience in the business side of e-commerce and fintech. I'm from an asian country where management consulting industry is non-existent and I want to get into management consulting one day abroad.

These are my work and education qualifications:

- project manager (3.5 years at a well known e-commerce company in my country) - I carried out different projects commercially, operationally in 3 different departments, managed a small team

- marketing manager (1.5 years at a well known fintech company in my country) managed a bigger team

- current: strategy manager (3 months at a property development company) standalone

So, my current job is not fulfilling for several reasons and I plan to leave very soon.

Currently I have two vacancies I can try before I go for management consulting in a year or 2:

Strategy Manager (e-commerce)
+ good addition for consulting career?
+ deal with group C level and senior management 
- isolation and lack of belonging since I will be on my own
- lack of execution which can be unfulfilling 

Marketing Manager (e-commerce)
+ dedicated team to manage
+ execution in daily operations
- might not contribute to my consulting career

So, my question is, Is strategy manager really more suitable if I want to go into consulting?",snoozerboo,1,1.0,0,1698729227,2023-10-31 05:13:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kdmep/advice_please_deciding_between_2_jobs/,10,2023

17kcibg,"Like anyone, I just want (need) to get paid, but otherwise I could not possibly care any less.","Have you ever worked too much? I have. I've been in my current profession, licensed and regulated, for a decade. Ironically, it was a positive career change that marked successful ambition. In that time, I've had numerous ""side jobs"" to make more money despite my primary position being in the top 2% of I comes. My marriage failed and killed that. All the money was spent and not by me. I make big paychecks, but I live from paycheck to paycheck. I don't drink or use drugs, bought a used car and haven't bought new pants in years.  Divorce is nearing. In 10 years, I've accumulated about 16 years of hourly experience. 

In this time, I've seen a psychological transition. I used to enjoy everything. Next, I only enjoyed sort of the status -income, benefits, people working to accommodate me and make my day smooth. Then it was only going to work for pay, and now I don't even care about that. COVID happened and I started doing 100% of my work from home where previously it was about a quarter. Heaven came to Earth. I didn't have to be around anyone. Now, the idea of going anywhere and doing anything for work makes me scared and sick. I was recently admonished for doing something at work that I'll do again. My care is gone. There is really no part of this that I want to do anymore. I said I was licensed. Frankly, my attitude jeopardizes that. 

I have found a couple of entrepreneurial endeavors I am going to launch in 2024. I'm actually very eager about them. Responsibly, I know I need to keep doing what I'm doing so my kids can keep their lifestyle, and I have bills to pay (until the divorce finalizes then I'm going 100% debt free / no obligation). 

The advice I'm looking for is how to cope here. I'm genuinely freaking out when clients hop on Zoom, when work administration wants something from me, and I nearly rage out with any sort of challenging email or phone call. I hope every day for appointment cancellations, lost contracts...even service interruptions - anything to make it all stop. I perpetually surf for other jobs in my field, but I really don't want any of them. 

Behind the scenes, I'm working out at home, cleaning house, cooking, running errands, doing laundry, home handyman projects, sitting on my deck, reading, or whatever I want. It's really only in those moments do I feel an escape - a peace.  I can finally be me because the last ten years wasn't me, and the academic training for five years before that really wasn't me either. 

Part of me is absolutely ambivalent. The other part of me is terrified that I'm going to have to do something at work. I had therapy for a year and didn't get anywhere. I took Cymbalta which made me feel less irritable in my personal life, but at work the volcanic activity continued. I've lost 15 years, and I'm getting anxious right now thinking about losing another.",FitCouchPotato,0,0.5,0,1698724991,2023-10-31 04:03:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17kcibg/like_anyone_i_just_want_need_to_get_paid_but/,10,2023
17kbx27,Issues with coworker,"Hello everyone!

I am just looking for some advice on how to deal with a situation that has arisen at work. I work for a school on a small team, love the job, no issues .. until today. I have a coworker who I have interacted with multiple times, have helped, chose to be hired, etc. She recently had to move offices and is now sharing my office.. we work in office on different days so we don’t see each other in person. I was having issues getting the employer to get her a name tag so I took it upon myself to get her one. We discussed today and I asked if it was okay if when she’s in office , she moves her name tag (for office door) in front of mine, when I’m in office, I’ll move mine in front. Our boss was cc’d in this email and we sent emails back and forth for 3-4 replies. At first, I didn’t pick up on her passive aggressiveness but she started saying how “it took a year to get this done” (not my job to get her the name tag), and saying varying rude things, then proceeds to insert a screenshot about a student complaining about me taking to long to reply to their email out of nowhere. The conversation had nothing to do with this , it was her complaining about the name tag taking too long. So I asked why she included that in the email and she said she just “wanted to share it 🙂”. I sent her a private message asking if there was an issue, she has yet to respond . I talked to my boss about the issue and he said that he would talk to her but this literally came out of nowhere and she was so rude to me. I know that I am a great employee and there’s nothing I’ve done but now I’m worried she’s going to make up some other BS because she’s clearly trying to make me look bad. How should I handle this situation? My boss isn’t overly emotional and probably would not rather deal with this at all but now I’m feeling uncomfortable with the team that I’m on and honestly it hurt my feelings because I’ve been nothing but nice to this person.

I'm looking for some advice and recommendations on online Ph.D. or Master's programs in psychology, behavioral analysis, or education. I have a unique situation and specific goals, and I'd appreciate any insights you can provide.  
**Background:**  
I've been working as a government contractor for the past 12 years, and I've been fortunate to achieve a high level of success in my career. In fact, I'm already being compensated at a Ph.D. level. However, I've decided that I want to pursue a Ph.D. for personal reasons and to enhance my professional recognition.  
**My Goals:**  
I'm not interested in clinical work, research, or academia. I aim to find fast-track and affordable online programs that will allow me to maintain my current career while obtaining the credentials I seek.  
**Why I'm Asking:**  
One unique aspect of my situation is that I often find myself overseeing employees with Ph.D.s, which can be initially surprising to them. However, as they get to know me and my track record, they understand why I've been successful without a Ph.D. Still, having that ""Dr."" in front of my name would make the transition smoother.

  
**Request:**  
I'm seeking your advice and recommendations on online programs that fit my criteria. If you have any experience with or knowledge of programs in psychology, behavioral analysis, or education that offer flexibility, affordability, and a reputable degree, please share your insights. I'd also appreciate any tips on how to balance work and studies effectively.

17k7gdf,Suggestions for a Potential Career/Life Switch at 28,"Hey everyone, I'm 28 and currently job hunting right now as I was fired from my previous job at Trader Joe's (petty reason but no relevant)

It's been 2 months now and I've been trying to get out of the retail space/customer service jobs. I appreciate the work and life skills I gained but do not see it as a professional path forward for me. Trader Joe's was a safe job during the pandemic and I always intended to switch careers, but the firing sped up that process. 

I majored in politics in school and I love the field/topic despite the toxicity and evident problems there are today. But I have no work experience in the field due to the timing with Covid and now I've reached a road block of not meeting requirements to get that initial job offer. 

On the other hand, I've come to realize through my past Trader Joe's job that I love being active, moving around, and having responsibilities. I led the frozen section previously and thrived under the pressure. I felt pride in my work with order writing, leading a team, and getting great results. Seeing that tangible turnaround made work enjoyable. Some friends and family have asked me if going into a trade might be worth exploring. It's harder work but pay can be much better, I'm on my feet, actively doing something, and can see the results of my hard work.

Obviously other jobs can provide that too. Leadership roles exist in every industry, even politics, and I want to reach that level of responsibility again. I guess I'm stuck wondering what's the best path moving forward? I'm at a point where I'm getting worried about my life, career, relationships, building a family, having financial security, etc. 

I'm starting to run low on savings and may have to settle for a retail/customer service job for the time being so I can at least get insurance and money flowing again. I see good money options there, but like I mentioned previously, it's not the long-term career path I see for myself.

Has anyone else been in my shoes? What would you advice/suggest? Are there avenues or options I'm no considering for getting into politics or something else?

17k5w1s,"Changing careers / job-hopping recently, need to be concerned?","Hi guys,

so, this just happened but I job-hopped heavily in 2023 because the last two jobs I worked were just... Terrible.

Small background story. I'm an experienced marketer, did sales for a while and also customer support/IT in the early stages of my career. I have an MBA and a proven track record of being successful. I never left an employer on bad terms, nor did I burn any bridges. All recent companies were the top dogs of their industries. The reasons why I left were a.) simply too much workload and b.) painful management issues.

However, I'm a little concerned. The last two jobs, I pretty much burned out in marketing. I have no energy left. All those jobs were in the software / IT field. Just thinking about it now makes me anxious.

I already found something new and secured a good contract - a 2nd lvl tech support role/customer onboarding job that I really am looking forward to, in a great team!

It's a bit of a career pivot since it's still software, but a different role using lots of my talents. But what I'm concerned with is the following:

My last ""long stay"" has been four years, as head of marketing. Then 8 months, then 3 months. Meaning this is the THIRD job I'm starting now.

Normally I'd just leave out the gap from the 3 months job, but it was also a head of marketing position at a reputable company which just looks good on the CV.

My plan and UTMOST desire is to stay long again with a company. I'm 30 now and honestly, I have had enough changes. I wanna do something meaningful and be happy about it. I'd love to stay and grow with a company again

Now my question to you, smart fellows of reddit is the following: What would you do? Would you worry about this quick pattern of jumps in the CV or would you sell it as career pivot / gaining experience?

17k2pcb,Do you view any of these things I do at work as bad? I'm asking because I truly don't know if they're really bad.,"Here are some things I do at work and I truly don't know if they're really bad:

1. I would say I don't express my opinion much on anything at all unless I'm asked. For example, if a company process doesn't seem good to me, I won't express to the company that it's a bad process in my opinion. 
 

2. I don't have a work profile picture. My reasoning is mostly because of two things: One, It seems like half or even over half of people where It work don't have work profile pictures. Two, I don't really have a professional picture of myself.


3. I don't really try very hard to make connections with people. For example, if someone sits next to me at work I'll usually remain silent unless they say something first to me pretty much all the time. If someone sends me a connection request on LinkedIn I'll accept it though. My main reasoning for not trying hard to make connections is because I feel like if I ever change jobs it doesn't really matter that I have previous connections.

4. I basically never complain about anyone in anyway towards anyone. My reasoning for this is because I just want to avoid any conflicts at work as much as possible that aren't necessary. I feel like if I ever complained about someone towards my manager that he wouldn't like that. Even if I was right.

5. I never put in 100 percent effort at work unless it's a safety critical issue. My reasoning is because I feel like it wouldn't matter if I'm really above average at my job. Since, I don't feel like that would result in a big raise or any benefit in general. One time, I remember getting a reward out of 150 people and I just got a pat on the back and a $50 Amazon gift card pretty much.


6. I pretty much only choose to work off site unless people ask me to come on site. My reasoning is because I feel like people can be equally effective at home or in the office for most work related things.


Are any of these ways I act really bad in your opinion?",Ben5544477,9,0.8600000143051147,6,1698697376,2023-10-30 20:22:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17k2pcb/do_you_view_any_of_these_things_i_do_at_work_as/,10,2023

17k1u78,Does taking a Lower-level job look bad on my resume for future prospects?,"Hello all 26 F here. Currently pursuing my MBA online part-time. Undergrad in Psych, Paralegal Certificate. 

Work experience: retail, tourism, social work, legal assistant, higher education. 

I am currently working in higher education and my current position I am just not enjoying it at all. It is not what I plan on pursuing with my life and I mainly took it for the benefits and to see if it was something I want to do. There are other roles I much rather do within the organization but I feel right now I am just too unsure and want to go out and experience different things for awhile. 

I worked as a legal assistant since I was 20 (started small, promoted 3 times with 4 raises) and left that job only due to the work environment. I REALLY enjoyed it and miss it deeply. (I also worked my tourism jobs as well as working at a domestic violence agency while working as a legal assistant.) I thought after receiving my paralegal certificate I would be able to find a job in the field, mainly looking remote because not a lot of job opportunities where I live, but no luck. I took the job in higher education as I could not get anything else, especially one that offered benefits as I was getting booted from my parents' medical insurance when I turned 26. 

Now I feel bad because I have been actively looking for a position more in my field and what I want to go into and have been having no luck and my current position requires a lot of training, like not fully trained until 2 years in. I have been there for 6 months. I am unable to move at this time, at least until I graduate with my MBA in Dec. of 2025 so remote jobs are a priority. 

I do not make much money at my current job, far less than I was making as a legal assistant. I want to leave the position and get a remote job if possible. However, some of these remote jobs would be scaling back my skills from my previous work experience/education, but I feel I would be much happier doing these jobs and that when I get my MBA I could have a good chance of getting promoted within some of these companies that I am scoping out. Plus, I feel I would be much happier working remotely and that is what I was aiming for when getting the paralegal certificate. 

So I guess with all that being said, this is what I am asking for example: 

Would leaving a good job for a job like a reservation agent or cashier downgrade my resume for future prospects? I am just unsure what I truly want to do and want to try out different things.

17k1f1d,My (40f) boss has been stringing me along re: hours for 6 months and I'm burning out. How to professionally address this?,"I'm the office manager for a really small firm. It is just me, my boss and a couple of people who are part time (and often remote).  
  
I was hired a year ago as an admin assistant/office manager. I could likely easily do the office part of my job with part-time hours, but I find things to keep busy. When I was hired, I balked at the long hours (9:30 - 7:00) but was told they were only temporary during that ""busy time"".  
  
That time wasn't overly busy for me. My manager is often busy, but that seems to be because he's very reluctant to staff appropriately, so he's often looking after many things that the other part-time people should be doing (and he also seems to have issues with delegation/communication because the part-time people are often asking him what they should be doing...meanwhile he's doing work they could easily take on).  
  
We have a board of directors (fairly hands off) and my manager approached them in the spring to ask if we can modify these long hours. They said absolutely, we don't have to work 9:30-7.  
  
My manager told me we'd wait until summer starts and then talk about summer hours, but in the meantime we started working 9:30 - 6:30. When I brought it up at the end of June I was told it was too busy (not for me!) and we could review it in September. I brought it up at the beginning of September and was told to wait until a particular event passed in October. That event just passed and I brought it up on Friday asking if we could begin working 9-5. He said, ""uhh, let's just leave the hours as-is until Christmas and then we'll talk about modifying them"".  
  
At this point I'm so frustrated. This job doesn't pay great (but it was the only job I had an offer for after a year of unemployment). As well, there is a lot of overtime expected on weekends (for event coverage). At least 2 Saturdays per month plus 2 evenings per month. We don't get overtime. We can take time in-lieu but honestly that's not even all that appealing...having a random Tuesday off in lieu of working all day Saturday isn't my ideal option.  
  
I'm afraid to leave the job, so I want to approach my manager professionally and reasonably to request a change of our hours to 9-5. There is absolutely zero logical reason for me to be working until 6:30 every night, and it's very isolating...I'm often alone if my manager is working from home or in a meeting, etc.

17k14qc,Transitioning from Project Manager to SWE: Good/Bad?,"I've been a project manager for almost 3 years at 2 different companies. I've recently been thinking about switching to a more technical role (i.e. SWE) for the following reasons:

* Higher salary (after some time)
* Fewer meetings, less dealing with ""people problems"" (I know, people will always be a problem to some extent in most careers)
* Being able to actually know what I'm talking about and understand the technical aspects of the work that needs to be completed

My main concerns are:

1. I currently make a low six-figure base salary, and I anticipate that any starting base salary for an entry-level SWE would be lower than my current salary when getting started (especially if I'm self-taught). It'll be hard to adjust my current lifestyle accordingly to a lower starting salary, but if it levels out soon enough, it might be worth it.
2. I don't know if I can tolerate the stresses of this new position, since I would anticipate that the main issues would be with troubleshooting my own work rather than dealing with timelines falling behind, budgets not being met, angry customers, etc. It's just a different type of stress, and I'd love to hear what people think.
3. I don't know if I will enjoy programming overall. I've always been the ""technical"" and ""analytical/logical"" person in my family and friend group, and I love tech, but I don't know if that really translates to the skillset or personality of a SWE.


**The question is**, why do I see so many posts asking about going from SWE -> PM, but there are so few posts about going PM -> SWE/SD/etc.? I feel like the ability to advance your career as a SWE is so much greater than a PM, and it offers better pay too. This could just be a bad take on my part.


  
One thing to note is that I am talking about PMs as in **Project** Managers, **not Product** managers. I feel like there's been a lot of confusion in the threads that I've seen. As a **Project** Manager, I don't necessarily have technical experience when it comes to coding/programming. I strictly manage timelines, budget, resources, etc.

Initially, I enrolled in the Kelley School of Business with a dual major in Accounting and Finance yet decided to switch majors after two years of enrollment, which retrospectively created some self-inflicted challenges since I didn’t complete an internship while I was trying to acclimate to this switch and navigating the pandemic.

I’m also aware that GPA has become a bit of a more obsolete factor for recruiting, but I did graduate with a 3.90 cumulative GPA and was involved in various clubs, volunteering, mentorship, and scholar programs through my enrollment. Of the various cyber analyst, software engineering, and IT analyst/specialist roles I’ve applied to, I’ve interviewed for 1 cyber analyst role, 1 entry-level software engineer role, and 1 technology graduate program, all of which decided not to proceed forward.

17jzr07,Jocking for position,"I started a contract job, filling in for a manager who gave notice and left. At the same time the company posted the job and was interviewing and had another more junior contractor filling another open role. My first few days were going really well and I thought I was in a good groove with the hiring manager. But the more junior contractor was not working out. The hiring manager asked me my opinion and I was honest, professionally, and he agreed.  
  
He decided to get rid of them and bring in a contractor for a different firm. The second contractor had meet with them for my role but the hiring manager passed on them and brought me in instead. Prior to this new contractor I was definitely the point for the two contract roles. The second contractor seems to want to battle me for lead position, inserting themselves and trying to direct. The problem I see, they want to dig into how other functions operate and want to spend a lot of time on what I think is not most efficient. Not bad things to learn about, but we’re here as contractors to get a budget finish and maybe not very efficient to be “digging into” if the VP of Engineering is planning their staffing levels right.  
  
How do I handle this? I do I take back control without seeming like I’m shutting down questions. Do I just let the second contractor take point on all these questions and get shut down from the hiring manager? Feels like they’re trying to prove to the hiring manager why they should get the permanent role instead of me.

17jzcmf,Can't make a decision about next career move,"Hi guys! Maybe you can help me out. I am working in my current company for around 6 years now. Since then I was approached about the possibility of leading my current team 2 times. The 1st time I refused because leading people was not something that interested me and to be honest I have some issues dealing with other people expectations, as I always feel I will mess up. Meanwhile I changed teams 2 years ago and now my current team leader also wants to promote me to a leading role: at first i refused for the same reason but considering I want to grow and there are no other opportunities I decided to accept and I am currently being prepared for this role that I should take next year officially. Everybody seems to recognize these leading skills in me that for some reason I don't see. My boss says I am afraid of taking risks. The truth is I am not sure I like people management and I am scared of not being able to perform well and let people down.
This week my old team leader - who i refused the first time and who meanwhile grew to a Head position - approached me about an opportunity in her team that is not team leading focused but more of a lone wolf thing which I prefer (but maybe because I am scared of living my comfort zone). I like my current boss and I have already compromised with him and i don't really like my old team leader. Both jobs would be of equal payment at start.

17jz1jp,Career ideas in psychology field that make good money,"I'm 23 and approaching my first full year in the corporate world. I'm not happy with my job and it's making me realize that I need to do something I'm actually passionate about. Here's the thing...money really matters to me. I sacrificed my happiness to take the highest paying job offer I could get out of college (not even that much, 65k) and I just need to get out of the industry I'm in. I majored in developmental/social psychology and consider myself to be exceptionally insightful in that realm, and it's actually something I love. Everybody tells me how wise I am and fantastic at offering genuinely great advice, to all kinds of people with all kinds of problems. I can truly apply myself to all situations, and accurately put myself in someone else's shoes even when I've never been through their own issues. Right now I'm working in marketing at a security firm (don't ask) and the biggest VP at my company who loves the work I do even told me I should consider pursuing that path instead. This was after I randomly had an in-depth conversation with him about some psychology topics and he was very impressed.

This is where I need help. I need advice on what path to take next. I'm more than open to going back to school, but I can't figure out exactly what for. I could see myself being a fantastic therapist, and it would be really great to start my own practice one day. That's the only way I could see myself making money if I take the therapy path (and even so, I know nothing about that). I guess I'm asking for advice on potential career paths that involve working with people and their mental and/or physical health...that's another thing I'm very knowledgeable on, healthy lifestyles and nutrition. So, ultimately, there are a few things that really matter to me: it's a job that involves consulting people in some kind of way based on my knowledge of health/psychology, it will provide me with a good salary, and receive the necessary qualifications won't be as extensive as medical school for ex.

17jymyj,Duped by job posting - a cautionary tale,"I, like many others currently, have been actively searching for a new job. While I’m content with my current employer and line of work, I am significantly underpaid for my industry and profession, and there has been limited to no guidance internally about promotions and more responsibilities. 

Recently, I utilized some temp agencies/contract to hire type positions and companies. One of the temp agencies, which from my understanding is relatively popular and reputable, had multiple job postings within my industry, and many of the qualifications I meet or exceed. A recruiter reached out to me directly, and after multiple phone interviews I felt confident. 

Shortly after the phone interviews, my current supervisor reached out to me to inform me they had a discussion with the recruiter. My supervisor assured me that they gave the recruiter positive information and answers and strongly recommended that I was a great candidate for the role. 

However, after this conversation with my supervisor, I have not heard back from the recruiter. No phone called nor emails. I reached out via email a week after my supervisor conversation, and have heard nothing. Similarly, I called the recruiter multiple times, as well as the company’s office location, and have also heard back nothing. I’m very disgruntled and frustrated. To make matters worse, over this past weekend, I was the victim of identity theft, and a credit account was opened in my name and SSN. While I’m not implying this organization and recruiter were involved, the timing seems suspicious, and the lack of any updates and communication does not help my anxiety around both the job search and the theft. 

I’m a mess, mentally and emotionally. I have been looking for better pay and more responsibilities, both with my current employer and with new opportunities, and have been aggressively searching I would say since June. This one promising lead I had, which I would say is the only one I’ve had in months, has resulted in radio silence and, potentially, was a fraudulent posting and communication.

17jxvnv,2019 Graduate | B.S. Marketing. Advertising Minor | Feeling off-track/lost/behind | Career change needed?,"I am currently working for my fraternity HQ that I was a member of during college. I have been with them for 2.5 years. I was hired as an Account Manager then was promoted as manager of that team after a year. Prior to that I worked at construction contractor after being unemployed for a year post-graduation due to the pandemic.

Internally, things aren't going well. My department has decreased from 6 to 3. My team's responsibilities have been essentially distributed to a different team that is fully staffed; and we are not being given any direction. There are no professional development opportunities provided or offered to us. Additionally, my team has been excluded from any discussion about pay raises. It feels like every one is waiting for us to quit or find a different opportunity.

I want to leave my job so badly but I am lost on where to go from here. I don't really enjoy Account Management but that is really the only relevant work-experience I have to put on my resume. I have been applying for new roles the last few months but have hardly even received rejection emails let alone interviews. I use ChatGPT as well as Rezi to edit and revise my resumes and cover letters.

I am starting to feel like the only way forward is to change careers entirely or look into something that will be a large supplement to my degree. Ive looked into coding bootcamps and even masters degrees, but even then I feel like I am only wanting to do that to get out of my situation rather than to better my career.

17jxuba,I have been learning coding/programming for three years and I still don't know what I'm doing,"Not three years of continued learning. I had to take breaks sometimes to focus on college/personal things.

But I put a lot of time into this and recently I managed to get an internship. Here it dawned that I'm heavily underprepared. Most of the other people at the internship are way better than me. They know more than me. And it isn't a college thing. Not all of them studied programming in college.

I basically have issues with every task we receive and the others solve them easily.

We have good mentors that helped me when I got stuck, but I know they can't help me with every small issue. 

This caused a lot of stress for me lately and there are still a few weeks until the internship is over. And I just don't know what to do. As I said, I put a lot of time and effort into this and now I see I'm basically the weakest in the team. I don't know what to do next. College didn't help me find any jobs.

17jxktx,Workforce or MBA (World of Data Science),"I'm currently a junior studying Data Science and Environmental Science. If my school allows it, I plan on adding a Computer Science minor.  
I am wondering if I should pursue a free accelerated MBA in Information Management and Business Analytics or go into the workforce and look at online masters while I'm working.  
If I add the comp sci minor and go for the MBA, it will be a lot of course work and summer classes, but I don't mind because I really want to add the CSCI minor. With that being said, I don't want to do extra classes during my senior year for this MBA, then struggle to find a job since I have a Masters and no real work experience.  
I've had one data management internship and currently have one with National Grid (but it's related to environmental science). National Grid does have a Graduate Program and I heard starting pay is around 70k for people with a Masters. I could also enter it with just a Bachelors, likely at lower pay. I know National Grid likes to hire internally so if I stick with this internship (and miss out on actual Data science internships) then it is very likely I could get into their Grad development program for Data Sci.

   
I guess my follow up question is should I stick with National Grid, or take the first data science internship I can get my hands on? I don't have any connections in this field, my old data internship was not as data science-ey as I wanted. Also a 2-hour commute home which was awful.  
Sum up:  
Bachelors -> National grid grad prog...     Masters -> National grid grad prog  
Bachelors -> find real data internship...    Masters -> find real data internship

17jx3d1,What’re some careers you could go into with a BA in Math?,"I had a subpar GPA due to some personal issues (though my major GPA is still decent) so I’m not considering a Masters at the moment, maybe after a few years of working. But it seems that most suggested careers for math majors either require higher-level maths or extensive domain-knowledge in another field. For example, being an economist requires economics, actuarial science requires the actuary exams, data science and statistics jobs strongly prefer graduate degrees, engineering and other related areas require applied math (among other things), and I have no interest in anything related to academia. So what options do I even have?

For additional context, I’m finishing up my final year at a pretty good public university in the USA. My major is math (no applied math option at my school though the classes I’ve taken have definitely leaned towards it) and I have a minor in philosophy. I’ve also taken the foundational courses for statistics and optimization (introductory statistics 1-2, probability theory, statistical theory, machine learning, numerical analysis, linear optimization, mathematical modeling, advanced linear algebra) and have decent coding/CS knowledge (proficiency in Java up to data structures level, proficiency in Python, particularly in terms of numerical methods and machine learning, R, Excel, and some databases).

Right now it seems like my best bet is to start taking the actuary exams (I can do P and FM before I graduate). Or to self-study mathematical finance and hope to break into that field. Data science and SWE seem to be out of reach as they’re competitive and require more advanced topics in statistics and CS, respectively.",mowa0199,3,1.0,3,1698682585,2023-10-30 16:16:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jx3d1/whatre_some_careers_you_could_go_into_with_a_ba/,10,2023
17jx1io,I have social anxiety and need to find a career that will work with it.,"I was a welder. Socially I like welding, but my body is seeing the effects pretty early of welding so long. Pretty much you get a work order or a blue print and if you are working, nobody bothers you. I did what I feel now is a stupid thing and went and got a bachelors degree in computer science. I like the work. I find it similar to fabrication. Step1: have idea, step2 build idea. But, I didn’t realize it involves so much communication with people. I have social anxiety to the point it makes it hard to work in an environment like this. For me, the hardest class I have ever to speech. I’ve taken linear algebra and differential equations. I about dropped out of high school 20 years ago because of speech. I about dropped out of college a few years ago because of speech. I’m 38, I don’t think I’m getting over it, and kind of tired of trying. Are there jobs in the tech industry that are like welding Where you get some work instruction and people leave you alone? Are there any other jobs out there like that? What I liked most about welding was the ability to solve problems mixed with people not talking to you. I want to solve problems, but not talk to end users especially, or anyone who is invested in the outcome. I’m ok talking to team members, but I loath that I exist in the same universe as project management and I am not a leader at all. I get along telling people what to do like a diabetic and sugar.

17jv6yb,"I don’t think sales is right for me, but it’s a step in the right direction.","Hi there, 

There are a ton of details that I could dive into, but I’ll try and be quick and not talk too much (which happens frequently lol) 

1. I have my Master of Science in a medical therapy field (I’m going to be vague on purpose) it was a top 10 program in that field, I had a 3.7 GPA with top marks from my clinical advisors during my hospital/rehab rotations. 

2. The above was a mistake. I was at a time in my life where I was making the “safe” choice and not willing to truly examine what I was doing. 

3. I am currently selling commercial insurance for a local agent of a national insurance company. Obviously pay and benefits could be way better, but even considering that I don’t think sales is for me. If someone says no I want to respect that. I’ve never been a pushy person. 

4. I had absolutely loved learning a new thing, it’s part of what appealed to me about my degree. I started at zero and had to learn and make my own way with it. Took my insurance exam in 28 minutes and got an 89 after around 1 week of studying/working. I’ve enjoyed Identifying lines of business where we are competitive, and especially lines that other agents haven’t caught onto yet. I love thinking outside the box “oh we are super compatible with Condo Association insurance. Let’s find property management companies who work with condos and start working on a relationship there”. 

All of that has been great. But anytime someone is on the fence, or saying no for any other reason than price I just think “okay”. Which really isn’t the best mindset for sales.

If I could do it over again I would get an MBA but I can’t. I’m not sure where to go next for a career. I have no idea what opportunities are out there in the business world as an “outsider”.

17ju8x2,Regretting Job Change,"18 months ago, i left my old job of 4 years to pursue another opportunity at a renowned company with great growth potential. I loved my old job and my boss, but there wasn't any room for growth and this new opportunity was too good to pass up. I was really on the fence about leaving up until my last day, but knew I'd never know if I didn't take the chance.

Fast forward to today and I hate it. My boss is a passive aggressive micromanaging gaslighter, my job description keeps changing and  tasks are added to my plate randomly, and communication here is terribly lacking. This is the only job I've ever had where I do exactly as I'm told and it still ends up not being right for some odd reason or another. 

I'm currently trying to transfer to another department and have also met with my old company and they would love to have me back when there's an opening. I'm worried my boss will give me a bad review and I won't be able to transfer, or my old company won't have an opening any time soon. 

Sorry for the word salad, but has anyone else ever experienced this? Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",gunstreetgirl999,2,1.0,0,1698674921,2023-10-30 14:08:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ju8x2/regretting_job_change/,10,2023

Long story short I am 27 working in a big corporation in a supply chain function. I am in this job for over 2 years and I was recently informed that my boss would like to promote me to a senior function which will involve people management.
It will also mean that I will be promoted over my colleagues, who have been in the company longer than I have.

In order to prepare for the role my boss has asked me to prepare a list of things I would like to be coached on to be better prepared for a managerial role. This is where I am a bit lost with what to do. I am really good in my job and have a lot of knowledge on the industry but I have never been in a managerial role and do not really know what to ask for without sounding under qualified to get promoted :(

So... I've had this job for about 5ish months now. Everyone there is lovely and the work is average but I really want to be in the research field and put my degree to use. I found a scientist position in healthcare and I'm keen on applying. okay I left it to the last minute cos I'm super nervous about applying, especially since I do not interview well - this is a government job and the last time I interviewed with them there was 5 people on the panel, I think I almost had a breakdown I was that nervous and overwhelmed  - at one point I couldn't even speak and they were all just staring at me). I have till Friday to put my application in. My pickle is that I need 3 professional references. (as you probably gathered I'm a super anxious person and I barely speak to anyone at work. I am trying a little bit at my current job, but my previous job I was at for 3 years I didn't really bother talking with coworkers etc because it was a very independent job. how the heck do I get 3 references??. I think I could probably get 2 references from my job I'm at now. I suppose my main question is can I contact my previous manager and bug them again to be another reference??? I already bugged them last time when I was applying for jobs. I would feel bad for making them be my reference again, especially cos they would be busy with all their other things managers do. Or do you think its okay if I try and get a third reference from the same company im at now?

17jrq0d,Should I be Worried?,"I am a seasoned professional in the field of data analysis, and recently, I transitioned into a role as a Data Specialist at a new organization. I went through a rigorous selection process, which included exams and interviews, and successfully secured the position.  
  
However, within a week of starting, I realized that the job description and expectations were not aligned with what was presented during the interviews. It became apparent that the team lead, who conducted my interview, had provided inaccurate information about the role, and there was no clear roadmap for the future. This left me, along with a Software Engineer who joined alongside me, grappling with a sense of misplaced professional identity within the organization.  
  
Seeking clarity, I reached out to some of the more tenured colleagues who had been with the company for several years. Surprisingly, they were unable to pinpoint where my role fit in, and it became evident that only the team lead had a clear understanding of my purpose within the organization. This raised a significant concern, as it's crucial for colleagues to understand how I can contribute to the team's success.  
  
I discovered that many others had faced similar situations, resulting in a high turnover rate due to the lack of transparency and a clear career trajectory. Some colleagues confided in me, expressing their intention to leave the organization, which further underscored the pervasive issue.  
  
Ultimately, after just a month, I made the difficult decision to resign. I was fortunate to secure a new opportunity that aligns more closely with my expertise and professional aspirations.

17jppxm,To move teams or not?,"Hi there, throwaway account and hoping to get some opinions on this and reduce my own personal bias.

I started a role in the tech space for a large company after completing what was effectively a training program in the same company.

I started this role just over 6 months ago, and at the same time the business area was hiring for three of the same role and an external candidate joined in one of the other vacancies. We have since been effectively working the same role across two separate teams in the same business area.

Recently a senior role of the same job became available in the business area and I wasn't sure that I was ready for it as have more development to do in my current role so did not apply (not unhappy with this decision in itself in anyway). However, my colleague in the same role as me with similar time in the role did apply and was successful in the application and will shortly start in the senior role in what is my current team.

As part of a wider shuffle around within the team, my manager has given me the option to move to another team in the same business area in the same role I am currently in or to continue exactly as I am now.

The question is whether I move or not and if there's anything else to this decision to consider other than personal preference. 

TLDR: I can stay in the same team under a recently promoted senior colleague who started in the same role as me at the same time or I can move teams to be under a different senior colleague but still in the same role.

17jo2uu,Mentally getting over letting someone down and quitting,"Let's just jump into the details

I asked for an internship role moving from production into a more technical role. Me accepting the role essentially meant I replaced someone which I still feel bad about. 

There was a verbal discussion I would stay after the internship. They asked for 2-3 years, but I said 1 was probably realistic, but 2 was a possibility considering my target role is still recovering from the recession.  
During this discussion we agreed on a salary which I learned is less than what the previous person was earning so I asked for it to be looked at again. This has also delayed me being paid properly right now because my internship was supposed to be only 3 months and I'm still an intern after 5 months with responsibilities of a full time person. I also feel like I was not trained properly and had to learn on the job and I still do not feel confident I am doing my job properly.

Initially I had planned to stay for year for some experience on my resume, but I'm learning this role is not making me happy. I know a job is not supposed to make you happy and should just be seen as something you do for a paycheck, but I should not be feeling stressed about it on Sunday nights and thinking about work on my time off. 

I'm considering quiting, but can't without another job lined up and that's proving a little difficult right now and I don't want to move into a similar role with another company because this is not my target career. I'm also fighting with myself because I'm part of the older millennials and was taught to show loyalty to a company and because they helped me out with the internship I feel bad for leaving after its completed. 

So I feel like I'm stuck because I do appreciate they helped me with the internship role since I was having issues landing one to graduate on time and I'd like to repay them back for it, but it might be at the cost of me not being happy and not being compensated fairly. I'm also bummed because 5 months experience doesn't seem like enough experience on my resume to persuade recruiters to consider me for a role.  
How do I get over this feeling of letting someone down? I might be in this role for another 3 - 6 months because I'm being picky with my next role, how do I make the most of this role until then and not be so depressed about this job?",Putrid_Experience586,1,1.0,1,1698651797,2023-10-30 07:43:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jo2uu/mentally_getting_over_letting_someone_down_and/,10,2023

Especially the 50-55 hour weeks I am expected to put in at basically a call center job where I also have to please the angry customers that come into my store everyday. It’s not worth the pay. I some days  dream of working cash register at a gas station because of its simplicity. I seriously would do it if I could afford rent and to feed my son on that salary.. but I’m a sole income house and it’s just not gonna cut it to make minimum wage, also eventually after my bitterness subsides from retail burnout I would end up wanting more from my job..I love coaching people I love sales most days and I love helping customers get what they need but this just isn’t it. I feel like going into a commission sales job is too sketchy with the economy.. now I’m just rambling.


Anyways what are some career paths I could try to follow and turn my life around. Just had my first baby and I’m super dedicated and motivated but I find myself overwhelmed with the results on Google and all of the webpages that are centered around themselves making ad revenue and nothing is actually true advice it’s just consumerism and someone else trying to make a dime off of my time spent staring at my screen lost in the chaos of the modern day internet.",RevolutionarySite932,2,1.0,4,1698639693,2023-10-30 04:21:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jl9ct/33_and_i_feel_like_my_job_is_dead_end_but_have_no/,10,2023
17jk01r,Dates for background check question,"I have a job from 8 years ago. On paper, I was there for 1 year (contract role).

When the contract came to an end, I didnt have anything else, so I asked if I could stay while I looked. They said they couldn’t pay me, but I could if I really wanted to. This was a verbal agreement. 

The company was a startup with only a few people (at the time). No HR person or deparment. 

It took me another 4 months to find a job. So on my resume, it says I worked there for 1yr 4mo. But on paper, it only looks like 1 year. 

I think I should put only the official 1year duration on a background check, right??",Slowmac123,1,1.0,0,1698635235,2023-10-30 03:07:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jk01r/dates_for_background_check_question/,10,2023
17jjwex,Looking for some help and guidance," 

During the last 2-3 years , I have had interviews with leadership and upper management but it has not gone anywhere. Snooping around online, it seems that these places did not hire anyone else either. I say this, as I have some experience with ""interviews"" with the higher ups. 

I have an upcoming ""meeting"" with leadership level, which is likely an interview. This is expected to take place in 3 weeks, so I have time to prepare. 

In speaking with the headhunter, it has been suggested that the interview/ meeting will be with the country manager and potentially another C level. There might be a round or two. I have been assured via the head hunter (who was told by the potential employer) that my skill set is unique and well above anyone else. 

I have been trying to do the usual prep, but I am at a cross road. Considering my past experience, I seem to be over thinking things and have hit the phase of decision paralysis. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this type of a meeting ? I am positive that it won't be STAR focused, but I will prepare for it as well. 

That being said, it has been suggested to me that should I make it through, they will want me to speak with the management team for the ""Americas""... All to say, this is not the only step. 

Any suggestions? How do I manage this meeting / interview?

This is an opportunity which can potentially change the trajectory of my career... All to say, I want to be prepared. 

Any help would be appreciated!!",twotwo4,1,1.0,0,1698634898,2023-10-30 03:01:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jjwex/looking_for_some_help_and_guidance/,10,2023
17jjs2k,Been making the same mistake unknowingly,"I just started a position as a legal assistant 5 weeks ago. I have never done anything like this before. I have anxiety, so I have been stressed over missing any detail and not doing a good job. I was starting to feel more confident in the position until last week. Thursday sucked! I messed up a phone call and felt bad and then found out I prematurely sent out some final documents to clients. Friday I discovered I had been sending out final documents too early when another case came to my attention. 

So basically, clients pay for the work up front 5-7k for their documents to be drafted and signed. We file them with the courts which have fees that we pay initially, so they are billed a final time for filing fees (about $200). We are supposed to hold their copies of final documents hostage until these Filing fees are paid and THEN send them out. Well I had not been reading through the High Rise notes to see if those final fees had been paid before sending them out. I found 12 more case I did this too within the last 5 weeks. I now have to tell my boss and am riddled with anxiety.

I can’t do anything to fix the mistakes I already made, as the docs have been sent and the filing fees have been sent to clients, its just up to them to pay despite already having their final documents. I have devised a solution to prevent this mistake from happening again. I am gonna ask for access to the lawpay website to check if clients have paid, so I can easily check before mailing (not every High Rise case gets regularly updated notes). I am going to be digging through all the high rise notes from now on before doing anything with docs, and I am going to always ask my boss if the final docs are good to be mailed before preparing any docs to go out. With that being said, I still have to discuss what happened with my boss :(

I just really hate I didn’t read all the high rise notes on the case before completing my task. I was just seeing task like “mail and email final docs to clients” on High rise with a time stamp of “due today” and  was so wrapped up in insuring all the docs were prepare correctly, with a correct cover letter, a correct address, and finished on time, that scrolling through the notes on the case didn’t occur to me. I wish I had caught this earlier too. I was so hung up on the quality of that task that I didn’t make sure it was good to be completed. 

Has this ever happened to anybody? What type of reaction should expect? Will they want to fire me?",LizzieTheLolita,1,1.0,0,1698634509,2023-10-30 02:55:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jjs2k/been_making_the_same_mistake_unknowingly/,10,2023
17jixzu,My boss hired a headhunter to recruit an assistant manager for me. The assistant manager makes only $5k less than me. Feels unfair?,"So I've been working at the job for a few years and over a year ago was promoted to General Manager. I didn't get a raise increase during my promotion because I had recently gotten a raise a few months before this. 
That aside, it's been over a year now since my last raise and since I was promoted to GM. My boss recently hired a new Assistant Manager making only $5k less then me in salary. (When broken down mathimatically, I make $2.40 more than them an hour). 
This makes me feel really weird. Not gunna lie. I've been busting my ass for this place and training new hires non stop. I asked my boss if we could talk and they said yes then never brought it up again. 
The new hire has a bachelor's in business and I think my boss is expecting them to be amazing. I'm literally one class away from my associates and have been in this field of business for 6+ years now. Why do I feel like I'm looked at like lesser? 
I'm not perfect and I've messed up a few times in the past, but it feels like they don't think I'm smart. Like I have no support. Maybe it's just too much history now and I need to move on.

17jiuqf,Dropping out of college?,"Hi Reddit. I wanted to know some opinions on whether or not I should drop out of college due to my extreme burn out. Not sure if it’s the place for it, but I need to get it out. (Please let me know if it’s not!!!)

For a little backstory, I graduated high school this year. I never managed to find a career path I wanted to pursue or any kind of job that I wanted. I’ve spent a lot of time researching potential careers/jobs/apprenticeships/etc trying to find something that suits me and I always come up short. 

I wasn’t planning on going to college or any extra school, but my local community college was offering free tuition to any 2023 graduates. My parents thought it would be good for me to at least get some base courses in since it was free of charge and I wouldn’t have to worry about moving (online courses). I thought this was a good idea as well, and I was genuinely excited to maybe pursue something new and get a higher education. 

Fast forward to current day, and I’m completely and utterly burnt out. Depressed, messy, failing my classes, you name it. I failed both of my classes for my first section (eight week classes is how my college does their courses) and now I’m already failing my second set. My main issue is I have absolutely no motivation to continue with anything these classes give me. I can barely bring myself to read the textbook, let alone do assignments. Failing these classes makes me so depressed because I want to be able to show something for myself but I fall short.

 To sum it up, would it be wrong of me to just drop out of these classes and give myself time to rest? I’m already employed, so it’s not like I don’t make any money. I’m not opposed to going to college in the future. My family is not unwealthy by any means, so money isn’t an issue for me either. I just feel like being enrolled and failing the courses is just the same as not having any classes at all. 

Sorry for the lengthy post. Any advice is really appreciated. 

TL;DR : college is killing me and I’m crazy burnt out. Advice on dropping out or just pushing through?",richisaloser,2,1.0,1,1698631590,2023-10-30 02:06:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jiuqf/dropping_out_of_college/,10,2023
17jieiy,Australia APS would you take the offer/ any advice?,"Hey all, 

Background: 
I (27f) started in a team as APS4 in early 2021 24 month contract. I worked in a team and frankly do more than I need to/ work at a higher level in my and others opinion, I was able to act as an APS6 in a sub team of my current area for about 5ish months this year via Expressions of Intrests (EOI) (1.5 months early this year + 3 months later this year). The person that owns the role is elsewere until end of January 2024. 

Due to the EOI length being maxxed out I went back to my old APS4 role in August after the 3 months, much to the APS6 managers dismay. At the same time, I applied with others for the 6 month contract for the APS6 role. I just completed my interview in very late October and was told at the beginning of the interview, that due to the recruitment process being so delayed the contract has changed from 6 months to 3 months, likely starting in November and ending in January. I feel that I did extremely well in the interview, have experience in the role and a good relationship with the team so I am very confident that I will get the offer.

I am in the process of being converted in my APS4 role to permanent, but it has not gone through yet and it has been in the process for months at this point. 

I have further context/ concerns below then items I am seeking advise on. 

Further context
- the manager of the APS6 is on leave for all of January and I suspect that the person above them will also be away for a week or two which means that APS6 will be the main contact for the small team during that time. 

- APS4 is the lowest role in the team. No one is looking to move up into that role in the current team. 

- During any leave I took in the last couple of years as the APS4 I prepared hard and caught up on the 90% of the work that was not actioned when I returned. Its very administration based so I was mostly able to. 

- When on the 3 month EOI I was meant to have a 1 week 50/50 transition but ended up covering most of the APS4 role for 3-4 weeks and then spent the next 8 weeks training and assisting 2 people (first person got hired for a way better job about 3 weeks in) that responded to EOIs to cover which was very time consuming and caused a great ammount of frustration for me and the Manager of the APS6 role. 

 - if I get the role I know that I will be expected to train and support the person if there is a cover for the APS4 role, which is a challenge that others being hired from outside the team would not need to deal with this. 

- The APS4 role reports to the same person  that Manager above the APS6 reports to. There is no way to escalate team concerns about the the ammount of time the training the APS4 takes. 

   - APS6 role is unable to do overtime. 

   - Other team members were frustrated with me during the acting position as some things that I do were not getting done as it was out of scope and skill of the APS4 role and I was told not to do those items. 

- I think if I get offered prior to my permanency going through it means I will be unemployed after the end of the contract and I believe that there will not be much hiring until late February due to holidays. 

Advice: 

- would you take the 3 month higher level role?  Why/ why not?

- I am looking to move into a higher position / move on but I am extremely bogged down with work, so creating more guides ect isn't possible at this time, although I have done a decent ammount already. How do I keep learning, being helpful without setting up the next person in the role for failure by taking on too much/out of scope work? 

- if I want to take the APS6 role how would you negotiate, the extra responsibility that covering the APS4 or training the APS4 role entails in addition to the higher duties? 
 - I was thinking that I could asked to be paid at a higher level and/or ask for 10-15 hours per week over time to complete about 70ish% of the task.

-is the the extra 3 months at a higher role worth it to my CV or am I just wasting my time?

If you have any advice please let me know.",Crazy_Area2621,1,1.0,0,1698630235,2023-10-30 01:43:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17jieiy/australia_aps_would_you_take_the_offer_any_advice/,10,2023

17jhflo,How do I bring up my boss’s mistake on a task that I asked her to do on a project that will make or break my job?,"I have a big year-end holiday gifting project that requires months of preparation, tons of stakeholders, and generosity from the supply chain gods during the busiest season of the year. I’m in an entry-level role but expected to manage a six-figure project without any hiccups, and I still get chest pains and migraines thinking about how poorly last year's project went. It was so bad I was nearly put on a PIP.  
For context: Last year, our exco wanted 500+ gifts to be sent out by December 10 but didn’t approve the gift concept until AFTER Thanksgiving, leaving me to scramble to rush everything and production delays caused the gifts to be sent out after the new year. When I told my direct manager that something was delayed in transit, she sent me an ESSAY ripping into my incompetence and saying how she refused to cut corners because of my poor planning, and how annoyed she was that everything was going wrong at the eleventh hour for my project with everything else going on during our EOY madness. My managers were furious, our CMO calls it a “s\*\*tshow” to this day, and I went into this year planning the project months ahead knowing people were expecting me to fail. Last year’s project was so bad I think it’s one of the reasons our VP switched my manager to Sandy (fake name) instead of putting me on a PIP.  
Sandy is great, and she worked on last year’s project too, and she’s been helpful and we’re light years ahead of where we were last year. Now the problem: I went on PTO for two weeks then was working remotely for about a week, so I was away for the better part of 3 weeks. Before that time, I asked Sandy to place a sample for packaging to make sure we could meet our warehouse’s timelines and keep the ball rolling by the time I got back. I was clear in my OOO doc, telling Sandy that she had to run the quotes by the VP for approval, place a sample order, and kick off production.  
When I got back online after the first two weeks, nothing had progressed. Nobody had sent the sample items to the warehouse to properly quote us for packaging. Since I was remote, I emailed three people - Sandy, my gifting “sub” to handle physical gifts while I was out, and one other person - asking them to send out the pre-assembled box I left by my desk. And nobody did. Okay, I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they were all busy. So I sent the samples when I got back, which set us back another week.  
NOW the warehouse is telling us we waited too long and the packaging will not be ready by our deploy date. I reached out to SEVEN other vendors to try to expedite something, and then got an email that the warehouse needed the packaging two weeks earlier than expected. Which Sandy found out while I was OOO (she was CC’ed on the first email notifying us of the two-week change) but she did not tell me. So I’m trying to find a place to mass-produce 1000+ custom packages in less than a month, which isn’t cheap.  
I met with Sandy and told her this, and she was visibly upset. Mind you, she’s an INCREDIBLY professional person, so seeing cracks in her reaction was terrifying and gave me PTSD from the essay my old manager gave me about last year’s “s\*\*tshow” (which, by the way, Sandy had also received since that essay was sent in a three-way chat including her). Sandy professionally told me that she is worried this will be a repeat of last year’s mess, and she wants to make sure I am “on top of this”. I silently agreed.  
The thing is, I’ve been back for two weeks and I feel like it’s too long of a time for me to “point the finger” back at Sandy when she and I already talked about how this delay has set us back. I didn’t realize that the warehouse changed the dates or that she didn’t do anything until after our meeting. I was too busy trying to find a fix until I remembered my OOO doc and there it is, plain as day, Sandy’s name beside the to-do list I gave her that I am now scrambling to do because my PTO cost us three weeks.  
How do I bring this up to her? I’m scared of being ripped apart again. I don’t want it to seem like I’m deflecting, and having a he-said-she-said argument is not going to bring those three weeks back on my project. If we delay this project any longer, it will inevitably be brought up in my performance review that I consistently mess this big project up.

17jhf3v,"My job is starting to make me feel very exhausted, down, frustrated and close to depressed, but my salary is good and I’m a single parent","Hi there. I’ve been working for six years at said company. I started as a sales rep, and I’m now a senior sales manager and look to be fairly close to getting the head of sales position. I’m proud of myself for this. 

I understand that as you move up, you have to expect more stress and more responsibility. This isn’t a huge issue for me as I’ve always done a good job of being ahead of deadlines and on top of my work load such that I don’t need to spend insane hours catching up. 

Recently, the company has struggled. This has happened before, but this time I feel my higher ups are doing a terrible job of handling it. They’re frazzled and prickly with everyone (including each other) and they’re doing a terrible job at guiding the teams they need to guide. I’m at the point, for the first time, where it’s taking a toll on me. I dread work now (something I’ve never felt here), I feel very low and unmotivated, and I feel myself getting irritable and prickly.

The downside is that I earn a good salary. I’m a single dad so I need to make ok money. Through this job, I’ve moved me and my daughter from a studio to a two bedroom which feels like a non negotiable now. 

My work load has been head of sales for about a year now, but I don’t have the title so I’m worried I won’t be able to attract anything with the same responsibilities and pay. Should I stick with it?

17jfgah,Considering leaving government job for private sector,"Hi everyone,

I'm weighing the pros and cons of leaving a comfortable government job for a private construction company. I am currently completing my commercial transport mechanic apprenticeship with a municipal government but am fairly disheartened with the workplace drama, slow pace and the type of work I am exposed to on a daily basis. 

I changed careers three years ago after working as a cook with the goal of becoming a heavy duty equipment mechanic. I landed the job I have now right out of school and they offered to take me on as CT mechanic which is slightly less specialized than what I really want to be doing. We work very slowly and send almost any major repairs out to different companies or dealerships instead of doing them in house. I am worried that if I stay I won't be exposed to enough and will not gain the proper experience to feel competent If I ever do leave. I also won't have the ticket I truly want, which is, IMHO a more employable ticket to have. Furthermore, I do not like my two bosses at all. They are egotistical and incredibly difficult to deal with on a daily basis. They treat most people badly and its a very open secret in the workplace that they are disliked by almost everyone employed in the yard. 

The perks of the job are obviously the security, benefits and union perks. I get paid breaks, leave at the same time each day and don't need to worry about being laid off. 

The new job I have been offered is with a small family owened construction company. They are willing to sponsor me as a heavy duty mechanic, which is the ticket I truly want to earn. The pay is the same and they are willing to pay my tuition and wage while they I go back to school for levels 3 and 4. (current job only covers wages). Time off each year is the same at three weeks and they do an RRSP match and health benefits. The commute is also about 15 mins shorter. 

The cons of the new job are that the shop is not nearly as new or well designed as where I currently work. It is very small and really not much to write home about. However I would have much more exposure to major repairs and overhauls that would never take place at my current job. The other unknown is the other mechanics. I met the foreman who I got a very good vibe from, but the other two mechanics I will be working with are total question marks. As an apprentice I really depend on having quality mechanics who are willing to support me and teach me what they know. This is possibly the biggest change I am worried about. 

I am hoping to make a decision as soon as possible but I feel I have gotten too comfortable in the job I am in now even though I feel it is at the expense of my professional growth and future opportunities.

17jejyy,How to make time for new job applications while working a full-time job?,"I'm currently looking for a new role, but I'm struggling to keep up with job applications and interview prep while working a full-time job. It's especially difficult because I'm in a ""leadership"" role at a high-paced startup, so it's not unusual for us to have to work overtime to meet deadlines and for higher-ups to request last minute meetings at the most random times.

I am trying to stay more in the background and ""let go"" of my sense of responsibility, but it's difficult.

**Question**: How did you guys manage looking for a new role while working full-time? How do convince myself to let go of responsibilities and prioritise the job hunt?

I know that I am going to wait to ask about how accepting the company is for trans/gnc folks until after a job offer in writing to avoid any transphobia etc. 

However, what I can’t decide on is whether I should tell the interviewer my pronouns casually. I know it tends to be easier for people to remember pronouns when they only ever know me as those pronouns, but I am a bit worried this might cause hesitation in hiring me.

17jaoeu,Choosing Between IT and Philosophy: Seeking Career Guidance,"Hello, I'm currently 19 and just started my first year at university a few months ago. I find myself facing a significant predicament and I'm hoping to seek advice!!  
  
  
  
The main challenge I'm facing revolves around my hatred of mathematics, a crucial component in technology-related fields. Conversely, I have an unwavering passion for philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology, and all things related to the social sciences. I can easily dedicate 8 hours to reading and continuously write on even the most mundane topics in these subjects. Yet, the mere thought of engaging with math for an hour fills me with dread, leading me to prefer delving into a political theory textbook instead.  
  
My current degree is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, but I'm contemplating a shift to a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Politics. What's making me feel so apprehensive is the potential lack of a secure career path and financial stability that might accompany this change. I acknowledge that no degree guarantees immediate job prospects; success demands hard work and practical experience. Unfortunately, Arts degrees often carry the stigma of leading to ambiguous career paths.  
  
I can probably endure the annoying discrete math, calculus, and programming classes. However, the end reward seems like a well-paying job in the tech sector, which I'm uncertain that I genuinely care about. While the idea of working remotely, programming, and earning a comfortable income sounds amazing, I'm unsure if that's the lifestyle I envision for myself. What truly makes me happy is the notion of becoming an educator, lawyer, or professor, where I can engage with people directly and make a meaningful difference. I see myself as an artistic individual, drawn to literature and the social sciences, rather than being confined to a corporate programming job for the foreseeable future. Even a master's in argumentation studies sounds like something I would love doing or even law school.  
  
Perhaps my concerns stem from stereotypical assumptions associated with these academic paths. It's plausible that I could carve a path where I pursue a teaching career while also having the flexibility to explore opportunities in the technology sector. I just don't know if that's possible if I take all Philosophy and Poli Sci courses the next 4 years.  
  
  
  
TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old student torn between enduring an I.T degree or changing my major to philosophy and politics. I'm worried about future job options, as arts degrees can seem uncertain, but I am willing to put in the work into anything as long as I “like” it. Unsure if a tech job is for me, dreaming of teaching or law instead. Trying to find a middle ground between my passions and practicality.

17jajxz,"Need advice about setting boundaries with a superior coworker in new job - dealing with ineffective communication, excuses, selective communication and passive aggressiveness. Any scripts for boundaries with this guy when he's at the director level?","**TLDR**: I've been in my current marketing specialist role for about 5 months and have encountered some challenges when working with our Business Intelligence (BI) team, particularly with the BI director, ""Alan."" In meetings, Alan tends to be all over the place and frequently opts for video calls for simple written questions, which can extend the duration of discussions unnecessarily. I've also noticed a tendency for Alan to provide a multitude of excuses when facing delays or challenges.

His difficulty in understanding basic marketing data metrics further hinders effective collaboration. **Then he tries to get me alone without my boss ""Stu"", I think, because maybe he expects me to be a pushover?**

&#x200B;

* About a month ago I was meeting with my boss's boss ""Phil"" and Alan for a pending report. In that meeting, Alan was clearly annoyed. Again, a bunch of excuses on why he couldn't get them done, or what he needed to do first. Phil had to drop off the meeting a few minutes early so Alan and I stayed on a few minutes more. Then he goes, ""don't worry, I haven't forgotten about your stuff, I know setting up this meeting probably wasn't your decision...""
* During another working session at the start he says, ""apologies if I accidently call you ""Jade"" in this."" Jade is another woman who started about the same time as me  

* I copy Stu on all emails to Alan, and in the same Slack chat messages, but he likes to respond with only me on the email, or with a separate chat or video call, cutting out Stu
* Last Friday, Alan initiated an unnecessary 45-minute call on a issue, without including Stu at 4PM. I should have said no, but I thought it was going to be a quick thing. It ended up being 45 minutes, with the last 10 minutes of me telling them I needed to drop off. That call didn't need to happen and he was all over the place.

I tend to be a people pleaser at work and I need to start setting boundaries with this guy. I can start by declining when he video calls me at random and calling him out when he tries to drop Stu from any updates. It's very obvious he's cutting out Stu from important updates because he thinks I'll be easier to walk over.

With the outstanding tickets I'm waiting on from him, should I even bother asking, ""what's the update on these?"" Should I instead let Phil and Stu know these are the current blockers and answer ""I don't know"" when they ask what the timeline is?

Now there are some colleges in the country that i am looking to study which don’t require GMAT/GRE, and some that require it. There is a college which Ranks at 25th out of 100 colleges, which doesn’t require GMAT/GRE. But the ones which are in Top 10 require you to have GMAT. 

Now my situation is that to apply for top rated ones i need GMAT, for that i need atleast 3-4 months to prepare, which would lead to all the application for top rated colleges to be closed and i would have to apply for them next year in 2024 and then my Maters would start in 2025.

17j8hyz,Med Student to Management Consulting (Non-Traditional Background) - Should I Get an MBA?,"Hello, I was a medical student in an accelerated BS/MD program, where high schoolers are offered guaranteed admission into medical school upon graduation from high school. I was in the program for about 3 years, but had to withdraw due to academic underperformance. I am potentially interested in making a career change to management consulting. However, I am worried if this is smart or even possible at all, given that I am completely underqualified for this career. My resume is completely healthcare-focused, and I do not have any experience in the business sector or doing any internships for management consultant firms (I never had the chance as I went straight into medical school from high school).

  
Background Information: Unfortunately, my grades in medical school combined with my undergraduate coursework grades (I had a 3.96 in college classes counting towards my Biology degree, but once I got in medical school I got a string of Cs and Ds which tanked my grade to a 3.3). Now that I am out of the program, I can complete my Bachelor's in Biology this spring with a 3.4 (I am only missing 3 credits), or delay graduation and take additional gen ed courses till Summer 2024 to get a 3.5 GPA (I am 22, the equivalent of a college senior if I didn't attend the BS/MD program).

  
Unfortunately, I have never had work experience (only done non-paid internships to get into medical school, and in medical school I spent 8 months doing basically a paid internship), and I do not currently attend a big-name school (no recruiters, non-target). However, I do have a good amount of leadership positions, a multitude of clinical research awards and publications, and I could spin some of my medical school internship or volunteer experiences to be slightly more suitable for consulting.  


My primary goal is to get placed into the best possible consulting firms out the gate, and to be able to beat the ""up-or-out"" policy via being as well-prepared as possible to excel at my job when I come in. I am aware major consulting firms very rarely make lateral hires from consultants at smaller firms, so I would appreciate any advice on a path moving forward that would help me break into the best consulting firm possible while also being ready to do well in the job, rather than just to break in and get caught with my pants down and then get put on PIP/fired for poor performance evaluations.

  
The main questions that I have which I humbly seek advice for is:

  
1. Is Management Consulting a feasible reality for me, or should I be realistic and consider trying for a different career?  


2. Should I apply for management consulting firms right out of graduation from my college, or should I try to apply for a top 15-30 MBA school first, or should I become a transfer student and go back to college to get a business degree (Finance/Economics) and use those 3/4 years to network, get consulting internships, related work experience, etc.? My options if I transfer would only be University of Washington or UT Austin.  


3. Do you think getting accepted into top 15-30 MBA schools is even a possibility for me at this point, considering I have zero business-related extracurriculars and I only have a 3.4 or 3.5? I heard if you don't get into a big name MBA school, your MBA isn't really worth it. I also heard getting an MBA right out of college is a ""waste"" since you are supposed to use it as a ""reset card"" for career changers or for career promotions, once you already have 4-5 years of work experience. If getting an MBA is still recommended to break into consulting, how would you recommend I bolster my application to become competitive for an MBA in such a short timespan considering I am the equivalent of a college senior?  


4. Should I try to graduate as soon as possible (Spring 2024) with my potential 3.4 GPA, or should I graduate in Summer 2024, take business classes, and get a potential 3.5 GPA?  


Thank you so much in advance, I would greatly appreciate any constructive criticism or input!",AnthonyLe9,2,1.0,1,1698602201,2023-10-29 17:56:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17j8hyz/med_student_to_management_consulting/,10,2023
17j71g0,Considering a Job Switch (Sales and Marketing),"I am writing this on behalf of my mother(50) since she's not on reddit.  
She is currently working as Assistant sales manager for a company in the plastic packaging industry. Her job essentially is to maximise sales and maintaining customer relationships. She joined the current company in the month of March of this year 2023 and is fairly happy at the current job. However, recently she has been getting calls from an employee of another organisation asking if she can join them (I have done the bg check on the person he seems legit, also its a public company so chances of any fraud is minimal). She also talked with the VP of that company and he asked for her Resume.   
Need advice on whether she should make the switch so soon after joining the current company or should wait sometime and ask for big salary increment in the current compnay at the end of the financial cycle ??  
Please note that she left her previous job in March because of huge work pressure and a very low salary. Despite this, she is willing to work under any pressure even now although she feels like she should be paid enough.

  
 I've listed some pros and cons of both the jobs below.  
**Current Company:**  
Pros:  
Work freedom (ability to make decisions autonomously), WFH flexibility, Low work pressure, commute to office is easy  
Cons:  
Lack of office perks, a lack of focus from upper management, occasional cooperation issues with fellow employees, slow reimbursement process for the field trip expenses.  
**New Company:**  
Pros:  
Offering a much better salary, office perks, willing to give WFH, high revenue company   
Cons:

17j5pdk,34 M career advice,"I live in British Columbia , Canada. For the past say 15 years I travelled to many counrries while for the frist half i was doing mostly restaurant, front of house work. I transitioned into construction. Mostly carpentry/home rennovations. I have now settled in BC and have been working for the same company coming up to 3 years. I am currrently on £35 an hour. And in all i enjoyed it. However after having a work asccident and realising long term this is not the best longterm plan for myself I need help on what fields i could potentially go down. 

 Accademically i am not the best. But hands on with any work i have always been able to pick the job up quickly, and take in information first time. 

I have also been someone that is very easy to work with and have around. Never left a job on bad terms and always welcomed back if needed.

I am someone if somebody gave me a task with no instructions i would find a way to finish said task. I like problem solving, and can come up wirh endless ideas. If most wont work one will.

I would like the idea of a bit more freedom in life. This comes with travelling alot. Happy to put the work int but 3 weeks a year holidays is a scary thought, considering i lose half over xmas.


Any help suggestions would be great appreciate your help

17j3481,"Need help. 19 aspiring writer forced into college, I don't want to be here","Basically as the title says, I want to be a writer, and I am currently majoring in Creative Writing with a history minor, but I feel like it's unnecessary. I want to be working a better job than I am at Walmart, one that pays better, like much better. I've looked at trades like HVAC, bricklaying, electrician, etc and they all take around 3ish years to finish my apprenticeship, at least in Michigan. I'm considering dropping out, and trying my hand out at one of these, but I don't know if it's a big mistake. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For one, my dad bought me everything for college, like a TV, a refrigerator, and a laptop, and he gives me $200 every 2 weeks. I never asked for any of these things, but my dad bought them for me anyway. My dad is a lot like Jodi Arrias, he is a chameleon, he pretends he's nice but he's very manipulative. I don't really like my dad. He's the cause of my parents divorce, and the cause of multiple injuries I had when I was little. Basically, I'm afraid if I drop out of college, he will be hounding on my ass, trying to screw me over financially. I asked BOTH of my parents about trades when I was 16, and they both said no. So now if I do something that I want, I will lose support from both of them. 

&#x200B;

I know I don't need the creative writing degree to be a good writer, and I don't want to do anything in college involving STEM, law, medical or dental. The fastest I can graduate is Fall '25, which is shorter than it would take for me to finish an apprenticeship program, but I would be making more money in a trade, and I can potentially be able to live on my own as well. I'm really stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I am not sure what I should do because if I take this leap, I don't know if I will regret it.",basedroman,0,0.18000000715255737,19,1698586680,2023-10-29 13:38:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17j3481/need_help_19_aspiring_writer_forced_into_college/,10,2023

There's a huge chance for me to move abroad, outta Asia, maybe USA or Canada. I need a career that  
1)is easy to get into 
2)I can learn by myself 
3) it's the same all around the world so I wouldn't be worried about my day-to-day life expenses in other countries.
Salary isn't my biggest concern at this moment. I’m open to investing in my knowledge and getting experience so maybe I can get a better position in like +5 years.
I did some research and I found out IT might be 
a good choice since I need to learn the field online, and it is indeed kinda the same thing in every country.
My problem is, I'm not sure which career path I should get in.
1) Web development seems interesting, I can learn coding, but I don't get math. So I was thinking about learning HTML CSS javascript React, etc instead of Python.
2) SEO seems quite easy as well. But I'm not sure if it’s really in demand. Is it worth it?
3) UX/UI same as SEO
4) I have no clue about data analysis and stuff

17iydxc,How do I protect my work from my credit-grabbing boss?,"I'm signed to this agency as an Independent Contractor for some of their projects. But, after several experiences of my boss (who's also the CEO) taking credit for the work of numerous creatives (most of which are fresh out of school btw), I've had enough. I stopped going to their social gatherings, although I continued to deliver on my work. That CEO is fairly narcissistic though and might've taken offense when I started emotionally distancing myself from the team. And yes, it is the type of workplace setting that screams ""We're family here!""  
  
  
  
Lately I heard the CEO will be building a marketing course to sell to freelancers. Mind you, this CEO has never touched, wrote or presented a Maketing / Branding Strategy to a client. She asked me to send over a few marketing resources, which I didn't because it is not part of my job to be her coach. Again, she might've taken offense from this and is now requesting to access all of my working strategy decks on Figma. I have a sneaking suspicion that she'll use these as templates to sell as part of that marketing course. I offered to send the end product of these files (basically the PDFs, all of which HAS ALREADY BEEN SENT AND APPROVED BY CLIENTS BTW so I'm basically collecting and resending them just so she shuts up) but she's demanding that I give access to the working files themselves. It's so fucking suspicious.  
  
  
  
They also hired a new member of the team who loves to butter her up. So I have a stronger feeling that they're gonna end my contract by the end of the year. I can't leave just yet, because I have projects (I work directly with their clients because they don't have an accounts department LOL) so I'm at my wits end trying to figure out a way to say NO or protect my intellectual property.  
  
  
  
They also scheduled a ""knowledge transfer"" meeting with that newbie (who has no experience in marketing at all) and I'm very sure they're gonna record the zoom meeting. BTW is there a way for me to fuck up their recording? LOL. I just don't want my hardwork stolen and sold at a few dollars a pop.

17iovoi,My boss expected me to know everything in 5 days…,"I just started working in a small business this week. I don’t have any experience before so the manager said they will train me.

At first, everyone was very nice and told me that they would teach me how to do things step by step. But after 4 days, the manager started showing up late (or never showed up at work) and I had to handle a lot of things, especially complaints from customers receiving services WEEKS ago.

Today, I was so stressed out because I am new and I didn’t even know what service the customers received and how to handle these situations. When I called and asked my manager (who was supposed to train me but barely show up today) about those complaints, he said my communication is bad (like wtf?) and I am not a fast learner like I said before. I really want to know what is their definition of fast learner when they are expecting me who just work for 5 days to know EVERY NEW THING. And if I ask them anything, the only response is that “this is COMMON SENSE and you SHOULD KNOW”. 

My boss was here today, and he saw that I was overwhelmed with many customers calling to complain this morning and didn’t know how to handle them. He didn’t like it. The manager didn’t come to the office until noon, but when the manager came, my boss immediately talked with the manager about me in his office. The manager came out and started talking with me about today situation. The boss even told me to leave my work for another co-worker to do.

Now I think I’m gonna quit after getting enough experience. There are so many red flags with this business, but because I wanted to get a job quickly, I tried not to care about those red flags.

The first red flag is that a lot of customers told me that they always see a new employee working here. People working here before me always quit the job after a few months.

The second red flag is that the manager used to tell me that he may be yelling a little bit, and ask me not to take it personal. Now I know what “a little bit” means for him.

The third red flag may be the low pay. The pay is average, but compared to the workload and the bad training, it is not enough.

I have received pretty good annual performance evals with positive comments/recognition on them from my supervisor and director for the past 3 years. I’ve been told my work is of very good quality.

17ik4dp,"BBA graduate , little experience in different areas, post career break, seeking advice from you!","Hey,  
I could use some guidance on my current situation. I've spent the past year in Australia on a working holiday visa, doing various casual jobs to improve my English. Before that, I worked for a multinational brewery for three years, taking on roles like commercial analyst, marketing coordinator, and product owner for two digital projects.  
  
Here's a quick rundown of my background:  
  
Bachelor's degree in business management.  
1 year of experience as a commercial analyst (excel, dashboards, reporting, some sales, expense tracking, budget management).  
1 year in marketing (built successful stakeholder relationships, executed off-trade marketing, managed customer experiences, handled briefings, and delved into influencer marketing).  
1 year as a product owner (handled backlogs, sprint planning, etc.).  
Fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  
EU citizen originally from South America.  
Honestly, I feel like I don't have a standout specialty. I'm not exceptional in any specific area. So, I'm looking for advice on where to focus my career to maximize earnings in the coming years. If there's a chance for sponsorship in Australia, that would be fantastic. I'm also considering relocating to a European country next year, though I worry that not knowing French or German might limit my opportunities, especially in terms of salary.",supertoni,1,1.0,0,1698518471,2023-10-28 18:41:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ik4dp/bba_graduate_little_experience_in_different_areas/,10,2023
17ijbs0,thinking about quitting my second job,"so, I got a second job as a brand rep with a clothing company in September out of the need for a little extra cash and having a freakout about where I wanted to take my career. the company said growth and development is possible and at the time, that sounded appealing to me. I've worked retail before in my early 20s and it did a number on my mental health. like ""having anxiety attacks before shifts, stress dreams for years after"" kind of a number. but I thought ""hey, I'm older now maybe things will be different."" the job so far has been fine. the clothes are nice but not really my style and things have been slow so it's been boring. however, I can tell being back in retail and just having another job is already doing a number on my mental health. and if I'm being honest, I've been interested in having a career in tech despite hearing how competitive it is right now.

I've been at my other job with a dog daycare for almost three years now and I've really enjoyed it. my bosses are lovely people, the clients we have are great and treat us to with gifts, lunches, and other nice things, the schedule can be pretty flexible, and I just recently got a raise. I'll be making a bit more than with the brand rep job. sure, there isn't as much growth and development with them but it pays decently, I feel like I can have more of a life with this job, and hanging out with dogs regularly is a mostly fun time.

I feel bad about wanting to quit the brand rep job so soon but something in my heart is telling me this isn't the right career path for me. just having the dog daycare job would give me a lot more type to focus on trying to get the tech career going. should I just rip the band-aid and let the clothing brand know this isn't working for me and put in my two weeks? or stick it out for a bit so that it looks good on my resume?

17igldg,Accidentally made fun of my boss - need advice,"Hi – for some background, I work in a corporate setting and I started this job in March.

On Tuesday we had a fire drill and all the employees had to gather around the hallway. As we were gathered in the hallway, i heard the VP (the boss of my specific department) talk about work to another employee. At this moment I thought it was funny. 

On Thursday, we had a happy hour in the office. We were all gathered in the boardroom. The same VP from above walks in, and stands by the door instead of taking a seat. An employee encourages him to take a break and “put his feet up”. At this point, (in relation to “he works a lot, he needs a break”) I say “he was talking about work during the Fire drill”

At this point I kind of black out because I realized I was better off not picking fun. From what I remember, some people laughed and he said I was talking to X not you. And my response was “still work. This was followed by a silent pause until the subject changed. 

I felt my face turn red, and I can’t stop thinking about this. My sentiment was to be lighthearted and funny. This can be innocuous and I’m overthinking it, or I need to apologize. Did I mess up? What do you guys think?

17ifwem,I really don't want to be a boss but all eyes are on me,"I work in a communications office and about two years ago my boss (I'll call him Adam) broke down at work. He was placed on leave and another team member stepped up to take his place. She left our company a few months into being team manager for a different opportunity. My original boss, Adam, became my boss once again because he returned from his leave, got the help he needed, and seemed  fit to resume his normal duties. 

Everything was good for a while and I was promoted to assistant manager. My team is the largest one in my department and I consider Adam a friend, so I was happy to help him out like this. Plus I've been there 4 years now and felt ok making that jump. It's just the right amount of responsibility I'm comfortable with. In my role as assistant manager, I help Adam field questions from other team members, show them how to do more technical tasks, help divvy out work when people are out and serve as the backup manager if Adam wanted to take time off. I've been in this role less than 6 months.

Adam is struggling with his mental health again and is out of the office again for the time being. To my knowledge he's going to be placed on leave again. I'm not going to get into all the details but he (like last time) was acting extremely erratically at work to the point where he was scaring people. I care about Adam and I want him to be ok, so I spoke with a higher up about my concerns with him who then immediately got the ball rolling on intervention measures. Now in Adam's absence, I have to assume his duties for the foreseeable future. I understand that's what I signed up for and I'm ok with that, but I do not want to make the official leap to take his job. There is way too much to oversee, not paid enough and I do not want it to throw off my work/life balance. Like I said before, I am very content where I am. Everyone keeps asking me if I'm going to be the manager and I give them all the same answer, ""I don't want to be."" But it seems like I almost have no choice if I want to stay in my department. 

The people who had this job either broke down (more than once) or left a year in. I DON'T WANT IT. I am not confident in my abilities to lead people, I'm pretty introverted and have horrendous phone anxiety, I make mistakes just like everyone else, I'm very conflicted avoidant, I just do not see myself as a boss. 

A higher up was apparently talking saying that I'm ""perfect for the job"" because of what all happened with Adam's second breakdown, but the way I see it, all I did was speak up for someone I consider a friend and fulfill my current job duties as they are written. Nothing more.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation who can offer advice? I genuinely don't want to be in charge, I have no shame in saying I'm a follower and not a leader.

I've spent the last 8 years in environmental engineering, which I find quite interesting, but I'm not doing very well and I'm still at a relatively junior level.

Thing is that I'm a big picture first kind of thinker. I do appreciate and focus on the details, but only when the big picture has been established at a high level resolution.  Problem is that the way most people work in my industry is very different - methodical and step by step. As a result I persistently develop a reputation as someone with poor attention to detail and who's a bit incompetent. I don't think that's necessarily true, but because of the industry processes that I'm expected to undertake, i dont have the right type of attention to detail, if that makes sense.

I'm a bit fed up of it really and want to change industry to somethjng that actually suits my skills and working style. Is there anything that could conceivably be more suitable? For context I have a masters degree in environmental science - obviously many industries would need a different degree, but sadly that's not an option me at this stage of my life.",MC1000,0,0.5,3,1698503181,2023-10-28 14:26:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17iew8i/suitable_careers_for_a_bigpicture_thinker/,10,2023

A colleague is getting ready to go for maternity leave and pretty sure I'll be the one asked to take over her role. We're in similar, lateral roles. I trained her as I used to fill this role and my other colleagues are unfamiliar with the work. We were recently asked to provide an overview of our projects/effort ""to see what can be delegated"". I've had one meeting delegated which was quickly replaced with two others as we're all working on an important project with a tight turnaround. My existing role is stressful enough as it is. What questions should I come prepared with, and how can I ask for temporary compensation while covering this role? How do I handle any pushback from leadership? 

P.S. I work for one of the largest companies in my state. They have the money. If I left tomorrow they'd hire a consultant at double my rate to cover this so money is not an issue.

P.P.S. I understand my employer can assign me any duties and i'm not entitled any additional comp but given how understaffed they are and the lack of resources available to both cover this tole and the priority project i feel justified in asking for additional comp, and there is precedent for it.

17ibea7,"My boss ""did not accept my resignation notice"" and told me that day was my final day.. what do I do?","This will be slightly lengthy, so I hope someone reads it. I work in healthcare as a surgical technologist. I worked for a very large hospital (employs about 10k). There are MANY problems that I had there, mainly being job discrimination. As a surgical tech working along RNs, we were regularly treated unfairly there. Some examples are in our 8 hour shift, the RNs in our surgery department were offered morning 15 minute breaks every single day. On our schedule that day, they would have someone scheduled to come in the ORs to give each nurse a scheduled break, there was also someone to be someone to be scheduled to get the surgical techs a break, but the charge nurse would always draw a line through those schedules. So in my over a year working there, I was never once (or any other tech for that matter) offered a 15 minute break that all nurses were entitled to. Also, all nurses parked in a parking garage on the campus, while some techs such as much had to park in a parking lot LITERALLY A MILE from the building I worked in. Parking is suppose to be seniority base, but even nurses hired in after me, parked in covered garages while I was still in the further lot. Bringing this up I was constantly told there was nothing that could be done about it. As far as breaks, management literally acted like it was absurd that the surgical techs felt they also deserved a break, like they just simply couldn't believe that. Fast forward, I put in a notice of resignation, it was slightly under a 2 week notice. My boss told me ""that she wasn't going to accept that"" and that that day was going to be my last day bc they were ""overstaffed"" the next week, when they actually aren't.

17ib6kd,Career advice for someone with strong passions: Do you follow your passion?,"I have strong passions for writing and for music, and have also been complimented by other professionals who said I have talent. However, I still feel like it's an unrealistic career path, and that I'm foolish and wasting my time by not doing something more practical. 

I know the standard advice is to be pragmatic, but what do you do when you have things you just actively want to dedicate several hours a day to? I feel that strong pull, but then worry that my feelings are just leading me astray. 

The standard maxim I hear, that you really only get good at those things that you're interested in, doesn't seem to hold if you can crack that code of discipline and get yourself to work hard at any task you're faced with. You can hate something but still work hard and excel, and I know this because I have. I believe I take quite a bit of interest in the learning process itself, so I can usually harness the very challenge of learning something difficult in a time-constrained environment to generate interest, and the nature of the formulation of the problem also ensures I learn quickly, thus giving others the illusion that I have talent and therefore interest in said endeavor. This holds true pretty much regardless of the specifics of the field. I forced myself through most of higher education in this manner, and get flak for saying so.

Do you follow your passion, if it doesn't happen to be easily monetizable? I think I've been led to believe that you must be incredibly gifted to even stand a fighting chance at any profession that isn't relatively ordinary. Therefore, even when I have demonstrated time and again a certain fairly high level of aptitude, and have seemed to impress even professors and the like, I still end up feeling like the real world is actually way harder, and that I'm still underestimating the degree of the challenge I would be up against: that it is only those superstar talented/privileged few that should even try.

I'm sure this is a common dilemma, and was wondering what you all think. It might be seen by some as financially reckless, but I'm also in my 20s.",gamelotGaming,2,0.75,2,1698490066,2023-10-28 10:47:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ib6kd/career_advice_for_someone_with_strong_passions_do/,10,2023

17i88uv,How do I keep my composure at work?,"


I'm reaching my limit with everything going on in my life. My parents are sick, I'm starting a new business, dealing with CPTSD, and managing a demanding 9-5 job. The biggest source of stress for me is my 9-5. 

My manager, who belongs to a different generation, is demanding, passive-aggressive, and lacks basic competence. For example, I have to send them the same email multiple times because they can't find it, they work on the wrong documents and then blame me for not incorporating their feedback correctly. They'll send an email at 1:59 pm and then follow up with a call immediately at 2 pm. If I make a mistake, they'll scream at me. They never review my work until the last minute and then pressure me to answer questions or provide information that I don't have. Despite my efforts to organize files perfectly so they can find everything, they still ask where things are. I’ll send them attachments, and they’ll still not find anything. They also ask personal questions, make inappropriate remarks, contact me outside of work hours, and show little concern for the stress I experience as a caregiver for my parents but I totally get they are in a similar situation too. I've been silent about this for 2-3 years, but I'm fed up. 

My manager has been with the company since day one, so they're not going anywhere. They are mostly supportive which has been a major factor in me not raising a formal compliant. I've subtly raised my concerns with our team boss and manager, framing it as a desire to take on new work rather than throwing my manager under the bus. However, everyone in the company knows my manager is difficult, and all warned me about it when I started. I've been searching for new jobs for months, even getting my CV professionally done, but with no luck. I also have significant debt to clear with my bonus next year, so realistically I need to stay until around early next year, another reason why I’ve tried to be composed because I’m out straight after (like any job or significant pay cut as I’ll have no more debt or student loan). I have some time off during Christmas, but I feel the pressure building up inside me. 

I've confided in a trusted colleague, which is against my principles, but I'm at my breaking point. I don't want to explode, but lately, I struggle to keep my composure, and I know my manager has noticed my snappiness but how many times can I repeat myself or send the same work? I need help to regain my usual patience. I hate that I’m not as composed as usual but I’m struggling.

Now, I'm six months without a job and honestly I'm super terrified I won't be able to get one for a LONG time, I'll likely have to leave my industry and enter a completely different one.

First job:

I would be working as a pet adoption specialist. I would work full time hourly $15.00/hour + availability to work overtime. I’m hoping to negotiate for more in my final interview. I love pets and want to pursue a corporate career in the pet industry eventually as my career goal. 

Pros:
- working with pets everyday
- choosing adopters for pets
- being in a career field i’d like to stay in 
- PTO health insurance benefits
- possible room for growth in the organization

Cons:
- pay $15.00/hour
- obviously not a hybrid setting

Second job:

This is a music and sports entertainment call center customer service job. I enjoy talking to people and problem solving. Plus I love music and festivals, but am mainly interested for the pros and benefits. 

- I get to work in a field I enjoy and would be good at 
- 2 hybrid work days 
- $40k base salary + opportunity for overtime and bonuses 
- opportunity for growth 
- PTO and health benefits 

My partner and I are trying to move out and live on our own. I know the second job pay wise would be better, but I feel like there’s more into job decision making than just pay.

17i5kgx,"Think I have the wrong title, but I don't know what to do about it.","This is a throwaway because I have no idea if my company monitors my main reddit account, but they may, and I don't want them to be on to any of this.  
I've been a technical writer for almost 20 years.  In my current position, I'm a ""Technical Writer III,"" at a software company.  
I have a coworker who has been at this same job for about six months longer than me.  For more than 10 years now, she's been part-time.  She does one very specific task, and her husband demands that she is off work as soon as her four hours are up, and it's... a problem if she isn't (she should get a divorce, but he's got money and a slow, but deadly degenerative disease, and he's not young, so I don't think that's happening).  Yet she has the title of Technical Writer IV - one step above me.  Nearly any problem she runs into doing her work, she comes to me first, and I have to remind her of how to do things that she should know how to do by now (most of the time I pass her off to the help desk, though).  I also have another coworker who was hired only a few years ago who is also a Technical Writer IV.  
On top of that, I have much more responsibilities than just a ""Technical Writer."" I am the expert for our authoring tool, meaning when anyone in our department has a problem with it, they come to me before using the support contract we have with the vendor.  I also keep track of who is using licenses of this software, and provide support for our source control system, including administrating and managing branches, permissions, analytics, users, and teams in our source control solution.  To be clear, this is just the source control for our documentation - I do not manage anything that the developers use.  I also manage and report on another analytics service we use.  
Our company just got bought and I was the only one with the necessary skills and knowledge to get a full scale rebranding in place in our authoring tool.    
Everyone who uses this authoring tool relies on work that I've done to get their jobs done, and 70-80% of that work doesn't have anything to do with writing skills.  
I also administer our SharePoint site, our team in MS Teams, and I'm one of a couple admins for our Vimeo account.  
I have developed automation scripts to streamline a bunch of my work and simplify the tasks that can be automated.  I introduced a change which saves me a bunch of time earlier this year.  I have been the one directing a project to host all of our content on AWS, working with our engineers and architects to make sure it all works to our requirements and meets legal and client needs.    
I wrote our department handbook.  I have helped other departments write up and maintain other internal documentation, and still do.    
Any time there is a new ""thing"" my boss is interested in, I'm the one she asks to look into it.  I have looked into a dozen different products over the past couple years for her because they might be the silver bullet for some random problem she wants to solve.    
I've been on several committees and task forces, and been the one trusted to make decently important decisions about how things move forward, or how we're supposed to do something, or establishing standards.  In all of these cases, except for one, I've been the *only* one from our team representing our interests.  
There are some things that I really enjoy in my job.  But I'm technically lower rank than everyone else I work with.  My pay doesn't even come close to the median, and is, in fact, lower than the low end of the salary range for people with my title according to some career sites.    
I know the general advice will probably be to just plug this all into a resume and find something else.  And that's probably the right advice.  But I kinda want to see if I can get a new title out of this before moving on - if not Tech Writer IV, then at least something that more accurately describes my role. Problem is, I have no idea what that title would be.    
To be clear, I'm only interested in getting new pips on my collar, so to speak, for the sake of putting it on a resume, not because I care that these coworkers are actually above me.  I would bet the part-time coworker is probably getting paid at a rate close to me, and she doesn't get benefits of any kind, either.  I am almost certain the other coworker is paid more than me.  A better salary would be nice, too, if only for the amount of time it takes for me to find something else.  
As I proofread this before posting, I'm realizing that most of it really is just the role of a more advanced Technical Writer - someone who should know how to use and manage the tools needed to do the job.  But there are other things in there, beyond technical writing, that my boss clearly finds me useful for.

17i4y88,Career advice .. harsh genuine comments needed ?,"
28 F 
I’m so confused I don’t know what I am doing. I graduated Masters in Business Analytics 4 years back. I’ve been doing a dead analyst job which taught me near to nothing in these 4 years. I practically see my career dead. Have no confidence to step out in the market . Have no marketable skills. Also I feel like I am not even a good analyst . I generally lack strategy , decision making , intitation. Idk if this steps from past negative experiences or just too much fear or comparison with other people around me. 
I forgot what I even studied in college mostly data science stats etc. I honestly don’t have interest in it.. I feel like I may learn a job but be very mediocre or replaceable wherever I go. 

I was thinking software engineering or coding (just with the mindset that coding jobs will have more market once I learn it) plus also the way an analyst job is designed to find hidden details , commmunication or just the randomness of it will be gone.

I don’t even know what a real software engineer development  or coding job looks like tbh.. i have just started boot camps and thinking to do leetcode.. with my confidence I know I won’t be really interested or good at it also .. but still thinking to go that way.. 

I just have a lot of fear and no confidence in myself .. I see people around so dynamic and sure in what they want to do and here I am don’t even know what I am doing wasted masters and 4 years on job for nothing and still Dk.. engineering was not my cup of tea but idk what else to do even for a living .. I have no other skills.. I am just dumb , poor decision maker and slow.. 

.. I don’t know what I am looking for exactly from here  but just a little perspective would be helpful probably in what career should I take .. should I leave analyst job? Is software engineering something one can cope with eventually? 

Any tips suggestions also how to go about entry level jobs in this market would be helpful

I'm 29 and looking to move to a new company. I've had a good five years at my current one relatively speaking- it became full time remote a few years ago like many other jobs, and I've always been treated well there. But, to be frank, the opportunities for advancement are relatively limited and slow, and I'm not satisfied with the rate at which my career has moved forward to this point. I've mostly looked to apply for roles that share as much similarity with my current one as possible, and today I got my first interview, which is scheduled for Monday. 

The job I'll be interviewing for has a fair amount of overlap with my current role- my title currently is Sr. Payroll Coordinator, and the position in question is Sr. Payroll Auditor. The meat of the position sounds similar, but there are elements of the new job that frankly I would not be prepared for on day one. I can get into specifics if necessary, but I'm mostly looking for advice on how to approach this at a macro level. Should I bring it up myself? Should I wait for it to come up organically? Should I try to do some light study on those concepts this weekend so I have better familiarity in case it's asked about? I have had a tendency to avoid applying for jobs where I don't check every box in the past but I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive in this search, so I'm not quite sure how to approach this kind of thing. I am confident that I can grow into the role quickly if I'm able to get it, just trying to maximize my chances.

I have been a Senior Marketing Manager at a giant globally well known company for the past four years (similar to Apple, Netflix, etc). Before that I worked for another well known brand in marketing for six years (similar to GAP, Target, etc).

Due to RTO I had to recently find a new job. I was offered two positions: the first is a Senior Marketing Director at a very small company with less than 200 employees and the second role is a Senior Marketing Manager at a big nationally known company (think Proctor & Gamble). In the first role I would manage a team, and the second I would be an individual contributor.


The compensation for both roles is similar and good, but my question is— would going to a small company nobody has ever heard of hurt my resume? 

I am tired of working for giant organizations and the thought of going to a small company is refreshing, but I am worried it could hurt my resume if I apply to new roles in the future . I also do not think this small company is a unicorn or anything like that— it will grow, but this isn’t the next big thing. I’m also nervous about a small company in the economy.

I also just received an offer for EY as a Technology Risk Consultant. I understand that the EY role is similar to internal audit as I will be testing controls for FSO’s so it’s not too much of a different besides working with different companies on audits rather than different business units.

17hxrzx,Should I keep my job or pursue a degree?,"Hey all!

I need some advice whether I should keep my current job or I should go back to school full-time.

I'm currently working at a software company as training and support full-time. I don't necessarily like what I do but it pays the bill. I make about $58k/yr with benefits. Lately, I find our department is not doing so well due to our absent manager and now, that I am being trained to be a trainer the person training me is extremely unreliable. I've been unhappy with how things are for a while but I feel like my unreliable trainer is the final nail in the coffin, and I'm really leaning to resigning. 

I feel conflicted whether I should keep going and see where my career takes me in this company, or if I should go back to school and get a degree to open an opportunity to work with software developers.

It makes me wonder if it's just a matter of surviving to make a living or do I give myself a chance to discover my passion?

I made a minor mistake about leaving a treatment in the girls hair (it’s basically conditioner) but she didn’t tell me to leave it in for 10 minutes and in the past we put it in and wash it out shortly after. So she yelled at me infront of her client and my coworkers and I was upset and embarrassed.I went to the break room and cried so no one saw me. 

Once I started crying I had trouble stopping. I have other things in my life going on and this was just the needle in the haystack. I just don’t think it’s appropriate to yell at me in front of the clients.

17hud34,Potentially being offered a new position once my failing division closes. Tips for conversation with boss?,"Background: I work for a small financial institution that had a failing structuring division. I was initially an senior analyst for said division, but was promoted to the head of that division when my boss resigned and the sales director for the division was laid off, leaving a skeleton crew of a few people (mainly ops and legal) for me to manage. I was basically tasked with getting existing pipeline deals across the finish line and managing the few existing relationships.

  
The good news is, I got the deals done, one which was quite substantial, and we became profitable within the year. The bad news is, because the division wasn't a main business line or focus of the parent company, we were never given any resources to put back into the division to grow. We had a few tentpole clients and I understood that unless we grew, got sales / marketing people, and diversified our client base, this thing wouldn't last forever. I casually looked for other external positions but nothing too serious (a paycheck and complacency is quite addictive). 

  
Fast forward to now, about 4 years later, and we're still not setup to grow, and the products we run have unfortunately underperformed and will most likely shut down in this rate environment. I'm assuming next year, we will not be profitable, and I assume they're going to close the division. 

  
My wife has a job with a stable / excellent salary so I'm not too worried about finances in the short term.  However, we have a large client leaving (due to market conditions, not any issue with our team) and therefore, I'm trying to have the conversation with my boss, (who keeps rescheduling / pushing my meeting requests) regarding shutting down certain products that will be unprofitable before years end to avoid having expenses bleed into next year. This will obviously lead to the conversation about my division being a going concern. 

My assumption is that they're going to try to find a new position for me within the company. Truthfully, I am very much not interested in working for this company anymore. I've been there a long time (long before the 4 years) and truly need a change. Therefore, I'm working to start looking for positions now.

  
LTDR Summary: Based on that, my question is how should I approach these conversations with my boss? Is there a strategy I can utilize to ideally get severance? If the position I'm offered is enough of a demotion, I'm assuming i can argue it's a constructive dismissal, but otherwise is there any approach i should take in discussing with my boss this division's status as a going concern to put myself in the best position?

17hu97e,Have to make a decision…,"So, having a really hard time deciding between leaving my current job and staying at it. Was hoping Reddit could help me out since I need an objective ear:

My current job pays about $2400-$2600/mo. The amount fluctuates since a good chunk of it is tips. It’s easy, casual, a counter/keyholder position, and I’m given a consistent 40 hours/week and sometimes overtime if needed). The base pay is $15/hr but I’m almost always making a good $19.50/hr with the tips (after taxes). There’s not really room for advancement besides to shift leader (which is just doing inventory and the company has more trust in you, especially to fill in for other employees at other stores). And there are no benefits.

The job I would be leaving this one for (I already got the offer and signed it, but of course I’m not *legally* required to show up or anything) is an assistant manager position and pays $50,000/yr salary (so $3000/mo flat). But it’s a management position, which means I’d be doing a lot more and be on the hook for a lot more. It’s a somewhat fancy full-service restaurant where I’d be dressing business casual every day and expected to act very professional at all times (not a problem, but I’d be masking basically all the time, since I’m autistic, and it’s kind of exhausting). Not sure if I’ll be in charge of a few lines of P&L or not but the stress of it concerns me. I’ve been a manager before (though not in pay, only in semantics… they gave me a manager position but didn’t officially call me one or pay me a salary) and I loved it, especially the control I had over situations I noticed were detrimental to us as a company, and I loved fixing them. It was great to be the one who taught other people how to do their jobs, and to be the person that other employees came to for advice. *However,* and this is the big one — I’m a recovering addict, the job would be around alcohol, and I’m worried the stress would get to me and cause me to start drinking again. I’ve also never been a *real* manager before and worried about underperforming.

There’s pretty much an equal amount of pros and cons here. At my current place, it’s much less low-stakes and I don’t have to work *anywhere* as hard… but I do want to move forward in the hospitality industry and this seems like a good opportunity, not to mention no other places are hiring for management positions without previous management experience, which I desperately need. I don’t want to be working counter/keyholder my entire life.

I put in my notice already at my current place, but my boss is super nice and devastated I’m leaving and would be ecstatic to have me back if I so chose.

Any advice? Opinions? I could really, really use them.

Thanks so much! <3",lv255,1,1.0,0,1698431747,2023-10-27 18:35:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hu97e/have_to_make_a_decision/,10,2023
17hu409,Become a pilot or start working as an engineer?,"Currently, I'm in my fourth and final year pursuing a master's degree in electromechanical engineering with a specialization in automation. I find myself quite perplexed about my future plans. Historically, I've always opted for paths that keep my options open, such as studying sciences and mathematics in high school and engineering at university.

Now, it's that pivotal time when I need to contemplate my future career. This involves considering where I want to work, the type of job I aspire to, the position I aim for, and the industry I wish to be a part of, among other things.

However, here's the twist – I've held a wild dream since childhood: to become a full-fledged commercial pilot. I temporarily set this dream aside to focus on my academic pursuits, but it has never truly left my thoughts.

The dilemma I face now is that if I dive into a typical engineering job, my chances of ever becoming a pilot diminish. Factors like age restrictions, the exorbitant cost of pilot training, and the need to essentially start from scratch all seem to work against me, not to mention the financial strain during additional training.

On the flip side, if I pursue a career as a pilot, I'd be two years older when I begin. Returning to the engineering field with no experience and little to show for my degree would present a significant challenge. I would essentially be starting over, likely in an entry-level position with minimal management experience, and with the risk of forgetting a substantial portion of my engineering education. Additionally, it feels as though I'd be wasting my engineering diploma if I opt for the path of a pilot.

What deters me from fully committing to the aviation world is the cyclicality of the industry. The demand for pilots can fluctuate dramatically based on economic cycles. We only need to look at past events like the COVID-19 pandemic or the economic downturn from 2007 to 2009. Losing my job as a pilot could force me to switch careers.

I understand that the ultimate decision lies with me, but I'd greatly appreciate insights from anyone who has navigated this kind of career uncertainty. I'm not inclined to take a gap year or pursue another master's degree. My goal is to have a clear plan by year-end. So, if you have any thoughts or advice to offer, please share them!

But please spare me any suggestions about pursuing an engineering or business career while enjoying leisure flying in a small plane; this does not pique my interest in the slightest.",RedizioFlint,1,1.0,1,1698431364,2023-10-27 18:29:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hu409/become_a_pilot_or_start_working_as_an_engineer/,10,2023
17htwg7,23F - PT or RN?,"Hello everyone.

I am a new grad RN (registered nurse) and in my second year of studying for PT (physical therapist) undergraduate program. 

The reason I went into PT was because throughout my RN studies I realised the job wasn't as dreamy as I thought or better yet - wasn't something I wanted for the rest of my life (in regards to the pay, working hours, holidays, night shifts, physical and mental burn out, family-social-life balance etc). The only reason I went into nursing is because of my wish to work at the ER or emergency services (in my country a RN diploma is qualified to go into any field - er, icu, paramedic other specialties...). But I soon realised that these 2 fields are exhausting, tough for anyone (esp a woman)... Yet I don't really want to be doing anything else than that. And as I am growing older my values of having a nice family life balance means more and more to me. I also am scared that the only reason I want to be in the ER or EMS is because of my will for adrenaline - which I can easily get in my part time by riding motocross etc.

So 2 years ago I decided not to waste any time and get into a PT undergraduate program. As I would have higher chances of a normal work-life balance, pay and working conditions. 

Now I am looking for a job and can't decide where to go. Should I get a job as a student somewhere in the PT field or get a job as a RN and in the meantime finish my PT program but lose some years I could use as a student. I do have a job guaranteed on both fields.

&#x200B;

I do realise both jobs are good and beautiful in their own way. And I do think the problem is me, because I can't make up my mind and stick to something. I do not know what exactly to do in life.

I know reading this you will think I am stupid and dumb but I just want to be happy in life and I think I lost that somewhere along the way.

17hsaqh,Pivoting from Customer Success to a more tech/business problem-solving role,"Hi Everyone,

  
currently, a Customer Success Manager for two years, looking to change roles due to burnout.  
I do enjoy and am reasonably good at solving problems, namely, solving business problems with technology. Love asking about, thinking about and setting up clients' workflows with our product.

  
I was looking into roles such as solution architect or implementation engineer but unfortunately, I am not enough technical, my background is in sales (which I am not good at) and now CSM. Although, you could call me tech-savvy or a power user, but not an expert.

  
I am trying to technically educate myself but that is only about 20 minutes a day. I go through challenges on FreeCodeCamp because it feels like fun. But now I am thinking I should get some Salesforce or Microsoft cert instead because this would better align with my career so far.  
I always found this corporate software training rather boring, but I can make myself to pass them if necessary.

  
I would like to ask you, for some advice as to what role I should aim for within the next year.

  
And also what kinds of training or learnings I should prioritise and how intensive should they be.

  
I am based in the EU if that helps.

17hrnq6,Compensation vs Culture,"I work in Software Development and my total compensation is around 110k a year. We have a hybrid schedule but I can pretty much work remote whenever I need which is a big deal for me. We also have a lot of flexibility when it comes to what hours we choose to work (I have a few meetings a week, otherwise I can work as much or as little as I like, at whatever hours of the day, and I am paid by the hour). On top of that, the environment I work in is very relaxed and I generally like all my coworkers. I do have to spend a decent amount of time outside of work trying to learn new tech that I don’t get experience with on the job, because our tech stack isn’t usually using the latest.

Recently a company has been recruiting me and is offering a compensation package that would total around 210k a year, which is obviously a giant pay leap. They also have more teams which would allow me exposure to new technologies. The down side of this offer is that from what I’ve been able to find, their culture and management is abysmal. Non-technical people who are often straight out of college, managing engineers. High turnover, and work/life balance doesn’t seem amazing (many report 50-60 hour work weeks). They also seem to be very rigid about working remote, though they also offer a hybrid schedule.

17hrev4,Two job offers. Unsure of which one I should accept.,"Hi all. Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I currently work at a popular grocery store. I hate my job and the physical toll it's taken on my body has led me to seek an administrative job where I can sit down most of the day. For the first time in my professional life, I've had multiple successful interviews and offers extended to me. Obviously, I'm thrilled at the prospect of having options, but it has put me in a complicated dilemma.

I have a bachelor's degree in psychology that's been collecting dust since I graduated. I've been extended an offer as an administrative assistant at an addiction treatment center that would pay $5 more hourly than my grocery store job. The commute would be bearable (20 minutes with traffic) and it could potentially be my foot in the door for a long term career in mental health.

However, I was also extended an offer for an administrative assistant position at a local community college in the education department. It would be a lot more responsibility, but would pay $10 more hourly than I'm making now. The campus is 7 minutes from me, and I would have the opportunity to work remotely.

On the one hand, a career in mental health is what I set out to get after I graduated, and might be more fulfilling. But there's no guarantee being in admin would get me anywhere. On the other hand, the community college would pay much better and it's more flexible as far as working from home goes. But that would mean selling out for the cash.

17hprm3,What’s your worst mistake at your early career,"
Hi I am F24. I graduated from college a year a go, so i am considered not a fresh graduate. I took me months to get my fourth internships as social media intern.

At first, i had a really good time enjoying the work because the industry are related to my passion. However after three months, i feel exhausted and lose of interest to work harder. Because the work of social media is 24/7 and i feel that i didn’t get to spend my free time easily. So at my third month of internship, i started to lack of work, even when  another brand needed my help i couldn’t done it properly.

Theres a lot of gap between employee and intern, we dont get a long. So when i done mistake, they will gossiping me and without telling me what behaviour should i fix. 

As an intern, i feel bad and insecure at the same time. I know i could work harder, but i have a really bad reputation there. Even i tried to apply for another company, they won’t  accept me too. I started to think that maybe my bad reputation  is the reason i didn’t get a full time job.

So i dont know what should i do next :( 
Has anyone felt that way too?

17hpoj6,"A lot of down time at my job, unsure of what to do","Hello!

 I recently made a career shift and took a job in a new field that is a challenge for me in a good way. I enjoy the subject matter of the job, my team and my manager; however, there is a lot of down time with the job. I’m being told by my manager and her manager that I’m exceeding expectations and doing really well but I feel like I’m not doing very much compared to what I’ve accomplished in jobs in the past…
 I’m trying to seek out opportunities to keep myself busy- getting involved with ERGs, volunteering to present for my team and helping with side projects, but there’s still almost entire days where I have a hard time keeping busy. I’ve told my leaders that I’d like more responsibility and I think they are trying tok help but unsure of how long I should wait this out. All of this may sound silly, I know a lot of people would love to have more downtime in their job, but I’m someone who enjoys keeping busy (within reason). I also can’t help but feel guilty that I don’t work for the entire day on some days…but maybe I’m just too caught up in hustle culture to accept not being constantly busy. Has anyone been in this situation? Should I embrace the slow pace? Any guidance would be great!

This past week for the first time in my life I have been experiencing panic attacks and extreme stress and anxiety, I have been in hospital twice and generally don't feel well at the moment

I have not been to work in about a week and my boss has told me I need to be in by Monday or I need to hand in my keys today and quit as he has to go away for business and I will be the only one around to keep the business going for 2 weeks while he's away

I have explained my situation but I feel like my boss really just doesnt understand whats going on with me right now and feel like after everything I have done for there business I shouldnt have to deal with this deadline situation


My problem is I cant decide weather to try and go back on Monday knowing I may have a panic attack and having to come home and close the store which will make the whole situation worse

Or

Weather to just say I can't deal with this and quit.

I was only planning on working there for another 2 months anyway as I will be moving to another country at the end of the year

I also have financial backup if I can't work for these two months

17hn5gs,Advice Levelling up role but to smaller organization,"Hello,

I am looking for advice on a great opportunity I have to leave my current organization Director of Sales position to a VP of Sales position.

The role of the VP at the opportunity I am quite attracted to.  It is actually a better scope then being VP at my current organization.  I would have a seat at the table, directly involved with leadership on direction and strategy the organization would take to succeed.  Plus more.  I am on the succession plan with my current company for VP, but the scope here would never expose me to what the opportunity would.

My question and concern I have is the revenue is smaller than my current organizations.  Is that something I should consider maybe from am optics standpoint amongst my peers / colleagues and such?

Or the fact that this would be my first VP of sales opportunity it actually makes it that much better of a step for my career?

17hmzox,"Help, can I get fired for not meeting deadlines because I'm strictly working my regular hours?","Ok, so for context: I started this job fresh out of uni. I completed a 4 year honors BA with a double major in biology and philosophy and a 1 year extension to do an undergraduate thesis project. I've been working at this place for almost 2 years (2 years in feb). My history here has been rocky, to say the least. 8 months into the job (right after probation), my manager started ""picking"" on me to get my performance up (ps this was after my performance review, which had no problems). Around the same time, we lost a team member, and our workloads all sky rocketed. To say the least, this didn't improve things, and add on I was dealing with some family and health issues, and I was on the verge of a PIP. By the next performance review time (approx 1.5 yrs into my working with them), I was able to avoid it and bring up the performance. She still refuses to approve anything I do as good enough to let me work alone, yet people who were hired after me have been allowed to work alone on almost everything and when I use their work as a reference and match things to what they've done (since they can work alone) still there is always a mistake or some new issue that I ""missed"". My manager also doesn't help in questions and tends to lead me in circles to call me dense when I don't get it. She says to always ask questions and that no question is stupid but when I ask her I get responses like ""you should know this"", or ""I think you know what to do"" and so on. When I take action based on what I think is right, she'll tell me it's wrong, and it's like that's why I asked the question in the first place! It  just makes me feel stupid. 

I have been working over my regular hours to reach deadlines (because the workload is extremely high right now, and they have been slow to hire more people when we desperately need them). Sometimes, I'm at work till 7/8 when my normal schedule should be 9-5. A while ago (about 8 months), I discussed with my manager to get a new schedule (8-4) as I was going to be in a different time zone, and she accommodated. When I got back to our regular time zone, I never changed my schedule and just stayed 8-4. 5 months later, she addressed it (i.e., today) and said I need to go back to my 9-5. I wouldn't have minded if I didn't like the 8-4 more. I clearly indicated that I wanted to stay at that schedule, and she refused and said that it was only supposed to be temporary. I didn't argue and said I'll switch back starting Monday. 

Now I am obviously pissed off because she has no problem when I work extra hrs, and I was happy doing it because I was allowed the flexibility in my schedule, but I don't want to anymore. I'm just worried that if I start only work 9-5 and work doesn't get done in those hrs (as it won't), she'll have a new bone to pick with me. I don't feel my position in the company is secured and I've asked for a role change (in the most professional way possible) so that I can get out from under her and hold on a little longer while I look for a new job. 

If I get fired for not meeting the deadlines because I'm working my regular hrs, can it actually be my fault? 

What should I do in this situation?",Sabsub998,2,0.6299999952316284,8,1698411532,2023-10-27 12:58:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hmzox/help_can_i_get_fired_for_not_meeting_deadlines/,10,2023
17hm430,Looking for an advice what to do when I grow up (m38),"After finishing school I worked in sales, started at some smaller companies and then came to my current employer in 2008. Worked in the sales department and went through a time of stressfully building up the client network and learn how to become better in sales. I have low self esteem, ADHD diagnosed as an adult.

The company was taken over by a bigger Group, a new CEO joined, management changed for the most part and the whole company is different to what is was before - for good and for bad things. 

I've finished studies and got a bachelor level in trade, asking with preforming good at work. Because the CEO was not able to bring a Sales Director from outside he feels he can work with since 4 years, I got the chance to take the role over. I do it now since now than 1 year.

Due to the work stress, I had a breakdown and couldn't go to work because of a crazy panic attack. I thought about leaving the company she finding another job but the money is quite good, the income is stable and my position as a long term employee does have advantages. 
I tired to be the perfect Sales Director, realized I wasn't. It made me feel terrible and I started to work more, instead of smarter and that made me sick.

I feel like I'm recovering from it now and believe that I can tell the signs now. I will able to take the right measures if I start approaching that stage again.

The problem I have is that the industry we are in is dying and we struggle with bringing in new products, from other industries. I have a very small team, the CEO believes we are not working enough and there ain't much work to do for us. We did reduce the number of people in the team and I feel like I have no one left. I'm feeling lost and don't know how to proceed. 

I had a coaching on my talents and personality and the recommendation was to change job to something that fits me better. I don't fully agree with that training and didn't go further into that. But, basically, I don't know what to do. I would want to change but how can I do this with having to feed a family and without having to give up the level of life we have?

17hko8k,Which Career is best for me?,"For context, I'm a 17-year-old male in the 12th grade in Turkey. I've always dreamt of becoming a business owner/entrepreneur, and there are plenty of opportunities in my country. However, the average pay is quite low, around 12,000 USD per year, and I'm not keen on taking that risk.

I'm thinking of moving to the US to pursue my dreams, but I'm unsure about the path to take. Initially, I planned to study computer science in the US, but I've heard it's tough to get an H1B visa as an undergraduate student. I could risk studying in the US and finding a sponsor or getting married, but it's a daunting prospect.

If that plan fails, I might end up working in Canada or Europe, where the pay isn't as great. Lately, I've been considering studying dentistry in Europe and then moving to the US. This path would require five years of study in Europe and two more in the US to get equivalence. Losing three years worries me, but it seems like the best option. I've heard that with a D.D.S or D.M.D degree, it's easier to find a sponsor, and even if that doesn't work out, the salaries in other countries are higher than those for software engineers.

Also, opening my clinic is essential to me since I'm interested in the business side of things. What are your thoughts on this? Which path should I choose, or are there other career options I should consider? I'm open to suggestions.

(Regarding the equivalence as a dentist in the US, I understand it can be challenging, but the key point is that after achieving equivalence, it may be easier to find a sponsor, making it a potentially more viable route than pursuing a PhD for sponsorship in the software industry.)",UzeusTR,1,1.0,0,1698403241,2023-10-27 10:40:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hko8k/which_career_is_best_for_me/,10,2023

Yes, I am 19F and am a software engineer. I graduated from high school and college early and got into my first job at my dream tech company.

Due to grinding my whole life, I’ve missed out on a lot of socialising, especially with men. It doesn’t help that I have social anxiety either. I thought it might be great to build really good connections with my coworkers. To cope, I have been looking into a lot of psychology and ways to manipulate people to seem more approachable..(it doesn’t end very well)

I have only recently found out that I’m *apparently* very physically attractive (this is the first time I’ve been told that countless times explicitly by other people). It has only been a few months and about 7 other male coworkers have already tried to shoot their shot. It doesn’t help that the tech industry is male dominated so it’s not like I can avoid them either. 

There was one case where it got really bad with a coworker and I had to get HR involved.

It has gotten to the point where I get paranoid with every time I approach a male coworker and wonder if they have ulterior motives.

I know that connecting with people can help quite a lot in your career, but I don’t know what to do anymore.

Any advice? Thanks!

17hgzcb,"Are the tech careers, if you're not super technical, but are creative and have good people skills?","I've done IT support (2nd line) in the past, but mostly succeeded because I'm a decent communicator and have good soft skills (especially when compared to a lot of IT workers).

After a decade chasing my creative passion, I'm pretty tapped out. Need a steady income and some stability.  So, thinking about a return to the tech sector (I'm in Sweden - so lots of opportunities).

However, I don't really want to go back to support, and ideally would like to maximise my people skills and creativity.  Can anyone suggest good niche roles?

Education is free here and easily accessible, so I'm not against retraining by any means. I've considered UX writing and UX Design. Or perhaps technical writing, although many of those jobs seem to want engineering degrees, which is not something I'm cut out for.

Thanks!

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post, but I'm feeling lost and any advice would be helpful!

A little info about me: I graduated earlier this year with a graphic and interactive design degree and a minor in illustration. Although I do enjoy design, it feels like something is missing. I think I would enjoy a career that involves more thinking and strategizing. During my college courses, I discovered that I enjoy psychology, especially when it comes to consumer behavior. I'm also realizing that the outlook for graphic design doesn't look all that promising. The salaries are low, the job requirements are ridiculous (wanting a graphic designer, marketer, social media manager, photographer, project manager all in one and wanting 5+ years of experience with about a dozen softwares), and there's been an increasing risk of automation.

I've been looking into marketing and UX design as a potential career shift where my degree is still useful. However, when I look at threads about marketing, it's like they are speaking in a whole other language. B2B, SEO, A/B testing, etc. All these terms are new and I feel so clueless. I'm willing to study Hubspot academy and other resources, but the field is so broad that it's overwhelming and I'm not even sure what would be the best fit and where to start. I dont know what will be expected of me or what my daily tasks would be. And I'm not sure what all I must know before applying to entry level positions. 

UX excites me more because I have a better understanding of what the role is. I think it would satisfy me design-wise and strategy-wise. The problem with this career is it seems to be extremely competitive. People have waited years and applied to over 2000 jobs with only a couple interviews. I don't mind competition (because any great field with high earning potential will be), but it's not an option to go without an income that long hoping for something to pop up.",Smart-Fold7327,1,1.0,0,1698386103,2023-10-27 05:55:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hgsgi/transitioning_from_graphic_design_to_marketing_or/,10,2023

17hg166,Need advice negotiating a salary,"Hi,

So during first round of interviews I told the HR rep my salary range was 60-75K. I know this is really wide and I realized I messed up. Also, my actual base is 60K, which was another mistake. Anyways they now made an offer to me of 55K.

I think I was one of very few candidates, if not the only candidate, as the hiring manager told me they are creating this position. She told me that there were other candidates, but I highly doubt that for two reasons: I got the interview through a higher up connection in the company so I'm pretty sure I was ""recommended"", and she said the job wasn't posted to LinkedIn or their careers site. She also said she was looking for someone long term because she didn't want to hire someone all over again in a few months.

On top of this, the company is a contractor of my provincial transit agency which are known to have huge budgets and lots of money. All of this leads me to think I have some leverage to negotiate. Plus, personally I am not that keen on the job (although I am unemployed and really need one) because of the following reasons: 1- it's not directly related to the field I want to get into but it is possible to transfer to a team in the company that is, 2- the job is 4 days per week in office and 1 day remote, and 3- it is an absolute pain to get to as it is across the city, right beside a busy mall and one of the busiest highways in N. America, with no reasonably accessible transit options.

How should I go about negotiating the salary? I'm currently thinking of just asking if the salary is negotiable to see if they make me a new offer. If they don't make a new offer, how high should I counter offer? Is it reasonable to make a counter offer of 70K, hoping to land slightly above 60K, and at worse land at 60K?

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for any advice or tips.",atsengamor,3,1.0,2,1698383051,2023-10-27 05:04:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hg166/need_advice_negotiating_a_salary/,10,2023

The folks there generally know about my company and apparently they once called my manager a ""devil"" (understandably so, IMO). Well, I've decided to apply for a job at this consulting firm. Now, how do I actually present myself when I apply? Should I give a typical vanilla line that I'm proud of my work but feel limited and want to take my career further? I don't feel that is entirely appropriate.

Hello,

I am currently a new grad engineer and I am 5 months in a job as a jr eng. My boss put me under an engineer as a way to learn and so far I am struggling as I am making a lot of mistakes despite my best efforts (from technical errors to simple formatting issues).  Its getting to the point where the engineer im under said that Im making his life harder, and started complaining about me to his coworkers (I overheard it). I dont really know what to do, am I just under qualified? Is it time for me to start looking for another job? Its getting to the point where I dread coming to work everyday, and its affecting life outside of work as I cannot stop thinking about it.

17hdxj6,How much do I ask for? Contract to Permanent,"I live in Canada, so I guess if you’re Canadian pls help me out.

I work as a purchasing analyst at a mid-size national company working on a 1 year contract. My annual salary is C$57,000– I only started in June this year. A little bit about me— I jumped careers from being an admin assistant for 5 years, and then to being an analyst after getting a post grad certificate in Supply Chain Analytics.

Three months ago, one of our permanent FT team members passed away (RIP). Since I was only working more than one month that time, my only headspace was to just do my work and take on work left behind, and try to get along with the team while being respectful to the valued member lost.
Now that it’s been 3 months, I brought up to a colleague during lunch that I’m interested to be a permanent employee. They encouraged me and that led to a serious conversation with my boss. My boss was thankfully receptive, and since I’m on my 5th month, I was told that I would have a semi-annual review in November to finally get my permanency contract going and finalized by December.
Now, they haven’t brought the topic of compensation yet— my manager told me that’s for me and HR to negotiate. My manager will approve only when the contract is for signing and he’s generally very chill. My colleagues are old people in their 50’s and are not the type who are open to discussing salary. Since this is my first purchasing analyst job, I’m just left to google on my own. 

Anyway, my question— how much do I negotiate? My salary right now is $57,000 (no benefits) and I’m thinking $67,000 (+ standard company benefits)? Is that reasonable? Should I ask for more? Or less?",mrsb0218,1,1.0,5,1698375523,2023-10-27 02:58:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hdxj6/how_much_do_i_ask_for_contract_to_permanent/,10,2023
17hdlve,Cloud Engineer Guidance,"Heyo,

I want to get peoples thoughts on my situation and what you would do. I have my VCP in Datacenter Virtualization with a CCNA. I am actively working towards my CCNP but I am just a Support Engineer at a Cloud provider. I am a tier 2 engineer (still taking phone calls and handling intake). The hard part is that the folks I work with are amazing and I have definitely gotten a few mentors in other teams that I look up to. For me though I am working towards these certs and I am making sub 70k a year. I am trying to maintain a positive light that eventually I will move up and out. This has started to fade as I am getting the impression that I am too valuable where I am at now to the company. It helps the support team to have a knowledgeable engineer but its not something I want to do.

&#x200B;

This is my first ""Cloud"" role and I have only been with this company for just under 2 years. Before that it was Point-of-Sale support. The only problem is that well Support is Support. Products might change but youre still answering the same questions and solving the same types of problems. (Password Resets, User error, Capability questions, etc) I have gotten to a point where I want to stay because of the people and friends I have made but I am not being compensated even remotely close to what I feel I should be. 

My question to anyone is when a job gets tough but there are folks looking out for you. Is it worth it to stay for the hope that it might change someday?",Zypherex-,2,1.0,0,1698374464,2023-10-27 02:41:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hdlve/cloud_engineer_guidance/,10,2023
17hcunt,I'm worried about the job contract,"Hi,

So I (f) received a job contract yesterday.

It's for a small start up, they're currently only males (9-10), and the job could give me transferable (excel, campaign optimisation) if I wanted to pivot. They're expecting a response by 3 today. Is it normal for things to feel rushed? The job offer and signing needed 1-2 days to confirm, and I had to ask for at least 1-2 days more time, in also thought that the job had more pros than cons, but is it being an all male company something I'm truly fine with ? They're hiring 1 more person atm, who should be female soon..

Other than that, although the commute cost and time near to £12 daily and niche area, 1hour, the pay, training and skills are positive 

I think I'm just worried about saying yes since I've been feeling really stressed and the reasons outlined above too, my current retail job isn't the best..",ColdEgg2527,2,1.0,0,1698372086,2023-10-27 02:01:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hcunt/im_worried_about_the_job_contract/,10,2023
17hccbl,Really confused.. help me out please,"Hi I’ve been working in this company for years. I was one of their first employees. I would say that I have good relationships with my bosses as they trust me. 

However lately I cannot stop myself from wanting to resign, can you guys help me out?

Here are some things I need to consider
- I am expected to work on call (does not matter if it’s way pass my bedtime)
- I have meetings even in weekends and I am not paid for this (should they decide to set up a call at 4 am it will still happen) I am however credited a PTO every weekend if I complete a wholeshift
- there are perks that I receive too: sometimes they give my gifts like gadgets/ food and so on (not always though)
- quarterly bonus is a plus though it’s not much… it’s always delayed though
- profit sharing agreement once we fulfill our goal (which we haven’t done in the past yearssssssss) they mentioned it will be huge amount like you can buy a car or a house but I’m afraid I’m just too tired to stick out at this point.. it’s a goal that would take probably 5 yrs to complete.. (brand awareness build clients investors and eventually flip the business)
- I don’t have enough on my savings as I have a lot who depend on me
- toxic work requirements: everything is too stupidly done right now..….. i end up fixing everything and getting blamed
- i would say I have decent relationship with my coworkers. Everyone is nice but I guess the whole work set up is just too much sometimes
- I work under marketing but end up doing other things that are outside my work like company certification, compliance legalities, finance and even IT on top of my usual work….
- lately i’ve been getting sick due to lack of sleep and rest.. my leaves are getting questioned. Imagine working working your butt off 12-18 hrs everyday.. 
- pay is higher than average market but not too high if we’ll weigh what I do
- no holidays off including christmas.. my leaves do get approved sometimes.. but I’m still expected to join meetings and reply on emails

Is it worth it to stay so I can buy a house due to the bonuses? I like my bosses but lately I keep getting absurd tasks, requestss.. I am getting frustrated and tired..

17hag9a,Need advice for my current work life balance?,"Context. I’m a business analyst in a department who are very illiterate when it comes to data analytics particularly with excel. With a degree in finance. 

Realized that work-life balance is all out of wack need help deciding my direction.

Yesterday I decided that I would wake up at 4 am today to get to the gym, get ready for work and be in the door by 6am. So I can be out the door by 2:30(with 30 minute lunch).

When I first started my boss said to me “we can figure out your time schedule idk if you’re an early bird or just want to work normal business hours 8-5 (1 hour lunch) 4:30 (30 minute lunch)” in the first week or two I asked if I “could skip lunch all together because I’m salary” and wanted to leave at 4:00 instead HR said I was “required to take at least 30 minutes” so if I wanted to leave earlier I would have to come in earlier. In the beginning I really didn’t mind just coming in at 8 and leaving at 4:30(30 minute lunch) but then I started to realize my work life was getting in the way of my life.

 Ex: I have a dog that it’s very high energy and needs walks everyday atleast twice. So, I decided to take him to work where I can give him 1-15 walk in the morning 1-30 minute walk in the afternoon(lunch) and 1-15 in late afternoon because I noticed how much energy he had when he would be get one walk in the morning left at home all day and one walk after work. Also I barely have anytime after work when my day is completely over. This has led me to literally dreading going to the gym (used to love) because I’m already tired from the day and I’d be home by 6:30-7. Have to cook dinner 7-8ish eat 8:30ish and laying down just scrolling through my phone till 11-11:30 because I’m just so done with the day. just to do it all again. There are other factors like hanging out with family, my dog, friends and other things that happen in life that would be nice to have atleast 7 hours of my life back. 

So I decided to go into work very early like I explained above. Because I assumed that she would understand my reasoning and she told me in the beginning I could figure out what I want for my schedule. So when I came in I let her know that I came in early and wanted to chat with her when she had time to talk about my time schedule. She said yes. When I went in I asked if I could continue to come in at 6 rather than 8 for all the reasons above and more. she just told me no because of our obligation to our executive leadership (who’s hours are 8-5) along with “you should be in these in person meetings shaking hands”. Literally haven’t been in one of those in person since I’ve worked, and everything has been on zoom with executive leadership and very rarely am I even in those. I told her that I could work around those meetings coming in normal hours to insure I’m there. Or if something comes up quick even though I’m off I would work extra to make sure everything is fine and I attend. She said “no that’s not fair to you”. Even though I don’t care and voiced that just as long as I could have more time during the day.  After she said no because there are asks for data throughout the day so 8-5 she can’t work around my ask even though in the beginning she didn’t care.  I pretty much just asked straight up well what’s the difference of me working remotely, and she said she would do that. This makes no sense to me. Im pretty much convinced that in the begging she thought I wouldn’t know how to do shit so she would have to do these tasks. Now she knows I can do everything, faster, and better than she can. So now she wants me to have her schedule because she’s always dealing with excutives. And I just feel lied too by her. 

What should I do work remotely so I can easily work from home not deal with traffic or leaving my car running so my dog can be warm in my car all day(even though I would much rather work in the office). 

Should I look for a new job that has better flexibility. 

I really just need guidance if anyone has felt this way and what they did. 

Thank you all ahead of time I knowhow long this is question is.  I appreciate any response.",lkat1022,1,1.0,0,1698364700,2023-10-26 23:58:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17hag9a/need_advice_for_my_current_work_life_balance/,10,2023

They gave me everything they gave me the 25% more pay, they gave me the perks I wanted, etc. 

The thing is...I was so aggressive cause I was hoping they'd pass...cause its still a big pay cut for me (changing careers), but it is a career field I am more passionate about it and I think I could build myself up to my current income level in 1-2 years.

17h9s28,PTO denied because of not having the accrued hours,"

Back in March earlier this year I had to take intermittent FMLA to care for my dad who was going through chemo treatments (he also has dementia and can’t drive or understand medical info). I burned through my accrued sick leave as well as my PTO/vacation pay I accrued. Our PTO accrual is painfully slow at 0.0384/hr worked. 
 
Fast forward to now- 
I’ve tried to request a PTO day off here and there for the end of this year, but was told by my manager she couldn’t approve it because I didn’t have the time accrued off and that it was against policy to give unpaid PTO days. 
Found out from HR that there is no actual policy in place and it’s up to the manager’s discretion. 
For context, I’m a nurse at a hospital in the Seattle area. I’ve never been written up or given warnings, and from what I’ve heard I’m well liked by my unit and my patients. 

I guess I’m just frustrated that I was lied to by my manager, and also don’t know how to proceed from here. Before I found out this out from HR, I was going to ask her for a personal leave of absence (for May 2024, so giving PLENTY of notice) so I can just take a damned vacation between caring for my dad as well as the burnout from just working in healthcare in general. 
Do I go in to a talk with her expressing my frustrations and hurt that I was lied to? Do I demand my unpaid PTO vacation?

Projected pay is salary based on $28/hr and 40hrs/week. So $1,120/week. My current pay is $17.50/hr and I work hourly 40 hrs/week. Approximately $700/week. So the pay increase would be a very nice change (if I apply and get the job).

Enter the conundrum, my current living expenses including my wife’s car payment are roughly $1,500/month. Rent is only $500 where we currently live. I also have a company vehicle so I don’t have a vehicle payment for myself.

The best rent I can find where I would have to move to if I got the job is between $1,000-$1,100/month. Add in the fact I would have to find transportation, it would add in another $300-$400/month in expenses. So my expenses would increase by very roughly $900ish/month while my income would increase around $1,680/month. Keep in mind, I did not take taxes out of the incomes. Currently around 26% of my gross income is taken out for taxes, health insurance, etc.

Should I take the leap and apply for the job? Or should I wait until I finish my degree and look then? This would be the first time I’d have to move a far distance from where I’ve always lived and it slightly stresses me out.

17h8mt0,I don't know if I'm making the right decision taking this job.,"So some backstory, I went to college for computer science and didn't like it and my backup was working as a system admin or literally anything else in IT like fixing computers or helping people with their issues. I never finished college because I just absolutely hated CS and have been putting the IT thing on the back burner and have spent the last 3 years pretty much doing nothing at my laid back minimum wage job (eventually working my way up to manager) still living with my parents (I'm 24). Recently my friend who works for a certain airline offered to push my resume up for a job where I’m basically making schedules for pilots. I’ve always had an interest in the aviation industry (mostly flight sims and top gun lmao) and possibly becoming a pilot but due to my adhd and issues under pressure I threw it out of mind.   
Now I just made it to the interview a few days ago and they said they’d have an answer for me next week and now I don’t even know if I want the job. It started to hit me that this a meticulous 10hr shift job and I have to work night shifts and weekends (granted its only 4 days a week) as a newbie and that goes against everything I wanted from a job. I know this sounds spoiled and childish but work/life balance and being relatively stress free is very important to me. The benefits of healthcare,401k, and free flights seem too good to pass up but the job itself seems very stressful and if you fucked up you FUCKED UP. I feel like I need to push myself to do something hard but I'm just so torn, I'm so lucky to have this amazing opportunity in front of me that most people would kill for but I'm being a child because I'm scared that it’s too hard. I just don't know what to do anymore. My only other option is to go to a bootcamp school for something IT related but I'm not even sure about that.  
TLDR: I might be taking a job that has really good benefits and would push me out of my comfort zone but very stressful and long hours with horrible work/life balance and I'm not sure what to do.

I graduated with a 3.3 gpa which im somewhat proud of despite what I had to wade through.

I've been looking into new roles and am about to have an offer lined up in a role I would be far more passionate about that I believe would elevate the skills I see as valuable in the field. The thing is, the company is much smaller, and alluded that they will not be able to match my pay. 

The benefits are great, the people I have met are great, and everything I have read online has been nothing but positive. The work is far more interesting to me as well.

Hi everyone, I’m at a stage in my life where I feel really lost career wise and could really do with some insightful advice.
Bit of a back story I’ve been in customer facing jobs my whole career and for the last 8 years I’ve been working in the housing sector in wales for a housing association fulfilling various roles from customer service and liaison based roles to more recently maintaining a sheltered housing scheme, where I’m mainly responsible for ensuring health and safety checks are completed however I do provide some basic support to the resident now and again but mainly just listen those that have requested a daily call (around 4 out of 30 residents) however I can confidently say I absolutely HATE the job, I hate how much I have to give myself to them, especially as many of them challenge me on the daily, give me snarky comments and just seem to go out of their way to lie about me and cause problems, many of these people are well into their 60s and older so I wasn’t expecting to come across this level of childishness when I took the job. I’m at a point where my respect for humanity is at an all time low, when I started in the field like I said I started in customer service and was in that role for 5 years and the majority of the time was screamed at, talked down to and just made to feel stupid and horrible and now I’m in this role where I feel just as bad, it’s gotten to the point I’m now currently on long term sick due to mental health, stress and anxiety all because I overheard a resident making unnecessarily nasty comments about my appearance (I’m overweight and battle with self worth issues and body dismorphia, they weren’t to know but that’s not the point) and I just cannot bare the thought of potentially going back. I’m wanting a change of career but the idea of working for customers is terrifying to me, as bad as it sounds I just have zero empathy for customers, I couldn’t care less if they have no electric or gas or whatever (no electric and gas was something I went though on a regular basis during my childhood, so you’d think I’d be more sympathetic but right now, I’m really not) I just don’t care about any one else’s problems if their not immediately my friends or whatever. But like how can I find anything I would want to do away from my current job? I have no passion right now, I’m currently looking into my mental health due to childhood trauma etc and I’m just really lost.

I am experiencing a bit of a midlife crisis at 35 and feeling underwhelmed with my career choices and I want to do something meaningful. I am 35F.

Ok, here's the dilemma. I have a job offer as a caregiver for 17.50 an hour and the opportunity to get my LNA for about 20 an hour. If I go this route, I will want to get my RN eventually. In my area, that would mean about 30 to 60 an hour. That will take me at least 2 or 3 years, however. The career would be meaningful and I'd have a positive impact in people's lives.

I also have the opportunity to become a correctional officer. It would still mean making a difference and serving my community, but in a much different capacity. But this is not an offer, I am still in the hiring process with a tour lined up Monday. The recruiter thinks I stand a good chance, but the hiring process is extensive. The pay is better than caregiver, but not as good as an RN, about 42k a year.

17h4ygi,Racial bias getting in the way of career progression?,"Hi, I’m an Asian American that speaks fluent English (grew up in California). I live in Germany and work in tech as a product manager. I also speak French and Italian fluently, and have 2 bachelor’s. 1 in business, and another in computer science. I also have experience launching my own startups.

I was working at a company for 3 years and time after time I was denied a promotion. Without being butthurt, I assessed the situation, but time after time even if I met all the goals, delivered everything well and on time, they never fulfilled their promise of that promotion.

I interviewed for a Senior PM role at another company and got an offer, but for a mid level PM role because the new CEO said that they have an internal criteria for how many years experience you need to be a Senior, and I didn’t quite fill that criteria. In any case, their product was cooler and my would-be manager was vetted by a mutual acquaintance, so I decided to accept the offer anyways.

My current company then came to me asking me if I’d stay on if I got the Senior role, but I said it was too late and quit.

I’m in between jobs right now feeing kinda sad to be honest. Despite my short tenure, I have a ton of depth and achieved a lot. I have amazing feedback from engineering leads, heads of design, and even the CTO. I managed a team of 15 people. I know I’m “above average” because everybody is always so shocked to find that I’m a mere mid-level PM. I have no doubts in my abilities and the way I conduct myself around business owners. Yet, it seems like my European counterparts always progress faster than I do. I honestly think it’s got to do with the fact that I’m an Asian guy in Germany.

I’m starting a new job, basically with the same title.

17h39es,"I'm responsible for mentoring the worst new co-worker, and I'm not sure what to do anymore [VENT]","About 2 months ago, a new employee joined our team and in that time I've come to see that this person is very underqualified, over-confident, and super annoying to deal with just as a person. I've listed some examples below. For context, we work from home doing data analysis work primarily in Microsoft Excel.

* Person barely knows anything with Excel; Had to have vlookups explained to them and still didn't understand; Still doesn't know they can use the save button at the top of the window vs going to file->save; Didn't know anything about how to build a pivot table; Didn't know how to use the format painter, how to copy/move sheets between workbooks, and much more. I really get the feeling they got a ""Excel for Dummies"" book and thought that made them an expert. And this extends outside of Excel. They have no file management skills/awareness and a very rudimentary operating knowledge of Windows.
* On top of not knowing it, they'll try to BS everyone on the team that they actually do know it. I'll tell them to do something basic in Excel but not say how, then I'll watch them frantically try to figure it out for 30 seconds or so, then will finally tell them how when it's obvious they don't know. Then they always try to cover and say something like, ""Oh yeah, I knew that. I just got nervous"". This person has even followed up with me and others several hours after work to say something like, ""I was thinking about our convo and just wanted to let you know that I did know how to do what we talked about earlier. I just forgot in the moment that I knew how to do it"".
* I don't blame someone for not knowing all the skills for a new job, but 2 months in and it seems like this person has taken no initiative to improve their skills on their own. And my colleagues and I have been doing our jobs for years, so it's super obvious when someone's BS'ing their understanding of it, and personally I'm a little offended they wouldn't think I'd realize that.
* Person cannot seem to follow basic instructions. A colleague and I will send detailed step by step instructions on how to complete a report and if we can even convince the newbie to give it a try just amongst us (nothing official) they'll come up with something not even in the instructions we send.
* Most of the time, the new person keeps leaning on the ""I haven't seen it done before so you need to show me first"" excuse even though they have been shown. 
* Never saved any documents we talked through or any notes that they took. I tagged up multiple times per week with said person for tutoring sessions and they'd been typing notes into one word doc over several weeks and never once thought to save it. Last week their Word crashed and they lost all notes. Basically back to square one.
* Terrible file management and organization - I created a network folder specifically for the new person and loaded it with only things that were directly relevant to their accounts. In addition, I compiled I giant how-to/cheatsheet guide for all of the accounts as well as all the relevant links and whatnot. This took several hours over the course of a few days to put together. This person actually had the nerve to ask me earlier today where to find one of the main account documents they needed when we've referenced that folder at least two dozen times over the past two weeks or so.
* This new person doesn't respect any personal boundaries. In addition to writing book-long Teams IMs regularly outside of work hours, they got the phone numbers for our team in case of emergency and has since called or texted about everyone, and as late as midnight on a work night. They even tried to call me on my phone to tell me they were going to be late to a work meeting instead of just sending me an IM through Teams. 
* This person has also repeatedly called one of my colleagues when the colleague was out on PTO and the new person was wanting to ask work-related questions.
* Seems to have no desire to be a team player - I setup a call to explain something to another new hire who had asked (A), and the problem newbie heard and wanted to join. When we got on the call, I explained to problem newbie that A had asked for the walkthrough so I'd be using A's account as an example even though it would apply the same to problem's account. Problem newbie then said ""Well since it's the same let's do mine instead""
* Same situation happened with problem newbie when they asked the manager for a walkthrough of something, and when it was setup, someone else on the team asked to join and problem newbie said ""No, my 1 on 1 time with my manager is MY 1-on-1 time"" just being a cunt
* Currently the common trend seems to be they're trying to find ways to talk other people into ""showing"" them how the work is done i.e. letting others do it for them because they don't know. My colleague sent them a request to just try completing a report even if it turned out wrong, and then the newbie went right to another team member behind colleague's back for a ""walkthrough"".
* There are many more examples, but the post would get too long. On top of all of those examples, though, they just have a godawful personality. They try to overcompensate about all of their shortcomings and it's so obvious and annoying. For example, I've never in my life heard someone repeatedly brag about their ""fast 50wpm typing"" skills. They also try to use a lot of filler in their talking and try to say ""document"", ""information"", or ""report"" as often as they can I guess to sound smarter. But this person thinks they're so much smarter than they are and is starting to play the victim card when it comes to not understanding the stuff but I think it's just because they aren't qualified and are being exposed.

I know this post turned into more of a vent session for me than anything, but if anyone made it this far, how would you handle something like this? I should add, this person is taking over the accounts I managed previously, so I do have some responsibility to ensure things keep running smoothly, but I feel like I've met my obligation to tutor/train and then some, and it's still not working for the new person. I'm honestly not sure how they were hired without lying on their resume. 

And they were not hired at entry-level. This person is at least 40 years old. I was hired at entry-level originally and could run circles around this person even then. I know I should talk to my manager about it, but I also don't want to be the guy that goes to the manager complaining about the new person everyone already knows is a problem.

17h1vn8,Is advancing to a leadership role in my field achievable after a journey from uncertainty?,"During my adolescence, I never had a clear sense of what I wanted to do with my life. My parents insisted that I pursue a college education, so after graduating from high school, I followed the traditional path and earned a degree in chemistry, despite having no real motivation and many doubts. I used my lack of interest in the field to rationalize my underperformance.   
After completing my undergraduate studies, I decided to change direction and pursued a master's degree in applied statistics at a lesser-known university. Following my academic journey, I embarked on a year of travel and work experiences, which eventually led me to a job as an engineer in a startup company. For the past two years, I have been immersed in this role and am thoroughly enjoying what I do, particularly in the realm of AI modeling.  
At the age of 28, I find myself experiencing a sense of ambition and a thirst for knowledge that I never felt during my college years. I'm highly motivated to be recognized in my field and aspire to advance to a leadership role. I'm currently taking additional courses outside of my regular work hours to further enhance my skills and knowledge. However, I'm contemplating how best to leverage this newfound passion, possibly through enrollment in a university program or even considering the pursuit of a Ph.D. related to my work in the startup.

17h140u,Don’t know what to do career wise (mech eng degree > PM),"Not sure if anyone has experience with this but I’ve been having some career/directional struggles. I (24F) graduated in 2021 with a mechanical engineering degree, started a job as an MEP engineer in May 2022. I really disliked the job, found it incredibly boring and felt like my company didn’t train me properly (felt like I was considered dumb, people would expect things from me that were out of my scope of knowledge and then talk shit to my manager) ,was also extremely underpaid for my VHCOL area (68k) and a combination of these things made me desperate to leave. I knew I didn’t want to be anywhere near the construction industry but could not get interviews literally anywhere else outside of construction.

By a stroke of luck, I got a job as a project manager in healthcare bc I knew someone who worked at the company. However, at this job, my boss is very overwhelmed and basically has given me no work (I’ve been here for 2 months) and I feel like I’m rotting away. This job uses none of my technical skills too (which is expected in PM I guess) but I just feel like I’m rotting and that my brain will be extremely dumb very soon. Part of me thinks I should go back to engineering but this job I have now actually pays me very well (im super overpaid lol) and it’s WFH so I kind of want to stay but this hump where my boss is extremely micromanagey and at the same time too busy to give me work is not really working out.

I don’t really know where to go from here. I feel super dumb as an engineer and am not sure I could do any technical role. At the same time, I don’t know if PM is for me. I’m just really lost and confused 😭 I know this is long but if anyone has any advice or words of encouragement I would appreciate it. I just haven’t found my place in the corporate world and have no clue where to go from here. Something I enjoyed in college was product design and ideation but I am terrible at CAD and even if I tried to get better I’d still feel behind everyone who mastered it in college. I’m also interested in finance/investing and I wish I studied business in college honestly but that ship has sailed out of here so I don’t know what to do any more.",macncheese323,1,1.0,0,1698339594,2023-10-26 16:59:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17h140u/dont_know_what_to_do_career_wise_mech_eng_degree/,10,2023

17h0p5r,Feeling underutilized and unfulfilled,"I know this is going to sound weird but I really like to work and stay busy. I work for a Healthcare company as a Major Projects Manager but lately (since May) I’ve been feeling really unfulfilled.
We went through our summer slow season and I had a hard time finding ways to stay busy and occupied. While I enjoyed a small break for the first 10 days or so the lack of activity really took a toll on me. After 2.5 months I was about to walk away from my job, take a $30k pay cut just for the opportunity to feel useful and stay busy. I had been asking for work, volunteering myself to help out and got nothing in return.
I was able to talk it through with my director and finally be taken seriously after I told her I was looking outside the organization. Since August I’ve picked up with a few small projects but again I’m getting back to a point where I feel underutilized and bored most of the day. I get that I work fast and thoroughly so I will have spurts of downtime but I’m on weeks of submitting 1 form or sending a handful of emails.
I’ve been with this company for 5+ years and put a lot of work, and years of education into this career path. Now I don’t know what to do, ride it out until we get busy again or move on to something different. (I have been applying and interviewing for internal director jobs but no one is hiring or I’m being told someone else has priority for a move over me).

They pay me really well and I have spent my last five years studying really difficult things to be good at it.   
I always liked math and programming and I can't say that this kind of career isn't interesting to me.

I realized that I am so much more fulfilled while working directly with people and like to imagine myself as something like psychotherapist, personal trainer or teacher rather that someone who spend most of days sitting alone and thinking. I know it because for most of my student years I earned money by teaching high school / grad students as private tutor and I just loved it. I would like to feel that my work can really change someone's life and feel real connection with that person. I am also really into psychology and similar kind of stuff.

I really don't know what to do, should I stay in data science and see if it turns out satisfying enough or maybe start entirely new career path (which might mean being poor for next few years, for example becoming a psychotherapist requirest at least 5 years of studying)? Being a tutor full time might not be an option, I'm not sure if there will be high enough demand in the following years because GPT chatbot (really). Plus then I won't be able to ever ""got a promotion"", I will do the same thing forever.

17gzygp,I'm not sure my manager handled my salary discrepancy correctly?,"I'm going to summarize, we got a new co worker who we both work the same job however she has less experience than me and I had found out she makes a little over 20k more than me.


I was very professional about it, but I told my manager I was upset at finding out this information especially after they wanted me to go salary and I declined because I wanted more money and they said there would be no salary increase with it. 


My co worker finally admitted to me my manager scolded her over me having a salary meeting with him. I told my manager I don't want her to know I know her salary or about our conversation and he said that she won't but I see he told her. 


Apparently he told her that I knew and that he didn't appreciate her 'flaunting her salary to me' (she absolutely didn't). He said that she shouldn't be asking me any questions about salary/time sheets etc and that should be all asked to him (although he's never available and tells her to ask me anyway). He told her this is going to cause issues in our department and that it's going to increase tension between us (it hasn't, I told him I have no animosity towards her). 


He also said that he doesn't want us talking about our pay to each other (why?) and that he doesn't want to hear about this situation from me again (again, why?). 


I don't think this was handled well. I don't know how other managers would handle this, but I think going to my co worker and telling her I knew wasn't the right answer?


As far as my situation goes I'm waiting until the end of the year to look for new jobs if this issue isn't resolved. I'm working on a project I NEED in my portfolio. My manager had told me a promotion was already 'in the works for me' and that I need to wait a 'little bit longer'.

17gzql0,"Went back to old job, but now I want to go back to my new job?","I was at Job A for 8+ years but left because there was no opportunity to move up.

Maybe after a year I would have been more comfortable.

My position at Job B was already filled. However, on my way out the door at Job B, my manager did tell me that she liked me and would rehire me, if the opportunity ever presented itself.

17gzdqd,My awesome job is becoming a nightmare. What are my best options.,"A year and some change ago I really loved my job. I work for a smaller company in the electric vehicle industry in their call center. For all intents and purposes, it's tech support. We troubleshoot, set up service appointments and replacements, etc. I'm good at it and I get good results. That's probably why I was put in for a promotion within just a few months. Then another a few months after that. Then came the first hurdle. We got bought out by a competitor of similar size based in a different time zone. My promotion to leadership got put on hold. 

At first it was all smiles and rainbows. Everyone's jobs are safe! We need you more than you need us. I felt from day one like I was training our replacements, but they kept stringing me along, just enough to keep me on board. We were told our office would become X coasts line of support and their office would be Y coasts line. We'd intersect and serve everyone better. A year on, we are down to 1 employee to every 20 to theirs in our office with no approval for more. The rest of the new positions got outsourced to a cheaper market. 

My boss, the best boss I ever had, was promised parity with their manager. They have been informed that they are now subordinate to the other. Maybe just in charge of scheduling and budgeting. Their boss who everyone loved just had a baby a month ago. They let that person go. They also let that bosses boss go. It goes pretty high up. Then they installed one of their employees in the position to make changes. 

Turns out, this new company is struggling. Things look really grim and many are speculating it may not survive much longer. Our company was blowing away projections and goals, but the new one is losing value. It's a scramble to fix it all. I finally got the promotion to supervisor after a year, but the raise to accompany it was insultingly low. My boss assured me come time for performance raises, they'd put in for the absolute maximum. Promised nearly unlimited ot in the meantime, but they're not my boss anymore. 

So this is where I'm at. I've used a throwaway account to avoid blowback. I doubt they'll find it, but you never know. I need to start making plans. I should have started 'yesterday', but I was naive. 

I'm in my early 30s. Before this unicorn jumped out at me, I was on disability for several years. Some sales experience prior. I went to college in 2019 for one year to study computer science, but when my wife lost her job during covid, I had to drop out. I was floundering anyway, and CS is now a tight field on top of that. I was finally getting some traction to explore other options, but I still feel like 2 years is going to look short for prospective employers. I don't even mention disabilities on my resume as I felt it held me back 2 years ago looking for this job. 

There are several reasons I need to stick to a Monday-Friday schedule as much as possible, but need dictates my action more than anything else right now. I live kind of rural so remote or hybrid remote is ideal, but again-. The way I figure it I have a few options:

-Stick it out and hope for the best. Highly dubious. 

-Keep my nose down. Return to school or even just try to get certs, changing focus to something like IT. I might be able to leverage my current experience there too if I word it right. Hope I don't get laid off before I can move onto something else. 

-Run. Anywhere. Find anything I can. This is scary because I still have a ton of debt from being on disability. The job required us to get another car, student loans were on hold while on disability, but started back up. We went into pretty deep credit card debt while we were both unemployed too. Paying it has been slow going with other expenses and inflation. Maybe I could luck out and get a supervisor gig elsewhere, but the job search is pretty scant right now for things I could reasonably do at my skill level. 

I'd love some input from some intelligent minds. I'd need to make at least 50k a year right now to keep the status quo, but it all feels like a pretty big ask in this economy. I was hoping to be making much more by now based on the local market for my role, but that's why we're here.

2. CoStar in Richmond, VA. $115k TC, no stocks/bonus but bi-annual reviews with promotions.

  
I think my heart wants Walmart, I love the area, love my manager/team/etc, fiance and I even found a nice church we love... but my brain wants CoStar because the base salary is $115k (6-figures) and Richmond is where we wanna end up.

17gy4uk,In house position or contractor work?,"Hello! I currently work a long standing contractor position for a large company supporting an internal department. The pay is great, but I miss out on the benefits of an internal position such as medical, retirement plan and paid maternity leave. The contract rates increase every year, and the company plans to continue the contracted work for years to come. I’ve received 4-7% salary increases every year, with ~3% year end bonuses.

There is now an internal position in the department open that I’m considering, but it’s a fairly new support position that hasn’t been established. The person who first got the job was previously a contractor and made it into an overflow department support role. I’ve been a contractor for 5 years in this group and saw multiple reorganizations happen during that time, which made my work feel more stable outside looking in. Because of this, I fear that this support position would eventually dissolve in a future department reorganization. 

I want to be strategic and possibly wait for a different position in this department that I’m working towards. However, I just don’t want to look like I’m not interested in a in-house position if I don’t apply.

17gxmbk,Transitioning My Career to Graphic Design and Video Editing – Seeking Guidance and Insights,"Hey everyone,  
  
I'm Vinicius, male, 24yo, and I'm in the process of transitioning my career...  
  
Currently, I'm a full-time employee in Brazil (CLT), and for a while now, I've been thinking it's time to make a change in my career path, as I don't see a future in my current profession. Ever since my childhood, I've always been into computers, playing games, and had a strong affinity for technology. Like many gamers, I've enjoyed recording my gameplay and playing around with video editing, creating edits here and there. I've also had a fascination with the idea of producing creative artwork, but I've never delved too deep into it, except for some basic tinkering in Photoshop and occasional ventures into After Effects.  
  
With all this in mind, I recently enrolled in a Graphic Design program at college with the intention of shifting my career towards video editing and graphic design. This transition is quite recent, with only a month since I started college. I'm still uncertain about which specific area within this field to focus on, and I'm extremely inexperienced in graphic design and art creation in general. When it comes to video editing, I believe I can manage decently, but I'm still just a beginner.  
  
The reason I'm writing this post and joining this community is to connect with people like you. Professionals who are already established in the industry and may have gone through the same career transition I'm currently navigating. I'm hoping to gain insights and share my journey with you, with the goal of eventually giving back to the community.  
  
With all that said, let's get to the point...  
  
I have doubts about how to acquire as much knowledge as possible to start working in the field as soon as I can. I don't feel like I possess the skillset to create professional-level artwork just yet so I can offer my services as a freelancer. The online college I'm attending progresses relatively slowly, and I finished all the available materials in the first two weeks of the first month.

17gx8f0,Need help determining if I’m better for a creative director or art director role!,"I work for an marketing company and I need help writing a resume and switching career titles but I’m not sure what types of roles I should be applying for. Here is a summary of my responsibilities:

I personally created the photography department. My role requires me to meet with our clients in order to discuss the needs of photography not only for their website but for their social media, advertising and any other collateral they would be using photography for. I talk to them about the tone, branding, look and feel of what they are going for. I will also give them my own input regarding what I feel they should be doing. Once we discuss the logistics of the shoot, I’ll search for a photographer in their area, negotiate pay, have a conversation about what the client is seeking as well as create any Pinterest or idea boards to help drive the creative direction of the shoot. I work with production coordinators in securing permits for locations as well as review and alter or approve the schedule for the shoot day. Once all of the logistical and creative information has been set, I act as a liaison between the client and photographer to eliminate any barriers or road blocks.

Once the Photoshoot is complete, I personally review and edit all of the photos myself as well as deliver the final assets to the client.  

My role also requires me to create a multi tiered product that establishes price and deliverables that clients can purchase for their needs.",throwawayacct54367,2,1.0,0,1698328908,2023-10-26 14:01:48,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gx8f0/need_help_determining_if_im_better_for_a_creative/,10,2023

17gul36,Harassment at the Workplace,"Sorry in advance for being so long, but here it goes.

I worked as a technician for a major oil company for the better part of 14 years. It was a great job in terms of pay and benefits, and the schedule was ok too. Plenty of vacation time, lots of opportunities for overtime, and generally good all around. There were some of the normal drawbacks, sure, but overall I enjoyed the job. The big downside was my boss and the overall management team at the site. But those I could bear for the most part.

Over the years, my boss seemed to do everything he could to keep me under thumb. On top of that, he was very unprofessional. He’d say sexually explicit things, make jokes about people’s physical traits (in my case, jokes about me being short), and he’d even kick me in the knees…just to name a few things. Well, after getting passed on for a promotion (which was given to a new guy who’d been hired 6 months prior…and who happened to be buddies with my boss), I felt I had had enough. So, I started applying to jobs at other companies. It should be noted that moving departments or locations is next to impossible at this company.

After a year or so of job hunting, I finally got an offer at a different major oil company and accepted it. At this point, I submitted a formal complaint against my boss to HR. I had not done so previously because the company is notorious for not really doing anything about complaints and I did not want to be retaliated against.

The investigation was initiated, and HR interviewed my boss and only one additional employee. They did not interview my entire team or any other employees. Ultimately, I ended up resigning from the company because the other job was starting and I hadn’t heard anything about the investigation, nor did I think anything would happen.

A couple of weeks into the new job, I contacted my HR person who was handling the investigation because I wanted to see what was being done with my case and, in all honesty, I was missing my old job. It’s hard to break 14 years of routine. The HR rep informed me that they had concluded the investigation and sent their findings to local management and legal, which gave me hope, but they couldn’t tell me the results since I was a former employee at that point. So I did more digging and have come to my own conclusion that the company most likely won’t punish, relocate, or terminate my former boss.

My question for Reddit is, should I escalate my complaint to a federal agency, such as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or similar? Would it be a total waste of time? Or should I just proceed with the new job and drop it altogether? My only issue with the new job is the lack of vacation (I lost a lot of vacation moving companies) and no overtime opportunities. I knew both of these going into the new job, but I had to get away from my old boss, no matter what. I just assumed that HR would have taken my claims seriously. I mean, I submitted 9 very detailed pages with truthful accusations that included dates, details, and (if applicable) witnesses to 2 years’ worth of incidents. I miss my old job and I mentally haven’t connected with my new job, though I’ll admit it’s only been a few weeks. I just worry constantly about the whole situation. I’ve had some significant anxiety about the whole thing. I want to go back to my old company, and I’d love it even better just to go back to my old position. But I feel like my departure is permanent and nobody in HR is willing to talk to me.",No_Damage9904,3,1.0,0,1698320696,2023-10-26 11:44:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gul36/harassment_at_the_workplace/,10,2023

17gu1tm,Should I leave?,"Should I quit job?

I (29F) work in a job where I work remote 80% of the time with the exception of some away days/training days. Last week my team got together with another team in our head office city and things got a bit wild. 

I got extremely drunk to the point where I don’t remember going home. I do vaguely remember discussing salaries with the MD and telling a few stories/office goss about my boss, who reports into him, he gave a bit of extremely confidential office goss back. What I should note is I have a tendency to talk absolute shit when I’m drinking, as in fabricating complete lies. In recent years I’ve really re-evaluated my relationship with alcohol and haven’t been drunk like that in maybe 4+ years. I really don’t know what happened. 

Because I’ve lost about 2 hours of conversation, I’m thinking the absolute worst. What could I have said. 

No one who was there has been in touch to say I was out of order or to let me know what I said. 

I have a great relationship with my boss, whereas they don’t and feel he is going to use this to his advantage. 

Should I get ahead of whatever I done and just quit? I don’t want my boss to hate me. I don’t think what I done and said was sackable but I don’t want to spend anymore time here if I have ruined our working relationship. Do I take some sick leave and dodge the whole thing and give myself time to find a new job or just leave with immediate effect. Or do I just continue as normal.

In my industry, I’m considered to be at an Associate Director level although my title is Senior Manager (we do not have AD titles). Titles aside, this is the happiest I’ve ever been.

My job motivates and inspires me, and I feel a sense of purpose. It’s also very flexible when balancing my family life with work.

My only motivation to move is to gain the Director title and what this would mean for my career trajectory, as I don’t see a Director position opening at my current company any time soon. I worry that I’m trading a more senior title with the happiness I have at my current role.

17gt34z,Consulting at Big4 v/s B2B,"Context:
 I'm based out of India. Just graduated with a bachelor's (undergrad), tbh I wanted to work in the sustainability space something in clean tech or clean energy but that didn't work out. I right now have two offers and I need to pick one. I do not atleast for now intend on working in consulting in the long run. Except if it has to be impact consulting (maybe). What I'm realising is that sustainability excites me a lot and hence in terms of function I could be anywhere few years down the line, business development or say a VC etc. Apart from this I also am keen on the startup ecosystem and marketing as a function. Cut to now. 

Option 1: 
Startup working with Saas companies and running their sales and marketing. I have interned there, it's a great place to work at, smart folks, the opportunity I have would be essentially business strategy/ceo's office. Get to do sales and strategy. It's a client facing role. All in all the work excites me and will be a good challenge. Plus it'll help me connect with big people at a CXO level. Along with this i also get to work on some B2B branding stuff. 

Option 2: 
Consulting- financial service organisations at Deloitte. It's a PMO engagement includes a lot of on ground work helping the client transition and implement - tbh not too excited about that. I'm not too excited at the thought of working there. But i come from a tier 2 college so this as some would say would do some ""re-branding"" for my profile. And I can always switch after one year. Consulting supposedly opens the door to a lot of options which I guess is true. 

Future plans: 
Masters plans are there for sure. Top B schools in India and would be considering the cream schools in the states/Europe as well.  Not very keen on management consulting in the future (unless it's impact but again this opinion could be coming from a personal interest atm and could differ in reality). 

I'm very confused about picking one. I know I have to make this decision on my own and both options have their pros and cons. Need advice!! Any insights or life advice would help.

One is at a start up agency who is scaling rapidly (won 10 new accounts in the last 3 months), in the e-commerce space which is hot, but pays slightly less and title is slightly more junior. 

I’m trying to decide which is the better long term decision. Things that are important to me are work/life balance, opportunity to work remote, making money, growing my skill set and progressing my career, being in a role that’s engaging but also not hugely stressful.

17gnjin,Need advice - asking manager to consider me for a position many levels above current job grade.,"I am in a ‘career level 11’ in my large company and I noticed there was a job opening in my department (aprox 45 people). This new position is a career level 18 and certain designations are considered an asset to hold in this position. 

I reached out to my direct manager to discuss my application toward this role with the caveat that I do the training while in the role. She was very very supportive and encouraged me to reach out to the director to discuss. 

I did, and I have an informal discussion on Monday regarding the position. 

For context I have a great reputation in my department and often take on many duties outside and above my role. 

My question is, is it inappropriate to ask them to consider me for the position with the idea that I am going to receive the appropriate education to do this job? I was going to pitch it as me being a ‘junior’ or ‘in training’ professional in this role rather than them outsourcing someone.

17gnc8p,Applying to an internal position two months after joining a new company?,"Hi! A little over two months ago, I started job with a new company. Going into this job, I knew I was a bit overqualified for the position, but accepted due to the fact that this particular company prioritizes internal employee advancement. Fast-forward to now, I don’t feel like my skills are being completely utilized in this position, which I fully acknowledge was to be expected.  
  
However, there is now an internal job posting for a position that sounds exciting, better fits my skill set, and that pays more than I make at the moment. What would the best process be to apply for this position? Should I even bother at this point or wait for another internal opportunity to pop up in the future?

17gmo5i,Should I ask for a demotion?,"I graduated with a degree in marketing and started working in a warehouse. I worked hard and was very respected. 

After a few months I applied to move into a sales rep roll in the office and was hired in very fast. The role was nothing like what I anticipated. The company sells products I don’t believe will be successful long term and those products face political headwinds. The company is only 17 years old or so. I’ve been there for a little over a year.

**PROS**
The job isn’t physically hard at all. 
They pay my phone bill completely every month. 
I’ve gotten to travel to some pretty interesting places. 
I like my coworkers. 

**CONS**
I don’t care for what we sell, but not caring about the products isn’t really a problem because my accounts are up drastically since I started. Higher than some other established reps. I don’t make commission and I’m pretty underpaid for the revenue I produce. The salary is under the US average for a similar role. It barely makes anymore money than my warehouse title did. When I travel on weekends occasionally, I don’t get extra compensation. Salary was presented as an advantage to me but turned out to be an advantage for them. 

My boss is an actual alcoholic and makes an a** of himself regularly, especially on sales trips. I don’t feel respected in the office despite being on time and being a cordial person. I have even helped them with many projects outside of my job description. I tipped them off on some drastic overforcasting and was laughed at, then a few months later I turned out to be right. Now there is massive pressure on us to turnover inventory. Feels like there is more pressure on me as the newest guy even though I’m over performing. 

Should I ask for a demotion if there isn’t a job readily available or should I stick it out for experience until I get another job? How should I ask? I imagine they would be shocked and maybe even angry with my request if I don’t word it to them correctly. 

I’m only conflicted with this because this job has notably affected my self esteem, and has put me in some embarrassing situations that make me question my worth.",iBoughtAtTheBottom,2,1.0,1,1698288823,2023-10-26 02:53:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gmo5i/should_i_ask_for_a_demotion/,10,2023
17gmn48,"Industries with Japanese-speaking jobs? Career advice needed. (Sorry, long post!)","Hi, I need a career advice. I found myself in a situation where my previous work experiences (5+ years) seem to worth little... or maybe I'm just targeting the wrong industries?   
I'm originally from russia, living in a political exile in a neighbouring (semi-stable) country. I have a bachelor's degree in Japanese linguistics, and I left behind a successful career in my home country (but I didn't have an option to stay). And so, I'm struggling now to make a new start now. The job market were I live is dire, and I can only hope for a remote job for a company based elsewhere. However, companies in some European jurisdictions don't seem to hire non-local employees, even for remote roles. I plan to move to an EU country next year, and hopefully things will get better for me there. But now, being jobless for more than half a year, and rarely hearing back from recruiters, I'm quite desperate. I'm starting to question if I'm looking into the wrong industries.  
My experience includes:  
\- Translation & consecutive interpretation   
\- Desk research (mainly on politics) and news monitoring  
\- Administrative assistance (hated every second of doing it)  
\- Project management and event management assistance (very low-key)  
\- Japanese language teaching  
\- English copywriting and UX writing (but only briefly)  
\- Knowledge of CRM platforms (briefly worked for an EdTech startup)  
Not the most suitable qualifications for a ""digital nomad"" lifestyle. Also, my two main problems are:  
1. Translation jobs (my primary career focus in the past) are ruled out, as I worked mostly between Japanese and Russian, which is almost a dead market now (if one is in neither of those countries), and no translation agency would hire a person to translate between their non-native languages (although I'm confident with Ja<>En as well, but who would believe it)  
2. Apart from that, I've done a little bit of everything, and but I worked for 3 years at a stiff and extremely bureaucratized Japanese-style workplace with suffocating micromanagement and no opportunities for leadership. In other words, as a ""local"" (i.e. non-Japanese) employee I never assumed much responsibility; effectively I can hardly say that I ""managed projects"" — merely ""provided assistance"".  
3. I'd like to keep using Japanese at work, otherwise I'm afraid I'll forget it, which would be a shame, as at my peak I was at a near-native level. Not mandatory, of course, at this point, but I think it's one of my most marketable skills.  
What I have already tried:  
\- Localization/translation project management roles. Would be ideal for me, but they usually want someone who already has the relevant experience of a project manager for a translation agency (I don't).  
\- Japanese speaking customer support roles. It seems I don't always stand the competition with candidates with more experience in tech companies. Never once landed an offer. Relevant openings are rare to find. Dubious professional growth prospects.

\- Copywriter roles. I probably dislike the job too much and it shows. Not a single offer.  
\- Virtual assistant roles. Ugh. Those are mostly shit jobs and often underpaying (am I wrong?).  
\- Japanese teacher positions. I love teaching. But most roles advertised are for online tutoring marketplaces: would be barely possible to make a living.   
Am I sleeping on some other industries?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks.

17gls4d,Should I leave my job for double my salary?,"I have been at my company for about 5 years now. This is my first ""real"" job out of college. I started as an entry level sales development representative and quickly worked my way up to an Account Executive. 

We are a startup that has gone from 30 employees when I started to almost 200. I have exceeded my quota every year and I’m the top rep. On paper, my on target earnings are 150k (50/50 split), but I'm on track for 300k+ after all is said and done.

Recently, a recruiter reached out to me about a startup in the same industry that I know. The offer would be 300k OTE (50/50 split). So double my base and if I continue to crush it there, I could surpass that. Here's what's going through my head that I'd like some insight on. 

Reasons to leave:
• more base
• more earning potential over time (even if not to start)
• our company will likely get acquired soon
• our company isn't as exciting to work at as it once was when it was smaller
• I find myself working late every night
• getting somewhat bored of same old same old

Reasons to stay:
• who knows if this new company will survive long 
• I'm already doing well and making good money, might as well ride this out as long as possible
• way less risky

FWIW, I don't want to be a sales manager and want to continue to be a rep.
What do you think?

TLDR Been with my startup for 5 years, currently a top-performing AE with 150k OTE, on track for 300k. Got offered 300k OTE at another startup. Unsure whether to stay in my comfortable, successful position or take the risk for potentially higher earnings.

17glkwa,Am I being fired?,"This is long; I'm sorry in advance. My team has always been understaffed and overworked. We just completed a nearly year long project (this involved long hours, weekends, etc.) and is moving into another big milestone project with a tight turnaround. During this transition our team was told we'd have lower priority projects placed on hold/delegated so we can focus on this.   
To note, the team reports to a high level exec, and another exec on the team just announced they'd be leaving the organization.   
I was told the two of my big projects will be delegated to another team leaving me with just this new milestone to focus on (which is a lot but manageable) and a smaller project.   
I also saw a ""transition"" meeting on my supervisor's calendar with leaders in our team. My super and I have similar positions, but my super is probably overdue for a promotion. When I asked my super about all these changes/if there's anything to worry about she said we'll know more by end of the month/beginning of next and right now to just support her. As you can imagine, this is not at all reassuring.   
I have never received any negative feedback about my work or performance, in fact the opposite. Also had excellent reviews. Only minor suggestions on things, if any.

17gl8vx,Has sticking out on a depressing job ever been worth it for you?,"I (22) landed a job at a objectively amazing company. Full benefits, eap, and pto. I have been here for a year and am really struggling. Long story short my boss has a reputation for treating my team members and I poorly to the point of one of them being severely depressed and having physical/health manifestations from her stress. My other team member developed anxiety and also depression but not as severely. There have been several complaints from multiple team members to HR and nothing was done but telling us that the manager will go to leadership training. I feel physically sick and on edge at work constantly and feel as if i’m having an “existential crisis” all the time because i’ll feel very depressed while at work then remember i’ll die one day and just get panic attacks and I don’t know why necessarily. It feels like impending doom or dread from overthinking how i’m in a place for 10 hours a day that makes me unhappy. My team members are very negative although i don’t blame them it gets to me because all they can talk about is hating the job too. Everyone tells me i’m lucky to be here so young especially because I didn’t finish school. I am not happy at work and I know i won’t be while under my boss but I don’t know if to just stick it out until I can hopefully advance or transfer or if too quit. I unfortunately can’t find anything else where I would receive the same pay and benefits. I feel at a loss because I know i’m lucky and i practice gratitude and mindfulness because I do genuinely feel so grateful to have a job with benefits and decent pay but when i’m physically at work it just is very depressing. I feel i don’t know myself anymore and from how draining work is I just go home and lay down everyday. I barely function and have no friends because I can keep up relationships, don’t cook because lack of energy and hardly do self care. I go back and forth between sticking it out or doing literally anything else since i’m younger and feel I can figure out my career and everything else while working a service job such as bartending/server etc. I would appreciate if anyone has advice regarding this or just what you would tell your 22 year old self.

17gl3tj,Imposter Syndrome?,"I’m a 35 y.o. man and have been in my industry for ~9 years after graduating from business school. I’ve been hard on myself through the majority of my adult and professional life. I was never a stellar student until later in my academic career, when I felt like I had something to prove to myself (i.e., “you are not an idiot, you just never tried.”). I grew up with a sister who was off-the-charts intelligent and lived in that shadow to a degree. 

On the professional front, I’ve been fortunate to land really great internships and full time positions with reputable and well-known firms in my industry, but all of the good things that happen I chalk up to luck and all of the bad - whether or not it’s truly my fault - I place directly on my shoulders. I’ve gotten great promotions, raises, and new employment opportunities all the while constantly wondering when someone will realize I’m not capable, especially the people that work for me. Getting stuck in that mental prison causes me to struggle finding “my voice” and having conviction, which I think is just a coupling of my affable nature and unfounded uncertainty around my actual capabilities. 

I am in constant search of positive feedback, which I totally get isn’t a good look and ultimately becomes a crutch. It’s clear my confidence and (perhaps) my self esteem is low and the positive feedback (I rarely get any criticism) provides a short burst of enthusiasm and motivation that enables me to hit my potential. It’s all counterintuitive relative to how my career has gone to date and potentially a function of the way my organization runs (e.g., little direction and feedback on setting/meeting goals), but trying to not point fingers and better what is in my ability to control. 

Does anyone else deal with this? If so, any tips on how to buck the negative thought cycle and truly build confidence?

17gj69j,Is it better to gamble with a contract role you prefer or play it safe and choose the perm option?,"n May of this year I was made redundant and for the 1st time in my life since graduating found myself without a job.

I began applying/interviewing thinking that with 10 years of media and software experience and being in director level positions I would have no problem landing something. Come August I was still jobless, had made it to 7 final rounds with no offer and starting to feel really down on myself.

I then landed a contract role with one of the largest media agencies in the world as media effectiveness director with the contract running through end of Dec. They’re flex with working remote, pays decent and low stress. I wouldn’t say that I’m challenged and pushed to develop & grow but I am learning a bit. One month in (September) I was told it would go perm at £75k. Now it’s almost November and it still hasn’t gone perm due to the client budget still waiting to be approved and I’m starting to get nervous that it won’t go through despite my manager telling me they’re doing everything they can.

Last week, one of the companies I had a final round interview with got back in touch to say another role was open and made me an offer. It’s a startup agency, the title is account director, so slightly more junior, pays £5k less and they don’t seem to be as flex with working remote. It does seem like there would be more room to grow with it being a startup and are in the e-commerce space which is hot right now. But ultimately if I was already in a perm position I liked I would not leave for this job. 

My dilemma is: do I accept the perm offer that’s on the table with the start up despite it being lower title, lower pay, less work/life balance just so I can have some peace of mind and stability, OR do I take a gamble and hope that the perm offer comes through from the larger company where I’m more satisfied with the title, slightly better pay, more flex working?

17giyuj,Should I take the gap year?,"Hey all,  
  
I am currently a student in Cegep, which is basically Quebec's pre-university, and am planning to move on to university right after, for the fall 2024 semester. However, the idea of a gap year has been running around in my mind for over a year, and I just can't ignore it. In my mind, I have it all worked out. I would apply for university at the same time as everyone in my cohort but would state that I would start my studies only the following year, for the fall 2025 semester (yes, universities in Quebec offer that service). Then, during my gap year, I would work and save money for a big trip that I would be planning for the spring/summer (thinking of the PCT or some other thru-hike, maybe GDT). In short, I know exactly what I would be doing during my gap year, and my university would already be figured out as I would have a saved spot for fall 2025. However, I just can't get myself to fully commit to this project, I can't fully commit to this dream of mine of doing something like this. Since I don't have anyone near me, in my family or friend group, who's done something of the sort, I'm feeling kind of lost, not having anyone who agrees this is a somewhat good idea. They pretty much all think that it would be lost time and that I should just continue my studies to finish them ASAP.

17gi8d4,i’ve screwed myself (i think),"hey guys hope all is well, need some small advice. 

been chasing an elec apprenticeship since i was 18, signed up then, boss smoked meth so i quit (Jr apprentice) i then fell into partying and dealing & eventually got bashed at the age of 20 for talking shit after my bestfriend set me up, i sat in depression until 22 because my veneers didn’t fit properly and have been trying to fix them the past 3 years (20-23) during that time i picked up an elec apprenticeship but quit because i couldn’t afford dental work & was flat out miserable. 

I move back into my mums house and have an interview tomorrow, the thing is because i signed up as a Jr at 18 i will only be on $500 a week instead of mature wages. I’m scared by the time i’m 27 that i will be sore from the trade & want to change. 

I used to be a good computer nerd / hacker so idk if i should just quit electrical all together as i only have 8 months out of the 4 years of accreditation, and transition into IT or something.

He is so clueless and likes to pretend he knows everything. And now he’s trying to micromanage me-everything has to be approved…for what? We have controls in place already that allows approvals from different levels.

17ghq33,Should I quit my current job? (Just want to talk to someone),"I know this is not a very helpful title, and actually I've already had an answer. The reason why I ask is because I think I need to talk to someone, but not the people I know - I don't want to bother them. So I appreciate any suggestions and commentaries.   
I am an expat working for a company in another country. The company is not bad, and the team is not that bad either. However, at the first month I joined the company I had already seen the problem. I attempted to give my advice based on my experience (I had more than 10 years working experience in the industry, though it doesn't mean anything). My colleagues or the leads did not think that would be the problem. So after near a year, there is no change, which should be fine until I fuck up several things consecutively. The problem I foresaw and the advice I provided were that the production environment did not have some auto recovery, versioning baseline in coping against the service failure, or buffer between customers and the system. So when something goes wrong in the production, it becomes an extremely urgent problem. And recently I made such mistake. Though it's not external customer facing services, I still feel very bad.   
I am thinking to quit my job. I do not have any offers at hand right now. I am chatting with someone else, but I do not think I will grab any in any time soon. The problem right now is if I quit, I will have to leave the country I stay in 3 months, and several tasks I need to do myself like resident permits, and so on. Also, if I leave the current country I live, other ongoing job interviews may need to abort because the current interviews I have comes from I stay in the same or close time zone (e.g. +-2 time zone) to the interviewing companies.   
Apologize if I reply late or forget to reply (I am not sure if I would have time because recently I am extremely busy). I feel depressed, probably coming from accumulated feeling of down in the dumps for some time already. I appreciate any suggestions, commentaries and advice. Many thanks.

17gh68v,Engineering or Software Development?,"I (18M) am from the UK and finished year 13 in June. I did A-Level Maths, Physics and Computer Science and finished with grades BCC in that order. I deferred my offer at university to study mechanical engineering, in order to find a degree apprenticeship. In the meantime, I am doing full-time work and if I am unsuccessful in finding an apprenticeship, I still have my place at university.

Out of curiosity, I searched for the role of a Python developer on Indeed as I have 2 years of experience with Python from my time in sixth form studying computer science. I noticed that the jobs advertised as a software engineer/developer had salaries ranging between £50k-£70k which blew my mind. I searched for roles of being an aerospace engineer or a mechanical engineer and the jobs advertised were between £30k-£40k. 

My lifelong dream has been to use my math skills to invent something meaningful and eventually build a successful business,  I believed a career as a design engineer was my path.  
Now, I'm questioning my choices. I've never been a car enthusiast, but I have a deep interest in math and physics, which is a huge motivator for an engineering career. My A-Level Computer Science experience was challenging, and I lost countless nights of sleep during coding projects.

The questions I have: 

* Should I go down the path of software engineering or should I stick with my original career choice? 
* Is there anyone out there who was in a similar position as me and regrets the decision they made or is very happy with their position?
* What is it like as a software engineer?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated

**TL;DR:** Finished A-Levels with an interest in engineering but considering a career in software development due to salary disparities.

17ggyv8,My manager revoked his consent for me to record meetings,"I wrote here previously, but my manager is extremely untruthful and unorganized. When backed against the wall, he will blame others. I’ve been on the receiving end. I’ve documented our convos via email and he would respond back to anything he deemed unfavorable to him as “untruthful.” This has been ongoing for a a long time and I got his manager involved. 

I received his permission in writing to record the meetings via our companies communication tool (teams). I also told his manager and she was fine with it. He initially agreed and this went on for a week. It was not favorable to him by any means. The amount of times I have recorded reminding him of the same thing over and over was alarming. The amount of times I have recorded of him giving incorrect information is alarming. 

He then revoked his consent out of the blue today saying it makes him “extremely uncomfortable.” He also claimed it’s illegal, despite giving his consent. I went to HR who said there is a policy that says if he doesn’t like it I have to stop. They said nothing I did was illegal as him staying on the meeting and me having it in writing was his consent. However I now have to stop since he said it makes him uncomfortable. The meeting with HR went well and they seemed to agree with my concerns and we will have a meeting all together. 

My question is, shouldn’t it be a red flag to HR and his manager that he suddenly didn’t want the meetings recorded!? Or am I only viewing this from my standpoint. He claims my concerns are not valid, but wouldn’t the recordings prove that?",ventingin2020,6,0.8799999952316284,2,1698272581,2023-10-25 22:23:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ggyv8/my_manager_revoked_his_consent_for_me_to_record/,10,2023
17gg0fk,Internship Salary Negotiation,"Hi guys, I'm a sophomore at U.C. Berkeley and my hometown is Irvine, CA (giving this as a reference for my questions/advice needed). I'm interviewing for a Data Analyst role in Columbus, Ohio right now, with a given salary range of $15-45 an hour. Geography of the role, college major, college year, skill level, and major are factors to move up the hourly wage range given. I have a final round tomorrow, and I believe I will need to negotiate my hourly wage at this interview. 

It is a large company, and I would like to get $30 an hour as I am honestly overqualified for the position, and my college's prestige, my experience in 2 prior internships, and my Statistics major + advanced coursework is something I think would help me negotiate higher - but I am also only a sophomore in college and the job is in Ohio where the wage is much lower than CA so I am unsure for what figure to ask. From my research the average hourly wage for similar roles in Columbus is around 16$ so maybe I should ask for like $20 an hour, but housing over the summer is a cost I'd have to pay, and I got paid $22 an hour as a freshman in a similar role back home, so it feels weird to take the pay cut. 

Regardless I could use some advice, and any pointers on negotiation!",yaboisecretaccount,1,0.6700000166893005,2,1698270220,2023-10-25 21:43:40,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gg0fk/internship_salary_negotiation/,10,2023

You need an income and you need intelligence. I was thinking of looking into sales as a career or something along those lines but I have no experience and no one around me with that either.

It’s a tired question, I know, but older people rarely ask it. When they do, the answer is either “You can do it!” or “Your arthritis will bankrupt the HMO."" There's no real perspective about what is likely to happen for the average, non-extraordinary person who isn't spending 10-16 hours coding a day.

It's hyperbole in both directions and I don't know how to make what I'm reading relevant to my situation.

I have some obvious disadvantages, but some advantages as well. I live mostly on my husband's salary, have a home office, and more free time than a lot of people would in my situation. So it's not all bad.

 Was hired 2ish years ago and told that I would replace a manger that is leaving. That manager left recently and I was told management role is now being split. My coworker is being handed majority of managerial tasks, and I was given paperwork. My reviews have been great, I am a dependable employee. My suspicion is that my personality is the issue - I'm nice, but not out going. Head manager asked me how I felt about being subordinate to my coworker. I was so stunned that all I could answer was ""he is great.""

I am considering becoming a contract worker in the next few months. I feel petty for thinking about leaving, but I feel like I was misled. I would also make 1.5 to 2 times more money as a contract worker, but not have benefits between contracts (time off, healthcare).

On top of all this, I have a severe illness and will likely get into a clinical trial next year. The clinical trial could be hard to schedule around if I switch jobs. I also am tied to a lease for one more year.

I am really conflicted, but honestly don't think I will be able to let go of ""feeling misled.""

I also ventured into freelance work, where I achieved some success, working as a Project Coordinator, Marketing Coordinator, Product Marketing Specialist in AdTech, and even exploring freelance copywriting and production for commercials and music videos.

17gd9x8,Promote or Coast,"I'm in a technical role now that affords me:

Near 100% autonomy as long as my work us done.
Company car.
Good salary

I am extremely high performing and can easily get my job done in about half the time it takes my peers.  I work from home and am able to make all of my kids' school functions, family emergencies, etc.  Basically, I have a great job with bulletproof job security.  I could do this forever if I wanted.

I was offered a management role.  It paid more, but I'd lose the car and so I wouldn't get a raise until 2 years in, given the need to buy a car.  I declined, at which point I was asked to fill in for a manager who was leading a project in another department.  In the 3 months I have been managing, all performance metrics are improved, some radically.  I was asked to fill a new manager slot based on my performance.  I declined again because leading people is *a lot* more work and my family does very well on my salary.  My freedom is worth something, even if I can't quantify it.

So a new role comes up.  No direct people management, more of a technical liaison between departments.  Still work from home, but more meetings/conferences than my normal job.  This role I can see myself doing and would enjoy intellectually, but I will lose some freedom and the company car.  That said, I think I can get a big enough pay bump on this posting to break even after 1 year when I buy a car. 

Do I take the new role?  I have a good thing going, but the company isn't going to keep throwing offers at me forever, so I'm wondering if I shouldn't give up some freedom to advance my career.

Facts:

Mortgage is 18% of combined married take home pay.  House paid off next year.  No other debt.

2 kids under 6.  Plan to fully educate both through post grad.

17gcfht,Mouse House Intern Or Stay Put?,"Disney PI or Current Woroplace New Offer?

Hey Everyone,

My head is spinning over this decision, but the answer is probably obvious. I love Disney and have tried to get an internship for the last 3 years, so it only makes sense that they ultimately give me an offer after I have graduated lol.

I started working at a hospital as a financial analyst about 8 months ago and when I told them this they gave a new offer that evening. Here are the details of both offers.

Disney -Proffesional Intern Analyst in Global Travel and Expenses. 
No benefits other than park passes and discounts.
Pay is 21.75 an hour.
Report to Senior Analyst
Possible Full time offer at end.

Hospital New Offer - Project/M&A Manager
Full benefits for around $120 a month.(not needed cause have insurance through mom and dad)
Pay is 35.20 an hour
4K tuition reimbursement per fiscal
PTO and 3% Salary match
Report to CFO, COO, and CEO

My heart says disney but my brain sees the logical choice. I feel like I might be able to learn more at disney but this may be a grass is greener effect. 

I want to hear other people’s opinions on this to help uncloud my judgement. The only thing I am really thinking about is if the disney brand is really worth the differences in the packages.

Ultimately, my career goal path is to work for 2-5 more years then get my MBA. Hopefully this will help me pivot into a consulting/IB position.

- We were both hired straight out of college with the same exact degree and minimal industry-related experience, and our benefits are the same, so there is no good reason for the pay discrepancy other than that I took their lowball offer out of desperation. 

- This 30% raise would get me in the average range of salaries for my kind of position in my city, which is on the low side of the national average.

- My contributions this past year have been extremely significant to the company overall, and I have gained a LOT of experience and become very useful since starting this job. I’ve also taken on responsibilities that are outside of my job description and taught myself systems that no one else in my department is able to operate. All in all, I feel warranted asking for a hefty raise considering everything I’ve done. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!",spvce-cadet,1,1.0,3,1698260286,2023-10-25 18:58:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gc7i2/new_hire_with_similarfewer_responsibilities/,10,2023
17gc5x3,Should I go the extra mile by giving overtime and working on weekends for my company since they were so generous with me?,"I have been working for this company as a senior software engineer for about a little over a year now. Around May this year I was diagnosed with  a Giant Cell Tumour on my right hand wrist. I have been to several doctors and they said I needed immediate surgery or I would end up with something more serious later on. So, after making a decision with my family we decided to go abroad for the treatment. Working  for me was a painful experience around that time so I informed my office about the whole ordeal and they wholeheartedly accepted it. Initially I took a month of paid leave but the surgery was a bit more complicated which left me with me being unable to move both my right leg and right hand. So i had to stay in the hospital for around 20 days extra. After coming back home I was unable to work with both of my hands and I did whatever I can with my left hand only. My office doesn’t allow remote work but I was an exception. 2 months after the surgery I again had to go to the hospital for a follow up to remove my plasters. That took around 15 days. At this point I used up all of my paid leave but my employer payed me the full salary without cutting anything. It will take about another 2-4 months till I fully recover so for now I will be working from home.

So this week we had a critical bug in our app that would’ve taken be about 2 days to figure out and fix it within the office time. I informed my boss about it and he got really mad. He was expecting me to do overtime and work on the weekends on my own accord. This was his exact reply, “As you know we were very supportive of you, giving you as much time as you needed for your health. Do you think it is unfair of us to think you would do overtime and weekends to resolve urgent show stoppers? You can say this is not fair, and I will accept.”. I was so embarrassed that I had no choice but to accept the overtime and weekend duty. As my office provided me with almost 2.5 months of paid leave for my health should I compromise and give them what they want?",Baldy5421,2,0.6700000166893005,3,1698260164,2023-10-25 18:56:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gc5x3/should_i_go_the_extra_mile_by_giving_overtime_and/,10,2023
17gbzv4,Stick it out or leave (with a huge paycut)?,"I'm at a fork in the road regarding my career and I don't know what to do. I'd appreciate any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you in advance!

Context and background: I have seven years of experience in the tech space and I've generally been a high performer with rave reviews from prior managers. My undergrad is in econ and I have an MBA from a top univeristy. I'm currently working on cerifications in data science and data analytics. 

Most of my background is in corporate finance. However, last year, I was given the opportunity to dive into my industry a bit deeper in an operations role. This role was under a new manager, who I worked with before but not super closely. It is his first time in a management position.

Making this switch has been a huge mistake. I won't go into too much detail here, but this job (and more speficially, the manager) has taken a signifant toll on my mental health, to the point of suicidal ideation. To put it another way, if I reported to my old manager still (in the job I currently have), I know for a fact I wouldn't be feeling this way. Although I don't love the work I do, it's not horrible. There are just some.. issues with my current manager that are too much to list here.

I'm looking for jobs outside my current company, but it's looking like I may take a pay cut. I'd likely move from $130k to around $100k - $110k. Although this hurts my ego, considering my YEO and education, I'm starting to think it's worthwhile to make the change.

My options are the following:

1. Stay in my current role and try to move back to finance in a couple of months. I may or may not be able to find a job in my old org. I have a great reputation with my finance peers, but we're also starting to offshore work to other countries.

Although I have met expectations in all of my reviews with my current manager, I am constantly worried that this may change in the future. If it does change, this could hurt my chances of making an internal move. 

Futhermore, my company is going through some tough times right now and our future is uncertain.  If I went with this option, my total comp would decrease slightly in this event, to about $120k. 


2. Take a finance role at a different company. I currently have an interview set up for one company with awesome reviews on glassdoor, but total comp would be roughly $100k. However, my husband recently got a nice pay bump that would offset my pay decrease exactly.

Additionally, this would be a new industry (SaaS), which offers better mobility into other companies in the SaaS space. 

Finally, this company is known for its work-life balance, which is really what I need right now. I may also be able to use this additional balance to explore data science a bit more and possibly start freelancing. 


I think I need to go with option 2, but I'm worried I'm hurting my career (and ego, honestly) by making this move. My ultimate goal is to move into the AI/ML space, hence the certifications I'm working on, but I think I'm a while away from being able to make that move. What are your thoughts?",throwaway38372771,2,1.0,0,1698259723,2023-10-25 18:48:43,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gbzv4/stick_it_out_or_leave_with_a_huge_paycut/,10,2023
17gbvdq,"Am I on track to being fired or laid off soon, or is my anxiety making me crazy?","I started at a healthcare / pharma advertising agency last august as a project manager. For the most part, I feel like I’ve done a good job— however we had a huge launch in august of this year (it was for the agencies biggest client). 

During that launch there were 1-2 days where there where mistakes were made by me / the apm as well. I got blamed fully and had to have two meetings with my manager about them. 

There was also another situation to where my manager wanted me to improve upon certain things. So basically, they treated it like I had two big mess ups. 

I also work in a slightly toxic environment where some people are rude and will throw you under the bus for no good reason. An example of that is when I started, the apm said that the other pm always micromanaged her and would yell at her if she did something wrong and make her cry. So I tried to be cool and not micromanage or yell, but found out she complained that I didn’t give her enough direction and didn’t help her out / she felt like she was doing my job. So her and one of my other coworkers complained about me. 

Long story short after launch, I was told I was getting moved to a smaller brand. We are in slow season and there’s not a lot of work on my old brand, but it feels weird that the apm got promoted and essentially took over my role while I got moved to a smaller brand. 

When I expressed my concerns to my managers they basically said no, I’m not getting fired but theres things they would like to see me improve. So they think this is a good time to just freshen up a bit. 

I also found out that I might get moved back to my old brand when things pick up in January. 

For extra background: I went on vacation for a week in September and my manager said after coming back — that she felt like she failed me as she didn’t realize how many projects that I was working on. She had to bring in 5 other pms to help cover my projects. (I was on maybe 5x the amount of projects that the other pms had)

My question to you is— with being moved to a smaller brand with less billable hours (even though my old brand is very slow) especially with the few mistakes and coworkers complaining about me— am I on track to getting fired soon? 

My performance review has been pushed 2 weeks in a row now, and now includes my managers manager (they discussed the goals I set for myself and wanted to rework them a bit to be “more measurable”.) 

While I feel like I’ve done a good job, the other side of me and everything that’s happened, I’m worried says another.",WeCameAsMuffins,6,0.8100000023841858,3,1698259392,2023-10-25 18:43:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17gbvdq/am_i_on_track_to_being_fired_or_laid_off_soon_or/,10,2023
17gbsbq,Physics degree-Looking for career path for middle aged.,"  
Part 1, Advice please:  
Any ideas on career paths? Took the GRE and did better in Verbal (90th percentile) so maybe I just suck at sciences and need to do something more verbal. Looked at an MSCS as well. Applied to PA school but doubt I'll get in.   At 40 years old.... I'm getting too old for 4 more years of school.  I've done other things in medicine but they have been pretty unengaging or unchallenging. I generally work very hard and engage fully into what I'm doing.

  
Part 2, Rant/Background:  
BS Physics.  I sort of regret majoring in physics. Its not that its a bad major, and I love the knowledge.  I graduated over 10 years ago, and had a mildly difficult home environment, so my mental health was a disaster and I pulled through with only average grades.   
 

I never wanted to go to grad school, and only later wanted to do med, dental, or PA school. All any grad/med/professional schools see is 2.9 GPA=algorithm autorreject, I don't expect any free lunches but like... it wasn't exactly an easy path.   I took more prerequisites recently and got all A's, but at 210 credits now, I would need 2 more years of college just to raise it.  Its just not worth it.  


  
TLDR:  
\- Could use career recommendations for just a BS

17g9may,My job is replacing Canadian Engineers with Indians,"Hello,

I work as a major national Civil Engineering firm in Canada. In 2020 before Covid started, we would hire new Engineers at $29/h in permanent positions. Covid caused a lot of people to move around jobs, and I noticed every single person who left (around 11) got replaced with Indians.

I noticed they would all come in early and stay late. Apparently him and all the Indians he works with have that they work 7am-5pm in their contracts, meanwhile all the Canadians work 8-4 or 9-5. Worse though, they all work for $21-22 an hour, and are on 12 month contracts with no benefits. They also have masters degrees in civil engineering.  Every Canadian Engineer here with a masters is making $40 an hour minimum. The Indians are happy though because apparently for their qualifications they'd make half.

This has gone on for two years and it's really negatively affecting the workplace because of these ""parallel"" work cultures that are here.

Meanwhile management is making more money than ever while having weekly company events (that the Indians aren't invited to), taking 2 hour lunches, and ending work early to golf on a regular basis. Also frequently working from home which the Indians don't get.

Is there anything I can do? There are two other civil & geotechnical engineering firms in my city I have friends working, and they are all reporting the same thing is happening there.

17g8nbc,Should I ask for payment for training on commission-based job?,"I am employed full time, working remote, and I have the chance to add a side hustle that can be done on my own hours outside my other work. This other work is relatively lucrative, but pays straight commission. Basically facilitating ordering of products for a network of dealers.

It's a remote job, but there's 3 days of training in another city, and a 8 hour hour course I need to take to be registered to trade these goods (it's legit government course, not a scam).

They are putting me up in the hotel I would need and paying gas, but there's been no mention of pay or additional per diem for this training time. I have to either take 3 days off my current role of course to do this, or use vacation days. Neither of which are really ideas since one way I take away income, and the other I lose vacation days with the family. For long term gain I will sacrifice, but I'm not sure why this pressure is put squarely on me to get started.

TL;DR: My question is, should I ask to be compensated a modest rate for the training, or would it look tacky and unprofessional to do this? I've never worked a full commission job so I'm not really sure what to think, but to me on training days there's no commission available, and I'm basically learning how to make them money as much as me, so some sort of base compensation would seem reasonable.

My current situation is i took on a job as a builders labourer to learn how to fix my house. I have now spent around 13k and probably saved about the same not needing labour.

Labouring is obviously not my area and i have a roof to fix and pay for (last job on house that i cant do myself)

I was debating getting back into education so that i can earn more money but it doesn’t seem financially viable. Im currently earning £110 a day as an unskilled labourer. Could earn up to £130 which is heading on over 30k a year. But this seems to be about what teachers are earning and it requires so many more qualifications, stress and hours.

Today i was asked to fill a teaching role for £120 a day lol

Teaching assistants wasnt even financially viable  and this also requires qualifications.

Classroom teacher just doesnt seem worth it. I regret getting into 67ks worth of debt for a job that doesnt even pay median wage.

17g6f30,How wage cuts work when transfer employee?,"I can understand each job position have a wages in range. And if staff is willing to transfer to lower wages then yes must accept the pay cuts.

I'm talking about when first got hired for this specific duty then something happen which move this person to do a job they aren't hiring to do. It becomes permanent job.

Example: engineering who work in office earning 100k a year. One day a person who responsible to unloading the package from truck did quit. That unloading position only earning 30k a year.

When company need someone to unloading truck the plants manager ask engineering to do unloading all because need someone to do it. When this person did unloading it impress the company how strong and fast this person can do. So they decide to have him doing unloading as permanent job instead of doing engineering.

Now what about wages cut? Problem is this engineering person was being asked to do it and this person won't accept wages cuts all because this person can't help it about previous staff who responsible for unloading did quit the job. It's big step down from 100k to 30k when this person aren't hired to do unloading.

I mean if manager asking him to accept leaving engineering job to do unloading and he willing to accept then that's okay. But suppose he willing accept the transfer but not accept reduction their paycheck.

17g5ngk,3+ years unemployed CS graduate. Should I quit the field at this point?,"Hey everyone.

I graduated in 2020 in CS. Since then, I haven’t been able to find a job remotely or locally. 

I did not make any personal projects or practice much leetcode either. The projects on my resume are 4-5 years old and were done during my bachelors.

My problem was that I lacked focus and commitment towards a single technology and as a result, I became a sort of jack of all and master of none. It’s like I would panic upon seeing the job requirements and would jump to learning that tech instead of staying focused on my interests. 

I have many regrets over the time I wasted. I’m trying to move on and learn from my mistakes and I’m dedicating myself to learning full stack development with the PERN stack. 

My approach is to keep learning and building a solid portfolio over the next 6 months.

However, my concern right now is that my unemployment gap is too large to be justified to recruiters. I fear that in the current market I may remain unemployed even with a portfolio and adding 6 months more would bring my gap closer to 4 years.

I have considered relocating but the easiest way I have found is by studying further. I honestly don’t want to study more because I would probably have to do a masters degree which would add another 2 years to my long gap before I become fully employed. I also don’t have any references so obtaining letters of reference would be difficult.

Should I just quit the field at this rate and do something else? Is my situation hopeless? Should I just take up any job even if it’s not related to CS?",sidTheGamer,9,0.800000011920929,12,1698242861,2023-10-25 14:07:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17g5ngk/3_years_unemployed_cs_graduate_should_i_quit_the/,10,2023
17g5c4m,Dilemma: Quit and continue later on once I make more disposable income OR thrive the biz with little $$?,"   
So basically my ecommerce biz is just making ends meet (1.5 years) and breaking even. I quit my day job to support my biz full-time, however, I don't think it's been sustainable.  
So, 2 options:  
1. Shut down the biz and wait till I make more money from my day-job to restart fresh (i.e. biz plan, manufacture products, hire better people, etc.). Cons: lose everything built, lose market exposure.  
2. Thrive the biz with little investment while working my day-job. Cons: I won't spend as much time with my biz..

17g5a4h,Counter offer from employer,"Hello everyone.
I am in between a rock and a hard place and I need reddit user guidance. 
I was noticing for a new job but I was approached by a company that offered me a very good position. 
I work in IT and this new position is a lateral move, the job duties are exactly the same as what I do now.

The benefits I am being offered are:
95K salary
30 to 50% annual bonus of salary
$120 monthly cell allowance
Company paid 100% free insurance for the entire family
Pension program vested after 90 days
401K (no match from employer)
People who hired on the company do not leave, they retire there for the pension.
Very very family oriented company.

My employer is counter offering with this
112K salary
10% bonus annual (bonus does tend to reach 150% every year)
$50 cell allowance 

I would need to do my own insurance which works to be about 12K for the family.
I am also being pushed to management if I stay with the company.

Both sides have pros and cons but I need to know, what some of you would do?

Also, how can I negotiate the pension with the counter offer?

17g4buz,How do you not let the stress of your work spill into your personal life?,"I joined my company about 2 years ago as a director of demand generation for a saas company. When I joined, the company was fully remote and seemed like the plan was to stay as such.  
Fast forward to about 6 months ago, my boss (CMO) was let go and I have been reporting into my CEO. It's been challenging managing up because he doesnt quite know marketing and my role (demand gen & ABM) is quite difficult for him to grasp. i feel like im constantly defending my job because marketing has areas where its quite diffuclt to tie back to ROI/attribution (ie. brand awareness camapigns). also without a marketing leader steering the ship all the marketing leads have been a little lost and getting all of us together to run full campaigns this year has been challenging. It’s been causing me to do a lot of work beyond my normal working hours because the CEO is located in LA and I am in NYC. The last 2 weeks ive been working until around 10pm-11pm 2-3x a week. plus the CEO is pushing for people to be at least 2-3 days in the office now and all sales teams are expected to be in the office 5 days a week in the last 2 weeks of the quarter. I am one of the few fully remote employees too so I feel like the longer I am here, the more distanced I am from the rest of the company.

The mental stresss has been taking a toll on me. I had my first work nightmare of my life last night. dreaming that my CEO yelling at me for going to the gym in the morning and getting a haircut at 6pm when its only 3pm for him. He would never but obv was a dream.  
I am not totally against my job, I just need to do a better job of setting expectations with my boss and leveling up my team to do more of the work for me instead of me picking up the slack for them.

I’m just curious overall though — **how do yall mentally, emotionally, and physically protect your personal lives to ensure work stuff doesnt spill over into your relationships, hobbies, and overall personal wellbeing?**

Is it possibly time to look for another role elsewhere where I have a boss that understands and values my work vs constantly questioning it?

17g1ijx,Switch from cozy position to a new and challenging team?,"I'm 40, no kids.

I work at a big multinational company in a business analyst position, I have decent salary and the workload is kind of light, for me at least as I already have the knowledge and routine. I have much more time doing other things during the day and I'm not submerged in endless meetings or tasks. My responsibilities are clearly defined and my boss is very kind and supportive. However I cannot advance my knowledge in this team anymore, it's kind of static and I'm limited to my own role strictly. I'm a bit worried that I'll become less and less relevant over the time.

Now I was approached within the company by my ex-teammate to move to a newly formed team for a big project which is a core part of the company's transformation and there is big focus on it. I would have bigger responsibility and workload, but in return I would get higher visibility and I could gain much more knowledge in SAP S4/Hana from the technical aspect and have a stronger CV for the future. This new team also consists really knowledgeable experts whom I could learn from. I would be more resistant to any mass layoffs as well, even though I was assured that even in my current position that will not happen in the near future.

Now I have a dilemma whether it's worth risking my low stress and decent position for the unknown which could lead to way more stress and workload but would secure me better for the future.

I'm 40 and I feel like my time is becoming more and more expensive and I don't want to waste my time with work if not necessary. On the other hand, everything is volatile in the world at the moment, so if I stay in my current position I'm exposed to a different kind of stress where I fear I'll become irrelevant and I'Ll have a hard time getting a good job like this again if something happens.

TL;DR: Have a cozy, stress free and well paying job, and I'm hesitating to join a new team in the same company with more challenges which would result in a much stronger CV. I fear that I make a mistake that I give up my current good life for better future financial security.",Select_Border_748,2,1.0,1,1698229146,2023-10-25 10:19:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17g1ijx/switch_from_cozy_position_to_a_new_and/,10,2023

17fzc8g,Should I change my major?,"Hello! I'm a college sophomore majoring in game art (like 3d environment design) thinking about switching my major to psychology. I wasn't into helping people when I was little, but after I got bullied in high school, I started to notice people in need.  
  
I actually wanted to major in psychology since high school junior, but changed to art right before applying out of a whim because I was into art before I got bullied. I am reluctant to major in psychology because I feel like helping people wouldn't be my trait if I did not get bullied.  
  
People do say they feel better when they talk to me, and even my grandparents and aunts ask for my support. And after helping people, I do feel worthy. But on the other hand something (i don't know what) keeps holding me back from switching my major. Also I am afraid of meeting new people and dislike kids. I was very individualistic person since I was born. I liked to just read in my room and draw when I was in elementary school. I just liked living in my own world by myself, occasionally having fun with peers. Then I got bullied in high school, which made me depressed (therapist actually diagnosed me depression, although I don't like the word because of tiktok). Then, I started to notice other people's emotions, especially those in need. Helping people does sap out my energy but I feel like my life is worth living when I help people feel better.  
  
So I really don't think, if I was currently not depressed due to bullying, I would've not thought about being a therapist at all. Currently, as a game art major, I just mindlessly go to classes and just do the required. I don't have passion for it, but like, passion can be just enjoying mundane life.  
  
People give advice to me that I should think about this after I fix my own mental health, but there's less than two weeks left before I can finalize my major so please help.

17fxxc9,How do employer cut the worker wages all because force them transfer?,"I can understand each job position have a wages in range. And if staff is willing to transfer to lower wages then yes must accept the pay cuts.

I'm talking about when first got hired for this specific duty then something happen which move this person to do a job they aren't hiring to do. It becomes permanent job.

Example: engineering who work in office earning 100k a year. One day a person who responsible to unloading the package from truck did quit. That unloading position only earning 30k a year.

When company need someone to unloading truck the plants manager ask engineering to do unloading all because need someone to do it. When this person did unloading it impress the company how strong and fast this person can do. So they decide to have him doing unloading as permanent job instead of doing engineering.

Now what about wages cut? Problem is this engineering person was being asked to do it and this person won't accept wages cuts all because this person can't help it about previous staff who responsible for unloading did quit the job. It's big step down from 100k to 30k when this person aren't hired to do unloading.

I mean if manager asking him to accept leaving engineering job to do unloading and he willing to accept then that's okay. But suppose he willing accept the transfer but not accept reduction their paycheck.

What most companies do in this situation?  Especially either small business or huge corporations?",Time-Butterscotch350,0,0.5,0,1698213065,2023-10-25 05:51:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17fxxc9/how_do_employer_cut_the_worker_wages_all_because/,10,2023

• I live in Alberta Canada
 -I have two certifications in healthcare (Nursing Unit Clerk (which I had sponsored) and Health Care Aide or otherwise known as a CNA for our American followers. (I took a student loan out for this and I have a year and a bit left of paying it off)).
• I've been in the healthcare industry for 4 years.

Main read: So l've been working in health administration and as a HCA for a bit of time. Unfortunately all of the positions I've had were temporary positions to cover for LOA's. in every temporary position I've been in, they've always been cut short due to the return of the position holder (my shortest position being 3 weeks). Permanent positions are extremely difficult to obtain within my (government) agency due to managers usually knowing who they're already hiring who is internal to the department, or people sit on those positions until they retire. (And some literally outlive their positions). So l'm the past year I've been working multiple casual positions in various departments to make full time hours. Now here's the issue...our agency is implementing a province wide electronic health records system. And ultimately that includes the streamlining of processes, less staff needed and the focus going more on leadership and individual oversight vs having a whole department to do a job. And there is talk of some departments I'm currently in being dissolved in the new year. I've been updating my resume, Cover letter, taking courses to try to stay current with everything, networking with managers, being active on LinkedIn and all that good stuff.

I'm just so anxious about the unknown and l've been trying to future proof myself and to see what other options I have for me. While searching the wide web, I found this brochure for the trades....I have family members in the trades, I love to build and fix stuff, i've welded in shop class once upon a time, but the trades is just something that hasn't crossed my mind when I was young.

17fupts,Do you feel difficult showing your practical abilities to employers and encountered limited opportunities?,"I am 22, a final-year Science student, I recently discussed an emerging trend in corporate hiring with my university's career advisors. They mentioned a shift towards skill-based hiring, emphasizing abilities over 'perfect' resumes or extensive internship experiences. This shift appears to offer opportunities for students like me, with a limited business background, to break into fields like consulting and finance based on our skills.  
**As a STEM student, I'm curious to know: Do you share similar concerns regarding the difficulty of showcasing your practical abilities through traditional resumes?**   
Many of us lack the connections or opportunities for prestigious internships, especially in Science-related fields, which can lead to limited job prospects.  
While some companies may require technical tasks during interviews, this typically benefits only those applied and made it through initial resume screenings. And sometimes I didn't even know that I could apply for certain companies because I was not aware. Even then, these tasks might not truly reflect our suitability for the role. Wouldn't it be more effective if companies could provide a task or challenge relevant to the position? This could allow us to demonstrate our understanding and capabilities effectively.

I had always been interested in becoming a veterinarian since being a kid and I went to a veterinary medicine summer camp, but I'm so unsure. I have heard that vets end up with horrible debt and little pay. Lately I have been considereing human medicine as well, but I'm so usure if the medical field in general is the right fit at all, or if I am good enough to be one of the few to be successful in this field. To be honest, the whole thing is really stressing me out.

I am on a robotics team and I really enjoy doing that, yet I find math harder than all subjects in school. I still manage to maintain an A or B in my honors math classes, but I really excel in my AP classes (high A's in bio, history, english). I was interested in engineering but I wonder if I could survive all the math classes. 

So heres my questions:

1- Should I base my career interest based more on the subjects that I am good at or the ones that i enjoy? 

2- Is it a bad idea to enter a math-heavy field (ex:engineering) since that is a harder subject for me?

2- what are some good outlets for me to explore potential careers?

Is a BAS looked down on or seen as less-than a BS?

I’m 32 and wanting to head towards a new career and this Bachelor’s of Applied Science strikes me as a great option. I have a meeting scheduled with an advisor next week, but am curious to see what Reddit thinks.

17fu85s,Chronically missing days due to uncontrollable life circumstances,"Hi all. I have never had a problem with work attendance in my life but life has been throwing a lot of curveballs at me. I am an MSW student serving a full-year internship in an elementary school, but I work 5 days a week and receive a stipend so it is treated as a ""hire-on"" internship.   
I took a personal day at the start of the month (the day was approved). Last week I drove home from school with a fever, and I had to take a sick day. I went to see the doctor and have documentation for the fever. Yesterday morning, I was involved in a car accident on my way to work that I was not at fault for, but it totaled my car and I do not have a car for the next several days at least (For context, I commute 40 min to the internship). After seeing a doctor, he recommended that I take a week off anyways which I have documentation for. Just to make things even better, I got called for jury duty which I will have to serve in the second week of November. Since my hire, I have informed the school district that I will be taking a week off in January for an international trip. This time off was already approved by admin.  
I have offered three times to carry out duties virtually to continue assisting my supervisor with daily tasks and paperwork. She has declined these offers. I contacted the social work administrator regarding my accident and she said not to fret as the circumstances were out of my control.  
Should I be concerned about these absences impacting how my supervisor views me professionally? I have done my best to maintain and demonstrate professionalism, and I don't want her to think that I am unreliable or intentionally missing days.

17fsule,How to negotiate pay raise at current job with an offer in hand,Background - I have been working at the same company for 23 years as an engineer. They give pay raises annually that generally fall around 3.5% across the board regardless of performance or the economic situation. I have received an offer with a company in the same industry for a 25% higher salary. The hitch is that it's in person in another city and I would have to move my family and sell my fully paid off house and purchase a new one. I am not considering accepting this position but how can I go about using this offer to negotiate a pay raise with my current employer? Is it better to give my 2 week notice and hope they come to me with an offer to stay? Or should I go talk to my supervisor about the offer and ask what they can do? Or something completely different?

17fs93a,Should I leave my family business and start from scratch?,"I have been working for my family business for the last 6 years and have learnt a lot. My father started the company from nothing and is very passionate about it.

  
When I started working, we soon diversified into other products which I worked on from ground up, procurement, logistics, sales, marketing, website, everything! Now this business is supposedly ""mine"" and my ""brother's"" who also joined in later. However, every decision whether it is marketing email frequency to website design, products to sell, how much to spend on marketing, everything goes through him and only what he believes in, is eventually the outcome of the discussion.  


  
During the pandemic, we were down to literally 0 staff. Just me and my brother working and keeping the old and new business running and handling from books of accounts to marketing and everything required to keep it functioning. This went on for 3 years and this year we started hiring staff. Barely getting paid enough even then. Because he wants us to make money out of the new business for ourselves. The business in which he only takes the ultimate decision.

  
Our business also involves us (me and my father) traveling for weeks on a stretch. Living with him is hell. He is an obsessive control freak and wants everyone around him to live according to him and please him. We have plenty fights because I don't give in to his such demands. And because of that, we can barely stay alone together.

  
Now I am at the stage where my marriage is near with my girlfriend and deciding what to do has been very difficult. Staying in the business gives me a false sense of security. I don't see any growth personally because everything is decided by my father. At the same time, starting from scratch is scary when I will have an added responsibility of my to be wife.

I personally created the photography department. My role requires me to meet with our clients in order to discuss the needs of photography not only for their website but for their social media, advertising and any other collateral they would be using photography for. I talk to them about the tone, branding, look and feel of what they are going for. I will also give them my own input regarding what I feel they should be doing. Once we discuss the logistics of the shoot, I’ll search for a photographer in their area, negotiate pay, have a conversation about what the client is seeking as well as create any Pinterest or idea boards to help drive the creative direction of the shoot. I work with production coordinators in securing permits for locations as well as review and alter or approve the schedule for the shoot day. Once all of the logistical and creative information has been set, I act as a liaison between the client and photographer to eliminate any barriers or road blocks.

Once the Photoshoot is complete, I personally review and edit all of the photos myself as well as deliver the final assets to the client.

17fqfr4,Seeking advice: 4th interview (most likely to discuss salary),"For a marketing position.

Hi all, I have a 4th interview with a utility company tomorrow most likely to discuss salary. In the previous 3 interviews, salary was not mentioned at all. But they went over benefits, job duties, and even gave me a tour of their offices. Toward the end of the last interview the hiring manager told me I would be a good fit. Frankly I think I got this in the bag but don’t want to jinx it.

Not to toot my own horn but I’m assuming this last interview will be to discuss salary with just me and the manager. I’m a little concerned about how to approach this. I absolutely love the position based on the last 3 discussions and will definitely take it if offered, depending on the salary…

I’m hoping for 80k based on market avg and my skillset. I’m sure he’ll bring it up first, and when he does I plan to ask what the range is. Based on his response, I hope to ask for ~10% more than that due to the advice of “never (or almost never) take the first offer.” So if he offers 70k, I plan to say “Given my experience and skillset, I was hoping for something closer to 80-85k. Is there anyway we can reach that range?” If he hits the top of my range and offers 80k, again I plan to ask for 90k.

Now if the salary is so low (i.e. 50k) that I wouldn’t even consider it, I’m planning to ask if there are any other positions I might be considered for with a higher salary.

17fom9c,Choosing Between PTA and Rad Tech Program," I've been accepted into both the Physical Therapy Assistant (PTA) and Radiologic Technology (Rad Tech) programs at my local community college. Here's my dilemma:

  
The PTA program is set to start this January (spring semester) and would conclude by the end of the following spring semester, meaning I could become a PTA in just one year. This is possible because I've already completed most of the necessary classes during my bachelor's in health science degree.

  
On the other hand, the Rad Tech program wouldn't begin until the next Fall semester and would extend over two years. While I understand that Rad Techs typically earn more and have various career paths, I'm apprehensive about the hectic hospital environment and the potential stress that comes with it.

  
If I opt for the PTA route, my intention is to eventually work in the home health setting after gaining some valuable experience. However, I'm aware of the greater career potential and higher earnings as a Rad Tech, which complicates my decision further. Even though PTA home health pays a decent amount as well. 

  
I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience in either field or has encountered a similar decision. What factors should I consider while making this choice?

17fo87d,Low stress careers for a professional communicator?,"Hi all!

Currently going through a big career dilemma. I work as a technical marketer in a highly stressful industry (cyber security), and lately my mental health and stress levels have been in the dumps. I have switched jobs a few times in the last four years, and though the environments are different, it's the same story. I get easily overworked, my department is understaffed, and I struggle with work-life balance. Looking for advice on lower- stress career paths for me.

For context, cyber security can be an altruistic and ""save the world"" type of industry, and I'm often spending time crafting responses and awareness campaigns for things like terrorist incidents or infrastructure attacks. So when something big happens, which it has been a lot lately, I feel like I'm never not on the clock and I end up working 10-16 hr days, depending on the day.

I am at the point where I decided I need to take a couple months off to work more intensely on my mental health. I am already in therapy and on medication due to a lifetime struggle with anxiety, but I need something more frequent and focused without work constantly detracting from progress I am making in improving my ""on again off again"" depression and near-constant anxiety. 

While I take time off and focus on myself and my mental well-being, I intend to reflect on my career and if I need a change to something less stressful. This is where I'd love this community's advice. 

A little bit about me without revealing literally everything about me: I have been in the work force for less than 10 years, and I have a BA and studied professional writing and journalism in college. I do not have a master's or PhD. I enjoy brewing beer and distilling alcohol in my spare time, and am passionate about hiking and live in an area with lots of nature. I consume lots of written news and am interested in areas like policy and public safety. 

Skills include: writing, public speaking, project management (though I kind of hate project management), research, and knowing a lot about cyber security 

Strengths: critical, empathetic, organized and structured, quick learner, altruistic, able to coordinate cross-functional groups and mediate disputes 

Weaknesses: struggles to operate with ambiguity, overwhelmed easily, often commit to more work than I can handle and then have to backtrack, can get anxious with some high impact interpersonal interactions (like a meeting with a big client -- I'm weirdly fine with public speaking to 400 people though)

It appears flexible, low stress, the people are nice, simple tasks, etc. The hours are nominal and inconsistent and I'm not making much money. Nominal hours come with the benefit of being able to take care of other business during my week. 

I received and accepted a new job offer (I didn't tell current employer I was interviewing because I was confident I did terrible during my interview and wouldn't get it). Pay is better than any job ive had, it's full time, a government job, probably high stress.

Anyway, how can I handle telling my current employer? I don't know if I want to quit-quit, I like the idea of working a couple nights a week. There's a certain (low) amount of hours you have to work each month to stay on the books. However, they were mainly looking for someone to help in the mornings. The one I just accepted is going to be demanding for some time, and I don't know my schedule until I'm done training.

I studied abroad in the Netherlands and got a job after my internship. It was a difficult time but with all my efforts (+ my luck) I was able to secure a permanent spot in my internship team. I was so over the moon and I still am. It’s been 2 months nearly and I think I am doing okay (FYI - This is my first full time job, I only had part time jobs before). 

Last month I got contacted by a recruiter for a role in an amazing company. I accepted to have a meeting about the role and to see if I would be a match. I progressed to the last stage where I meet an interview panel. I think I might be able to get the offer but I don’t know how I feel about it.

I am worried about how my team would react. I am not necessarily close with anyone and my manager knows that I am interviewing. She has been super supportive and nice about it. I feel like it is too early to job hop… But at the same time offers like this don’t always come. Another concern I have is I will let the team down. Throughout my internship, I always talked about how much I wanted to stay and contribute. If I leave now I feel like I would just throw all that away to trash. Additionally, the director made a comment about job hoppers and I dont want to leave a negative impression.

I don’t know the benefits of the job and these details yet. Of course if it doesn’t pay more and doesn’t have certain benefits then I will let it go. But, if the offer is too good to not say yes I dont know what I will do.

I have been shown a lot from different subjects of physics and biology, like basic of quantum physics, laser and fiber optic physics, biomed engineering, software engineering, hardware and firmware engineering, sensing technologies, digital signal processing (I believe that it looks very similar at other universities), etc. My problem is that I found most of these topics interesting, especially how to approach them with designing device and writing algorithm to measure and control certain aspect in specific field. Very often I spend my free time learning more about one of these topics, reading science academic books, learning how to apply equations and models in simulations etc. I do that mostly out of sheer curiosity.  


This leads to my curiosity in many different topics, making me wanting to work on different projects every 3 months ranging from robotics to astrophysics signals processing. I am usually more happy with building solution for the problem than maintaining some IT infrastructure or adding new features to already working device.   


I was thinking about PhD few times, but I am always reject by idea of spending 3-4 years in one topic, rather to have freedom of switching projects, but as we grow human ties with coworkers changing job each 3 months is simply stupid. I usually like people I work with, and they tend to like me.    


I know some software engineers staying only in web development for fintech, as I believe they are world class experts due to time spend and good knowledge of technologies, I would feel burnout as engineer if I would stay too long in one field. I love when I can apply my skills in math and physics via algorithms and electronics and see how we can get data or control over the system, but then we are doing that again and again, and I am at the stage of wondering i.e. ""how to make robots walk"" and would like to explore and learn new things there.  


Of course, I know what I am paid for and I am not trying to pretentiously bring quantum physics to cinema management software. That would be super ridiculous, and most of people likes me due to my problem solving clear approach and keeping things simple. However, I was wondering what job would you recommend or what career progression for engineer who just love to learn beyond his craft and cannot stay in one field?

He is in a terrible position based on his performance and is getting exposed by not filling through on actions, delivering poor results and failing to align the team on priorities.

I am nervous to see him fail and get replaced. I am also nervous that he may try to sacrifice his team. Ultimately, I think he needs to be transferred or made redundant. I want to maintain good relationships and not get caught in any kind of negative situation. My perception is that in and out of my department, I am highly regarded.

17fld9p,"I was let go due to ""restructuring"" after FMLA?","Hi everyone, I'm in a bit of an uncomfortable situation. I took a 12wk FMLA approved medical leave of absence and was to return to work on Monday, with medical clearance. I reached out to my boss and HR in advance to inform them that I intend to return and will need my password to be reset ( it expired during my leave). I had a 1 week delay with getting my medical clearance, which I also informed them about in advance and they were okay with it. 

&#x200B;

HR set up a touch base call with me and my boss on Monday ( It gave me a weird vibe because why would HR set that up and not my boss directly? I was assuming it's just a touchpoint to catch up on my transition back to work etc.) I join the call & my manager begins to explain to me that they went through some organizational "" restructuring"" and my role is being eliminated & they'll be offering severance. How convenient, just as I'm returning to work after a federally protected leave...cool.I'm obviously blindsided as I fully intended to return to work and kept in communication in regards to my return.

&#x200B;

For background I don't have a good relationship with my boss or the company in general. It was. very anxiety inducing- hostile work environment, plus my boss was very negligent about supporting me and our team. I had to go on medical leave within a weeks notice, and that was truly the best that I could do as my health was deteriorating and I needed medical attention asap. I have no negative performance reviews or bad guidance.

Do I have a legal ground to leverage here? Or at least negotiate my severance? I wholeheartedly believe that this was retaliation and they were not being discreet at all. My mentor and parents keep encouraging me to engage an employment lawyer because of the backhanded layoff ( trying to skirt around FMLA guidelines), but not sure if that's an option here. I haven't signed the severance yet. 

&#x200B;

TLDR - Employer fired me after my FMLA leave of absence & tried to be sneaky about it. Should I/ can I pursue it legally or negotiate my severance?

17fl8yv,How to bring up the topic of diversity and hiring more POC to my boss?,"Hi all!

I work for a real estate company. My job entails a lot but it's mostly helping agents and managerial tasks. This means I have to be in the office a lot. I don't mind it but at the moment I am the only POC that's regularly there and I often feel left out. Out of all of the agents there are only 3 POC including one that just started with us (it was 4 but one just left).  

We've been hiring new agents and two agents that were just interviewed were white. Don't get me wrong I'm not opposed to that, it's just that it's starting to get to the point where I dread going to the office because of how cliquey it is. I'm always the one who makes the effort to talk to them but it's hard to keep a conversation going or find something in common to talk about (I'm also curious if other POC can relate? I am very close with the 2 other POC but find difficulty with non poc?)  

I do think he would be receptive to what I have to say I just don't know how to phrase it without sounding like I am making them out like they only hire one race. I can already imagine that his response would be something along the lines of  ""we hire on merit not skin color, etc etc""

17fl3rj,"Fulfilling job vs ""Successful"" job","I know this may seem obvious but hear me out.

Job A)
Creative job that lets me be ""out and about"" the city. Sometimes long hours depending on the day. Union job. I generally enjoy the job but always felt like I wasn't living up to my potential. No possibility of promotion. Started doing this when I was 22 and immediately started looking for an out. Some of my best memories from my 20s are from this job. Some days are really long and hard. 

Job B)
Corporate manager job. Lots of potential for upward mobility but in general soul sucking, staring at a computer. Currently in office 5 days/week but option for remote/hybrid. Generally don't enjoy the work but days are easy. Should probably note that I used to be extremely ambitious but I am not anymore.

I left out pay because to me it's not really relevant but they are both $120k. Job A, that will never change. Job B, lots of room for growth. 

I'm currently in job B. Missing job A. My wife says if I went back to job A, I will feel like I took a step back and remember why I wanted out. I think I fucked up by switching careers.

17fkaxr,Best way for me to get back where I was,"I (25M) was a property manager in Florida, now reside in California. In Florida, I was making $110,000/year as a relatively unique type of property manager. I was on call, worked weekends, and dealt with many industries in the property (office space, restaurants, marine). I worked there for just over 2 years.  I moved to CA for unrelated reasons and decided to take about 6 months off of work (I’m very frugal so no worries there), however, I realized I liked having a set schedule and didn’t have the motivation to make one for myself. 

I got a job as only an Assistant Property Manager, namely because the company that hired me has an experience cap. 2-5 years experience for APM, 5+ years for Property Manager. This position had a range of around $60,000-$75,000/year. I was fine with that, didn’t need the money that much. I was hired and given a starting salary of $68,000, which honestly kind of stung because I at least thought I qualified for the higher end due to my last job’s duties and responsibilities, but I suppose the 2 years experience was a factor in that decision.

I’m coming up on 6 months with the company and am about to have my annual review. My 90 day review went fantastic, got very high praise from my PM and very little to actually improve on (I tend to do whats necessary at all times so my “improvement” was to find out what other small and overlooked items are in my job description). We’re graded on scale of 1-5 in about 15 categories. The company makes a big deal about how 4’s are hard to get, as they are high above standard. 3 standard. 5 is exemplary. I got all 4’s and about 3-5 5’s from what I remember. Obviously it felt great, I always try to have a good attitude and listen to anyone who has an issue and try to understand instead of trying to make them understand me. It’s been working out. When I was hired, I was told that much of the promotions come at this annual review, if not all. I was also told that exemplary employees can and will get promoted as soon as they are ready, even if the years don’t match the job description.  

With this annual review, I am going to make it abundantly clear that it is my intention to be a PM come 2024, and with that, at least my previous salary (my old job was actually much easier business wise. It was more physically demanding though). PM’s with this company make around what I did before and I’d like to get back on track with the saving and investing schedule I had before and now have needs to travel to see my family. 

My actual question is, what is the best way for me to express this, especially with how short of a time I’ve been with the company? My current supervisor and I have lightly talked about it and she joking says “No, please don’t leave us. I can’t lose you to another building!” Which is funny of course, and flattering, mostly because my supervisor was alone at the property (supposed to have 3 staff) for a while and was drowning. But I want to get very serious now and make it apparent that this is my full intention and anything but that would honestly be disappointing.",preadburell,1,1.0,0,1698173770,2023-10-24 18:56:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17fkaxr/best_way_for_me_to_get_back_where_i_was/,10,2023
17fjw7k,“I don’t know what I want to be when I grow up”,"Hello! I apologize for the long post, but I’ve been trying to figure this out on my own for years and it just isn’t working anymore. I need some help. 

Some background; 
I (24m) graduated with a Bachelor’s in Business Admin in Spring of 2021. The reason I even picked that degree was that ever since high school, I couldn’t answer the question, “what do you want to be when you grow up”. 

I could never figure out what I wanted for my career path and after finishing most of my Associates during high school, I didn’t feel like I had much time to try out different electives during my first year or so of college and needed to pick a major. I went with business, with the excuse that it was the most “flexible” degree and would apply to the most jobs once I graduated. 

After I graduated, the plan was to move back home and work at my dad’s small business for a few months while I searched for a new job. He did a few different things at his business, it was both an auto repair shop and a rental place. The main source of income was industrial and recreational equipment rentals (RV’s, trailers, ATV’s, and small boats). While those were on rent, he would spend his time working on cars. 

That plan didn’t happen exactly as expected. I stayed and helped with the mindset that I’d find something else eventually. I’ve spent the past two years half-heartedly looking through job listings hoping something would pop out at me but nothing ever did. 

Luckily, life has given me a second chance. As he’s gotten older, my dad decided to close his shop and was hired on as a professor at a local university. This is great for me for two reasons; one, it forces me to move on and start seriously looking elsewhere for real career and two, the university offers free tuition to children of its professors. 

I’m very fortunate to have this opportunity to try college again. I want to go back and get a second Bachelor’s but I want to do it differently. I want to have a plan going in this time, graduating with a degree I feel better about and with a job lined up. 

However, I’m still stuck on “I don’t know what I want to do.” My question is, what do I do? How can I find a degree and ultimately a career that I want to pursue? Do you know of any resources I can use to help guide me in the right direction? What would you do if you could start again?

If you got this far, thank you I really do appreciate it. Thank you for any advice you can offer, I’m just ready to get my life moving and I’d love some outside perspective. 

tldr: I’m have the opportunity to go back to school and get a 2nd degree, but I don’t know what I want to pursue. How do I find what career I should pick? What resources are there for me to find the answer? Any other advice? Thank you :)",t-ham4,1,1.0,0,1698172705,2023-10-24 18:38:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17fjw7k/i_dont_know_what_i_want_to_be_when_i_grow_up/,10,2023
17fjfes,I’m feeling left out as a new employee and I don’t know what to do about it.,"Hello everyone, 

I’ve been working as a leasing agent for about a month now on my property and it feels like I’m having a hard time finding my place. To put things into context, out of nowhere I also found out that there are going to be many changes to our property’s staff right off the bat. I will be the only leasing agent and finding another one to help out is TBD because the other is moving to a different property because of a promotion and the assistant property manager is quitting. Another leasing agent here is taking over for the assistant property manager who’s leaving and the property manager has been on maternity leave and won’t be back until December. To be honest, finding all of this out starting this new job definitely threw me off and I’m not sure what to do with all of these changes happening so fast as a new person here. On top of it, it seems like everyone was very close and aren’t wanting to lose the relationships they’ve all formed since working together. I don’t have any problem with this, but when it comes down to it, it sucks to feel alone and like I don’t have an opportunity to make any sort of connections with these people. Maybe it’s all in my head, but I don’t know how to go about this. I do love what I do as a leasing agent so far and everyone is really nice it seems. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to work around/through this and all of these changes or had a similar experience?

17fj7a7,"Should I prioritize security or my ambitions as I hunt for my first ""big girl"" job?","After year out of college pittering around doing odd jobs, I'm now looking at getting into my first full-time position. I can’t decide if I should accept the first one I’ve been offered, or keep looking for something better suited to my wants.  
My undergrad major is in biology, but I have an offer for a marketing position thanks to out-of-school work and extracurricular experiences that align me with the role. I am interested in making this pivot and learning skills in marketing, and the starting salary just under 50k seems solid!  
However, there are lifestyle factors I’m considering. Accepting this job means another year living with my parents (just the most reasonable thing to do if I’m going to stay in my hometown) - which for me means another year in an environment that’s materially comfortable but emotionally not the most (lgbt things, I feel like I can’t progress my life, feeling like a perma child). I also worry that entering a corporate sphere will make me super depressed because I’m an anxious free-spirited person who hates routine. Overall, I’m just scared to make the commitment and have this gut sense that the job isn’t “me” even though it offers a valuable learning experience.   
In an ideal world I would hope for a decent-paying creative job that would help me move to the west coast or PNW and have flexibility, a diverse range of responsibilities, and time beyond to work on my own freelance and other projects.  
What do those more experienced than me recommend? Should I suck it up because this is the world we live in? Comfort and safety or keep searching for the golden ticket out of my hometown?

I don't have a good salary even till decent level neither moved up the ladder, as managers kept on ditching me and I was one with loyal servant attitude (like kattappa in Bahubali), lately I realized I am like a tissue paper here. I was shifted between domains/modules/projects throughout my career and at this juncture I am like **Jack of all, king of None**. I am not an underperformer, am good at whatever work assigned to me and very good in building and solving stuff.

I am a deadly combination an Introvert, very sensitive and very emotional. There were some instances that happened during my initial phase of career when I was giving interviews which hurt me deep, hence I stopped giving interviews since then, in fear of facing the same. And I realized I could have addressed my problem then and there and could have fixed rather than giving up, which I didn't realize that will haunt me forever from various angles. I didn't share my inner struggle with anyone hence no one from family or friends had any clue why I won't change the company and why I settled for so less than my caliber.  
  
But fast-forward now with 15 years exp, with above said reasons I am in a phase I have to switch at any cost, to grow personally, financially at least for sake of my kids. I know I may have a limited time or is there enough time for me to grow?

I am currently working in the compliance department of a fintech company. My position requires me to analyze financial transaction data and determine whether any illegal activity has occurred, on a case-by-case KPI. I have been working here for about 15 months now and already dominate the workflow, which is pretty much copy and paste with minor adjustments. I have a lot of freedom when it comes to this particular position and the pay is pretty good. The catch is that the only clear progression is to go from junior to mid to senior with the same repetitive workflow. This over-repetitive process causes me to numb my problem-solving skills as well as my creativity, which then causes me to feel unsatisfied, unrealized and unfulfilled to the point I feel depressed. Even though for some people good pay and freedom sound ideal, the fact that I feel my skills and potential being wasted on such roles, essentially overpowers that fact.  
More recently I have finished a postgraduate degree in data analytics for business and I am currently finishing SQL training to brush up on my data programming skills. I also have a bachelor's degree in International Business and another post graduate degree in anti-financial crime.  
I am currently looking for a new position that makes me engage in problem-solving, pushes me to be creative and where I can contribute to process/product development. I was thinking about joining strategy/operations management roles, consulting or even pursuing a master's in finance/project management.

17ffmox,Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"Hi all I wanted to ask some advice about if I should stay at my current job, or leave for another job closer to home. I’m trying to give as much info without giving away too much about my job, so if this is confusing please let me know. 

When I interviewed at the company I currently work at I interviewed for a position (I will call it Position A), but the company lost the contract for that position and had to cut it. They were able to find a position in another department that I will call Position B which is where I currently work. My current commute to this job is 45-60 minutes each way, and I’m spending 1.5-2 hours driving to and from every day. 

I recently interviewed for a job that is the same as position A that iscloser to home and my new commute would be 1/3 of what I have now. I make a little over $59k a year at my current position in Position B and was offered the same exact pay for the new Position A job. 

At my current company, Position A typically make more than what I make now, and even though I asked about positions opening up at my current company they could not promise anything. 

My question is if I should take the new job which could be seen as a pay cut since it’s a lateral move financially when Position A typically pays more but I would be working closer to home, or should I stay at my current job with a potential of moving into a similar role and move up financially but have a commute close to 2 hours per day.

I’ve heard so many times that one should not put in their two weeks before making sure they sign their offer and that the background check is cleared. 
I did sign the offer but the background check is taking longer than expected. 
I was supposed to put in my 2 weeks yesterday but I don’t feel comfortable doing so until the background check is cleared. I do have a lot of PTO and sick time. My current employer will only pay me the pTo. 
Would it be better to put in my two weeks next Monday, work a week then use sick time for the second week? Or should I tell my new job to push back my starting date because the background check took longer than expected?

17f6ul8,"I feel like a failure, like I’m stupid and pathetic and too old?","Hi all, so I’m 25, a guy, and this is my story. In spring 2020, I finally was able to get my associate’s degree or we’ll 3 AA degree’s lol in community college after almost 4 years and pass calculus with a B, thanks to COVID-19. Then when I got into Rutgers Business School - New Brunswick, they gave me a hard time taking all my credits and told me that I was going to have to repeat calculus because of some dumb policy. So I went to TCNJ - The College of New Jersey for a semester in spring 2021 and HATED IT, to be honest, and dropped out. Then I went into tech sales, specifically B2B SaaS sales from September 2021 to December 2022, and had some horrible toxic experiences and met some really shitty people. I then took time off from everything for my mental health from summer 2022 till August 2023, and earlier this year in March 2023, I realized that if I can network with people from Google and Meta and Netflix on LinkedIn, then I can also network and cold outreach to Rutgers Business School Professors. So that’s what I did, and after emailing like 60 professors, one professor told me how if Rutgers Business School - New Brunswick is giving me a hard time taking my credits, then try Rutgers Business School - Newark. Fun fact, Rutgers Business School is Newark AND New Brunswick, but they don’t tell you that. So I reached out to Newark, told them what happened in 2020, and asked if they would take my calculus and all other classes. The admissions and deans all said yes, and so I got transferred and am a 25-year-old junior currently in my first semester at Rutgers majoring in supply chain management. But I can’t help but feel that I’m too old for this shit since I’m 25. Also, I’m taking 5 classes a semester so I can finish in exactly 4 semesters. This semester, I’m taking intro to marketing, management, finance, supply chain, and stuff, and it’s honestly hard to keep up. I’m worried that I might fail or get straight C’s, and if I have a crappy GPA, then how am I going to get good internships and a good job and stuff? So you guys know what I mean. I could’ve graduated already if New Brunswick would’ve told me about Newark 3 years ago. It’s hard being back in school after all these years, and honestly, I feel stupid and a failure.

I wanted to know if it is unprofessional to email my resignation say one afternoon and ask to discuss in person the following day (the one day of the week they are both physically in the office).  
  
Part of why I am considering this is that there is really only 1 day of the week they are in the office (not working from home) so it is hard to have discussions like this in person within timeframes. However, I admit I am also quite scared of their reaction. They have not treated past staff the best when they served their notice period and I also think it will come as a massive shock to them. I don't know if it is better if they process the initial shock, even talk to each other first, and then we discuss in person the next day when everyone is calm/on the same page.

It feels heartwarming to give advice for them regarding their future and capability to achieve it. I’m also intrigued on organization & planning for trainings (students/adults). I heard that those career can be done by pursuing Education. Since I have done my Bachelor, I would not waste my money on another Bachelor again (besides its to darn expensive for a 3-4 years of lecture 🥲)

17f5f3k,Remain in supply chain business career or change to technical side?,"
Hi all,
Let me start by sketching my background. I am a 27 year old living in Belgium with a masters in industrial engineering and operations research. 

I started my professional career as a consultant in a supply chain software company (APS kind of software). As a consultant, I was mainly creating SQL queries as the supply chain tool was mainly SQL in the background. In addition to that, I was also creating dashboards and data visualisations, again based on SQL queries. 

After working for 2 years in a more technical role, I changed jobs towards a more business minded role at another company, also in the field of supply chain software. This job is now my current job and within this role I am more focusing on the process side of supply chain. Because of this, I am learning a lot of new things on the topic of supply chain and best practices within the industry. I am gaining lots of knowledge on how the big companies are managing their supply chain processes.

While I am not unhappy in my current role, I do have some doubts on my current position, partly due to financial reasons (salary is not great). In addition to that, I recently also came across some vacancies for BI analyst and was really intrigued by the job description and content. I did some further research and the job really sounds interesting and on top of that financial aspects also look a lot more promising. I feel that I possess the right skills and would be able to do the job (having SQL, data visualisation and process knowledge).

So what I am wondering now is which path I should take? Should I stay in my current job and grow further in the process side of supply chain, broadening my expertise on supply chain, or should I somewhat revert back to the technical side and apply for some BI analyst vacancies? 
Maybe important to note, I would like to grow my career and eventually land a higher management position. What I fear when going back to the technical side is that I will be limited in this, but not sure whether that is a valid assumption.

All advice and guidance is welcome.

17f3uri,"22M, Technical, No Uni/College and no idea how to get back on track.","TL;DR stuck at low end jobs, GPA too low to go to school, Technical interests/hobbies, can't get started on a career path that actually interests me.

  
I'm a bit socially anxious so my apologies if this isn't written all that well as it's difficult for me to reasonably describe how I'm feeling in regards to all of this.

  
I'm a 22M and for the past few years I've been struggling to find the mental drive to hold down a job for more than a few months. For a bit of background I'm a very technical person that can have a **huge** drive if something interests me (I've started several small gigs making and selling custom guitar pedals, my own circuit designs, I've built equipment for a studio, and restored probably a hundred electronic things, woodworking, music, history buff and was self taught in all of it).

I was pushed into an electrical apprenticeship at 18, by my parents, who had my best interests at heart but I probably wasn't mature enough at the time and I absolutely hated the hours. - Another obstacle, I absolutely loathe long/fixed work hours. I've had some success at short term contract work but anything over 35 hours per week is mental torture.

I still consider going back into the trade but I'm afraid the same situation will repeat itself.

  
I never went to university or college as I do not have the grades to get in. School never interested me and if anything, I just barely scraped by. I've got a GPA of around 2.2. For the past 4 years I've been working low end labour and hospitality jobs which have been an absolute miserable experience for me, and things would usually go south pretty quickly at these jobs where the usual cycle of losing all interest, stop showing up consistently, have fights with my boss etc. would just continually restart after about a month or so after getting the job. There were better ones, there were worse ones. It wasn't always doom and gloom and I've met coworkers and managers that I respect and look up to. Tried all the usual ""keep your head down, show up on time, do the minimum required..."" Been there, done that. I can tell you with absolute certainty that it does not work in the long term. For some people it might, but not for me. When I've got absolutely zero motivation to even go in the next day, the otherwise simple task of being on time becomes a gruelling mental challenge. I've never been let go from a job (I've gotten pretty close on a number of occasions) however I usually just end up quitting and getting another one when things get bad.

  
It's not an unwillingness to work. but rather a case of not having options for things I can actually excel at, and not really knowing how I can get those options.

  
Maybe I'm in the wrong and should just 'man up', quit complaining and accept whatever I get. However I'd like some advice as to what career I should look into and what to do about my situation to get there.",dissonantdarkness,2,1.0,4,1698119720,2023-10-24 03:55:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17f3uri/22m_technical_no_unicollege_and_no_idea_how_to/,10,2023

17f2qgq,Low Balled Offer (Construction),So I went through several interviews with a recruiter explained my salary expectations then got the interview with the company where I also explained my salary expectations with no comments.  Then today I got the offer and it was 13% short.  No explanation nothing.  Aside from that there were a few other things that were a little off from original discussions. I'm blown away and not sure why they would do that.  I'm definitely telling them no tomorrow I can't trust them at all.   I have 20 plus years experience in my field so I'm not a new hire.

17f0zxp,Roast my life plan,"Roast me or give me advice

Introduction: 
I am an 18-year-old aspiring young man from the state of Pennsylvania. My life's goal is to achieve significant success and financial stability. The finance industry has always fascinated me, and my dream is to venture into the world of private equity, with an ultimate aim of starting my own firm.

Educational Journey:
Despite my high school years being marred by a less-than-ideal GPA of 1.6, I attribute this to a combination of factors, including the challenges of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and the low academic standards at my school. Regretfully, I didn't apply to any colleges, given the slim chances of acceptance. However, I firmly believe that my GPA does not reflect my true intellectual potential. I recognize that I cannot change the past, but I am determined to shape my future.

Current Business Venture:
Presently, I operate a business from home, primarily in the automotive niche. It generates a gross income of approximately $6,000 per month, with around $1,000 in expenses. While the business is promising and can be further expanded through promotions, I am wary of dedicating too much time to it, as it might impede my long-term aspirations.

My Strategic Plan:

1. Join the Military (4-year enlistment) from 2024 to 2028:
   - This decision is driven by the prospect of acquiring valuable skills during my service, such as cybersecurity or computer programming.

   - I'm exploring finance careers within the military, though I've found it may not offer the knowledge I seek.
   
   - A pivotal reason for this choice is the opportunity to leverage Service2Schools and the G.I. Bill, affording me a chance to attend a top-ranking university free of cost. I acknowledge that this is a significant incentive.

   - There are numerous other benefits associated with military service that I won't detail here.

2. Continuous Learning during Enlistment:

   - During my military service, I plan to dedicate myself to learning to enhance my intelligence and readiness for college.

3. Start College (4 years) from 2028 to 2032:
 
  - My ambitious goal is to secure admission into prestigious institutions like UPenn or Columbia, where I intend to major in Finance or Economics.

   - I will strive for academic excellence, maintain a high GPA, and actively pursue internships.
 
  - The advantage of having my housing and living expenses covered by the G.I. Bill will allow me to focus solely on academics and career development.

4. Post-Graduation:
   - After graduating, my journey will not conclude. I will continue to climb the corporate ladder, accumulating knowledge and experience to work towards my dream of owning an investment firm.",buhgati,0,0.5,22,1698111052,2023-10-24 01:30:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17f0zxp/roast_my_life_plan/,10,2023
17f0qxh,Not sure what to make out of the encounters with this company,"Hi, everyone.

There is this company that I am quite indifferent about and yet its title pops up in my life periodically.

It all started when I was actively looking for a new job that would be relevant to my degree (love the subject). I contacted manager in the relevant department and asked them for an informational interview. 

The interview with them was long (record long!; lasted a few hours) and I got a pretty good insight about the tasks, daily routines, etc. It all seemed fine, but somehow I couldn't shake off the thought in my mind that the manager sounded depressed or apathetic. It was in their voice tone. Following their request I've shared my resume and didn't get an offer. I found my latest job quite shortly after this.

When almost two years have passed since our first communication, I was planning my exist from the latest job and started reaching out to managers again. As the first step, I listed companies, where it would be interesting to work. Added this one to the list because the previous lengthy interview was very informative. Thought it would be nice to have an update.

The same manager answered the call. They still sounded quite apathetic and yet answered all of my questions. We even discussed a possible salary range. The offered salary range was quite low and yet not a major deal breaker. We parted ways with an agreement to connect when they will be ready to give me a concrete offer.

Then there was silence. I wasn't too enthuasistic about pitching myself to that company either. However, after about one month I still decided to reach out to the manager in this company again. They informed me that they no longer worked in the company, adviced to contact a manager one level up instead and offered to reach out to HR regarding open vacancies as well.

I found contact information of the manager one level up. Upon our first contact, they seemed busy and suggested to reschedule the phone call. I agreed with the offer and went for a walk in town. I missed their call past 6PM in the evening and called back a bit later. They dropped my call,  then called back while I was taking a bus and it was too loud to hear the phone. Finally, I called them back and we had a conversation. We agreed to schedule an interview, which would require me to travel to another town. I agreed and the manager said they would come back to me with more details and a link next morning. 

They didn't contact me with interview details and, again, I didn't feel like bothering them. Instead, just wanted to move on from this company altogether.

Four months have passed and I get a call in the evening from the same (one level up) manager. Their voice is shaky and there moments of awkward silence, but I got informed that their department will offer their clients new services and they discused my profile with a new team manager and they would like to invite me to an interview. Again, no details about the time for the interview were given. Potentially, we could meet in a few weeks in the local office in my town.

I don't know what magic is this and why this company pops up in my life again, but there is some strange gut feeling about them. I get nervous when communicating with this manager.  Those awkward silent pauses sound a bit strange, like he's withholding anger.

The company stats are ok and yet not among the best in the market. They still are one of the competence leaders. The employee turnover is ok. The new role is in line with my current interests.

What would you advice doing? Are there any red flags? Could the new manager be wishy washy or a psycho?

Thanks for getting this far. I just have a rush of thoughts and would appreciate more opinions.",Silber4,0,0.5,5,1698110321,2023-10-24 01:18:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17f0qxh/not_sure_what_to_make_out_of_the_encounters_with/,10,2023
17f0ors,Career Change?,"In a bit of a pickle. Was just offered a new job with another company making 23% more annually than I currently am. The issue is the new role would technically be a demotion in title, older (in terms of tech) company and a warehouse leadership role. The team I would lead is very blue collar, and not sure how well I’d fit in with them.  

Currently I love the role and my current employer, but feel like I am drastically underpaid. We just built a state of the art facility, and there is enormous room for growth. I’ve already been “promoted” a few times but really it was just a title change and more responsibilities.

She says we’re expanding so we’re hiring 2 more people. I’m naturally an anxiety suffering paranoid person so I feel like my time is coming. I’m in Florida so it’s a no-cause state and they don’t have to pay out your PTO either. I currently have 240+ hours of unused PTO accrued.

17ezqof,Is this unprofessional?,"
I started a job in June. When I interviewed I was told the pay was $45 an hour once I was finished with training. I stupidly did not get this in writing-lesson learned. Anywho, my job requires managing a caseload either in person or virtually depending on the needs of a family. When pay was discussed again my supervisor said it was $30 an hour for virtual and $45 for in person. No benefits. Pay is based on the time you meet with a family so for virtual, which most of my cases are, the most I can make from meeting with one family is $30 an hours which will average to around $1,000 a month. After childcare and insurance bring home around $400 a month.  I am applying for a job within the same organization but different company. Pay is more. I had a meeting today with my boss. At this meeting I had planned to discuss my resignation with her. She did not answer to a meeting time nor did she answer my phone call when I called to discuss over phone. We live in different counties so there’s no in person contact. Is it unprofessional to send an email to resign? I’ve been told by several people this will make her angry but I want to let her know asap so I am move forward with the other job and so she can find my replacement. I also worry emailing her may ruin my chances with the new job since it’s in the same organization. She is known to stab people in the back.

17ezp4s,"Talking to my boss about getting a full/time, better paying position after graduation, how to broach the subject?","I (22F) am a college senior set to graduate this December with my bachelor’s. I am currently working part time at my company and have been at this role for only about a month and a half. When I interviewed for this position, I was very open about my upcoming graduation and desire to work with the company afterwards as well, my now boss said “don’t worry we won’t kick you out!” at the time. I meet weekly with my boss and am looking for the right words to say when it comes to broaching the topic about being hired full time after graduation, as well as moving to a different position (the one I am in currently is crafted for student workers) and how my graduation/having a degree in a relevant field would affect new positions I may be able to move up in/pay increases (as my current wage is not much and intended for a student, I will began supporting myself fully in December so it’s not feasible for me to continue with this pay) I feel comfortable talking with and openly communicating with my boss, however I just fear coming off too brash. I have not had a job before like this and don’t have experience when it comes to negotiating/ wanting to get answers about the future. My bosses have not really said anything yet about my graduation, however I don’t see why they would hire/train/give me responsibilities and projects if I wasn’t intended to move too a full time position. Please give me any advice you have and maybe even examples of things to say when I broach the topic. I really enjoy the company I’m working for and am hoping for upward movement past student worker, I don’t want to graduate and not have a secure full time job, but I don’t want to come off as brash since I’m still fairly new.

17exnox,Should I take the Engineering Manager role?,"I don’t want to put the cart before the horse but I am Interviewing for an engineering manager vacancy that opened within my company and think I am doing well. 

Background: I am a young engineer. This is the first company I’ve worked for out of college. I have done exceptionally well in my role (not bragging, I have been told this by my manager and others outside the department). I currently enjoy my role and have a lot of flexibility in my schedule (WFH opportunity if I really need to focus, 4-day weeks as long as I put in my 40 hours still and am getting my work done, etc.). 

A position managing one of the other engineering groups within the facility has opened due to the manager retiring. Before applying, I talked to my manager and he thinks that I am fully capable of doing the job and encouraged me to apply if I was genuinely interested. I applied for this position and have done 2/4 interviews thus far. I feel that I have done really well. However, in the back of my mind I am feeling some inklings of hesitation. This is mostly rooted in the fact that I am going to be taking on a team that needs some work and needs a strong leader. They are also all older than myself and have more work experience. I have various leadership experience from project teams in college, leading a team at my internship for 2 years, captain of sports teams, etc. The overarching fear in my mind is that I will give up some of the comforts I have in my current role, and definitely make myself uncomfortable in having to adapt to the new role. BUT discomfort is the source of growth. 

If offered the job, should I take the leap and advance my career, make significant personal growth, and potentially positively impact the group?",whitacrez,1,1.0,1,1698101593,2023-10-23 22:53:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17exnox/should_i_take_the_engineering_manager_role/,10,2023

Been working as a bartender since 20years of age, I started out in my local pub in the UK, got promoted to management, did an apprenticeship, and then dicided to further my career further and move to another country.
I got a job working as a bartender in one of the most luxurious places in Dubai, and the world for that matter.

17etukt,Stay in current role (team leader) or new role (senior consultant)?,"Hi guys, really really need some advice and mentorship with this decision, please.

I have gotten a job offer from a company to join them as a senior consultant, which I'm considering - here's my current situation:

Current company:

1. Toxic CEO and upper level management
2. No longer wish to generate income for the CEO as they have explicitly said that they care about noone but themselves.
3. Phenomenal existing pipeline (2 years of building)
4. No growth in the market, selling the exact same product to a saturated market (100 competitors, easily)
5. No further career prospects
6. Small company (30 employees), with a VERY high turnover
7. Continuous stream of monthly commission (1 or 2 months a year I am not commissionable)
8. Incredibly mentally draining (CEO guilt trips, blames employees, hides commissions, etc) - a real nasty piece of work

New company:

1. Same salary as company above
2. Sales cycle is longer, and the product being sold is ALOT more complicated & more expensive
3. Commissions will be lower/non-existent for the first couple of months due to building pipeline
4. Significantly larger company (150+ employees)
5.  Same industry I am selling in, but a completely new product
6. Career prospects are significantly higher with room to grow, and company prospects to expand significantly
7. Company has some negative reviews on culture and toxicity

I am honestly struck between the two options, but my heart is no longer with the current company due to the constant mental abuse.

I'd really appreciate any advise that any of you could give me.

Please, ask me questions, raise your concerns, I'd be happy to engage further

I know it takes hard work but I'm just trying to make sure I have a good fit. I'm starting to think I'm not cut out to be an EE and I'm wondering what other paths I could take.

I definitely want to do something with electronics or electricity. I find it all fascinating and super interesting. I had a job for a while soldering parts on circuit boards and that job was a dream. I would love to be in assembly/manufacturing but I have a family I need to provide for and being on the ground floor wasn't making enough money.

I'm definitely a hard worker physically/actively. I've worked at a lot of food places and am good at staying busy and getting things done to keep the ball rolling and I'm always one of the highest performers. I'm not social and focus on my work. 

Are there any suggestions for jobs between Electrical Engineer and base level worker? I've thought about looking into CNC training or welding. I know welding takes a lot of work and schooling as well. I've thought about electrician but I'm worried about the longevity and me getting too weak/old.

17eqwf7,What are alternative careers for a teacher (in mid-30s) who’s into tech and wants a an opportunity of a better salary?,"
I’ve taught music in public schools for more than a decade but my salary isn’t worth the stress (and PTSD, as my therapist says) so I’m seeking advice to venture out of public school education. Most websites list things like “HR director” or “education tech” as alternatives but I’m open to more broad tech applications since I enjoy fiddling with computers and helping others fix their tech issues (IT support perhaps?) and would be comfortable “selling my soul” (or whatever that means.) 

My main priorities are high salary (understandably this would come with more time in a position) and job security. I’m fine with in-person or remote, and would love to at least have weekends and/or reasonable PTO.

17eocah,Should I take a lower paying job that doesn’t align with my career goals just because I got laid off?,"I recently got laid off from my position as a CRO designer 2 weeks ago. I am in a very tricky situation as I am 3 months pregnant, so the timing of things is quite complicated. In my state, unemployment only lasts 6 months, which 6 months from now will be when my child is born. 

I had worked my position as a fully remote CRO designer for a little over a year and a half with a salary of $72,000. My goal was to continue this position until the 3 year mark and then transition internally to a UX/ UI designer role, as my previous role is a great funnel into that department and a position I am very interested in. Additionally, UX/ UI positions pay very well with a salary range of $85,000- $160,000 once you are more established in your career. 

Obviously this is not going according to plan as I got laid off. I have sent out over 60 applications in the past month so far, however have had no luck getting interviews for UX/UI positions. Or even getting my applications opened for the matter. (It seems as though the UX/UI industry is experiencing a lot of layoffs and many entry-level jobs are being taken by mid-level applications). 

I finally heard back for my first interview today, which is really exciting! However, the position is for a fully in person Marketing Coordinator role and I found out that the salary range is $42,000- $53,000. This would be a huge pay cut for me, and being fully in person would guarantee needing full-time daycare, which would be very expensive in my state, likely leaving me less than $1,000 with each paycheck. 

I am struggling because not taking a job when I am unemployed seems quite idiotic. But at the same time it is hard to be excited about a position that is taking me away from my ideal career goals and establishing my career path in a different direction for significantly less money. 

However, I also feel as though I don’t have the room to be picky considering I have a limited amount of time to find a job before I’m noticeably pregnant at interviews. And it feels very wrong to accept a job 2 months before the baby is born in April just to immediately be gone 3 months for maternity leave. So I am worried by not going through with this position I may be turning down my only realistic opportunity for employment, even though I’m my heart I wish I could hold out for a role that is better for me.

17env6y,Just had an exploratory meeting re: a promotion. When should I let my directs know?,"

Ive been working this past year as an assistant in a university resource development office. This is my first position following graduation and recently my manager (not my supervisors who I support as an assistant) noted in my check-in that leadership has taken note of my work ethic and success in my role. she said that there has been talk of promotion and asked me to start thinking of where my next step would be. It was definitely very exploratory and nothing concrete was said, but of course it his has me very excited about my upcoming prospects professionally. Also the positions I’m interested in and mentioned in the meeting have a decent pay raise and would make my living situation a lot more comfortable. 

My question is, when should I talk to my supervisors that I work for directly about this possibility? I meet with the manager who told me this again next week, so I’m hoping to give her a list of positions and roles I’m interested in then, but should I let my supervisors know before? They did my interview and ultimately hired me, so I don’t want to be seen as going behind their backs in any way.

17enkbs,Can I switch industries as a ChemE SME with 12 YOE?,"I'm a 34 year-old Chemical Engineer with a BS in ChemEng working at BASF as a SME Process Technology Manager. My role is highly technical and I enjoy it a lot. I have acquired a lot of expertise in the complex processes for petrochemicals manufacturing. However, I'm somewhat motivated to move out of the industry because I'd like to try living in a new location and most of the chemical industry is confined to the Houston area. Among locations, it seems that Houston proper is as good as it gets for ChemEs in petrochemicals.

  
I'm not sure what I can transition to at this point.  
\-  I'm not interested in moving to management/project management/operations etc. I enjoy being technical.  
\- Consulting at something would have lower job security and business contribution than working internally at a BASF/Dow/etc  
\- PhD seems  fun but I'm already 34 at this point and it would be a huge opportunity cost. I don't want to give up pay. Currently, I just have a BS in ChemEng.  
\- Other industries for ChemEs are not that technical or exciting (P&G, Pharma, etc). They don't involve the complex heat transfer/reactions that are involved in petrochemicals and agriculture product mfg.

17ena01,Have you ever walked away from your dream?,"Hi all. I’ll try and keep this short. Basically I’ve been doing my current self employed job for about six years now, and for the last year the industry has been hit hard by the cost of living crisis, and there’s still no end in sight. (UK) The service we provide is a luxury, not a necessity, but in “normal” times it’s a career you can make decent money from. 

I didn’t really start making money until about 3 years in, and even then it wasn’t mega bucks. I managed to put money aside in savings though but they’ve all but gone now due to the slow down and I’m living on what little money I’m making now. Currently I’m working the equivalent of part time, even less these past few months. 

I’ve been applying for part time jobs on the side for a steady income but I’m thinking a bit beyond for the time being. I’m thinking it’s going to take a year at least until our industry gets somewhat back to normal. By that time I’ll be mid thirties, and I’m really just wanting a stable job where I can progress. The job I have now can take it’s toll on your body so I figure by time I hit mid forties I’ll need an out anyways. 

I’m really struggling on what to do for the best. Get a part time job to just get me by until the industry picks up again, whenever that will be, or just get something full time now that I’ll enjoy and can actually progress in and make decent money. I honestly love my job now, and I’ve worked so hard to make it work, I’ve honestly given it my heart and soul. But it’s so unstable financially and I don’t know how much longer I can carry on just getting by.

I’d somehow feel like I’ve failed if I walked away from it, because I’m good at it, I have a skill that not a lot of people have, and when it’s good, it makes me happy. But it’s not been like that for a while now and I’m always worrying about money. I think the only thing I’ll struggle with is not being my own boss. I love being self employed because you can do what you want on your schedule.

17emjb5,Is there such thing as a surgical nurse practitioner,"I am a Senior in Highschool I have dreams of working as a heart surgeon but I can’t afford that and from what I hear a bachelors in premed doesn’t offer many jobs or decent jobs that can help you survive and pay for med school. I have changed my career dream to working as a CRNA I have actually become a lot more interested in the nursing field rather than the MD field because of how nurses deal more with the care of the patient themselves. I feel like MD’s are simply just experts in their field that diagnose and plan treatments for patients rather than interacting and forming relationships with them while nurses execute the treatments but build bonds with patients.

I know as a CRNA I will be almost on the same level of expertise as an MD anesthesiologist and might not be able to form bonds with all of my patients but it’s still something that interests me. Along with that to become a CRNA rather than getting a bachelors in biology or some sort of other premed degree that I can’t really get a job with I need a bachelors in nursing where I can get a decent job with. Along with that to become a CRNA you need two years of ICU nursing experience in those two years I can save up so I can pay for CRNA school. I know it might sound like I’m taking the easy way out but I truly can’t afford medical school I know I could just go in 300k worth of debt like a lot of medical school students but I’m pretty sure you still have to make some sort of payment to stay in medical school which I probably can’t afford because a bachelors in premed doesn’t really offer any jobs that can pay for medical school and even though my parents do support me on and my siblings through college they can’t afford for us to do any graduate level education unless we can put something in and with a bachelors in premed I can’t put anything in. I’m not trying to insult premed majors or anything but I rarely see any decent jobs that requires a bachelors in biology,chemistry,or something related there just aren’t a lot of jobs out there for those majors.

Anyways even though being a CRNA does sound cool to me I still do have a passion for heart surgery for some reason but from my understanding nurse practitioners aren’t allowed to perform any sort of complex surgeries (or any surgeries for that matter unless they are supervised by an MD). As a CRNA I’ll get to see people having a heart surgery and I’ll monitor them essentially without the supervision of an MD but I can’t actually perform a heart surgery unless I get an MD. A lot of people find it weird that me as a girl would be so interested in heart surgery but after taking both anatomy and Pathophysiology the heart is officially my favorite organ just so complex and beautiful.

If there is such thing as a surgical nurse practitioner (specifically cardio surgery) can someone tell me how I can become one. I know I will enjoy being a CRNA but being some sort of Cardio Surgeon I would enjoy even more.",Big_Education932,1,1.0,2,1698073501,2023-10-23 15:05:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17emjb5/is_there_such_thing_as_a_surgical_nurse/,10,2023
17emeo0,I (26M) strongly believe that my pharmacy manager (50M) is setting me up for failure.,"I’ve been working as a pharmacy technician in training at Walmart since August 16. I was taught how to do most things, except how to properly understand people’s medical insurances, how to do the math when doing inputs for most medications, etc. The list goes on and on. I’ve yet to memorize any medications that people take and almost usually ask me questions about. I can’t seem to memorize any of the medications because I’m too focused trying to not look like a fool while I’m ringing up people for their medications. Anyway, the other day I apparently forgot to ring someone up for their medication that was thankfully only about $23. I don’t recall doing this, but because we’re logged on with our user ID’s that Walmart gave us when we were first hired, maybe that’s how I was essentially criticized. 

My pharmacy manager speaks Vietnamese, along with the other majority pharmacists who speak it too and a pharmacy tech. The day of the incident, they were speaking in Vietnamese and mentioned my name. I said to them, “What mistake did I do now?” The pharmacy manager then responded, “You make many mistakes.” It was a mix of seriousness and humor, but mainly seriousness. Instead of telling me to be more careful when ringing up people for their medications, he tells me this? He did say after though my mistake was fine because he’d get money that the pharmacy has to pay for what was essentially lost. I had apologized for him to say that my mistake was fine. 

I’m contemplating each day on quitting, but I desperately need this money. I’ve been searching for jobs as of recent. I hadn’t been successful in getting a job beforehand since graduating from college in May 2021. They’re setting me up for failure by not teaching me how to do the things I had mentioned in the beginning of this post. I know I applied for this role, but I’m not sure if they’ll ever teach me these specific things in order to be successful. 

Because many people are getting different types of vaccines during this time of the year, people’s insurances are usually a mess. A pharmacist from a different Walmart criticized me recently at work, but calmly the entire day because I was too slow to figure out the problems people had with their medical insurances. For Medicare, there are different parts. I was never taught how to differentiate between each one, especially when I was never taught about medical insurances to begin with. That was the issue with vaccines because apparently I was supposed to choose one part over the other in regard to Medicare since one of them paid for vaccines while the others didn’t. 
I spent at least 10 minutes with different patients, all while the line got bigger from behind. Even when helping out people for other reasons, she told me to help the next person so the line could get moving. Essentially she told me to give these people the middle finger and to get moving elsewhere. I told her I wasn’t going to stop helping them just like that because I was doing my best to get the necessary issues resolved before moving onto the next patient. 

All in all, I know I recently started working here if you think about it. I don’t see myself doing any pharmacy tech work in the future because it’s really not for me. I noticed on the career section for my Walmart that they’re planning on hiring for pharmacy clerks. I told my pharmacy manager if this store has ever had it, and he said straight up they have and that it was my position. I told him I was considering being a sales clerk and nothing more to ease the responsibilities I had. He said he’d lower my salary, but not below the minimum wage of course. I told him that didn’t matter because I need my peace of mind. While I’ll still be stressed out, at least I can learn at my own pace and not have to worry about doing or be trying to do what my coworkers are doing. 

Only me and another coworker speak Spanish. Apparently when I was hired, that lessened the burdens that my coworker had trying to translate for those who only spoke Spanish. I’ve seen the pharmacy struggle without me during my break. I always watch them from a distance, all while the line gets big, the phone rings nonstop, and they’re trying to fill medications, all the while there’s no one at the front able to help ring people for their medications. Two pharmacy technicians quit earlier this year in June, two weeks apart from each other. I wonder why. I’m clearly not appreciated where I am, but most likely it’ll be like that at my next job. I don’t care. I don’t want to leave because I’m not appreciated, I want to leave this job because I wasn’t properly trained and I am risking too much for myself and the pharmacy by doing inputs. If I make mistakes during the inputs and the patient follows my mistake, what happens next if they have some sort of bad reaction? I’m trying to avoid this from happening as soon as possible.",Square-Quiet3950,1,0.9900000095367432,0,1698073195,2023-10-23 14:59:55,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17emeo0/i_26m_strongly_believe_that_my_pharmacy_manager/,10,2023

I think this is a really good change and will give me more resources as I am a team of one. However, my old boss is still continuing to inject their way into my work. I know that since this person is head of marketing they will need to have some sort of an awareness on what I am doing. But it is getting kind of frustrating still being given things to do from this person when I am no longer their direct report. I still have ties to their team because I need to align with them but am more of their resource for PR/comms.

I know it is only week one of this change, so I’m hoping that as projects wrap up, this person lessons their grip on me. But I am concerned because they are known for their micromanaging tendencies and if I had to guess they are not too happy that me and another team member moved.

How to I navigate this change? At what point do I need to set boundaries?

17elwwy,Question for freelancers. What is your turnaround time to complete projects,"I am fairly new to freelancing. I do graphic and multimedia design, video editing, motion graphics and so on.   
I usually like to ask for a 2 week turnaround time. This way, I can juggle between projects, while having my days off and not burn myself out.   
I noticed that the vast majority of clients don't like that and expect you to deliver in a few days, which feels like exploitation, given that the price that you charge them is not going to justify it, and also, there projects don't have to be so rushed all of the time. There's no need for such a pace, it totally comes from them.   


What are your takes? Also, would appreciate any recommendations as to how to put together an agreement, pricing strategies and your standats as to the turnaround time.

17elvgn,Seeking Career Advice: Finding Fulfillment and Balance in Work,"28/M with a BSc in Biology (plant science) here, transitioning from a 4-year stint in IT support to a 16-month contract as a Junior Agile Project Management Coordinator at a university. Though the new job pays better and offers great flexibility and work/life balance, I'm feeling unexpectedly unfulfilled.  
In my IT role, despite the stressful environment and job insecurity, I found satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment daily. Now, I'm grappling with the lack of structure and clear objectives in my current position, which leaves me feeling lost and questioning my worth, despite earning significantly more.  
As my contract has no extension prospects, I’m proactively seeking advice on potential career paths that align with my values and needs. Ideally, I'm aiming for a role offering:  
Good work/life balance  
A tangible impact on others' lives  
A steady income around $65k/year, without the pressure of constant upward mobility  
A compressed workweek, if possible

Trying to navigate a potential promotion. This is within the mobile gaming industry if that context is needed. 

I got pulled into a 1-1 last week with my design manager and their director. 

Long story short my manager is getting their own studio and they want me to be their #2. 

At the time, I didn’t get into the nitty gritty details on the call as the current director was also on the line and it didn’t seem like the time for negotiations. It was more of just these are exciting times, you’ve been killing it, etc etc talk. Also I was told I can’t talk about it yet with other colleagues because they aren’t announcing it until the beginning of next year. 

I have my 1-1 with my manager to go over the new studio structure and help them plan out some things this week. I want to bring up to them although I am 100% excited about this opportunity and ready to take the journey with them I just want to ensure this responsibility is coming with a titling change and compensation increase. 

I was thinking of saying I’d expect around 10%. I’m not sure though if I should be looking at it from a percentage aspect or dollar amount though. I already am in the mid 6 figure range.

Yes, it's seemingly not so stressful, and on the easier side of the medical field, a shorter program, and could keep me afloat financially. But I don't even know if I'm really interested in it. The trouble is, work/jobs in general I am not sure where to even turn. It's an easy way out, especially when I don't have any idea what kind of career I should work towards.  
I have studied Japanese for many years, but I know the work culture in Japan is not ideal.  
I think what's important is having a job you're interested in, but I also want to be able to live comfortably. So I'm at a loss for what to do.

They reassured us our jobs at the company were safe, however, we were all transferring to new departments. So, without consulting us first, we were all told we would be beginning new positions that are completely different from the jobs we signed on for. 

While I hate the feeling of being seen as no more than a pawn, I understand this is just part of working for a corporation. With that said, the reason I’m posting is because it was made clear there would be no pay increase accompanying this transition. While this is technically a lateral move, as far as the pecking order of the company, this is a completely different position and not one I would have applied for.

When I reached out to the company conducting my background check I asked them about it there only response was your bgv process is complete. They didn't tell me if it has been alright or not. I have received further onboarding details from the company from where I got my offer for. But I am still not sure about the details of my Bgv report.  
  
See the thing is I am worried because I had a backlog in one subject in my BTech(2019-2023) in 7th Semester. I cleared it in July 2 months after rest of my batchmates(in summer semester). I even got the result for the same in July itself. However our college had convocation for my batch in July 3 days before my backlog subject exam. The Admin has said I will get my degree next year. I have got Provisional degree certificate issued from college (it states that I have completed all academic requirements for B.Tech of this institute in July 2023 with X grade), all my semester wise marksheets and transcript. I had submitted my provisional degree certificate and semester wise marksheets in Bgv process. I had applied for the job for which I got offer for in August. Could I face a problem as I would be getting my degree next year while rest of my mates got this year. Also would it be considered that I completed my BTech in 5 years.

17eckrx,"I don't know if I should keep a linkedin or not, bully psychopath ex-coworker is a connection","My main concern is I used to have a psychopath bully co-worker. It's hard to talk about this person without sounding paranoid or as overreacting, it's the kind of person one might think - am I still in high school? what is this? but in all honesty I do think that person is not right in their head. 

Long story short, this person sent an invite on linkedin while we were still working together so to avoid drama I accepted. 

Fast forward I'm no longer there, and got a new job. I knew there was no way for this person to not see my new job because even if I blocked them, I knew they were stalkers and used other accounts to keep tabs on people. I had seen him do it. 

But I was afraid of triggering this person if I blocked or unfollowed them in a way that they would search for a job at my new place. He's that type of ""crazy"" that would 100% do that. Plus somehow in his mind this person is set that I was the one that caused his position to end at our old place. Not only that but this person would totally ace any interview - is very good at talking and at people being able to relate with him and find him pleasant to talk to. So if he wanted to, he would have a very good shot at landing a job at my new place. 

Once in a job this person is really good at pushing buttons (harassment and hostility) without leaving much tracks and being very subtle while also winning most of the other people and putting them against you and as the bad person (this is were his mastering communication skills comes into place). This person is also very interested in a lot of ""dark psychology"" so I'm pretty sure he employs a lot of the techniques. 

The only way I survived him at my last job was to just ignore and focus on work and keep myself busy in order to not get involved in that mess, but it was very exhausting.

So now, I hate that this person will keep tabs on me, and blocking or unfollowing will only trigger stalking through alternate accounts, and will feed his need to harass. 

This person is so crazy and so good at this so called dark psychology that recently has been posting a lot of activity about taking courses which match 100% what I'm currently doing at my new place. So I know that even if he's not really appying at my new place, he wants me to see that so that it triggers my mind. He likes to play a lot of nasty psychology games.  I dealt with it a lot while we were working together. I've tried to hide that activity but somehow it ends up back on my feed. 

I ended up closing linkedin, but at the same time I know this is closing me to seeing opportunities that I would otherwise have to actively look for a new job to see and will probably in the end impact my mobility in my career. I got my new job through linkedin and just randomly seeing a job that fit me. I would have never found that job digging through indeed. 

In the end, I think this is what this person wants, to keep me in fear and play with my head, and probably sees this as a win, but idk about having such a stalker keeping tabs on me either. 

I'm not really happy at my new job and want to look for a new one and I think linkedin would be a great tool, but I'm honestly afraid of this person applying at my workplaces. I really don't want to have to quit because this person starts working at any of my new places.

There is nothing to report this to anyone as there are no tracks and it's all mind and psychological games. This person is that smart. This person is crazy and I know I sound paranoid and crazy mentioning it. I just need advice on what you think is my best course of action in regards to keeping a linkedin.

I'm looking for a full time job in Canada. What roles do you think I can apply to? I'm thinking customer service or sales. But, I'd like to do more. I'm a quick learner, I have some free time now to pursue any certifications that might make my profile stronger. 

Thinks I feel I'm good at/will be good at: Project management, Business Analysis, UI/UX Design, Analytics (I started the Google Data Analytics certification, but got distracted midway. I found working with SQL and Tableau interesting) 

Thanks in advance, and appreciate any advice regarding what roles to apply for, certifications to pursue, or any general tips. ",Effective-Ad-2747,1,1.0,0,1698028730,2023-10-23 02:38:50,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ea6w7/career_advice_what_should_i_do_next/,10,2023
17e9r6k,Should I quit my job?,"Hi there,  
  
I come here to get new perspectives on issues at work that are affecting me.  
  
TW : >!saiksual harassment!<  
  
I started to work in this company a few months ago. I like my team-mate, the group I'm part of and my manager is great. I moved here for this job but still have my main home abroad.  
  
In August, while walking home from work, I heard someone calling out to me. I kept walking. A man on his bike stopped by me and after asking me if I did not recognize him, I actually did. It was a colleague from my department. He said he spotted my colorful dress and followed me in the street. We chatted, and he told me he lived nearby. He also suggested exchanging numbers and having a drink. At that time, I saw no red flags and thought he was as friendly as all my colleagues.  
  
Last month, there was an Afro festival in another city. I thought about this colleague and asked him if he planned to go. He did not hear about this festival and suggested to go to another event. I accepted.  
That night, we were 4 — one friend (M) of his, someone he met at a conference (F), him, and me.  
At some point, he started to sexualize the conversation. He told the other woman ""she has not seen it yet"", I said nothing but stepped back.  
Later, I was at a bar with these two men. While he was referring to saiks, I told him I was not comfortable with the word (including pronouncing it), he smiled and said ""interesting"". He made a ""joke"" about gay people and both he and his friend laughed. After, he talked again about saiks but I told him I did not want to know. He was smiling and insisting. I repeated twice more and since he was still smiling and not listening to me, I left.  
I cried a lot and felt miserable that night. I still feel dirty.  
  
A few days later, I am 80% sure I saw him passing by my home on his bike. He smiled at me.  
  
After some advice from my friends and a coworker, I decided to report him to my manager. She believed me and after I gave my consent, she spoke to HR who advised her to report him through a special service dedicated to misconduct. Since then, my manager allowed me to work from home full-time if I wanted to.  
  
I got my hearing with this service this week. There were 2 people - a woman and a man who spoke most of the time. They explained the process.  
I told the story without crying (the first time I could do so). When I was done, the man asked me if I did not think it was ""seduction"". ""If we talk to him, he will say 'I love her, I want to be with her'"".  
He asked if I talked to him so he stopped. I said yes, while it was happening but he was actually referring to after. He said that nothing wrong was done and that I should meet with him and asked him to stop.  
""It's life, men go after women"". He added that since it was outside of the workplace, it was not their responsibility. Regarding the fact that the colleague may stalk me, he advised me to go to the police.  
At some point, I started to cry and said their reaction basically meant I had to resign as most women who experienced that do.  
The man said he had a psychological background, and that based on my reaction, I should go to counselling as I must have ""unresolved issues"" and that I should neither leave nor stay home officing since it was avoidance.  
The lady said that I was powerful and had support from my manager.  
They finally told me that if I left, it would be my decision but advised me not to rush.  
  
While I expected this reaction, it still shocked me.  
Before this hearing, I looked for information and found official texts and guides that clearly mentioned that it was saiksual harassment, that my employer had the duty to prevent it and to take action. Despite not being a work-related event, it was still affecting me at work so it was in their scope.  
These people are not trained as they should but it is not worse than most of companies.  
  
I also have another big problem with the people I work with (F and M). I do most of the job (90%) and they reap what I sow. They also behave as if I were their subordinate and give really wrong advice that I have to compensate. I did try to tell them about these important problems but they did not understand how serious it was or ignored what I said. I cannot avoid working with these people.  
There was an important meeting abroad a few weeks ago but due to compliance, some had to step out. I thought one of these 2 people, who worked in the same department, would do so as she had done nothing and could not go physically - she actually previously said she was not sure she could attend.  
But it had to be my team-mate, on vacation at that time, or me. I knew a long time ago it would be me since I anticipated this problem weeks before. I finally stepped out after our manager tried to intervene. The best she got was one of us attending virtually and the other face to face.  
It would have still meant that I had to cancel all my travel arrangements 3 days before the meeting. It was a lot of organization on top of all the work I performed. I decided to step out and clearly told them I was shocked by their behavior and that it affected my willingness to stay.  
I learned later that the female coworker did not say a single word during this 4-hour meeing.  
  
I want to leave because of these 2 issues. I'm a contractor with an expected last day on 31rst December 2023 and my notice period is 7 days. When I look at my calendar, it seems like an eternity. It will take me months to recover. The quality of my work has been excellent until now, I'm afraid it will soon not be the case anymore.  
  
But when I work with my teammate or get hands on my projects, I feel better. My team-mate would like me to stay. The last days have been busy with helping colleagues abroad with a project.  
During the weekend, the issues have been stuck in my head. I wish I had kept silent. I could have resigned soon after I started working there, seeing the red flags the other coworkers waved at me.  
I have anxiety attacks almost every day now.

In my sector, everybody knows each other. What will I say to my new employer if I leave ?  
  
For the colleague: I will not talk to him.  
For the 2 coworkers: due to an ongoing organizational change, it is possible that it will be other people. I'm trying to get the info.  
  
  
What is the best way to proceed now?

17e4zij,So scared I have to start from scratch,"Hey all, 


30F here and have been having a rough few years. I have 2 degrees from a Big Ten university (business admin and Spanish) from 2016 and was in sales from 2016-2020. 

In 2020, I had to move to a generic Starbucks job because of their excellent insurance coverage. I have a pretty awful medical problem that I’ve been working through and luckily was able to receive a surgery I needed, though recovery was tough. 

Fast forward to 2022, I had to be a caretaker of a family member who was in an accident and left handicapped. They needed full-time care and I worked with them for 24 hours a day doing everything. 

Sadly, they have since passed away. Yet here I am, with a strange, strange resume of an Account Manager making 100k in 2017, to minimum wage from essentially 2020 til now. I don’t even know where to begin, I am getting rejected from ENTRY LEVEL positions in sales even, and tbh, I hate sales and want out. Heck, even a customer service job would be great but I don’t even get replies, despite sales overlapping with customer service really well. 

I’d be willing to go to trade school I guess, but gosh I feel lost y’all and I’m feeling the financial pinch pretty hard :/ any advice at all?",StaceyGoes,1,1.0,0,1698013149,2023-10-22 22:19:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17e4zij/so_scared_i_have_to_start_from_scratch/,10,2023
17e4vb3,38 year old business owner. Going back to college?,"So,  I am 38 years old. I have owned by own business since I’ve was 23. And purchased a second in 2017. 

I do make money still.  But not as much as I have in the past. Business in my field is getting tougher due to the employee shortage. To the point where some of my employees make more money than I do.  And I am nervous if we go through a slow time I may lose so much money that I may never recover. 

 Meanwhile I can’t find the same caliber employees that I have had in the past. So that leads to basically no time off. Or if I do take some time off I am nervous the whole time something is going to get messed up. So it doesn’t really feel like time off. I keep telling myself that the industry will find a balance at some point.  But I am getting burned out at this point.
 I worked from 7am till 10 or 11 pm my first 8 years in business. Until I was established enough to pay more than my competition and hire better people. And I do get lots more interest when I post jobs and such than other people I know in my industry. But I literally hire the foreman and mangers out of other shops and they come here and do not know nearly as much as we do.  So I kind of thought I put in my time and thing would get easier. 

Anyway. That’s the background.  

So I am thinking about going to school for nursing. Becoming and RN. Make a career change. And then go part time while working and get my masters. Possibly use my business experience and nursing combines to manage in the hospital at some level. 

But I am too old to make this work?",Live4toys,9,0.7599999904632568,13,1698012846,2023-10-22 22:14:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17e4vb3/38_year_old_business_owner_going_back_to_college/,10,2023

17e4hw5,[Hiring] Everyone! Effortlessly Find Your Next Job with WeHunt's AI Matching System: My Personal Journey to Reinvent Job Hunting,"Hi folks!  
Ever just yeet your CV into the Job Boards abyss and hear...nothing? Been there, done that, got the rejection emails to prove it. A while back, I was crushing it in tech project management. But then, outta nowhere, the company pulls a sneaky on me, and I'm out on my ass. Oh, and did I mention my girl dumped me around the same time? Yeah life…….  
So there I was, blasting out job apps like a madman, 20-30 a day. Felt like I was just screaming into the void. But then, over a coffee (and maybe a few beers), an old mate drops this on me: ""Bro, you ever try, like, actually tailoring your CV for each gig?""  
That night, I went full mad mode. Picked my top 5 dream jobs and tailored (without lying lolz!) my Resume for each one. And guess what? By week's end, I had 4 calls lined up. That's when the lightbulb went off. Maybe, just maybe, I'd stumbled onto what I was meant to do. I wanted to change the game, make job hunting not suck so much….  
Say hello to WeHunt. Okay, the name's a work in progress, but hear me out. I rang up my full-stack buddy who was itching for a side gig. We brainstormed, and bam! WeHunt was born. We partnered up with some big-brain indexers (cost me an arm and a leg, but hey, YOLO) and got access to a whopping 6 million job offers. Then, we set up a vectorDB to store all the CV goodies and started matching them using BERT, with a sprinkle of open-source LLM - LLAMA (finally, something from Meta that doesn't suck).  
So, what's the dream with WeHunt?  
Instant Job Hunting: Upload your CV (srsly thats all), and we're on the prowl.  
Auto-Fill Job Forms: Tired of those ""Why us?"" questions? Let our AI handle it as its apply behalf of user.

WeHunt snags it and beefs up your profile.That is, you no longer have to remember to add new achievements to your resume - we will automatically rebuild them so you won't even have to open Wehunt. Although VCs would say that I must be fucked :D  
Chat for Recruiters: No screening boring calls, just our LLM acting like a mini-you.I was recruiting for my previous team and spent millions of hours reading resumes instead of having the chance to simply ask what I cared about.  
Career Advice: We'll point you to the best courses and skills, based on real data. We know who gets the job so we can start suggesting after some time what made those candidates get the job.  
So, there you have it. My wild ride from jobless to startup founder. If you're tired of the same old job hunt BS, give WeHunt a whirl. Let's change the game together.  
But here's the kicker: This isn't just a business for me. It's personal. It's about every rejection, every ghosted application, every ounce of self-doubt. It's about turning that pain into something transformative. With WeHunt, I want to give everyone a fighting chance in this chaotic job market.  
So, if you've ever felt lost, overlooked, or just plain frustrated, I get it. I've been there. And I genuinely believe WeHunt can change the game. If you're up for it, let's embark on this journey together. Yeaah - looking for frens to build it together - we can't do it alone.  
But here's where I need you. We're on the brink of launching our Proof of Concept, and we need real-world CVs to train our models and refine our system. If you've ever felt the sting of rejection, the frustration of unanswered applications, or the sheer exhaustion of the job hunt, I'm speaking directly to you.

17e3n8y,"How to approach a bad CV in job interviews (1+ gap on CV, low GPA, etc.)?","Hi.  
  
 I'm seeking guidance on how best to navigate my current situation. To provide you with a clearer picture of where I stand, here's a bit about myself:  


* 26 years old
* Living in Europe
* I worked 6 summers as a warehouse worker (2014-2019).
* I have been dealing with depression since I was 17,  which has had a notable impact on my academic performance. .
* Completed my bachelor's degree in Economics in a good university (target school in my country) in 2021: 
   * Graduated with low GPA , and it also took me more time to finish it.
* Currently doing a master's degree in Finance in the same university:
   * Already completed the curricular part in 2022 (with low GPA)
   * Was supposed to deliver my master thesis in October 2022, but I didn't do it.  


The period since I missed the deadline for my master's thesis (October 2022) has been particularly challenging, marked by my ongoing battle with depression. During this time, my CV has remained stagnant (no jobs, activities, etc).  
  
However, I have recently made a commitment to turn my life around. I've begun the journey towards recovery and have been actively working to enhance my hard skills.  
  
Yet, I remain concerned about the less-than-ideal state of my CV. I worry that it may hinder my job search, resulting in rejection from potential employers or inquiries about the gap in my résumé.  
  
With this in mind, I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer to help me navigate this situation.

17e2bqt,Early career advice,"In need some early career advice.

I've recently started at a small building engineering consultancy (<40 employees) since graduating some months back. The team I'm working in are mostly young engineers with little experience (most 3-5 years) with only 2 members of my direct team having >10 years experience. The company has lots of workload and is extremely chaotic and there is little to no time to properly train the younger staff including myself. At the start of my career, I feel proper training is essential. The other younger employees have told me that theyve had such little opportunity for training and/or getting their work checked due to how hectic the workload is. However, another way to look at it is the experience i'll get working with this consultancy may be better due to the more independent working/problem solving.

Very unsure right now whether to ride with the chaos and disorganisation with the current employers, or to consider/look elsewhere for a more structured and sophisticated company with a training programme/reigime?

When I reached out to the company conducting my background check I asked them about it there only response was your bgv process is complete. They didn't tell me if it has been alright or not. I have received further onboarding details from the company from where I got my offer for. But I am still not sure about the details of my Bgv report.  
See the thing is I am worried because I had a backlog in one subject in my BTech(2019-2023) in 7th Semester. I cleared it in July 2 months after rest of my batchmates(in summer semester). I even got the result for the same in July itself. However our college had convocation for my batch in July 3 days before my backlog subject exam. The Admin has said I will get my degree next year. I have got Provisional degree certificate issued from college (it states that I have completed all academic requirements for B.Tech of this institute in July 2023 with X grade), all my semester wise marksheets and transcript. I had submitted my provisional degree certificate and semester wise marksheets in Bgv process. I had applied for the job for which I got offer for in August. Could I face a problem as I would be getting my degree next year while rest of my mates got this year. Also would it be considered that I completed my BTech in 5 years.

17dzq6m,BS in chemistry student but I want to be an electronic technician afterwards. How to proceed?,"21F Interested in being an electronics technician

Ever since I was young, I was always good at fixing things and figuring out how electronics work. I would “dissect” them and look at the inside circuitry frequently as I grew up. 

However, when I was in high school/Lyceum, I was told to go for the economics/sociology-based or humanities-based track so I was young and clueless, I listened to my school. I deeply regret this because my passion for electronics was still alive and it grew even more during that time.

I started university at 19, I took a year off to focus on myself and heal my school trauma. I was in a different major than my current one (chemistry). I chose to switch to chemistry as it is the crossroads and intersection of STEM fields. At my school, it is an interdisciplinary program as it also includes physics, mathematics, and a wide range of elective courses + liberal arts&sciences courses. For the physics courses, “Electricity and Magnetism” (and its practical lab) is a mandatory course. We may choose another physics course so I will choose Modern Physics (encompasses: relativity, photoelectric effect, wave nature of particles, atomic and molecular spectra, models of the nucleus, nuclear reactions and elementa­ry particles, optics) as I feel it may be better for me. There’s also a mandatory course/practical lab in computational chemistry and a major’s elective in materials chemistry (covers themes like electronic materials and their chemical properties).

Despite being a chemistry major and liking my courses, my courses I find most interesting are those who relate to electronics. However, I wonder what would a path to being an electronic technician be in my case. Is there a Master’s program I should do? Should I join a technical master’s? Can I get a job straight after my BS chemistry? Or should I take a minor in physics too (I’d have to take 3 courses (To choose from: Solid state physics, intro to nanotechnology, electromagnetic waves, and statistical mechanics) on top and an extra semester, which I wouldn’t mind)? 

PS: I graduate in spring 2025 but I may extend to fall 2025 if I must.

Feel free to ask me if you need clarification, I’d highly appreciate any help.",NoPrivacy0220,1,1.0,0,1697999068,2023-10-22 18:24:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dzq6m/bs_in_chemistry_student_but_i_want_to_be_an/,10,2023

I have had a certain thought rushing through my head for quite some time. I decided to join a certain small Company (really small, less than 20 people) 6 months ago. The pay is okay for the area where I live, I definitely don't complain about that. The problem is it stress me out all the time. 

The people are okay. I learn looots of new stuff there, the learning curve is really though the roof. The only con other then the stress is that the overhours are not paid or anything (there are like 3-5 additionall hours a week).

So I'm wondering - should I quit? Really, all the time, no matter what I'm doing I'm thinking about my job. Can't get it out of my head. I have this weird fear of failing, that keeps on going in my head. I kinda stopped excercising and I'm not taking care of my personal life because of that, as I had in the past. 

I really don't know what to do.

I'm 24 and feeling a bit lost in terms of my career. 

I love architecture and have been doing a design job, but I also love story / screenwriting / film.

I recently made a fictional narrative film which is very spatially oriented; the story revolves around elements of the space it's in. 

I've also been making short videos, in which i edit people to size down and interact with architecture-like objects in a fictional narrative format which I write + film. 

But, I'm not sure there's a career or even individual artistic path for this sort of thing. 

I don't have an accredited arch degree and will l apply to masters degrees soon, but I'm afraid to leave my artistic and story-based interests behind, underdeveloped.

i’m 19 and i’ve been working at a bookstore for 6 months now as a part time employee while I’m in college. 3 months in advance, I requested time off near thanksgiving for a family reunion that has already been paid for, and time over christmas for a family vacation that my parents surprised us with.

I know they’re allowed to deny this time, but we’re specifically hiring seasonal employees right now who have agreed to work over the holidays, so I thought it would be okay to get time off.

17dvjn7,"Questionable CEO, lower-than-expected salary - WWYD? Red flags?","Long story not so short, I was FT with an agency I loved for three years making 84K/year (I'm 42 and have years of experience. ) Company went through three rounds of layoffs in 10 months, and my whole team except one manager was laid off end of August, including me. It sucks. I was FT freelance five years before that role, and did well, so right now I'm trying to freelance again but holy hell it's next to impossible, not to mention applying for FT roles I can't even get an interview for despite my experience. I'm single, have no debt other than a mortgage, but obviously I need work. But thankfully I'm good for a year or so if I can cobble things here and there until I hopefully secure some solid freelance clients again. But now the dilemma...

One freelance client I DID find was for a company of around 50 people, tech-focused editorial on my end, and I did four articles for them that the editor, who is relatively new to the company, loved. It paid well. I was thrilled to be able to have some work for them on a semi-regular basis. They also recently opened up a staff writer role and on LinkedIn, the salary listed was 65-95K/year depending on experience, unlimited PTO, and benefits. I had a call with the editor (after our initial call about freelance) talking about that staff role, as obviously i was interested. The editor is great - but made a huge point to tell me the CEO (his boss) is very demanding and has really high expectations, etc. Then he asked about salary and when I said that was a huge range listed, but that I would need it to be towards the top given my experience, the demands of the role, etc. and he agreed.

Fast-forward and a week after that interview, he said he was still trying to meet with his boss about the role and asked for my resume and portfolio again to send to his boss again who was ""crazy busy"". A week after that I still didn't get an update, so I followed up (when turning in another paid assignment) and we had a call about it last night. He started by saying he's a huge fan of my work, impressed, etc. but again brought up that it's a challenging environment right now (paraphrasing, but his boss is yes, very tech-minded and demanding), etc. and said he had a meeting with his that day when the CEO said he was looking to pay...65K for this role. 

I didn't mean to, but pretty sure I physically recoiled because I was so shocked. That's not the high end of that range we talked about. He asked what I thought I said that was much lower than I was anticipating, and that 65K wouldn't work for me. He understood, and agreed, and asked me what I was thinking. I said 80-85K given my experience, demands of the role, salary history, etc. He again agreed it aligned with my value (plus, he's also a writer who gets it), and said he was going to talk to his boss again Mon or Tue about our conversation and again bring up my value and experience, etc. as he gets that you get what you pay for. It wasn't an ""official"" offer, but I feel like it's my job if I was willing to take the 65K, which even though I want the security of FT work, is what I was making 10 years ago in a role without a ""challenging environment"". I do also have the option to continue to freelance for them, which ironically pays great, so maybe go that route and avoid having to deal with the possible neurotic CEO and that situation? I would love a steady paycheck, but not sure if it would be worth it. 

I haven't had to negotiate in a long time, and I have no idea if there is wiggle room and they could meet my 80K suggestion, but is this a red flag? Obviously I don't know what he'll come back with - or when, as it's apparently hard to nail down the boss for these things - but I was just shocked they listed that range and then came in at the bottom of the barrel.

17ds5tc,Have a bachelors degree in Business with an HR management concentration want to make career change to CPA,"Hi everyone! 

I went to a CA state school and have my bachelor’s in business with an HR concentration. I want to make a career change to accounting. 

If anyone has any advice or previous experience making this switch, I would love to know. 

I have over 2 years of HR experience. I really enjoy the parts of my job that involve being detail-oriented and organized. I would say those are some of my bigger strengths. However I prefer tasks that are less focused on managing interpersonal conflicts.

To make the transition, I assume I would need to go back to school for my BA in accounting or maybe go to grad school for accounting…? 

Anyways, any advice is much appreciated. Thank you! ☺️",browngirl615,0,0.5,1,1697977729,2023-10-22 12:28:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ds5tc/have_a_bachelors_degree_in_business_with_an_hr/,10,2023
17dr8im,Lower salary and CEO question — Red flag? What would you do?,"Long story not so short, I was FT with an agency I loved for three years making 84K/year (I'm 42 and have years of experience. ) Company went through three rounds of layoffs in 10 months, and my whole team except one manager was laid off end of August, including me. It sucks. I was FT freelance five years before that role, and did well, so right now I'm trying to freelance again but holy hell it's next to impossible, not to mention applying for FT roles I can't even get an interview for despite my experience. I'm single, have no debt other than a mortgage, but obviously I need work. But thankfully I'm good for a year or so if I can cobble things here and there until I hopefully secure some solid freelance clients again. But now the dilemma...  
One freelance client I DID find was for a company of around 50 people, tech-focused editorial on my end, and I did four articles for them that the editor, who is relatively new to the company, loved. It paid well. I was thrilled to be able to have some work for them on a semi-regular basis. They also recently opened up a staff writer role and on LinkedIn, the salary listed was 65-95K/year depending on experience, unlimited PTO, and benefits. I had a call with the editor (after our initial call about freelance) talking about that staff role, as obviously i was interested. The editor is great - but made a huge point to tell me the CEO (his boss) is very demanding and has really high expectations, etc. Then he asked about salary and when I said that was a huge range listed, but that I would need it to be towards the top given my experience, the demands of the role, etc. and he agreed.  
Fast-forward and a week after that interview, he said he was still trying to meet with his boss about the role and asked for my resume and portfolio again to send to his boss again who was ""crazy busy"". A week after that I still didn't get an update, so I followed up (when turning in another paid assignment) and we had a call about it last night. He started by saying he's a huge fan of my work, impressed, etc. but again brought up that it's a challenging environment right now (paraphrasing, but his boss is yes, very tech-minded and demanding), etc. and said he had a meeting with his that day when the CEO said he was looking to pay...65K for this role. I didn't mean to, but pretty sure I physically recoiled because I was so shocked. That's not the high end of that range we talked about. He asked what I thought I said that was much lower than I was anticipating, and that 65K wouldn't work for me. He understood, and agreed, and asked me what I was thinking. I said 80-85K given my experience, demands of the role, salary history, etc. He again agreed it aligned with my value (plus, he's also a writer who gets it), and said he was going to talk to his boss again Mon or Tue about our conversation and again bring up my value and experience, etc. as he gets that you get what you pay for.  
It wasn't an ""official"" offer, but I feel like it's my job if I was willing to take the 65K, which even though I want the security of FT work, is what I was making 10 years ago in a role without a ""challenging environment"". I haven't had to negotiate in a long time, and I have no idea if there is wiggle room and they could meet my 80K suggestion, but is this a red flag? Obviously I don't know what he'll come back with - or when, as it's apparently hard to nail down the boss for these things - but I was just shocked they listed that range and then came in at the bottom of the barrel. I would love some outside opinions on this depending on when/what I hear back next week.",SunshineACH,1,1.0,1,1697974345,2023-10-22 11:32:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dr8im/lower_salary_and_ceo_question_red_flag_what_would/,10,2023

17dpcua,"Why are money driven individuals are looked at negatively/as though they don't care about the work itself, within professional circles","Hi, this is something that puzzles me on a personal side. I am money-driven, starting my career in the entertainment industry. I wasn't always money driven, but I grew to be, because I want to be treated fairly, and not a fan of struggling to pay my bills. Yet each time I openly say what motivates me, I get such a weird opposition and condemnation, as though if we all could afford not to work, we still would. For example, a couple of weeks ago, I posted in a Facebook group, that I am considering becoming a producer, and if folks could recommend resources for research and learning, and then someone asked me, what show I want to produce, and I said, ""the ones that make money"", and I got sooo many negative responses saying that I should only produce what I'm passionate about hahahha and that ""if only kids these days worked half as hard as we did"" and all of that bs. I wonder why is it OK for lawyers and doctors to be money motivated, but if you happened to have gotten education in stereotypically less prestigious fields, you're supposed to settle for scraps and ""work for passion"". Why is it OK for business owners to be motivated by money, but if you are small, you shoud  pretend to be smaller, and be happy about it.   
Another thing is I also dread the infamous question ""but what is it that you wanna do"" from prospective employers (because I have mixed experiences, and I'm like well, I want to do what I get hired to do, and this is where I see myself in 5 years. And they simply don't like this answer. I made a similar post in a psychoanalytical group, because I was curious, but that one either wasn't very interesting to most members, or the ones responded, seemed just as annoyed as folks I'd spoken about it before. Cusious what answers I will get here.)",loshilo,5,1.0,8,1697966519,2023-10-22 09:21:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dpcua/why_are_money_driven_individuals_are_looked_at/,10,2023

17dotg5,High paying Remote job or dream job as touring musician?,"
""Throughout my life, the passionate dream of becoming a professional touring musician and a pivotal artist in a band has remained a constant flame. At the tender age of 13, I embarked on this musical journey, picking up the electric bass with an unwavering determination. Yet, I was raised in an Indian household where scientific and academic pursuits were hailed above all else. The clash between my fervent musical aspirations and familial expectations was evident even in my teenage years.

My dedication to music, however, bore fruit in middle school and high school, as I found myself garnering accolades, securing coveted audition spots, and receiving recognition as a prominent 'band kid.' This musical success was a testament to my unwavering passion and commitment to the craft.

But life took a different turn as my parents emphasized the importance of core academic subjects and coerced me into pursuing a college major that bore no relation to my beloved music. This was a devastating blow, a deeply-rooted aspiration left unfulfilled. Nevertheless, my love for music remained unwavering. I continued to nurture it by immersing myself in rock and indie bands, expressing my devotion to the art.

When I embarked on my college journey, I pursued a degree in engineering at a prestigious Big Ten university. It was during this time that I took the initiative to start a jazz-funk band on campus, seamlessly balancing my academic commitments with a thriving music career. The rhythm of my life was set to the beat of my bass, as I performed at shows every weekend. My band, ever ambitious, began to experience local acclaim and ventured on regional tours and independent shows.

With a diploma in hand, the year 2020 welcomed me into the professional world, but it didn't quite embrace me back. My engineering degree did little to provide fulfillment or a satisfying career. Instead, frustration and disillusionment took over. It was then that the counsel of a wise uncle prompted me to consider an alternative path. I heeded his advice and undertook an online master's degree in business, an endeavor that would ultimately open doors to a new trajectory.

The pandemic, with its global disruptions, presented an unexpected opportunity for creative expression. My band and I crafted an album during these trying times, keeping our musical dreams alive despite the world's chaos. We continued to perform in Chicago until the curtain fell on 2022.

Following the disbandment of my cherished musical project, I faced a significant crossroads. I relocated to Los Angeles while retaining my remote job, which now provided a comfortable six-figure income. My musical undertakings remained close to my heart as I continued to strum the strings of my bass, but now I reside in a city where many of my friends are deeply entrenched in the world of touring musicians, some even touring with major artists.

I’m now 25, working a comfortable and easy job and have all my needs met. In this current juncture of my life, I'm grappling with an agonizing dilemma. Should I part ways with the stability and financial security of my remote job in pursuit of my lifelong dream of becoming a professional bassist? This pivotal juncture has me torn between the safety of my current life and the ardor of a musical aspiration that refuses to wane. The decision is far from clear, and I'm now standing at the precipice of a life-altering choice.""",Wise_Association_589,3,0.7200000286102295,6,1697964167,2023-10-22 08:42:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dotg5/high_paying_remote_job_or_dream_job_as_touring/,10,2023
17dn7ks,Got offered Sales position but may turn it down for serving job.,"Alright this is gonna be long winded but there’s a lot to this so bare with me. 

I’ve been working at this landscaping company for three years now. It’s a small business, currently at like 13 full time employees but growing. I started at $13 an hour and currently make $22 an hour. Moved my way up through the company partly because of the small size but also because (not to toot my own horn) im a dedicated, hardworking, trustworthy individual/employee. 

Well one day last winter (around December) we were doing snow removal and something clicked, I just thought “I don’t really enjoy doing this”. This thought caught me off guard because for the previous two plus years I was working my ass off to try and keep moving up in the company. My end of the year review was coming up so i decided to see what kind of raise/bonus I was going to be offered and go from there. My bosses had reassured me many times throughout the summer they were going to take care of me once they were able. With it being a small business I understood and just kept grinding. End of the year review comes up and all I’m presented with is a $1 an hour raise and no bonus. An absolute kick in the dick.

Pretty devastated I slowly start to look for other jobs, not quite sure really what I was wanting to do. For background I had worked in restaurants about 10 years prior to working for this company and part time while working for them as well. Eventually I find this restaurant that is perfect for what I’m looking for. Open 5-8 M-Th and 4-9 Fri and Sat with higher priced menu items so tips are nice, can make roughly $800-$1200 a week working 30hrs a week. 

I start working at this place in late February but not quite getting full time hours so I decide not to quit my landscaping job quite yet. Once April rolls around I’m consistently getting good hours at this restaurant but for some reason some guilt sets in and I for whatever reason don’t want to leave my other job hanging right as busy season is starting (dumb I know). I decide to grind out both jobs through the summer and stash as much money as I can. 

Being pretty checked out from my day job I just kinda coast through the summer. My bosses didn’t seem to acknowledge my lack of dedication which was also, a kick in the dick. 

Anyway, we finally get to fall, I’ve been talking of quitting for a long time now, literal months. I decide I’m going to do it on a Friday, give them a three week notice because my position was a specific one, not just a laborer and I figured I could help train or stay until they found a replacement.  

The day before I’m gonna quit my boss texts me and ask “do you have time to talk today, want to bounce some ideas around”. Not thinking much of it I say sure and set something up and just plan on giving the notice after we talk. 

We meet Friday morning and to my surprise they offer me a promotion… They offer me the landscaping sales job, base pay is $65,000 with 5% commission on gross sales (they estimate another $5000). Stunned I tell them I need to think about it. They understand and we plan to meet the following week. 

Fast forward after a couple days of long thought and talking to friends and family I tell them I want $75000 with same commission structure and very flexible PTO and hours (I.e work more maybe mid week and get off at like 1 on Friday if I wanted). To my surprise they accept and so I then accept. My raise won’t start til March 1st but I’m expected to start this roll right away. Since my raise won’t kick in til March I decide to stay at the restaurant to keep making extra money. 

Anyway, I’m about two weeks in and I’m having second thoughts. I’m sitting at my desk making quotes thinking “I don’t give a shit about any of this”. The person training me who I’ve worked with for a couple years now can just be an absolute dick head and I’m not sure if I can put up with it for much longer. 

Anyway I guess my question for this long ass post is, am I dumb to walk away from this position?  I have no college degree and basically just restaurant experience and just this landscaping experience. I went from making $13 an hour to basically $80,000 in three and a half years at this company. I feel like these opportunities are hard to come by for a person like me with no degree and little experience. 

However, I thoroughly enjoy serving, I enjoy talking to people, the flexibility of the job and I make decent money too. The downside is having to work nights and weekends. Missing out on family/friendship gatherings is a big bummer for me but I think if I put in extra effort on my off days I can still make time for everyone.

The pros for the sales job would be great experience, flexible PTO, having a normal schedule like all my friends and family and of course more money. But just don’t know if I can do it. 

Just looking for advice, do I suck it up for a couple years and then maybe leapfrog to another job elsewhere? Serving makes me more happy/fulfilled but scared it may put me in a box career wise. Although with all the extra time I have with serving I could look at starting my own business. TIA and sorry for the long ass post just wanted to get all my thoughts out there. 

TLDR; Do I turn down good paying sales job that I may dislike for serving job that I do enjoy a lot. No college degree, no sales experience.",Fragrant_Gazelle69,2,1.0,2,1697957220,2023-10-22 06:47:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dn7ks/got_offered_sales_position_but_may_turn_it_down/,10,2023

17dkq06,Do you think presenting young holds one back in career growth?,"I’m in my early 30s but I’ve always been told I look younger, and even now people I meet with as part of my job think I’m newly out of grad school.  A lot of this is just how I look but I also think my more excitable and extroverted personality doesn’t help either. 

I have a good job (assistant director level) in a very specific field at the state level. I’ve been doing this type of work, but in different states, for 10 years. I recently wanted to volunteer in my community, so I reached out to the city employee who directs the program.  We met in person to talk about potential volunteer opportunities and in passing I mentioned my job because it has super high relevency to the volunteer position.  I didn’t emphasize my job because I want to do this in a volunteer capacity without the backing of my org.  

After the meeting, she reached out to a state-level  director (not my boss) to make sure I was legitimate.  The state-level director told my boss who told me but I was kinda baffled because I definitely was mature when we met.  And I dressed well so I don’t think it was that.  So, I think it was probably because I looked too young for the job position I hold, or maybe because I seemed too eager to volunteer in my field of work as a rando 30-something? For some reason, I didn’t seem credible enough for her to accept me at face value, so I’m trying to figure out what it was.  

Has something similar happened to you?  Is this normal?

17dj50w,Seeking Advice on a Career Pivot: From Business Leadership to Intellectual Fulfillment,"  
Hello everyone,  
  
I'm reaching out to this community for some guidance on a potential career change. I've heard that many of you offer insightful advice, and I'm eager to learn from your experiences.  
  
I hold a bachelor's degree in Marketing and Psychology and have been working as a Marketing Coordinator for a plumbing company for close to 10 months. The company has around 35 employees, and I joined the team through a connection who purchased the business two years ago. Although my title is ""Marketing Coordinator,"" my responsibilities have evolved to include leading most of our business strategy.  
  
Since joining, I've successfully integrated technology into our operations, significantly improving both efficiency and revenue. However, despite these accomplishments, I find myself increasingly disenchanted with my job. I often feel isolated, as my innovative ideas are met with resistance from the older staff. The work environment seems to prioritize mere survival over improvement, and I'm growing weary of solving an endless stream of problems.  
  
Initially, I thought that honing skills in public speaking, business strategy, and optimization would be rewarding. However, the reality has been a constant uphill battle, and the burden of resolving new issues now falls squarely on my shoulders. I'm contemplating a shift towards studying Philosophy, Mathematics, or Physics, hoping that such a path would offer a sense of discovery rather than the feeling of running on a treadmill.  
  
Has anyone here transitioned from a leadership role to a more intellectually fulfilling career? If so, do you consider your change a success, or do you have any regrets? I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice you can offer.

17dioo9,Career Transition - Cyber Security. How do I start ?,"&#x200B;

I am starting my career over at 35, I have been in the travel industry for 10 years, and post Covid I make half of what I make. and have been interested in cybersecurity for a while and decided to take the plunge and enroll in WGU in Dec.  
I have been getting mixed reviews that the tech sector is not that great due to all the recent layoffs, but I feel different and have always had an underlying passion to break into the field.   
So my question for those who are in the field now is :  
 1.If you could start over, what steps you would take to break into the field ?

17dijqj,Advice for someone with ‘challenges’,"(Australia) Hey everyone. So I(35f) have pretty severe ADD, depression, anxiety, chronic migraines and low physical stress tolerance. I mention this because I can’t figure out what sort of career I can realistically do when 1) I will have to work part time 2) will frequently have to have days off for migraines - usually once a week, I can’t control which days they come and 3) have struggled majorly with training and study due to those reasons too. 

ADD makes self paced study near impossible, and self-employment would have the same problem. My resume at this point has so many gaps from health related issues or failed attempts at college that I have zero self-confidence when applying for anything, even though I know I could definitely do whatever job I’ve applied for. The only jobs I’ve had over the past 10 years have been either through a friend or my partner getting me hired.

I have some experience with Admin and IT, started a Computer Science Bachelors, did well with the content but struggled majorly with the exams and the inflexibility of semester scheduling so ultimately dropped out. 

I am really interested in all things IT, one of my hobbies is learning Unreal Engine and game design but I know realistically I wont get paying work in that field. I love data and databases but I struggled majorly with the maths part of the CompSci degree. I did well in the Python unit, feel confident about Java and Object Oriented Programming, understand relational databases etc but I don’t know where to go from here. 

I live in Western Australia and currently cannot relocate but I feel so useless and confused because I know I need more skills but I don’t know which direction to take and have lost all confidence in myself due to the health stuff. It’s not classed as a disability and even if it was I want my life to have purpose and to be able to make a decent income to contribute to my family. I don’t want to take the sob-story approach but I don’t know how to approach my situation from a realistic and professional angle. 

Can anyone give me advice please? Thankyou!

Tldr; unsure how to approach an ability-limited career in IT, have some knowledge of programming, interest in Databases but unsure of direction",Salt_Fabulous,3,0.800000011920929,2,1697940164,2023-10-22 02:02:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17dijqj/advice_for_someone_with_challenges/,10,2023
17digrw,How much do short stints actually matter? (Explainable gap),"Going through a lot of change recently. I'm a 28M.

Had a great start to career after University in 2017:

\- Worked for company for 3.5 years (top sales rep, promoted and really loved it)

\-Moved to Europe and worked for a start up for 8 months, moved back to US after family member fell ill

\- Joined a company that I really hate (company change their name and going through restricting), been here 8 months and I'm going to quit in the next few weeks. Exhausting everyday doing this job with such an unorganized company 

\- Going to be doing some certificates/really search for new job that I can fit well with.

Thoughts? (I have 12 month of expenses saved, no debt)

17di5sx,Tired of feeling exploited.,"27(F), I've been working since I was 14 years old. Food service, Retail Management, Holistic Wellness, styling, then Advertising. Bachelor's in Communications. 

I began working for startups at the end of college and enjoyed it very much because I loved the companies. I then was poached by one of our clients and started working in Advertising as a post-production coordinator. I was let go during COVID (company shut down) and have been lost ever since. I got really sick soon after, and took a break from ""the grind"". 

To survive, I took a couple of temp jobs at Ad agencies, did some freelance social media work, and held a part time retail job. 

I am now at a point where I feel like the clock is ticking, and I am so tired of jumping industries because I get a job offer. Unfortunately, all of my bosses have been very shitty. In each position, I ended up getting paid less than promised, never got benefits (although promised) and was severely burnt out from being given about double the workload. I have only ever been praised by my bosses, yet whenever I asked for more money or benefits, it just ""wasn't doable at the moment"".  I have been the one to leave every job I've had due to being underpaid (mins covid job).

I truly put 100% into each job I have, but I feel like it is severely affecting me. I am actively searching for jobs right now in any field, and I am tired of feeling like I have to keep starting over.  In whatever field I have worked in, the most I've been paid is close to 40-45k. I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world and I just cannot allow myself to dig into savings while living paycheck to paycheck. 

I do not want to sound like a victim or ""poor me"" but I really need some guidance or help in picking the correct path. I am willing to do the work and learn a new industry, I just don't know what to even look for at this point. 

Any career advice or ideas for me? Thanks for reading. ",Crafty_Meaning8778,1,1.0,0,1697938929,2023-10-22 01:42:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17di5sx/tired_of_feeling_exploited/,10,2023
17di47w,Is my new boss trying to fire me or get me to quit?,Sorry for the long post. I have worked for my current employer for about three years now. About six months ago the manager who hired me was demoted and I was placed under another manager. When that happened I went from being an automation engineer working on engineering projects to having to work on writing training materials and documentation. I have worked in this field now for 18 years. I have a bachelors degree in computer science and one in industrial engineering. I also have a masters degree in industrial engineering. Needless to say I was shocked when assigned to documentation and training. So about two months ago the manager who hired me was let go.  Ever since he was let go I have been told weekly that I am not meeting expectations. This past week things escalated and now everything is in email and my manager will not talk to me directly. I was also told that I need to start being on site to conduct training classes. I replied back to them and repeated I am an engineer not a trainer and never have been a trainer. My email was ignored. I have never been through something like this and just don’t know if they are building a case to fire me or make me quit.  I have my own consulting company ready to go if something happens.,Flashy-Albatross-ASD,5,0.7799999713897705,7,1697938794,2023-10-22 01:39:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17di47w/is_my_new_boss_trying_to_fire_me_or_get_me_to_quit/,10,2023

Alongside my job as a technician, I've dabbled in procurement assistance work. However, as I pursue my computer science degree, I've started to question the value of traditional college education. Many of the baseline classes seem unrelated to my future goals, and I've noticed that real-world experience, certification courses, and self-guided learning have accelerated my knowledge and skills significantly.  
Despite my doubts, I've found a few perks from college, such as informative demonstration classes and a ""not-so-free"" gym membership included in my tuition.  
To give you some context, my journey began early, and I'm eager to expand my expertise as a technician. My dream is to venture into network administration or perhaps become a penetration tester, with the ultimate goal of becoming an ethical hacker.

17d4hmj,Mom jobs for someone who doesn't want it all!,"I'm at a real crossroads in my working life right now.  Before kids  I had a career...public sector info systems/IT background, 9-5 M-F, commute 1+ hour each way. When I had my first kid I asked to go part time, and altogether they allowed it, they made it very painful. I had to report to new hires who had no idea what they were doing (but they were young and didn't have kids). By the time I had my 2nd and 3rd kids (twins) they made it so painful I decided to resign. I'm also just not a daycare type of person. I know plenty of people who have had decent experiences but it's just not for me. I ended up staying home for 3 years. It's very important to me to be there for my kids.  In the meantime I did a lot of studying on YouTube Univerisity, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, etc. I did not let my time go to waste. It wasn't easy with 3 kids but I just hated the idea of losing touch with my field. I ended up learning new skills and offered my services for free as a volunteer. This volunteering for me was noticed by a person who needed someone (desperately) with my skills. I wasn't fond of this person but I saw it as an opportunity--as well as my husband--to get my foot back in the door. I did have stipulations though before I agreed to take the job-- if my kids are home, I need to be home.  They allowed me to leave to pick up my kids and then finish at home as well as work from home in the summer 3 days a week and off (with reduced pay but I asked for that) the other 2 (its a school so mostly quiet in the summer).I was told no problem... they even built it into my contract. 
Now into this job for over a year, they told me they won't allow the summer schedule any longer. I was taken by surprise by it, especially bc they always praise my work. Also, IImean let's be honest, it's not rocket science they're doing here!  I  told them,  no problem, I'll just stay until the summer and move on. I honestly don't have a problem with this. This is not my dream job!  My ""boss"" is a horrible person and terribly uninformed micromanager and gets 100% consistently on every ""Is your boss toxic"" quiz! Her idea of work is to brute force things... meaning not using any form of algorithm or repetitive process to complete a task. She sends emails at 3 am showing all her hard work on something that I can do in literally a fraction of the time! She is a terrible person and I knew this from the beginning! This job was only supposed to be a stopgap until I could find something better!   Well now I DESPERATELY need to find something better. But I have no idea how!  I admittedly have significant personal limitations (I want to be able to still pick up my kids from school and be home when they are home and I really just don't see myself ever going back to a 9-5).

Here's my question... am I being unreasonable in what I want? I'm not looking to make enough to be the breadwinner but a modest salary!  I feel like my skills are very in demand so why can't I find someone willing to work with me on flexibility? I though a school setting would be more low-key as opposed to a bigger corporation,  but somehow this place seems to think they can demand more! (I feel like they're experiencing financial issues and are in dire straights but I digress).

Where do I look?  How do I get out of here!  Should I give up and stay at home again? The job market right now just seems so terrible and looking for jobs is so disheartening.

17d3xbs,Why does it matter if I'm quiet for an IT call center.,"So some background, I recently got this job in IT that was supposed to be AMAZING. My old friends work there, I love the people, but holy micromanaged... We get scored on each call, we have to make sure we have everything documented in the ticket an exact way, we're given a set amount of time we can use the bathroom, and the main reason for the post, we can't go quiet for longer than ten seconds and we have to make sure it's okay with the client if we do go quiet. That and our calls are expected to be shorter than ten minutes. They expect us to have the ticket done at the end of the call. So you want me to document every single step I take, not stop talking to the client, and also troubleshoot within ten minutes??? The place I worked at before was a lot better managed. We had a set list of people we'd call each day, and we could mute as long as needed just to make sure the client was taken care of. I feel like the client would much rather me just troubleshoot whatever's wrong, than sit there talking about what I'm doing. They usually just get confused by what I'm saying and get frustrated, saying ""I'm not an IT person"". Yes, I know, and I wish I could quietly just fix your issue, but unfortunately we can't. Just like we can't use the bathroom or clock into work early, despite being expected to be ready at our start time. They want us to have about fifteen things open and be ready to take the call and troubleshoot at 8. They even talked to me aside about it, for being on the phone at 8:10 because I was setting up my stuff at 8. Overall, just really fed up. What can I do to get out of this job and my contract, as I'm not a hired in employee and just a contractor?",Rumtumanna,1,0.5699999928474426,6,1697898833,2023-10-21 14:33:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17d3xbs/why_does_it_matter_if_im_quiet_for_an_it_call/,10,2023

17cy9tp,"Pursue better job in location I'm not totally sold on, or stay put in city I like but with job I want to leave?","I've been at my job for a little over a year and a half, and I moved from the US to Amsterdam for this job. It's in the field I wanted to be in, but I feel unhappy with it for a couple reasons: I feel underpaid, and I feel like I'm not growing anymore and that I'm simply not reaching my potential in this job. I've expressed the latter to my manager several months ago and nothing significant has really changed. I'm kind of at a stage where I'm freaking out about how this is affecting my future employment and career prospects as I feel like I'm not gaining anymore relevant skills, and I want to buckle down and focus on my career. 

I was looking for jobs in Amsterdam and found a promising one, but they closed the role due to budget unfortunately. The same company has a similar role in Manchester, UK and I also found a role in Sydney, Australia at a very reputable international company. I didn't initially really have any super big desire to move especially because I've just been through a breakup and my mental health isn't great and I'm worried moving somewhere new and starting over would make it worse, but I also feel like I ""should"" pursue these opportunities if I'm serious about advancing my career. I also don't have any particular interest in Manchester or Sydney specifically as cities, it's really the jobs that appeal to me. So it's hard for me to decide what's important. I do enjoy living in Amsterdam and have friends here, so uprooting that stability again seems scary, but some other people have said maybe that's what I need right now. Has anyone been through this? How do you decide whether to pursue something new in a completely different location that you didn't have on your radar, or whether you should choose to stay in the city you like and hope something else comes along? I guess my fear is if I stay in Amsterdam nothing else will open up and I'll be stuck in this job for who knows how long.",dak0taaaa,2,1.0,4,1697878682,2023-10-21 08:58:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17cy9tp/pursue_better_job_in_location_im_not_totally_sold/,10,2023

17cxsx6,Don’t know wether I should start this field or change degree’s completely for ‘more money’,"Hello all.

I’m 21 and currently about to graduate my Communication degree majoring in media arts and production. I recently completed an internship at a one of the biggest news channels in Australia and at the end of it they offered me a position as a Junior Editor (edit news clips/stories that go to air; no writing involved). All sounds great and all. But the pay is 50-60k a year for full time. I’ve been thinking about my far future recently and it’s worried me a lot. Buying a house and living a comfortable lifestyle doesn’t seem achievable with current salary and I’m not sure wether or not if the pay will be better as I go up to maybe a producer position. I definitely don’t see myself working there forever because they require rotated night shift work and because I live around 1.5hr away it’ll be really tiring and harmful to my health in the long run. I’m worried that working in News would be the only way I can work full time with this field (as an editor) otherwise I’d have to freelance or contract work which sound even more stressful because it won’t give a sense of security. I guess this is what happens when you study a (semi) creative degree (Woking in film was my initial aspiration). Australia isn’t heavily catering to the creative field, America would have much more jobs in my field. But that would require me to migrate and work there which would be down to do. Sydney is also really expensive at the moment so moving somewhere else would be a good idea. Now that I’m heavily worried wether I can afford a house and comfortablly live a good lifestyle in Sydney working in this field, I’m thinking I should maybe after graduating go and study some IT or Cybersecurity degree because ‘that’s where all the money is’. I guess I’ve gotten money hungry and would rather chase money than I field I was initially interested in. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I think my anxiety might make it seem more bad than it really is. Some help and guidance would be much obliged.

I’m currently in search of finding a full time job that’s a right fit for me during the weekdays. I recently got a call from a start up company about an open position as a video editor (mind you I never reached out to this company, but the hiring manager knew my resume because I applied at another media company that she used to work at, so she reached out). We never did a proper interview, just talks over the phone, twice in two weeks, about the position. She called me a few days ago and told me the pay would be 60k, which is more than what I currently make (the photography job is 40k but I do get a raise in a few months and the part time job is $23/hr). She wanted me to give a verbal agreement to the job offer right on the spot. I told her that I’m in the middle of another interview process (which is tru) and I would let them know ASAP. 

But after thinking it over I just feel in my gut that this job is not for me.

17csa06,Am I going to get fired?,"Info about me: I work as the sole internal IT person for a company with 30+ locations across the NE in the US. I troubleshoot around 500+ computers for over 1k employees company wide as well as manage our network and nearly any device with a plug.(printers, servers, phones, routers, switches, access points, firewalls, scanners, scales, cameras, etc). We do have an external IT company I work with but according to our contract, I am still the primary POC for anything IT related. 

Earlier this week, I was tasked with updating a specific software from our partner on over 50 computers on top of my normal duties which is already incredibly time consuming. I have nearly zero downtime and often can’t even take a break for lunch without falling behind. Today, I was forwarded an email from our partner by our CEO to ensure the devices were updated by the end of day. Whilst completing the task I was asked to do all while managing my other duties/calls, I was asked to reply back  to the email with an update by EOD. End of day comes and I finish updating the last computer so I reply all to the email and inform our partner that all computers at the three locations we have their software on have been updated, so all is good… or so I thought.

On my way home, I receive a call from my direct boss saying “you f**ked up….”. And then proceeds to tell me that our partner only knows about two of the three locations we have their product at. The last location is across the street from our main location so it is considered “one location” but the partner wants “everything under one roof” so disclosing another location to them was a massive screw up. I don’t know the details of the contract and didn’t know the one location was a secret but the fact that the CEO called my boss to tell me I fucked up makes me scared. 

Although it’d probably do them more harm than good by firing me after this, I can’t help but feel uneasy… I obviously won’t make a mistake like this again but also seems like bad business practice to not disclose where a partner’s product is.

17cqstr,Switch from Revenue to Expense Accounting - should I do it?,"
Background: I've been working as a Senior Revenue Accountant for the past 4.5 years at a Saas based tech startup (Started as a Staff Revenue Accountant and moved up to Senior Revenue Accountant last year). 

Recently, I was given the opportunity to make a lateral move to a Senior Accountant role on Expense Accounting side within my current company (I have never had expense accounting experience - I started off as an auditor at a public accounting firm and joined this tech firm in revenue, right after). I feel getting this experience will be give me the option to get a full view of the accounting cycle and will be a good resume builder (more so because I am not a CPA). The  senior manager on the expense team has offered me the lateral Senior Accounting role and believes in my potential. They’ve stated that I'd have the chance to move up to a managerial position by summer of next year - there is room for growth and scope for a promotion on this team. 

On the other hand, my current manager on the revenue side, who I’ve worked with for 4.5 years, also sees a path to a managerial role for me by the end of this year within my current team - so a faster promotion (& I could use a pay raise 😭). There is also room for growth and scope for a promotion on this team. 

Both teams, as they currently stand, are very lean teams and any change will cause a bit of an upheaval - so I’d like to be courteous and cognizant of how this will impact my manager and the staff person I work with if I do make the switch. 

Both are exciting opportunities, and I'm torn between them.

Here are my main questions:

1. **Objectively speaking, is it better to have experience as a Senior Revenue Accountant or a Senior Expense Accountant in the long run?** 

2. **Objectively speaking, which of the two paths is likely to be more financially rewarding in the long term?**

17cpwxx,Stuck in a (not) dead end job,"Here we are another Friday night wasted on junk food and Netflix. 

I lost my job on Wall St a few months ago. Banking is the kind of industry where you can't really even get an interview unless someone refers you so even though I have applied to 100+ jobs nothing is hitting. 

I hold multiple licenses and registrations in my field and I am a pretty competitive applicant - it is just a matter of time but banking moves slow. 

I am so tremendously broke its not even funny. Living with my mom is severely depressing. I have given up months worth of plans because I can't afford them and that breaks my heart because I am working full-time.

Here's the problem - I am working a commission based job rn. No pay unless I make sales. I made enough to pay off my bills for the year but I dont know when more money will be coming in. There are some big clients that MIGHT make a big move but also might not. No guarantee. Basically - I have no money but I also have no bills. I cant get a part-time job because I am under contract and would have to get it approved by my boss (I know, bullshit). I also can't leave the industry without losing my licenses. Getting a job here means being stuck in a city I hate where I don't know anyone I won't make enough to move out anytime soon if I do this. Staying means working a job I hate that I MIGHT be able to make enough to move out.

So the question is - do I leave the industry and work waitressing/retail type jobs (I will be infinitely happier short-term) or do I stay for potential high earnings (I mean we are talking 20k a month) that might not come.

For reference my first month was 11k but 2nd month is zero but I have some maybes.",Boring-Animator6384,1,1.0,0,1697848166,2023-10-21 00:29:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17cpwxx/stuck_in_a_not_dead_end_job/,10,2023
17cpuk0,Background check after interview,"Hi,  
  
I am (hopeful) that I'll get an offer letter for the firm I've been interviewing with. However, they conduct a background check and I semi lied about one of my employment dates, terminations & layoffs.  
  
Specifically, I was terminated at two of my previous roles that I input.  
  
I have a reference at my previous company that will vouch for me (non HR, direct manager), but how do background checks work? Am I screwed? I am not a felon.  
  
More importantly, am I just unhirable at this point despite (hopeful) personal growth? Will I just have to continue to lie about my reasons for leaving and hope that future employers don't check?

17cppef,"Im 29, after 10 years my career fell apart, I dont know what to do.","at one point I was possibly the youngest in my industry, worked countless hours never went on vacations, many times worked 7 days. until I ended up upsetting one of the industry's ""top guys"" by getting him fired for verbally abusing me for years(staff complained in waves about the way he was treating me) everyone in the industry knows the guy and now its basically impossible for me to find a job in my industry.

also forced to job hop a little to go from 40k to 85k. (people in my industry tend to stay several years earning trash wage for the amount of work)

some time ago a manager in another department told me that it seems im blacklisted from tons of companies(?) i didn't ask him more about it because i didnt believed him.

i know for a fact there is a shortage for people with my skills and cant find anything since January looks like they just slide my application when usually I would always at least get an interview.

this forced me to come back live with my parents, im rolling deeper and deeper in debt and everyone has high expectations of me since i worked tirelessly in my career since i also lived in extreme poverty as a kid.

i truly worked insanely hard, barely had any social life because i was following my dreams.

cant go too much into details about my industry since it would get rather specific and i dont want nobody seeing this and complicate my situation. (i also deleted all my social media even my LinkedIn)

all i can say is that it has to do with industrial machinery, warehousing and production management.

is there a way to figure out if previous employers are talking bad about me or something? if so, what can i do? i noticed all my previous employers use the ""work number"" system btw.

17cpn3t,"The days are ticking down to our big yearly event and no one has said a thing, what do I do?","I work for a very small company on a team of 10 or so, each year we have a big event with every company we work with that shows off what each of them are doing and allows for important one on one time with the big players. This of course is the CEO’s favorite thing we do on our team but definitely not the only thing. Usually we begin discussing it as a group in August and spend that time developing a theme and drafting an email to everyone that is sent out around this time. From there most of the responsibility of the event falls on myself and another coworker. I work to make sure everything is organized for it and he supervises it while it’s happening. 

My manager has never really known how to prioritize properly and that always leaves us scrambling at the last minute because we honestly can’t plan anything more in the future than that. It’s not entirely his fault but that’s a different conversation. Lately it’s been getting worse and with no discussions about the event, I’m getting worried. 

They always push us to make it bigger and better every year but my manager is the one making the promises and he doesn’t exactly understand what it takes on our end of things. I’ve been working with my coworker in private to see what we could do in the meantime but without those group discussions we can’t really go anywhere with it. We’ve brought it up to my manager a number of times and are constantly dismissed, even told to “work on more important things” so we settled with a whiteboard countdown showing how much time we actually have. For reference, despite starting in August it was still a rush to get things ready last year.

So that brings me to my dilemma, I absolutely do not want to sabotage the event but I can’t push to do something about it without getting dismissed. I want to allow them to come to their senses on their own but I know that’ll leave me with little to no time to do my responsibilities and it’ll fall on me if they aren’t done. What’s the next course of action here? How do I prevent them from doing this again next year?",Mythicalsmore,3,0.8100000023841858,2,1697847341,2023-10-21 00:15:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17cpn3t/the_days_are_ticking_down_to_our_big_yearly_event/,10,2023

17cpg0b,Deciding between two offers in Product/Project Mgmt - rlly need advice please!,"I need advice regarding a career choice I need to make. I graduated from engineering in May and after taking the summer off, I am job searching. My career interests lie in Project and Product Management.

I have been offered to return to Tesla as a Project Manager in automated cell manufacturing after completing a PM internship with them last year. I also have an offer for a Product Manager role at a previous startup I worked at as a Product Manager intern 2 years ago. I have tried to work out the PROS and CONS and have also consulted family and friends, but I still feel troubled. Important to note that both offers had similar salaries and benefits, so those are not huge factors

The PROS i see of working at Tesla are:
- Great brand recognition that would help with landing future jobs
- Established organization and set job responsibilities 
- High pressure/responsibility so a good opportunity for fast growth in a PM role 
CONS:
- Work life balance isn’t always great
- I don’t see myself doing more than 1-2 years here

The PROS I see of working at the startup:
- Strong product market fit with good company leadership, the founders have started other companies, two of which are unicorns, so my thoughts go toward equity and the satisfaction of contributing to building a successful company
- Multifunctional role where I would learn alot about product dev, management, and business
- More creative role with more flexibility and the chance to take initiative
- Great company culture and support, I was happy going to work here and the founders gave me lots of opportunities 
- I believe in the product, company vision, and founders
CONS
- Startups fails all the time
- If I were to leave, I feel my chances of landing another PM job are less good than if I had a Tesla PM job on my resume

I feel like my head is saying Tesla because it is a strong company and would be a great job to start my career while setting me up really well for future job prospects, but my gut is telling me to go back to the startup and build something really unique even if it is a risk.

I also have family and friends with drastically different views and that take either side, so this has only confused me more as to what the right decision is.

Overall, I feel conceited because I am fortunate to have two great options to chose from, but I am still feeling stressed about making the right decision to the point where I can’t sleep. I am hoping you can give me insight, experiences, or knowledge that could help give me more clarity.

17cnoid,Stay or Go,"Working a job for 5 years I really like. However hourly pay is below current market at $30_hr. Pretty laid back overall. They are on a salary freeze for past 10 years. I'm on call every other week for 7 days straight. And also have to work every other weekend. No 401k matching. No raise ever. Insurance is decent.

I applied to another facility nearby that offered 45/hr after some negotiation and $10,000 sign on. Bigger place, busier. I would take calls for a week every 6 weeks only.Thats way less calls. I would work only one weekend every other month..Insurance package is not great. Yes to 401k matching. Yes to Annual raises.

After doing the math, annual salary is really only $10,000 increase due to not taking as much call. BUT  that would take the call pressure of my shoulders. I'd have many weekends off in a row. As I'm typing this, an extra 10,000 plus more guaranteed free time on weekends seems like the better deal. 

I can take the new job and stay as a resource employee for the old one if I really wanted. If it sucks I'd be able to come back. It's Healthcare sector so it's not uncommon. Having a hard time making this choice as I do enjoy my current job but I also need to increase my value in my profession and be worth more.

17cn2h8,I have a job opertunity that will be detrimental to another job I have,"
I graduated in December 2022 and, for now, I'm working as an au pair. However, I'm not exactly thrilled with this job, primarily because I find the child I care for to be quite disrespectful, and my upbringing instilled a strong sense of discipline in me. At the moment, it's my primary source of income, and I make around R5,000 per month (in South African rand).

Simultaneously, I'm also involved as a camp counselor on a volunteer basis. This camp works year-round and serves children from less fortunate or bullied backgrounds. I genuinely enjoy this role and believe it's a valuable way to give back to the community.

Additionally, I'm in the process of training for a security company that operates in my community. The heads name is Gabriel. I'm currently in the volunteer department, but I have the option to transition into a paid role, which comes with a significantly higher salary ranging from R15,000 to R20,000 per month. What's more, some of my best friends were there before I ever joined the security company.

Here's where it gets complicated: Arun, the head of the camp, has issues with me working for the security company. The reason for this stems from a situation with my best friend, who also worked at the camp but decided to prioritize making money and joined the security company. Arun spoke negatively about my friend to Gabriel, which ultimately led to my friend leaving the camp after finding out.

This revelation has created a challenging dynamic. I've invested a lot of time and money into this camp, and now Arun is concerned that I'll follow the same path. What adds another layer to this situation is that the security company donates their services to the camp every December. Yet, Arun continues to speak negatively about the security company even though they have been generous with their contributions.

I have expressed my interest in working for the security company to Gabriel and warned them about potential lies they might hear from Arun. This way, I'm trying to protect my interests while being upfront about my intentions.

Despite Arun's reservations, I want to emphasize that I remain fully committed to the end-of-year summer camp, even if I choose to join the security company. I genuinely value the work we do with less fortunate kids, and I don't want Arun's negativity to deter me from continuing this important commitment.

I'm really torn between these options. The security job pays significantly better, but it may mean sacrificing my commitment to the camp's events throughout the year and then have Arun on my case about how I have to be more committed. On the other hand, staying with the au pair job could allow me to continue helping the less fortunate kids at the camp, but I'm growing increasingly unhappy with the way Arun treats people anyways and I already don’t really enjoy my job as an au pair.

17cmgmu,"Your thoughts, Chief of Staff role or Global Manager...","Hello,

I'd like to hear peoples thoughts on a current crossroads I am in right now. I am currently in a situation where I can choose between being a Global L&D Manager for a relatively small software company (around 200 employees worldwide) or become Chief of Staff to an IT executive in the organization I am currently a part of (around 170k employees worldwide). The ladder role reporting to the IT exec is fairly new, the exec hasn't been in the company for long (just about 4 months) and while I think it may be a great opportunity to have such visibility and insight in a large organization I am a little worried this guy hasn't been there for long and so if he leaves I may be laid off as well. So far, from what I've been told about this role, the person would be managing top priority projects focusing on making things happen.

This L&D Manager role would give me the opportunity to start a department from scratch, allowing me to shape up the strategy and career paths for all the roles in the company in the way that I see most appropriate and aligned with companies vision. If it goes well, I would end up having direct reports in different countries which I see as a plus for my professional experience. 

Compensation and benefits wise, the global L&D role pays a little bit less than the CoS role, but at this point money is not really a top priority for me, I am more interested in making a decision that will have a positive impact for my career and make my professional profile more appealing for future roles. I'd like to be in a senior leadership position within 5-8 years.

17ckiwf,Job or work advice?,"Hello, I’ve been unemployed nearly a month now. I’ve been applying to different places close by my house. Preferably within a 10 mi radius or less. Retail, restaurants, banks, even my local hospital. A store rejected me. 

Another store considered me and then they tried to call me. I tried to return their phone call, but it kept ringing until it hung up. The local hospital sent me a rejection letter earlier this week for a position I applied for. Weeks ago, I was on the phone with a clothing store. At the need of the phone call they said that they’d email me but they haven’t. Unless I’m not looking through my emails more closely? 

Other than that I’ve gotten no other responses from anywhere else I’ve been applying too. I’ve been indoors all day and I’m so depressed.

17ck6mr,Advice on transitioning from Accounting to Tech?,"Looking for any information on jumping from the accounting field to the tech field.

  
BACKGROUND / CONTEXT - I’m 23 years old. Graduated with a B.Sc. in Accounting in December of last year. During college I ended up moving to a Los Angeles and through a string of crazy events landed a job on a number of very popular traveling TV shows. For the past two years, my life has consisted of going to school for half of the year, and traveling with television shows for the other half.

  
After graduating in December, I traveled the world while working on TV shows for about 7 months. After returning home in July I realized that the lifestyle was keeping me far too disconnected from my family, friends, and overall life back home. To add to this, I was out of a job any time a show wasn’t filming, and was treated mostly as a glorified contractor (position had no real ‘benefits’, just offered wild perks).

  
Recently I decided to try something more secure in the spirit of my degree - Accounting. Unfortunately, because of my time spent traveling and working in TV, I (regrettably) never made time for an accounting internship while in college. I’m currently working my first accounting internship at a publicly traded company, and while it’s been going well so far, I just don’t see myself striving to push far in this career path.

  
Which brings me to now. I’m looking to make an early jump to a field I have far more interest in like tech - It’s faster paced, more interesting, and feels like it would compliment my skill set. I don’t know the first thing about coding, but I’m a social person who thrives in teams and loves to solve problems.  
Any advice? I’m obviously not going to be competing for any coding jobs, but I’m curious what kind of career paths are out there for social, team-driven business minds that like to work in a high-pressure environment like tech.

  
Thanks in advance!

  
TLDR; 23 y/o. living and working in Los Angeles as an accounting intern. Worked in the film industry for 2 years prior. No coding experience or knowledge. Looking to make the jump into the tech industry once internship ends. Advice?

17ck0do,I feel like I'm being exploited,"I ""work"" for a start up that has literally no funding, its very early stages. I was looking for experience after graduating college and got involved with The Company. The Founder is really great, and offered to teach me some pretty valuable skills if I could then do those tasks for The Company, as an internship/mentorship. Quickly, I'm taking on more and more responsibility, and now 8 months later I'm basically working for them 40+ hours a week, leading things, and even training new people. I was unpaid at first when I wasn't an asset at all, then I started to be paid a few hundred a month. It's almost worse now that I'm paid because I know at this point I'm adding a lot of value and I'm not getting what I'm worth.  
It's hard to set boundaries because the more work I do, the more opportunities to learn. I really am learning cool and useful things, and I really like what I do. The Founder has a lot of connections to notable people in my industry. I feel like if they had the funding to hire me full time, they would. If I was getting fairly compensated, this would be a pretty perfect situation.  
This job is pretty much exactly what I went to school for and am interested in. I've been taking an online course and trying to create a portfolio for a job similar to what i like, but more corporate. This was my plan A after graduating in august 2022. I'm applying for full time jobs and not getting anything, and know i need to improve my skills and portfolio, but dont have much time because of The Company.  
I love what I do and could see a future in it one day, but I know I'm getting taken advantage of and should put my attention to getting a ""real"" job. At what point does it get too pathetic?

17chytz,Is it honestly better to just let my boss have his way and float through the workdays without pushing my own opinions?,"Hi, all. Senior designer here. 

The most difficult thing about being in a creative role is that the work I do is highly subjective - it’s neither right or wrong, and comes with a ton of feedback. I either need to defend my ideas or swallow my pride - swallowing my pride is typically the easiest route, but then I end up work that I, personally, think is hot garbage.

My boss had my job before me. I am more experienced than my boss and my work is frequently lauded at my organization. 

After the multiple rounds of feedback, It feels like my every project just kind of morphs into his project and I’m unable to bring fresh ideas to the table. 

I take great pride in my work, and it feels like more than a career. It’s my life. It’s my art. But I’m burning out from constant feedback and seeing my best ideas get bulldozed every single day. 

Do I just kind of..let it go? Do I just listen to podcasts all day and do exactly what my boss would hypothetically do and keep the peace, at the detriment of my enjoyment for my job?

17cgh2p,Could REALLY use advice before work today,"One week ago, I was hired after my interview by a restaurant at a golf course. During my interview, I let the boss know that I have been in talks with a coffee shop opening in my town about working for them and that I would be finding out if I will be soon. We agreed I would go to part time once this happened. Fast forward a week later, I find out I got the job. So, I went to my boss and let them know that I was giving my two week notice of needing to reduce my hours as I got hired at the second job. However, she was not understanding and made me feel uncomfortable despite having agreed to this with me upon hiring me. She budged me to ask what they’re paying me, and then proceeded to tell me that she just turned another cook away because she hired me despite there only being two other cooks besides myself. I told her that I made sure to let her know this would be happening before she hired me for this reason as I didn’t want any issues to occur with scheduling. She then said if this is the case, that I have to come at 2PM on my workdays when my schedule changes in an annoyed tone which will not work with my new job most likely. She just said we could finish speaking about it the next day which is today and finished with saying that she doesn’t even think the place that hired me has gotten a health inspection yet and telling me how she doesn’t see how they’re going to even open, and basically just made me feel like crap despite how excited I am to branch out for the first time in my work life. Due to this, I am about 99% sure of putting in my two weeks notice of resignation after the way I was treated and made to feel despite having been there for only a week. Even before this, this boss makes incredibly rude and snarky comments to people around me and will very clearly ignore me when I tell her to have a good one as I leave. It sucks because this job pays well, but I already can tell she’s going to make it hell for me in regards to scheduling. Not to mention she is quite unprofessional in her manner at times.

17cemt6,Losing the will to live due to toxic job,"This is a throwaway account. I'm a 28F working in corporate. Previous to this job, I worked in 3 other fields. I've been at my current job for almost 1 year. In the beginning, I was so excited to join and finally felt like I could breathe a sigh of relief. I would be earning a livable wage for the first time in my life and be working in a field I actually wanted to be in. I was thrilled with the offer, despite feeling like my boss and I wouldn't be a good match during the interview process (which there was 6 over the span of 3 months... red flag). I do think I'm a decent judge of character and something about her seemed off, but I was desperate at the time living off of my savings with no income coming in. I saw this as an opportunity to improve my life and took it.  
Big mistake. I got to the office on first day and noticed right away that this was not the team for me.   
Here's everything that's been wrong since day 1:  
\- I signed an offer to work here with a certain title and role. Day 1 and I'm training for a completely different role. I followed up with my boss numerous times and she kept telling me I would eventually move into that role. At the 5 month mark, I pressed her for what was really going on and she told me another employee took that role; it was a bonus promotion since they were recently promoted but got this job also. Her response when I asked her why was I offered this position then? ""I wasn't thinking clearly. I needed more employees and you were a quick hire. You're just another number.""  
\- My manager has consistently humiliated and harassed me. She has put me on the spot for numerous things, called out my mistakes no matter how small to my boss, who then calls me into further meetings to unleash her wrath on me as ""concern for my not understanding."" They tell me to ask questions when I need help, so I do. And no one helps me. I got in trouble for asking other co-workers for help. My co-workers banded together and went to my boss to say I was disrupting them (I would ask maximum 3 questions to them a day). She told me I was only allowed to ask manager 1, 2, and 3. So I did. They all gave me different answers or told me to do different things, so all have grown increasingly dissatisfied and angry with me.  
\- My 3 managers have piled up extremely had projects on me. My other co-workers do not get these projects. Then I am blamed for why I'm asking questions or not getting things done fast enough. When I do ask for help, my main manager gives me the go-around so it takes me even more time to get something done. She refuses to give me clear answers and tells me to search for them myself - even though I have no way of knowing it! Which is why I asked in the first place. There have been numerous instances where I have pushed back and told her ok, then the work isn't going to get done until you give me what I need to complete it. That's when she backs down and admits she doesn't know and then tells me to contact someone in a different department to get the answer, or that she needs to meet with her manager to ask. If this gets put off to the side, she blames me for not reminding her that that's what she had to do.   
\- My manager often tells me that I'm incapable and slow, despite knowing my workload and the fact that her and the other 2 managers keep giving me insanely difficult projects.   
\- My work is often deleted by another co-worker/manager. The manager comes back to tell me I never did it. This happened more than once so I started saving proof. Once I showed the proof, this stopped happening. It has recently started happening with a different project.  
I have tried everything I can at this company. I've tried going to HR - not to complain about the things above, but simply to get help transferring to a different department under the guise of I'm looking for a different opportunity. I spoke to 3 different HR people - none helped. I think I might be blacklisted. I reached out to 4 other employees to learn about their jobs, but it went no where.  
My mental health is in shambles. I am working 50-60 hour weeks with a 2 hour commute each way, 3 days a week. Overtime is not paid past 40 hours.   
I've struggled with depression throughout my life, and although I was suicidal for the year before I landed this job, now more than ever I am extremely hopeless. My father passed away when I was young, so it's just my mom and I. We are very close, and she has a great career, but is older and will be retiring soon. She is extremely supportive and encourages me to leave this job. I'm afraid I can't - what would I do next?   
I'm an active volunteer at a local shelter and am considering going back to school to get my masters in social work. I've been volunteering regularly for the past several years and, aside from my mom, is one of the biggest reasons why I haven't taken my life yet. It is being there in that shelter that brings meaning into my life. I'm terrified of how this will look on my resume, with my work experience being so varied and random.   
I know I'm young, but I feel like a failure. I'm overtaken with grief that I don't have a stable career yet. I worry financially about how I'm going to take care of my mom. I'd love to get married one day but am not counting on it. Until then, it's just my mom and I. No additional family. We have suffered through so much together and I long to provide a good life for her, especially as she enters retirement and old age.   
I just don't know what to do. I'm glad I have enough saved where I'd be okay for a few months, but I'm really struggling with yet another failed job. At the same time my mental health is affecting me deeply. I've never in my life had issues with speaking, but now I do. I've distanced myself from friends. I don't want to do anything on the weekends. I'm crying every single day. I can't take the bullying and unrealistic demands.

17cdehu,How to approach an inflated job title?,"Hi all! Currently I have 2 and 1/2 yrs experience in my role (1 and 1/2 yrs with the current company.) My current title is “XXXX Specialist.” I have asked about a promotion to the next step up which is “XXXX Manager.” I asked about this in May due to us hiring more Managers and wanted to be considered for promotion. My supervisor stated they like the Managers to have at least 4-6 yrs of experience for consideration, but “we will work towards it.” 

My rub is that when working with clients on new projects I am always introduced to the client as a manager. I am the lead on projects and expected to fill in, as if a manager. I have asked current managers and other specialists what the difference between the roles are, and no one really seems to have an answer. My supervisor sent me a responsibilities list, but honestly they’re just reworded differently. While the managers list is longer, the specialist list states the same thing but in different verbiage. My supervisor said it’s a matter of “responsibility and accountability” but I’m not really sure what that means when I’m held to the same standard as managers… I will say Managers tend to receive much larger projects, but responsibility and accountability are the same on those projects. In May I actually took over a project for a manager who left the company. 

Sooo where do I go from here? I want to handle this professionally and tread lightly, but managers make about 10-15k more per year and it’s really upsetting me that I’m presented as a manager to clients.

17c8eq0,Feeling guilty for taking a new position,"I (26F) have been at a large company working as an engineer for 3 years. My team has been great and I love the people. I’m making 85k with a bonus and good benefits. I won’t get promoted again for another couple years. 2-3 days per week in the office with an hour commute. 

I accepted a role making 25% more doing project management at a related company (not a competitor). I really liked all the people that interviewed me and like the job. Its 4 days a week in the office with a 40 min commute. The benefits aren’t as good (less 401k match, insurance is a bit more), but on paper I still will take home significantly more even if I bump up my own retirement contribution to make up the difference.

It was a hard decision to make and I spent hours going over pros and cons. Eventually I decided to take it because it’ll allow me to grow a lot and have more money to spend on things I’ve been wanting to do but didn’t have the money for before (travel more, house renovations, saving up for a new car, saving more for retirement). 

FWIW, there’s also tons of turnover with other engineers at my company right now. All my work buddies have left or are actively looking for jobs which was also a concern. 

Anyway, keep feeling guilty and like I made the wrong decision. Is it normal to feel like that?",__usernotfound,2,1.0,6,1697799092,2023-10-20 10:51:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17c8eq0/feeling_guilty_for_taking_a_new_position/,10,2023

17c7ftz,"CEO agreed to speak at industry event, then cancelled: worth contacting again?","I organized a small event for people in my line of work and industry, and a recently-retired CEO in that industry agreed to speak.  Then two days before the event, the CEO cancelled, citing family being in town, unexpectedly.

Understood, as those kinds of things happen.  

I then saw that the CEO has some business interests that overlap with my line of work, and we could be mutually beneficial to each other.  

However, since the CEO cancelled the CEO's speech at the industry event 2 days before the event, 

1. Would you take that as the CEO saying, ""you're unimportant and don't ever bother me again""?
2. Or would you email the CEO and say, ""I see that we have some common business interests, so I'd be happy to do X, Y and Z if that's ever of interest to you""?

Offer A is with a multinational food & beverage company - diverse culture, 2 days WFH allowed, far office with 1.5 hr commute per trip (but WFH helps). Looks better on Resume, but industry isn't too exciting.

Offer B is a local medical device firm, listed company, no WFH, local management (more old school/conservative), some business travel may require, closer location with 45 min commute.

I'm leaning towards A for the WFH flexibility since I have a 2 year old. I also vibe with the culture more. But B pays around $650 more per month which is tempting. (Although more pay likely means more demanding).

17c446c,Should I negotiate pay,"Hello all,
I have a question so long story short I applied for a few positions I recieved an offer from one and am expecting an offer from another soon. 

Job A is my preferred job because it would allow me to travel but the pay will be likely 10k less. But  other than travel days I am guaranteed to be home at 5 and have every holiday off.

Job B is not my preferred place to work but pay's significantly better and the benefits are better as well as far as retirement goes. The main issue is it's a 24/7 365 so I may be required to work holidays and nights. Which is one of many reasons I've left my last profession.

Or I can stay at my current spot in life I make really good money, but I have no benefits and a horrible work life balance.

So my question is should I ask job A to match the pay of job B or should I just take the money from job B and call it a day.",OwlOld5861,1,1.0,6,1697781362,2023-10-20 05:56:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17c446c/should_i_negotiate_pay/,10,2023

17c3qnv,How to Recover from Workplace Betrayal?,"About a year ago my place of work hired its first dedicated human resources professional. We hit it off right away. I am an administrative assistant, and I was critical to helping the HR manager get up to speed (or so she said). I will call her Z.   
Z proved to be an ally. For example, she advocated for large raises for me based on my consistently excellent performance. She inspired me to return to college and finish my degree. I struggle with mental health issues, including seasons of depression that can sometimes lead me into dark and sometimes dangerous places. Z knew this and was very accommodating of my mental health needs. She claimed to have suffered from depression and she said that she was an empath.   
However, over the last two months, Z has changed. She began to pull me into her office and accuse me of various offenses. Her accusations came out of nowhere, and when I asked for examples of my allegedly offending behavior, she did not give any. Instead, she told me that the company had given me much grace, and if I didn’t shape up, all of my “privileges” would go away. Once again, I said I was confused, and I asked how I could improve if I didn’t know what I had done wrong. I am apparently on thin ice, and I am still not totally sure why. I talked to my direct supervisor, and she was just as confused. She thought Z’s accusations were totally baseless. I have not received negative feedback from any other managers or coworkers. I suspect Z has private and professional struggles that are boiling over. While I understand she is going through a rough time that does not entitle her to take it out on me.  
Thankfully, I will be starting a new job in a few weeks. However, Z wants to be friends after I leave the company. Frankly, I want to distance myself. I do not need that kind of unpredictable toxicity in my life.   
Though I am moving on, Z’s abrupt attitude change still hurts. How have you recovered and moved on from professional betrayals? ",AButterfly5488,0,0.5,0,1697779856,2023-10-20 05:30:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17c3qnv/how_to_recover_from_workplace_betrayal/,10,2023

17c2fm8,"Should we always use OOP, Service Repository Pattern, MediatR, Object Mapping, and Clean Architecture on our projects? - A question by my Junior Developer.","Good day everyone.

  
I'm a senior developer now, Actually, 2 years ago, I used OOP, and then I went into SOLID principles or Service Repository Pattern, and now I'm using MediatR and Object Mapping (Mapster) in my projects.  
  
Then I moved to a new company where they were transforming the IT department into a new modern one I was hired to be the lead developer for their projects. And then we hire a new junior developer.  
  
Now I teach him this thing, for OOP, SOLID, and Service Repository, I told him that this will apply the ""DRY or Do not repeat yourself"" and to make our codes cleaner, then I also teach him the MediatR.  
  
Then he asked me If we should use these things, as this would make him slow, actually is very fast when developing projects, but his code is not that clean, but our manager approved it because for him ""Output first"" or ""Projects should be delivered on time"" and he always finish the project ahead of the deadline (well he works on weekends, which I told him to take a rest, and he said, he always got bored). He told me that he has to create many classes and interfaces, that will increase the number of files on a project, especially on creating MediatR files.  
  
Well, for me, he's not wrong, too many files, and too many complexities, and for me now, I'm also doubting if I should use most of them, or if should I stick with OOP only. though MediatR can fix the problem of too many dependency injections, this will create additional files, especially if you are using it on bigger projects with a bigger database layer.  
  
Should I continue all of them or should I use OOP only?",ToTheAeons,0,0.5,0,1697775015,2023-10-20 04:10:15,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17c2fm8/should_we_always_use_oop_service_repository/,10,2023

I loved the first year of my degree. However a few aspects held me back, as well as being told that there was a major possibility i wouldnt get a job in this field, or i would end up working for a corporate company such and B&Q made me apprehensive, as well as a major change in circumstances meant i couldn’t go back to university

So here i am, working the hospital as a health care assistant, with the prostect of working as a nurse, but i don’t know if its for me (again!)

So I’m asking advice to see how people have been getting on with courses such as web development or UX/UI Design, as i feel these would be a good fit for me.  I’ve researched some courses I can study from home. Is there any recommendations on courses (possibly free?). How easy/possible is it to get a job? Is it a secure job with a good salary?

17c1nq2,Career path regret?,"This is my first post to Reddit! Looking for advice on what to do:
I graduated high school in 2017 and went away to college with no clue what I wanted to do. My senior year of high school, I took physics and LOVED it plus I was really good at it, but my parents convinced me that it wasn’t really what I wanted to do with my life. It was my first time dabbling in it and I hadn’t showed any interest in that field before (but I had also never been exposed to it). 
About 2 years into college, after taking foundations of physics, I started to seriously consider if this was what I wanted to do. At the time, I was majoring in psychology, but took some physics classes to see if there was any further interest….there was. I had great connections with my professors and really enjoyed engaging with them and overall dedicating my time to my physics classes. I even found myself researching topics outside of class and connecting with old friends who went on to be engineers. I had never showed the same interest in any other field/career path before. I took modern physics at the start of my junior year just to seal the deal and decided to major in the subject. 
I transferred schools to a university that had a better program and was closer to home. I figured I was going to have to take an extra year to make up for the time lost….this wasn’t the case. I was committed to this school and there was only one advisor for the physics program. I was really not the best at math, but I could do it when it was applied to physics. I was able to solve equations involving quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, and relativity- pretty advanced stuff. My previous professor from my prior school was surprised I had never even taken calculus. The advisor I was assigned to would not let me take any physics classes without taking at least calc 2. She made me a deal: if I got an A in calc 2, I could take calc 3 and foundation of physics 101 concurrently but in order to take calc 2, I had to take college algebra and calc 1 which were all prerequisites for each other. I was looking at 4-5 more years of school and at least 2 years before I could even touch a physics class. I had no general or liberal education requirements left so core classes were all I needed. 
I had previous professors write me letters of rec in order to try to convince this lady to let me take my physics and math classes at the same time (this lady wasn’t even in the physics field, she was a chemist and I have no idea why she was the chair of the physics department). She disregarded them and told me what I was going to have to do and that it would take 4-5 years as a part time student. I decided to bite the bullet and just do it (keep in mind, I was already 19-20ish at this time). 
Then the pandemic hit and classes were moved to online with no clear idea of when we were going to go back in person. I struggled tremendously trying to learn math online and teachers were just as confused on how to teach in an online environment. It was a shitty situation with nobody to blame. I ended up getting an A- in calc 2 and this woman wouldn’t accept that- the deal was I had to get an A. I was going to have take a whole other semester to get into a physics class. I decided to change majors. I had the credits towards a psychology degree that would transfer and I just couldn’t learn the math online. It was such a difficult decision which leads me to the reason behind my post.
I am now in a Master’s program pursuing a degree in counseling. While I like it a lot, it isn’t the same as physics. I felt like it was taken away from me and I’m going to regret the decision to leave my physics program for the rest of my life. I try to look at the positives of what surrounds me in my life now (my experiences, people I’ve met, accomplishments, etc) that wouldn’t exist without me quitting physics, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not doing what I love. 
What would you do? Do I go back to school again after I complete my masters in a completely different field? Are there any jobs available for people who don’t hold a degree in physics, but still have interest in the field (maybe certifications?)? Would any body be willing to share if they have had a similar experience? I’m interested to hear from people who are or might have been in a similar position!!!

Since I'm in my 3rd year, I have to choose a major in business or just graduate with a general business degree. I can't major in accounting or finance, which would be considered the most employable majors in business.

The last 2 options seem to be the worst and least employable, so between HR and marketing, what would be better?

17byb87,Do I follow up 3 weeks after interview? How to not sound desperate?,"I interviewed at the beginning of the month for a salary position (currently hourly labor) with my current employer and it went well. The hiring manager offered me a tour with one of her team members. I followed up and accepted the next day to schedule. The day of the tour, I received an email that I was not selected. I emailed the hiring manager from the parking lot asking for clarification and was told I am still under consideration, and she has multiple positions available and no need to apply since she already has my resume. Tour goes well (10/6) and I have yet to hear anything back. This is a large employer with 10k+ employees in this facility.

I currently work 2nd shift for shit pay compared to my coworkers and consequently feel like I only see my wife and kids on weekends, provided I’m not working OT. This manager is a huge advocate of work/life balance and the position is first shift and would be a decent pay bump. I’m VERY interested and excited but being in limbo is killing me, and I’m worried about sounding desperate.

17bxz43,How do you know if you’ve found your calling?,"I (30f) have been struggling my entire life to find a career that I would enjoy. Something that I would love to do. “Do something you love and you’ll never work a day in your life”. I have tried many different endeavors, each time feeling like “okay this is it. THIS is what I want to do.” But then it turns out to be a passing fancy. 

Currently I’m pursuing my degree in Communications, and I went with this degree for the sake of making it easier to find a decently paying job. However, over the last 6 months or so, I have developed a sudden interest in history. I want to change my degree to a history bachelors with the hope of pursuing a major in archaeology one day, but I don’t know if it’s actually what I want to do? Or if it’s just a passing fancy again (which would be REALLY disappointing.) 

I had a fascination with ancient Egypt early in life but it was crushed by shitty teachers and childhood trauma, so I may be rediscovering an interest from childhood. I really want to be able to understand the intricate workings of our history as people and how we went from caves and wall art to skyscrapers and smartphones. I want to know who did what and how it affected history. 

So I guess my question is: how do you know you’ve found your calling? How did you discover that one thing you love doing? 

I just don’t want to change my degree and halfway through discover that this isn’t the right path for me… so I’m looking for advice I guess lol

17bwrmh,Boss doesn’t make time to meet with me / send me the info I need to complete my daily tasks until late at night,"I started this job about a month ago, working remotely as an assistant at a 40-ish person agency. Lots of data entry and outreach to track our performance. It’s my first full time job. I work under one person, a co-founder, who’s last assistant left the company about a month before I was hired. Because of this, my boss had been operating solo, and now that I’m in the role, I need LOTS of emails / documents from him in order to get both us caught up. Once we are, I’ll then be able to handle a ton of these interactions on my own. However, my boss is seemingly so swamped currently that he has been sending me very few of the documents that I need. At this point, we have multiple clients asking us to send them info they need, but I can’t act on anything until my boss forwards me said info, which I’ve been asking for for days/weeks. I still feel new and overwhelmed. I do what I can with what I have during the day, but mostly I’m waiting for his responses so that I can finally move on from these tasks. He pretty much only meets with me around 6-6:30pm every day. I’ve accepted that I can’t schedule anything after work since many nights the meeting goes until 7:30. He asks that I hold on to any and all questions I have for him until this meeting. Many times I’m then expected to finish the task afterwards. I’m new to the workforce, but is this normal assistant stuff? I feel like I cant put my best foot forward if I’m not being given the necessary info/direction I need just to finish my day up. 

How do I bring this up with him in a way that doesn’t make me seem insubordinate. I still feel extremely lucky and grateful to have gotten this job. It’s in an industry I’m passionate about even though the pay isn’t good.",kobekobekobekob,1,1.0,0,1697757734,2023-10-19 23:22:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bwrmh/boss_doesnt_make_time_to_meet_with_me_send_me_the/,10,2023

17bvspx,Was I being a Karen asking HR to switch teams?,"


Please read fully before giving opinions, 28f and work in Financial Aid remotely for a school. I’ve been at the job almost 2 yrs, when I started they assigned me to a team where I had the same mgr & supervisor for most of the time I’ve been in the role. I got along with both, I noticed the supervisor tends to come across as micromanaging/hassling in a way when wanting updates & certain things done. I never complained but a yr later I did ask my mgr at the time if I should be wary of the supervisor being this way/is it implying if I’m not doing my job? And she said that the supervisor likes me, is known to be micromanage-y but things are going to change. She wasn’t kidding, after we got another supervisor so now the team had 2.

For about 1-2 months I was reassigned to the new supervisor’s team & for the whole time I was on his team I felt a lot more at ease. I thought first this was just  how mgmt is, that’s when I realized I don’t think feeling hassled is completely a job description thing, it’s more the other supervisor’s mgmt style. And after that, my mgr announced she was promoted to director & that our whole team will change. I was on a leave of absence for 3 months, hoped it would work itself out & of course with my bad luck the supervisor that micromanaged was promoted to mgr & now she’s my new mgr. 

The new supervisors on this new team are also more relaxed, I could be lying to myself but I wonder if other teams are like this with feeling as hassled, the job is a lot as is. My director is on maternity leave & I ended up reaching out to hr who said they’re looking into this. The hr reps & I will meet next week, I told them right off the bat I like my mgr & don’t want her to get in trouble but I was blunt too. They’re going to look to see if it’s possible, I wanted them to be honest & see the likelihood of it happening & he said he really isn’t sure, when they’ve done it before it was cause of EXTENUATING circumstances. I didn’t feel the need to talk about this with my mgr, considering she’s been at the company 10+ years & I’m assuming im one of the first formal concerns.

17bvpvj,"How do I tell my boss that I know my male coworker got a bigger raise than me last year, despite being newer than me (a female) and working on less projects, and I expect a bigger raise this year?","My male coworker got a larger raise than me last year. We discussed our pay. However, I took part and continue to take part in these massive, urgent projects that come up and require many hours of additional work. I’m someone people are constantly coming to for advice and help with their work and I took on an additional role in the company, along with my already very stressful IT role, to help out the company. I did not get a pay raise for this. And was hardly trained, which added additional stress to my workload. I work pretty long hours. I go on trips. I volunteer to cover for people that are on vacation despite rarely taking any myself. 

This male coworker plays video games while working, is often not even at home during the work day, takes plenty of vacation, doesn’t have a very good bedside manner, takes off right at 5 pm, and is very entitled. I understand there’s a whole psychology behind this and my boss likes to hire guys with machismo regardless of whether or not they are talented. I feel like I have to babysit and help all the guys he hires. But I’m one of the people he can really rely on and I know he doesn’t want to lose me.

17bv5yb,Stressed While Job Prospecting,"Good afternoon,

I am in a bit of a predicament. To word this question simply: ""What would you do if your current job was excessively stressful to the point where it affects your ability to effectively interview for new opportunities?""

I am in my mid 20's currently working within the construction industry. My specific area of this industry is in shambles due to COVID-19 and other factors regarding labor and supplies. I also work as a Realtor and have experience in almost every industry within the Real Estate Sector. I am a hard worker and have a solid background/experience/education. Unfortunately, the issue is that I am ethically conflicted with this role. It is a toxic environment (that I have somehow managed to perform well in) where there is no value placed on either the client or internal stakeholder, just the sale. I am looking for a new role where I can have a more positive impact on the lives of the people I serve. The big issue is that this position has seriously impacted my mental health and continues to do so. I feel I am not as sharp as I used to be. I have much more anxiety and in short... I am losing hope. I know this is affecting my performance in my job search. 

I have been told and have abided by the mantra of never leaving a job without having one lined up, as it is much easier to obtain a quality position in this way, but I dont know if it would be better to leave, heal, and continue fresh. 

What kind of effect will this have on my potential? I am a bit lost and just want to help people and feel good about my profession again. Thank you in advance for any advice and/or support. It means a lot. ",Emergency_Heron3047,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1697753384,2023-10-19 22:09:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bv5yb/stressed_while_job_prospecting/,10,2023
17bv5d5,"I Have No Degrees, No Skills, No Sense Of Direction But A Desire To Learn","Hello, everyone. So I (29M) recently posted in r/acting about how I had recently moved to LA from my home state and was losing interest in acting and having trouble supporting myself in this city. If you'd like to know more about the story behind that and what made me do such a thing then just check my profile and you'll see the post. I've since made the decision that it's best for me to go home and reevaluate my options, i.e., what sort of career path I'd like to follow in order to live a comfortable life while still being able to do the things I enjoy and travel a little, as I love traveling. As the title of this post specifies, I have no degree(s), no skill in a trade or anything like that and no direction, meaning I've reached the age of 29 without a goddamn clue as to what I wanna do with my life. 

All of the jobs I've had were either in restaurant, warehousing, food manufacturing or retail. I've job-hopped A LOT in an attempt to find something I enjoy, but I oftentimes end up quitting in order to find something that either pays more or that I think I'll enjoy more, but then I end up not investing much time at the job I'm currently at so every position I take just ends up feeling like a waste of time in the end. Not completely though, as I've gained some knowledge of those industries that I've worked in. 

My problem is that I've an interest in so many things that I don't know where to begin and I am afraid of possibly losing time if I were to pick the ""wrong"" career path, but I know I'm also wasting time just thinking about it every day. 

The things I enjoy about my previous jobs were having a sense of responsibility (when I worked in food manufacturing), having interaction with people/guests (retail and restaurant), and being able to work independently once I know my task (warehousing). I work well in a team or by myself, no preference. I've found these past few years that I have a natural desire to help people reach their goals, probably due to the fact that I myself haven't found what I feel I'm meant to do in life. In that realm I've always considered a career in HR or maybe something assisting immigrants in the U.S., as I really feel for the people who just want to live their lives as best they can when they come to this country. I also enjoy anything that allows me to be creative such as video editing or illustration, although I'd like to stay away from freelance work if I can avoid it. I just prefer something that provides a more steady flow of income. Teaching English as a second language (or teaching in general) was something I've considered since I love to write and I enjoy continuously learning about the subject. I've never been great at disciplining others (I'd rather let people do as they please, unless of course their actions hurts someone else). I have gotten praise from people under me whenever I was in a leader position at my previous jobs, so I guess I'm not a bad mentor? 

Sales is something I could never do, as I'm not the type to push people onto something if I can feel that they don't want it, similar to what I said about disciplining others; I'd rather let them be as long as it's not hurting anyone. Programming is something I had considered ever since I started to learn coding with Python. I enjoy figuring out how to code but goddamn is it confusing sometimes. I'm afraid of getting burnout on the more complicated days.

I'd like to take a second to mention I strongly considered the military from the age of 18 to 27, just a couple of years ago. I think it's a great option, I just don't know if it's for me. I've always had an innate opposition to authority figures and I don't like being told what to do, especially if someone phrases a command as NEEDING to be done, like ""you HAVE to do this."" My natural response is, ""I don't *have to* do anything, I do what I want so fuck you."" Not very mature, I know. With that being said, I'm actually very good at taking orders and will do as I'm told if I know I'm in a position that calls for being told what to do. Does that make sense? I may not like the order, but I'll follow it to the T. But the idea of travel, learning a new skill (I learn much, MUCH better hands-on), and the thought that I'm a good mentor makes me think I'd do well in the military. Plus, I enjoy staying in shape and take pride in my physical fitness. What held me back from joining all this time was a lack of support from my family and friends and some red tape because I had a history of asthma as a child and the Marines wanted proof it no longer affects me, which it doesn't. When I planned on marrying my then girlfriend I decided to not go into the military, but now I've no girlfriend, no obligations, and I don't give a fuck what my friends and family think anymore; I'm gonna do what I wanna do. I kind of regret not joining earlier... It's too late to go Marines as far as I'm aware (cut off age is 29 and I wouldn't pass boot camp before my 30th b-day,) but there're still the other branches. 

I know I don't want to stay in warehouse or ever step foot in another warehouse again unless it's part of an office job. Idk if programming would work out because despite the fact I enjoy coding, I'm pretty computer illiterate like the rest of my generation and am only good with the basics of a smartphone or laptop. So maybe coding and video editing aren't for me? What do I sound like I'd enjoy and excel at? I wouldn't mind working in hospitality again. I'd rather not do anything healthcare related with the exception of massage therapy, as I considered that straight out of high school and for a few years after. My long term goals are to have good benefits and be able to travel in my off time to see the world. I also feel like I should mention Vegas, as I have this romanticized view of the city and I enjoyed visiting there very much. I also like the desert landscape. I may want to make that my home someday but I'll think about that later. For now I need to focus on a career and stop fucking around. I'm ready to start my life.

Any and all input is appreciated and I'd be so grateful for some advice from you all.",NewLowsSameHighs,1,1.0,1,1697753340,2023-10-19 22:09:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bv5d5/i_have_no_degrees_no_skills_no_sense_of_direction/,10,2023

17buh7j,When would be a good time to switch jobs?,"22M with a BBA from UT and currently working as a Marketing Specialist in Austin, TX with 2 years experience prior to my current position (not including prior experience as an entrepreneur).

I've been working as a one-man marketing team for 6-7 months now managing various aspects of marketing (campaigns, tradeshows, marketing collateral, setting up and managing Hubspot CRM, etc.), coordinating with the sales department, assisting with general business, and leveraging photography, graphic design, and content creation. I'm currently making $50,000, which seems on the lower side given my experience and education at McCombs (one of the highest-rated undergrad business programs in the country). The average salary for my position in Austin is $76,226 according to [salary.com](https://salary.com). While I understand it wouldn't make sense for me to make this right now, I strongly feel I am worth $67-72k.

The problem is the company I work for is very small and a bit of a drive to get to. It is in the manufacturing industry, and our market for our products is rather niche. I don't receive any benefits whatsoever and work 8-5 in the office each day of the workweek. I don't feel very valued and the owners are pretty resistant to change or recommendations for better business or marketing strategies. The employees complain about the business strategy as well. While I am learning a lot by managing a marketing department alone, I ultimately don't see myself here longterm (let alone past a year) and do not see much potential for career or salary growth. It is not very enjoyable or rewarding compared to my prior marketing internships and I have a hard time relating to my coworkers who are 20+ years older than me.

That being said, I really want to look for a different job that pays me what I'm worth and can at least give me benefits lol. I'd prefer to have at least the ability to WFH for 2 days a week of my choice, but fully remote would be nice. So, when would be a good time to start looking for my next job in Austin? I'm thinking about leaving after a year so that I have 3 years of applicable marketing experience combined with my entrepreneurial experience as a professional photographer (5 years) and magician (13 years). I just wish to be somewhere where I enjoy working, feel like I belong, and have peers I can relate to. Thoughts? I imagine some may say I'm being unrealistic, especially given this economy (not too great for marketing right now), but I strongly feel this is attainable.

It’s interesting field I liked the courses but most of the courses were hard and rigorous esp math and science specific courses. Was considering working with kids or people with speech impediments or work from home jobs with the degree. And choose the career for stability and job security 

But I’m not passionate about it. My dreams and interests really are the arts (sketching/painting-considering becoming an art therapist), modeling, acting, content creation, influencer, cosmetologist or just becoming an entrepreneur and working for myself 

But my main point is as a black person do you feel you should be doing science or math based careers, for example doctor, lawyer, accounting, engineering, etc because some of us haven’t came from nothing or the simple fact of stereotypes such as black people are ghetto or come from the hood or good for nothing .

17btz0l,Programmer stuck in a bit of a bind,"Hello all, using a throwaway account since I'm not sure to what extent my boss is on Reddit. I am a programmer, I work in Ruby on Rails and have some experience with a few other languages (Go, PHP, JavaScript) and have been working at a small company in this role for around 10 years now (I'm in my mid 30s).

For a time, I've been going through some growth and I did enjoy the autonomy of being able to choose the technologies we use and whatnot, and was told that big things were coming (a lot of the tools I've been building have been with the goal of making the company significantly more efficient and able to handle a lot more business than presently).

The problem I'm starting to encounter is that these promises haven't really amounted to anything, and my last notable raise was in 2019 and obviously the cost of everything has gone up significantly since then. Because of changing requirements and because I'm now the only developer on the team, I haven't really ""finished"" any of the major projects I've set out to work on (they've either had to be abandoned due to poor project management, mistakes on my part, or whatever, or it's just incomplete due to lack of time).

It's getting to the point where I'm feeling very irritable about everything at work and I'm definitely noticing a lot of signs of burnout and I feel like the quality of my work has been suffering as a result so I've been seriously looking for other jobs for the past handful of months now (though I've never gotten to the interview round yet so I definitely need to work on my resume / cover letter, it'd seem).

Where it gets tricky is my boss can take things personally (my boss is the owner) and because I don't think they can't afford a real developer salary (at least I'm not getting paid one and it seems like money is tight) so I'm not counting on them for a reference, and a lot of my experience doesn't really lend itself to a more senior developer role so even though I've been learning programming, I don't have much experience managing others which is what I gather most of a senior developer role entails anyway.

For a time earlier this year I was considering changing careers for aviation (I've always dreamed of being a pilot and it's a major interest of mine) but me and my wife decided it's not going to be viable due to the constraints of being away too long and the amount of money I'd have to spend up front for training, etc. would certainly not help.

I guess I'm mostly asking to be pointed in the right direction. I've been getting pretty discouraged by the lack of response to any of my applications and it seems like I've kind of found myself at a dead end at my current company (not making enough money to build up a sufficient retirement, although we do have some savings).

I'd really appreciate any help or guidance. My post might be a bit hard to follow, sorry. Let me know if I need to clarify anything.",ThrowawayEmployee234,1,1.0,0,1697750370,2023-10-19 21:19:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17btz0l/programmer_stuck_in_a_bit_of_a_bind/,10,2023
17btx6y,Feeling lost,"So I'm at a cross roads in my life and I'm feeling a bit lost. Some information about myself.

I'm from Scotland and I studied music and graduated with a good mark. After working as a teacher and musician for a few years. I had this idea to move into TEFL and moved to Spain. 

I've been here since I've enjoyed my time but as I reach my 30s I crave home and I'm tired for the shitty pay of TEFL scraping by every month and realising there is no career growth and I keep seeing much older people working the same job as me getting same pay and I feel I should get out of TEFL sooner than later. 

I would like to move back to the UK I still have lots of close friends and I would like to be close to family aswell. but I feel totally unequipped to move into any sustainable career. 
While I was living ""the good life"" in Spain teaching English all of my close friends have developed careers bought property and started familys This feels totally unobtainable as I feel I have stayed static though i have developed skills in teaching and learned a new language I feel these skills make no difference in the UK.
  I don't want to move back and be a burden to my family while I figure things out. I think I should go to university again and do a masters degree. But I'm not sure where my skills are outside of teaching. I would like a job where I can work and try to buy a house and ""grown-up"" 

I would love if anyone has lived a similar path or if anyone could suggest some career paths that I could transition into my skills from university outside of music are based around digital marketing and education and I have become quite an experienced teacher of English.

17bsqxu,Should i take a step back?,"Hi everyone,

32 year old male in the UK. Mostly writing this to get my thoughts out but if anyone has some advice it would be much appreciated.

Im wondering whether I could take a temporary change in my career to gather myself without harming my future prospects. My current job is within the water environment industry. I have a masters degree, and 6 years experience. Ive been successful, got several promotions and have a great CV. However, As my role has become more senior, I’m being pushed more into a commercial/management role which is not my bag at all and I’m feeling quite exposed. My mental health is suffering as my job satisfaction is rapidly deteriorating.

My partner and I have been considering emigrating, and plan to do this next year. This has been planned for a while, and isn’t because of my current job issues. Im confident in getting a job in my field abroad, as demand is high.

My mental state has lead me to job searching for any other job under the sun in the interim. I’ve found one locally where it is within the same field, but not technical, no requirement for qualifications etc. Basically a data collection type role. Do the job, go home. Im considering applying to give myself a break from my current career and sort myself out. My question is would a one year self-demotion impact my future prospects? If I were to hypothetically get this less-skilled job, or any other job different to my current one, then a year later apply for a job similar to my current one but abroad to where the grass is greener**, would it reflect poorly to prospective employers? Would they question why I had stepped away from technical role and then want to restart my career? and if so, does taking a step back to manage stress and mental health reflect poorly? Other option is to suck it up and carry on until we emigrate, but that could potentially do even more damage!

Thanks in advance for reading and any advice you have on career breaks.

However, I am still new to the role and I joined 6 months ago. It’s an administration role in higher education, and I am currently experiencing my first time around the academic cycle with this University.

I have over a years experience of working in Higher Education, but never with a University like this. I understand that what’s happening is that I am in new situations, with a new workload that I haven’t handled before. Naturally, I am feeling anxious and stressed and overwhelmed because my brain is still reacting to change and at the pace things move in HE, there’s a lot of change all the time and it’s hard to track.

My manager did bring in a temp to provide support but to be frank, they’ve been unhelpful. I have colleagues who do help, but I feel everyone still has their own job to do and I’m responsible for my end, but I know I’m starting to panic a bit and it will lead to me making mistakes.

I want to talk to my manager about it, but I don’t want to make him worry more (he’s a bit burnt out himself), and I also don’t want to put my position in jeopardy. I don’t want to lose my job, I don’t want to do a bad job, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do to fix things at work right now.

I arrived in Scotland during the war and, within 1.5 years, managed to reach a B1 level in English. I also earned my Bachelor's degree in Journalism from a Ukrainian university. Since 2020, I've been working as a freelance reporter, contributing to newspapers, magazines, and online media. My skill set includes SMM, digital marketing, PR, photoreporting, and community development for non-profit organizations.  


I've been taking on freelance projects, but they haven't been particularly lucrative – my last one paid just £200 a few months ago. To make ends meet, I've also worked as a barista in coffee shops and as an administrator at the International School of English.I'm actively managing my social networks, networking with journalists, taking online courses, and continuously learning.

17bra59,Complicated situation with my toxic boss,"I really don't feel safe at work.

I took this job, purely because my boss promised me my dream job through her 'contacts', if I worked on a fixed contract for 1 year. (I knew someone who she'd done this for previously, so as the cool kids say, seemed legit).

I'd met my boss previously, and never really got a good vibe from her, but I thought to myself, it's only a year. A year of working for someone I got a bad vibe from, for my dream job. 

Except, that bad vibe turned out to be the the warning I should have heeded. My boss is toxic, unprofessional, manipulative, and seems to find a way to blame everyone else for her mistakes.

In august, I worked 19 days with 1 day off, mostly 12 hour days, and then she told us through some twisted logic, we owed her time. 

I'm starting to think she was so desperate to hire me, and gave me this incentive, because she can't hold staff. Three people have come and gone since I started 8 months ago. One of them only lasted one day.

This week, my boss has been picking on me. Telling me I have no common sense, telling me I'm not listening etc. Just being really rude and unprofessional. If I have a question, she gets very frustrated with me and tells me I have no common sense, that I 'better be writing this down' etc.

I understand if I've made a mistake she might be upset, but she has no idea how to manage people or give constructive feedback on what I could do better.

I want out. It's getting to the point where I throw up every morning, cry on my way to and from work... I've even started fantasizing about crashing my car to get some time off work. I've struggled with my mental health before, and I don't want to crash my car, but fuck anything to escape this hell. 

If I hand in my notice, I have to give a month's notice. Unless I leave without pay, but I really don't want to do that to my coworkers. 

My contract ends on December 15th, so there might not be much point. But I don't know if I can handle the next 8 weeks. I feel completely trapped. I hate my boss. I hate my job. 

Is there any way I can get time off for mental health reasons, without having to explain it to my boss? She's a 70 something old woman who doesn't believe in mental illness. Last time I was home sick, she called me begging me to come in, called me selfish and dramatic.",Upstairs-Course3026,1,1.0,2,1697743526,2023-10-19 19:25:26,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bra59/complicated_situation_with_my_toxic_boss/,10,2023

17bpmpg,"Absolutely bombed an interview for a job I am extremely well suited for, I have so much anxiety. (Recent Grad)","The first interview, which was a casual phone screening, went very well, the HR was very impressed with my experiences. The second interview was the next following day (back-to-back), with the SVPs. The interview was heavily based on the role and my experiences. However, I was very nervous and awkward and stuttering. The SVPs were understanding and nice about it though, told me there’s no right or wrong answer and this is not scripted. But I still totally blew on my answers by continue to stutter and ramble on and on. You know you can tell the interview is going great after every answer the managers would say ""yeah that's a great answer! Here at (company) we also do..."" …

However here, I can already tell I blew the interview when the SVPs seemed not impressed with my answers and said okay and would just move on to the next question.

After that second interview, I asked the HR to get the SVPs’ emails so I could send them follow up thank you notes, but she never responded until the next day today I got a rejection email from her, stating they moved on to another better candidate. Not only that, I also saw they reposted the job listing.

Does anyone have any tips on how to manage/plan when you have multiple interviews in a very short timespan? It makes me nervous that I may not be able to properly prepare for each one, and I’d appreciate any advice. So far what I’ve done before is read through the comapny website, reread the role responsibilites and refresh common questions, practice in front of the mirror, take notes, and go over that again. That’s a pretty exhaustive process though and idk how to do that in a time crunch.

Also, if anyone has tips on how to relax before an interview without feeling guilty, I’d appreciate those too. I’m a recent college graduate and I’m feeling absolutely crushed and devastated right now. I have been nonstop applying to job listings (200+) for 5 months and landed only 5 interview offers so far. The types of roles I’m looking for are based in entertainment industry (production assistant, video editor, social media assistant/manager, content creator, social content analyst, etc.). I guess I’m so used to doing formal interviews that this interview turned out to be more casual than I thought. Should I also look for something outside my industry or keep applying to every job you want, ESPECIALLY if I’m not qualified? 

TLDR: I applied to a company last week, got an HR interview that seemingly went well on Monday, got a second interview with 2 senior vice presidents yesterday, and got a rejection email about today stating they moved on to another candidate. The same day today, I saw they reposted the job listing.",gojonumber1fan,1,1.0,0,1697739273,2023-10-19 18:14:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bpmpg/absolutely_bombed_an_interview_for_a_job_i_am/,10,2023

My work experience involves an internship at a tea manufacturing company (creating packaging), about a year and a half at a food supplement company (where I did everything from packaging to social media posts, photo editing, web banners, etc.) and now tattooing, which also involves a lot of social media management, as well as customer service.

Everyone would say that advertisement is the most lucrative business within graphic design while I was in college, is that still true? And do I have any prospect for promotions without any substantial video editing or UX/UI experience? I'm willing to learn those things, but I can't afford to take on any more studies right now and companies aren't all that keen on training.

17bn24t,Laid off for the first time,"I was laid off for the first time in my life in a company wide restructuring affecting 800 employees. For context i'm 25 and was one month away from my 3 year anniversary at my past company. This was my first corporate job out of college and I feel like i'm never going to recover. I'm extremely frustrated as my boss had me complete many projects that were needed for the restructuring the weeks before the lay off occurred. My boss acted like nothing was wrong and never gave any signals that I was a bad performers. In fact, the months before we had discussed a promotion at the end of the year. I ended up receiving an email from HR saying I was laid off one morning and was locked out of my computer. My boss never even sent an email or text addressing this, which has just pissed me off more. I get layoffs had to happen, but just sweeping it under the rug and not even acknowledging the 3 years I worked for you?

  
The whole situation has caused insomnia and anxiety for me. I've been applying to 20+ jobs daily since receiving the layoff and haven't gotten a single call/email back. I know I shouldn't expect something immediately with the current job market. That being said, it's been disheartening to see 800 applicants already to a job posted 2 days ago. I know the timing couldn't be worse since corporate recruiting slows down in November/December for the holidays. I'm single and don't have any dependents. I have enough savings to last approximately 3 months. What would you do after a lay off? Would you get any job to get a job? Wait until the right one that is on par with my last job? I'm confused on what I should do next and feel like I can never trust a boss again...any advice/wisdom would also be appreciated ",b2night,19,1.0,16,1697732520,2023-10-19 16:22:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bn24t/laid_off_for_the_first_time/,10,2023

Potential gig: closer to 45 full busy hours a week, sales oriented in nature, very competitive environment at same company. Pay on average for the role is about double what I’m making. Same benefits, but taking PTO more penalizing since it is a production role.

The thing is that I don't know if I want to continue with this type of job because unfortunately I don't have paid holidays, health insurance, etc and while it's an ok salary, it takes a toll on my mental health and it's leaking through into my personal life (I teach adults mostly) and a toll in my pocket during long holiday periods (we're nearing summer holidays here).

She rapid fires off questions you can only answer if you are still online and wants them answered pronto.   


I have been at this job for less an a month and a half and I don't think she has ever not redone something I have produced. She redoes work products at night and then sends them in the morning her way. Things she has picked at me for in the last 48 hours alone:

&#x200B;

1. putting a space between years ( 2025 - 2026 instead of 2025-2026)
2. capitalizing the word City when referencing a real city - she doesn't like it
3. using the =+ formula in excel instead of sum (I was trying to avoid refs) because she likes only sum

I have probed a bit with colleagues about this in a very nonchalant way and they all state that she is harsh but its just how she is.

I am so disheartened and I feel sad every morning and anxious about what I did wrong the day before. My first day she even said ""I don't do birthdays and I don't use greetings in email- I am not friendly"". This is the exact opposite of me and what I thought I was getting into.

[Background]

I'm [29F/single] currently working for a major fortune 500 corporate as an engineer. 

I recently won a prestigious engineering award for the work that my team and I have been working on. Our work was briefed and received extremely well feedback, not just at corporate CEO, but also at the congressional and presidential level. It was hailed as a game changer not just within the corporate, but also the entire industry. We litterally changed the direction of the biggest DoD program in history within 1 year from white board concept to working products.


Where I'm right now, I'm very well respected among executive and have a long future ahead with this company. 


Unfortunately, working for a big corporate with rigid HR policy and strict government regulation, I could only fast track my career up to a point. 



[Current situation]
Recently my director/manager whom I have formed a deep bond with just accepted a new role as a VP for a struggling startup with 250 people. I talked to her and she happy to take me with her.

- The company has a market capital of just around $100mil+ evaluation, which is around the same size as my current directorate. 

- My director has a reputation of being able to turn several failed program/directorate around. 

- The ceo of the company was asked to step down by the stockholders due to internal mismanagement, the lack of proper process, the infrastructure to scale to enable faster turnaround of the product. These issues are something that my director and me are well suited to fix.

- I like to bet on the person, not just some random organization. My director and I has formed an understanding of each other, where she can communicate by just looking non verbally. She is someone with a great vision, and I'm very good at architect that vision for her.

- Knowing her, she would never leave a big corporate for a small company, unless there is something bigger being talked behind the scene. Although it is still a speculate on my part, I have a feeling that she will be named as the next CEO. But there is also a very high chance that I'm completely wrong here. This isn't something that I have experience in

- That being said, while I know she's fully capable of turning the ship around, but startup world is extremely brutal and volatile. There is a real possibility that the company will go belly up in the near future. It rather makes me feel uneasy since I have used to the comfortable of safety net working for a big corp.",yellow_smurf10,2,0.7599999904632568,5,1697727624,2023-10-19 15:00:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bl780/is_it_ever_a_good_idea_to_leave_a_comfortable_job/,10,2023

17bkfjh,Unpopular Opinion: Lost your job? Find a shitty one and commit to it.,"Hey there, job seekers. I'm here to drop some tough love career advice, so brace yourselves. The job market is brutal, and let's face it, it's not the same as it used to be. If you've lost your job, you're in a tough spot. Unemployment is perceived as a huge risk by potential employers; fair or unfair, you've got to reset your expectations if you want to get back on your feet. I recently went through this and have now accepted a shitty job, and wanted to share some advice for those of you going through it now. Here are some bitter pills you'll have to swallow:

**Pay:** Forget about making what you used to. The market has changed and you should be prepared to accept the going rate for whatever field you're in, which in many cases is 50-70% lower than pre-pandemic. You might also have to accept lower pay to compensate for the perceived risk of being jobless. It's not fair, but it's reality.

**Title and Responsibilities:** You might have to take a step back. Be prepared to accept a job with less prestige and responsibility than what you're used to.

**Micromanagement:** Companies are wary of hiring the unemployed. You can expect a high degree of micromanagement in your new gig as they may have a hard time *trusting* you. After all, *in their eyes*, if you could be trusted then someone else would be employing you already.

**Vacation/PTO:** You won't get as much as you used to. Some companies might not even offer any at all. Be ready to sacrifice your leisure time. My new company has an ""unlimited"" PTO policy but in practice, ""we don't really like to take vacations around here because we're a family."" My passport expires in 2024, and I plan to allow it to expire, even knowing that re-applying will be next to impossible amid staffing shortages at the State Dept.

**Remote Work:** If you've been working from home, mentally prepare yourself commute to the office, maybe even five days a week. No more pajama-clad meetings.

**Strict Attendance Policies:** Your new job might have stricter attendance policies than you're accustomed to. No more calling in sick on a whim. The baby boomer advice of ""15 minutes early is on-time, and on-time is late"" is fashionable again. I went from basically setting my own schedule to getting ""demerits"" for being 30 seconds late.

Instead of chasing those ""unicorn"" jobs, it's time to embrace the ""shitty job"" as the new normal. I get it; it's not your dream job, but sometimes you've got to make sacrifices to survive in this job market. The good jobs are never coming back because why would anyone ever leave that? And even if they did come back, when 10,000 people apply to one single opening, probably 3,000 are going to be those who are already employed. Guess who is getting culled to thin the applicant pool?

Recent wisdom says to take the first job that comes your way and keep searching quietly. I'm here to tell you that this is an unethical approach, and the trend of job hopping is ""uncool"" again. The company invested time and money in recruiting and training you. You owe them 3-5 years of loyalty, no matter how terrible the job may be. They took a risk on you, so you need to pay them back by going above and beyond, doing extra, and showing unwavering loyalty. If not out of some intrinsic sense of ethics, do this for your resume; there was a while where job hopping became an accepted norm, but now it's trendy again for potential employers in the future to question a short stint to the Nth degree.

Many employers now even require a one-sided commitment to a number of years if hired. My shitty employer asked for a verbal 5 year commitment. While legally it would be unenforceable in my state, I'm still planning to see it through; being laid off was a huge hit to my professional reputation and I can't afford to stain it further.

Losing your job is supposed to be a punishment of sorts. Take this time in your new, not-so-great job to reflect on why you lost your previous one; even if it was a layoff, it's likely you could have done more to add value and prevent that. It's tough love, but sometimes, it's what we need to hear. For me, this is all I do - replay situations in my head from my previous job where I didn't step up to the plate and go above & beyond.

No silver linings here, just the hard truth. Suck it up, take that ""shitty job,"" and commit to it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.",BluejayAppropriate35,0,0.2199999988079071,22,1697725571,2023-10-19 14:26:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bkfjh/unpopular_opinion_lost_your_job_find_a_shitty_one/,10,2023
17bk621,Transitioning from Architecture/3D Visualization to UI/UX or Data Analysis: Seeking Advice,"Hello everyone!

I’m navigating through a career crossroad and could really use some perspectives from this community. Here’s a bit about my journey:

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Architecture and Interior Design from Düsseldorf, Germany. Post-graduation, I worked with two architectural firms, and eventually moved to Berlin to continue as an architect. In Berlin, I worked independently on numerous projects, handling everything from construction supervision to project management and 3D visualizations.

Life took a beautiful turn when I met my now-wife in Berlin, sparking a desire in us to travel the world. Post my architectural stint, I transitioned into freelancing as a 3D visualizer. Freelancing started strong but gradually, the project flow reduced and a year in, the allure faded. The demanding hours (60 to 80 per week) made me yearn for a better work-life balance.

This led me to contemplate a shift into UI/UX Design or Data Analysis—fields that seemingly offer a blend of creativity, tech-savviness, and the potential for remote work. I’m tech-adept, enjoy learning new programs, and thrive in collaborative settings. However, I lack the fundamental programming skills for Data Analysis or the niche expertise for UX Design.

I’ve dipped my toes into Data Analysis by completing three short courses and found the subject intriguing. I love statistics, math, and data visualization which makes this field quite appealing. Yet, the path ahead seems a bit murky. The plethora of online boot camps and contrasting opinions on the viability of transitioning without a relevant degree have left me bewildered.

So here I am, reaching out to you all:

	1.	Has anyone here transitioned from a seemingly unrelated field into UI/UX Design or Data Analysis? What was your experience like?
	2.	How do employers view boot camp certifications versus traditional education in these fields?
	3.	Given my background and skills, what would be a reasonable pathway to tread towards Data Analysis or UX Design?

17bjds3,"I am 30 years old and have some basic experience in IT - I am looking for guidance on where to go, what to study, where to start?","Hi everyone! If you spent your time to read my post I thank you a lot. I am seeking for career advice.  
I am 30 years old and eager to start to learn something new, something serious this time. I have a job, as an IT engineer in one small company, and I feel like I am not learning anything and getting dumber and dumber day by day. I need to start to change something ASAP. That is why I am looking for someoone who can give me an advice based on their own experience. I have a feeling like I am too late for anything.  
Good start and a good foundation is the most important construction for further improving yourself. If I now decide to study something that may become obsolete or something that will fail, it means that I have wasted time that I really don't have anymore.  
I feel like I'm late and like it's over with learning a profession for me and looking for a new job.  
I have a solid job that makes me dumber and dumber, I have some basic experience with networking, computers, and such things. I had some certs before. I am aware of bunch of vendors like Cisco, Aruba, Ruckus, Allied Telesis, Sophos, Mikrotik etc.  
 I also can study it, I don't love it that much though. I'm afraid I won't find a job as a network engineer that will give me good salary in my country at this point. But again, it is highly possible that I am dead wrong because networking is a huge aspect - you can be your own ISP, mount IP cameras, try to become a cyber security expert etc.  
I'm thinking of switching to programming-coding. But then again which language should I start learning? And is it too late for me at 30 to start learning programming? Will anyone hire me at 31-32?  
Where do I have better chances - networking or programming. I think that coding is better because I can work remotely in addition to this job I'm currently doing.  
Or should I study to be a system engineer?  
I am completely confused, in chaos, I don't know where to start. Any advice is more than welcome!",middlemangv,8,0.7599999904632568,1,1697722767,2023-10-19 13:39:27,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bjds3/i_am_30_years_old_and_have_some_basic_experience/,10,2023
17bjakh,English Language Teaching Bachelors - What can I do with this degree realistically?,"Hi. I've graduated from ELT 2 years ago, and I wish to go to the EU while optimizing my time wasted. I am on a crossroads on whether i should take advantage of my bachelors degree somehow and build on it, or change into another career.

&#x200B;

I don't believe that my degree holds much merit in getting a job with a visa sponsorship in Europe unlike tech, which is what I am trying to branch into right now with a masters in Management Information Systems right now. I kind of like the department. I know it's not CS, but it seems relevant enough to slide into tech at a later time, maybe even go into EU somehow as I will be within academic networking range. What worries me is the time and if my country will get worse and worse and harder and harder to get out of in due time. This'll take at minimum 3 years to do.

&#x200B;

My family can support me a bit if I were to go abroad, which I was weighting the option of as well, however, I feel like it'd be quite a waste of time to study for another bachelor's degree, especially because I don't really have good math skills for something like CS. And I am unsure how reliable it would be to do a masters on my own department abroad and continue that way. It feels like the safest bet, but lots of questions remain in my head, for example, what else can I do with a linguistics (or similar road that follows ELT) masters? Surely there must be work that's more than an english teacher that I could get into reliably.

&#x200B;

Currently I am looking for second opinions and other directions I could follow. I kind of regret studying ELT, as it seems like a foolish endeavor for me to sit around for 8 hours while i can code away or do something in front of a computer. But I am absolutely willing to go to the EU and teach, if only it was so simple.",Slivereen1,1,1.0,0,1697722520,2023-10-19 13:35:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bjakh/english_language_teaching_bachelors_what_can_i_do/,10,2023

In July i had to quit my job, because of health reasons. I had to come abroad, to my home country for treatment and my previous employer wouldnt allow work from abroad. Which lasted much longer than expected. Nothing major, i just had osteomyelitis on my foot, and docs have proposed to me to not walk a lot for the next few months, i had my toenails removed too, so i cant wear tight shoes etc. Now, i had a good offer from the country i reside at to start next week, i rent a flat there so...i pay monthly rent, but..at first they told me its ok to work from home for the first 2 months. Today, before signing the final contract,i reached out to HR and told them that its difficult to commute for the first few weeks, but they told me the policy is 2 days per week at the office. I explained (fr the 10th time) the situation, and the distance and all, but they said they cant make any exemption.

What do i do? The work is 13 stops on the subway and 20 minutes walk.

17bgtbp,Put on a pip—fmla or ask for severance?,"To make a long story short I’ve been put on a pip. It’s warranted— many of the criticisms are problems/struggles I’ve had with the job. When I started at the company I was in a different role (the one I applied for) and last December they told me the position was going away and that I had two choices—I could resign and get a severance package or take a new role that they wanted me to take on that I was not qualified or experienced to do. I didn’t feel confident about the role, but I wanted to keep my job.

I’ve not been good at this role (mainly the project management aspect). And I never got training or proper support to really help me with the aspects of the job that I did not have experience in.

I also have had some mental health issues and family issues that I’ve been dealing with. I don’t think the job or company is a good fit for me at this point. 

They told me to take some time to read over the expectations outlined in the pip and then let them know if I can do them or to let them know if I don’t think I’m a good fit for the role(which I’m guessing means resigning.)

This is triggered a severe response from me in terms of my mental health and I’ve talked with both my counselor and my psychiatrist and they have agreed to help me take an immediate FMLA and short term disability for mental health purposes. (I would then look for a job during those 6-8 weeks)

My question is should I do that or should I just let them know that I don’t think I can be successful in this role—and would that mean severance? Or by admitting this would it be quitting and not getting anything?",Dense-Release-5460,6,0.800000011920929,9,1697714505,2023-10-19 11:21:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17bgtbp/put_on_a_pipfmla_or_ask_for_severance/,10,2023

So I just finished a video interview for a website admin role and I think it went great! The next step would be an in person interview sometime next week.

The only thing is that I don't know what to expect! A lot of the job scope requires HTML/CSS knowledge (which I'm comfortable with and have it on my resume) but I haven't coded in a while, and I'm worried it will show in the in person interview. The interview today had coding questions but nothing too specific about it, just how would I approach xyz and what languages and experience I have.

They want someone to become proficient in a new website platform, so that's why I have some hope that it's ok I don't know 'everything' because they said they are learning too.

Base salary: $120k

Bonus: 10%

Equity: ESPP (purchase company stock at 30% discount of the next six month's average price but can only sell it after 3 years), 401k matching at 6%

Travel: none

Commute: 20-25 min each way

5 days a week onsite, EV chargers onsite provided (free charging for my car)

&#x200B;

New job offer (start up)

Base salary: $145k

Bonus: offer letter specifies $14,500 but not sure if this is a fixed number or always 10% of base

Equity: 5000 stocks (company is pre-IPO so no idea if this is good)

Travel: will need to travel 1 week out of every 1.5 to 2 months to a vendor site an hour away by flight.

Commute: 50 min to an hour and 10 min each way

4 days a week onsite, no EV chargers so I would have to cover this cost myself and charge on my own time (if using Tesla Superchargers probably will charge about 3 times a week, I'm guessing roughly $250 a month if including weekend driving)

The new job definitely seems more exciting as far as the work and people go but the current job is closer, more stable since it's a big company, more predictable day to day work, and I get more flexibility (I can usually head home after lunch whenever I want without consequence). I'm guessing at the start up I will never get that flexibility since there are only 50-70 people working and everyone needs to be present and accounted for unlike at a big company where I have many team members and people cover for others. Not to mention the 1 hour commute, I will never get home with that kind of commute before 5pm as opposed to my current job where I get home by 3pm on regular days (or anywhere from 12pm-2pm if I choose to leave early and continue the day WFH).

17b9nte,Im a 26 (F) TORN between two majors….I don’t want to make a mistake I’ll regret,"Hi all!

I am a 26 female currently taking my generals at a community college. My first initial interest was marketing, and I planned on majoring in it. 

I took a year off of school due to significant life changes, and I’m now back this year. During my time off, I started a new job as a recruiter and I’m currently now an HR coordinator. 

After working in HR, I decided that majoring in Human Resources would be more “realistic” and would allow me to land a job quicker,  since marketing is a very competitive job. 

Now, I’m having second thoughts. I still have interest in marketing, I consider myself to be very created and dream of having a job in advertisement. After digging deeper into my personality and skills, I now am considering marketing instead.

I don’t want to make the wrong choice. I know this is more of a personal issue, but what would you advise? I feel like a career in HR sounds more practical for me, but marketing is what I really want and what I’m passionate about. 

I will consider any advise. :)",fryeesaucee,1,1.0,5,1697686476,2023-10-19 03:34:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b9nte/im_a_26_f_torn_between_two_majorsi_dont_want_to/,10,2023

I am the only one in my district who does my job and I have both routes for tomorrow already, so any changes that need to be made either won’t be or are going to have to be made by me tomorrow night.
Does anyone have this feeling? What should I do?",duckhunter5556,1,1.0,0,1697686388,2023-10-19 03:33:08,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b9msb/pto_anxiety/,10,2023
17b96ki,Landed a great job at an amazing company…. So why am I feeling like this? Help!,"I took a job at a company I’ve been trying to get into for over 4 years. Aced my interviews, have great relationship with the owner. Been there about 3 weeks now… but something just isn’t right. 

Im afraid Im not hitting the mark at my first 3 weeks on the job. I feel as though my manager was a lot warmer of a person during our interview, but now that Im on the job and asking questions and reaffirming processes of certain tasks, he seems to be annoyed with me. I might be taking this entirely wrong, but I see him interact with other staff (Im the newest so nothing to compare to in that regards) and he seems much warmer and open with them. He rarely asks how my weekend was, if Im doing ok with stuff, etc. On the other end, we have been having daily meetings to review tasks and he hasn’t said Im missing the mark yet. He stated himself it took 6-12 month before he understood this role. Still though, I feel as though he is annoyed when I ask him to review something Ive gone over a few times already. Ive had people say Its normal to review things multiple times, even with taking notes. However I feel self conscious about asking him to review something a 5th, 6th, or 7th time and his lack of compassion or verbalizing that thats fine, makes me feel like he is becoming annoyed at my constant need to review these processes. 
Could this be an issue of me being overly self conscious about a new job, or is it entirely possible that my new boss is seeing signs in me within the first 3 weeks that have formed his opinion that Im possibly not the right fit or what he had in mind? He told me in the first week that in regards to the person Im replacing, he knew on the first day that they weren’t a good fit. They let them go after  2-3 months, so even though he allegedly knew on day one… he let them remain on the team for a few months. This concerns me, as I begin to wonder if he has already formed an opinion of me, but is allowing me to remain on the job for long enough to let me go without seeming like they are impatient. 

Am I thinking into this too much? How can I calm these feelings? For reference, I had these same feelings in my last job, however they subsided about 75% by about 6 months in. However my last role was not nearly as technical.

I think in gross, not receiving positive feedback or hearing “You’re doing good” has me concerned. I dont need to have my ego stroked, and to be fair I don’t think my boss is an overly energetic or social person at work, but I’m concerned. 

I don’t want to outright ask him if my concerns are valid, as that will seem as though I’m lacking in confidence. However when I ask him if I’m hitting the mark for 3 weeks, he gives vague answers. I so badly would rather him say “No, you’re not hitting the mark” or “Yea man, you’re new and you’re over thinking things. Just relax and absorb as much as you can, and ask me as many questions as you want” but instead he just gives very general answers. 

Am I over thinking this or are my concerns valid?",bahrough,2,1.0,0,1697685011,2023-10-19 03:10:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b96ki/landed_a_great_job_at_an_amazing_company_so_why/,10,2023
17b8gy3,Career,"I'm ruby, I'm a 19 year old transgender woman from new Zealand, basically i have autism and because of that, i never got a proper high school education, they stuffed me in a special needs class that we dont even get credits for, i got work you would expect an 8 year old to get and this was work i got 13-17 years old, i would constantly leave class or practice music because i saw no point in sitting in a class i got nothing out of.. i only got high school education in the creative subjects like art and music, i ended up dropping out and doing a music course that got me a qualification in well.. music  


now the question is: is it too late for me? all my life my career goal has been to care for animals and not necessarily a vet as much as id love to be one, but more along the role of a zoo keeper, caring for animals directly..  
whether its in a zoo, or a rehabilitation place, id love to work with the cats and dogs, to monkeys and lions  
i have recieved quite a scare from some people that i may need to redo high school and do biology, animal behaviorism and english but i feel i could do that via courses.  
i know i sound ridiculous being 19 and asking this but im scared  because i fear il be 30-40 by the time i get to do this and ive seen people under 25 doing these jobs   


is it too late? should i follow my animal passion or leave it and stick with my secondary career in the creative industry?   
what kind of qualifications/courses should i need to go for?, i cant mentally do full time work right now and im fine looking at part time, this is kinda a plus, because i want to have space for study, i have applied for spca (an animal welfare company in new zealand, stands for society of the prevention of cruelty to animals)   
its voluntary, theres also a small zoo that i could apply to volunteer at and i think some give qualifications..  


sorry if this was alot to read or understand- please ask any questions, but id love some advice, im planning on moving to aus some time in  the near future so i should get better odds being a country full of animals id love to work with.. such as snakes :))",reubel,0,0.33000001311302185,0,1697682840,2023-10-19 02:34:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b8gy3/career/,10,2023

It isn’t really to make the coin decide for you, but because for the split second the coin is rotating in the air, you will subconsciously pick what you want it to land on. Obviously I could actually flip a coin here… but I figure once I post this, I will have a hope to hear the feedback in a certain direction. 

Here’s is the rant (it’s for me, not you):

For the past two years I(24M) have been working as an assistant project manager for a commercial remodel GC. I was fortunate to have even been asked to interview for this job. I am a college drop out who was working for as an apprentice plumber. Some of the GC’s saw my work ethic and invited me to interview for a superintendent job, so I did. The interviewer there then invited me to interview for their commercial department. So I did. By some miracle I got the job. I have been very grateful for this job.

As grateful as I am, things are not perfect here. The offer that they made was slightly more then I was making at plumbing. At the time I was stoked to be making more money with the potential of making lot’s of more money down the road. Here is the kicker, going from hourly to salary. At the time I was comparing 40 hours of plumbing to the salary. Almost immediately starting the APM job I have worked 50 hours or more a week. 10 hour days are the standard mon-fri, and usually more to make sure I am on top of all my jobs. That being said, If I would have worked 50+ hours a week plumbing, I would have made more money. This job does have potential for me to make more money, especially once I become a PM (hopefully in Feb 2024). 

50-60 hours a week has taken a toll on my social, physical, and mental health. I used to be an avid gym goer, 5 times a week. Since starting this job, I maybe get 1 workout a week. Also since getting this job I have started to experience anxiety for the first time in my life. In HS I used to make jokes about anxiousness and that it is all in your head, I was dead wrong. I often go home after 10-12 hour days sick to my stomach about the amount of work I have to do the next day/just worried about the progress of my jobs. 

Here is the real dilemma:

I recently was approached by a residential remodel company. They offered me a job working with them as a superintendent, with potential of promotion. They are looking into starting more commercial work and would have me superintend most of the time, then PM the few commercial jobs. Eventually they want me to be on commercial PM jobs full time. They have not yet sent me an official # yet (they are waiting to hear back from me). But have suggested around what I am making now + 1% of the profit on the jobs I PM. That would be ALOT more than I make now. But that is not guaranteed, it might be a hot minute before I PM anything with them. Downsides are the unknown, not knowing if the grass is greener. My current company has given me a company car, this company is a newer startup and does not offer that. 

I feel bad because the company I currently work with has been the one that gave me this great opportunity without any college degree. I feel like I have a loyalty to them. But I definitely feel overworked here. Even my boss has made jokes, saying things like “really we should have two or even three APM’s for the amount of projects you are on”. 

Would it be messed up for me to get an official # offer from this new company to use as leverage with the current company? I know if I were to leave my current company it would greatly hurt them. They have a lot of work going on and if I were to leave I am not sure how they would get all of these done (even with me there, I am not sure how we’re going to get it all done lol).

17b8cf8,Should I Move On From My Old Job?,"I was hired last December on the 26th, just a day after Christmas. For the first two months, things were honestly pretty good. I did my job well and management enjoyed having me around. The first two jobs I had were very strenuous and I had to move at the speed of light. Here, things were better paced and management was more lax with rules. So I took advantage of that and shortly after my first two months things sorta fell apart. Because of my vanity and immaturity, my job performance tanked.  
  
I started to slack off and half-ass many of the assignments I was given. Before you know it this became a frequent occurrence. There were a few junctures where I would improve but then before you know it I would fall right back into the same rabbit hole. Toward the end because of my history, my shift leads would nitpick at whatever job I did and no matter what I did it was never good enough. My coworkers often had to redo many of the assignments I was given.  
  
There were other issues as well. A few isolated incidents of me acting up and getting fussed at, wandering around in the backroom, etc. Management talked to me repeatedly about my behavior but I didn't listen. It all finally caught up to me when I was let go last week, just a few days after my 20th birthday.  
  
I called some people in corporate and they said because of some technicality regarding my termination I can try to get my job back but I don't know if I want to. With everything I've done toward the end, it seemed like a lot of people(not everyone) were sick and tired of me.  
  
On the other hand, I wasn't a complete ass. There were many times when I busted my ass and went up and beyond my coworkers. Sure I had plenty of hiccups but most of the time things went pretty normal. And you know I'm not the only bad employee there. Not to mention and I'm not being corny, I did have friends there. This is the biggest retail store in my area and I have to shop here from time to time, I just don't want to go in there with some bad reputation but then again some people quit without notice and shop there.  
  
Being unemployed has allowed me time to reflect and I honestly feel bad for the way I acted. Things didn't have to be this way. It wasn't an easy job but it wasn't hard either. I was going to switch to cart pusher so that way I'm just doing the same thing over and over and I'm out of everyone's hair. I could do that for a while and then leave on good terms. I just feel so sorry for everything. But still, I can't help but imagine just how awkward things would be if I was allowed back in.

17b7wjn,Career dilemma: stick to loyalty or pursue a new opportunity?,"Hi carreeradvise, I need your help.  
I'm in a bit of a professional pickle and could use some advice. I'm a guy in my early 30s from Mexico, and as of late July 2023, I was working as a team leader in Finance at a major tech company – think Fortune 100. The pay's good, and I've experienced significant growth in just four years. Life's been pretty great.  
  
Around this time, a former boss of mine, who recently moved to a big leagues (like nº 2) company dropped a bombshell – there's a job opening on his team in London. My heart skipped a beat, not for the money or the company, but because it's a chance to leave my developing country and start fresh, working for one of the biggest companies in the world in London. Opportunities like this don't come around often.  
  
Fast forward to late August, and after a grueling interview process, I landed the London gig. The catch? The salary they offered (around £65k a year) is less than the equivalent what I'm making now (adjusted for cost of living), and I know it won't cover our current lifestyle, especially since my wife plans to quit her job to join me. I'm set to start in mid-November after navigating all the visa stuff.  
  
Now, here's where I need your advice. Back in March, my current employer offered me a manager position, which, due to hiring freezes, only came through in September. I hadn't applied for it; it was an unexpected promotion. So, I'm now a manager in my home country, and I thought I'd make the most of the two months or so left before my London journey begins.  
  
But things took a turn. This past Monday, I broke the news to my manager about my decision to leave for London, explaining that it wasn't about the money or unhappiness, but rather a desire for a more stable life in a secure country. My manager was understanding and supportive.  
  
But, and here's the twist, today, my manager hit me with a counteroffer: he proposed relocating me to Europe while keeping my manager role, with a significantly higher salary than the London job.  
  
Now I'm caught in a dilemma. I've already accepted the London offer and gone through the visa process. My old boss (who's also my friend) might never forgive me, not to mention this will probably affect his reputation. Also there's a risk of getting blacklisted not just by the London company but also in the tight-knit world of tech Finance. On the flip side, I've found real happiness in my current company. I achieved my goal of becoming a manager here, and they're willing to relocate me to Europe.  
  
The London job looks like a downgrade in some aspects, but it's a massive company with tons of growth potential. What should I do? I'm at a crossroads, and your insights would be greatly appreciated!",UsedPossession2750,3,1.0,3,1697681149,2023-10-19 02:05:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b7wjn/career_dilemma_stick_to_loyalty_or_pursue_a_new/,10,2023

17b5qi1,"Not sure what jobs to apply for - I'm going to describe what I enjoy and am good at, maybe someone can steer me!","A little background first. I'm 40 m, and until 2021 had been solidly employed since I was 18. 

The last company I worked for, I ended up in a completely different role from where I started, but had been with them for 12 years. 

Without wanting to sound arrogant, I know I'm intelligent. I really enjoy learning and whatever role I've been in I have sought further skills and promotion. 

I started out at my last company doing filing, progressed to valuing properties then moved onto valuing and managing the sale of large residential property portfolios. Luckily, I love maths and Excel and the job used both a fair amount. 

In time, I began teaching colleagues how best to use excel, and then expanded into general coaching and mentoring alongside my actual day to day work. 

This led to my first big job role shift - I took an internal position as an IT trainer which I loved. This role also allowed me to have a secondary role as consultant - basically if people needed Excel, PowerPoint or Word to do things that were beyond the users skills, I would take these on as projects. As a result I had to learn a lot and taught myself macros, visual basic coding etc.

Then came the next job shift - my company launched an Elearning team, with me as one of two founder members. Again, more intensive learning - Storyline 365 as well as every system that we would have to create online learning for, not forgetting video editing software, audio recording and editing software.

By the time I had to leave the company (depression hit me hard and I had to choose to be a carer for my disabled partner) I had been promoted and was routinely trying new ideas, including creating and working with animated videos so we could branch out from just systems training and offer soft skills/regulatory training options as well. 

Having been out of work for just over a year now I want to return to work, but I don't know what to do. 

I could literally spend all day problem solving Excel issues and creating bespoke spreadsheet solutions, but haven't seen any kind of job that needs that! Am I going to have to return to Elearning if I want to have any hope of making sensible money again?

If you have read this far, I salute you! But I would love some thoughts on what options there might be out there.",KingGing83,5,0.8600000143051147,3,1697674839,2023-10-19 00:20:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b5qi1/not_sure_what_jobs_to_apply_for_im_going_to/,10,2023

So last week, Boss A said I was going to be working with Boss B in the project team (which I hated). At first I tought that he did it because he was to busy, but then what he does is put someone else in my position.

&#x200B;

Now I feel very frustrated because I did everything I could to show that I care, but he wouldn't even give me tasks to do so there was nothing I could do. Now I'm back to a team I hate (not the people, but the attributions) and I feel very tired to go to work and eager for the end of the day so I can go and rest.

Feel like I’m pursuing SLP just for that because of job security and stability. As if your working in school or healthcare you are secure in life. I come for a low-middle class family and they all suggest I get a stable job in healthcare so I can be secure in life . But I hate people telling me what to do in life like bitch this my life 

Idk if sounds messed up but I don’t feel like ima serious person and want to be stuck in a job be miserable. Everyone says they hate they jobs why would I want to live a life like that. Miserable every day everyone makes they jobs sound very depressing makes me not excited about the work life 

I want to have fun in life like travel, work for myself be an entrepreneur. Don’t want to work for other people as I have people as some people are dicks  even bosses. I can’t sometimes deal with other people personalities. Cause me anxiety and I social anxiety 

I dint life to follow rules or people telll fuck to do I’m 24f I’m grown ass adult

I’ve been doing it for about 7 years and have been a consistent top performer at my company -  I’ve fortunately won several awards over the years and have been offered peer leadership opportunities and have participated in the organizations formal development program. 

I really want to be a manager, however, there are no openings in my area and I am not willing to relocate. (They have offered for me to take roles in other states)

There is a startup in the specialty that I have been working in that is hiring a salesforce. I applied for the manager role and didn’t hear back but got called for the sales representative role from the 3rd party recruiter.

The initial interview went well and she thinks I’m a perfect fit for the role. I asked what the next steps were and she said it’s to interview with the regional director because they have not hired a district manager. 

I have a virtual interview with the regional director on Friday and to be honest I don’t want to make a lateral move to this company but I would LOVE to take the district manager role. I wouldn’t traditionally be considered because I don’t have “management experience” but I do feel as though I’m very prepared for that role.

So I just finished a video interview for a website admin role and I think it went great! The next step would be an in person interview sometime next week.

The only thing is that I don't know what to expect! A lot of the job scope requires HTML/CSS knowledge (which I'm comfortable with and have it on my resume) but I haven't coded in a while, and I'm worried it will show in the in person interview. The interview today had coding questions but nothing too specific about it, just how would I approach xyz and what languages and experience I have.

They want someone to become proficient in a new website platform, so that's why I have some hope that it's ok I don't know 'everything' because they said they are learning too.

Coworker has been at company for 10 years, I've been there 3. We both have the same general career experience, he has 10 years, I have 12 years overall. He was making $11k more than me a year which I equate to more experience at said company and a certification I didn't have. I now have this certification. I also have an MBA, coworker has no college education.
Coworker found another job, they offered him $30k more a year. They declined the offer due to our company ""matching"" the offer. The company ""graciously"" offered me an increase but now I would be making $25k less than my coworker. 
So they matched their offer, giving them $21k more a year PLUS a $13k bonus for 2 years and 1 more week vacation. They offered me $6k more with no bonus and 1 additional week of vacation in 2025.
I am beyond furious. My young self says quit now which I know is stupid. I assume my best option is accept the offer but look and leave as soon as I can. I assume I shouldn't even counter their offer since they clearly slapped me in the face (in my view anyways). I feel i should still be within the same margin prior to the coworker almost leaving.

17b2dxv,Having a hard time deciding on a career path. Felling discouraged.,"I am 27 years old. last year a I graduated with an undergrad degree in Sociology. Due to health reasons, I was constantly in and out of college which is the reason why it took me so long to get that degree. I originally went to school for environmental science and then realized I wanted to work with people and hopefully become a therapist one day. After a few years I became increasingly involved in small creative ventures, such as creating music, getting into photography, and even planning my own local art shows and concerts that we're incredibly successful. As the years went by, I stayed pretty involved in my hometown's local art community with my own small projects and collaborations but never fully built it into a career or way of living. A year before I graduated, I began doing sports photography for my University and eventually went on to do more work for a G-League basketball team (this was all free work btw). With that, I realized that I actually wanted to do something creative with my time and thought about changing my degree to marketing or design. When talking to a career coach, she advised me that if I can land an internship I likely wouldn't need a degree and could get a job right after that. During my final semester, I got offered two marketing internships, one at an engineering company and the other related to sports. Although the engineering one paid better and seemed to be more thorough and involved, I ended up taking the sports internship because I had a dream of eventually working for an NBA team one day. This proved to be a bad decision as I was basically there to help deliver posters, create some social media posts, and help out with events without any opportunities to dive in and gain valuable experience in marketing. After that, I received a great opportunity to help a local business owner create an online presence for a brand new food hall opening in my hometown. I was a self-starter in this position and took initiative to help out with graphic design/branding, creating content (photos/videos), run their social media, events and come up with creative ways to increase customer traffic. It was an amazing opportunity. Though, after a year I was eventually replaced by a marketing firm. While I was working at the food hall, I was also doing sports photography work and had made some connections who gave me some opportunities to hopefully move up from the G-League into a job with the NBA. Unfortunately every single one of those opportunities fell through. I also applied for many jobs in marketing to no avail. Right now I am currently doing the Designlab foundations course and I love it. I'm thinking of going into UX Design but. I just can't make a set decision right now with anything. I know I have many skills but it feels impossible to have a job right now. I feel like I'm constantly shifting from wanting to be a therapist, to UX Designer, to NBA photographer/marketer. The fact that I am 27 and I've never made more than $19,000 a year is extremely discouraging too. I had a huge opportunity to be a photography intern for an NBA team last month that I was betting on. Interview went amazing. I even had multiple people within the team vouch for me. I felt I was overqualified in certain areas. Then I get rejected. Sometimes I wish I had switched my major two years ago when I was thinking about it. I want to get a masters degree either in HCI or something related to marketing or Social Work if I decide to go the therapy route but I don't know if I will be able to get in anywhere with my skills. My dream is to move to New York City and I am honestly just trying to find something to give me enough money and freedom to do that.",snack047,2,1.0,0,1697665765,2023-10-18 21:49:25,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b2dxv/having_a_hard_time_deciding_on_a_career_path/,10,2023
17b2ai6,Career change after a PhD in marine science,"Hi all,

Like many of my peers, I followed a childhood dream: I wanted to swim with the fish and study them.

After a painfully long PhD, I realized that academia is not quite for me. I enjoy the research part and the writing, but being constantly on the road, the career and the financial instability... Not quite.

I'm giving a try to the industry, but unsure where I fit.
My background is in ecology, working with ocean or ecological data, looking at changes in biodiversity and relating those changes to changes in the environment (for instance, climate change). 

**Tools and techniques**:
I programmed algorithms (in R mainly and a bit of Python). I really enjoyed that part where I had a problem and could get creative by finding a solution with some code.
I played with time series, graph theory, and some machine learning. I focused more on multivariate analysis to discover patterns, rather than univariate, modeling and hypothesis testing. The last experience I had with modeling was in my M.Sc.

**Other interests**:
I really enjoy science communication where I can take some data, make an explanatory visual to deliver a message to a technical or non technical audience. Teaching and mentoring was also something I really enjoyed.

I feel I went deep into this field when the industry prefers someone who knows a bit of everything and who focuses on modeling.
When I look at job descriptions, I feel I'm sitting between two chairs: a bit more than a data analyst with an interest in ML/AI, but not quite a data scientist as I'd need a much deeper and broader understanding of computer science, maths, ML/AI.

I'm struggling with two aspects of my career:
- to see what job titles I should aim for when looking for jobs?
- to select one or more industries where I could leverage my strengths?
(- what jobs/companies let you use R programming with or without Python?)

Ideally, I'd like to build some pieces of software. Some tool that others can use, whether they are colleagues or clients.
The analytical part is nice, but I love to use my brain to get creative.

Any advice or direction at this point is appreciated, I feel quite lost.",GrowlingOcelot_4516,1,1.0,3,1697665519,2023-10-18 21:45:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b2ai6/career_change_after_a_phd_in_marine_science/,10,2023
17b1axh,How did you make your career choice?,"I think this ended up being a vent-y post, so tl;dr I can't decide on a career and feel like I'm running out of time. How'd you know what was a really good fit for you, and when'd you realize it?

I'm (25f) currently going to college for my associate's in interior design. (unfortunately, due to my parents being in the awkward class of making too much for fin aid and not enough to pay for all their kids' colleges, I had to wait until I aged out of dependent status). I'm still not sure if I'm in the right major. I really don't know for sure “what I want to be when I grow up” and it's frustrating and discouraging. I've considered a lot, but I've either been talked out of them or decided they wouldn't fit with what I want my future to be like. Maybe it's a field that doesn't allow for much family time (like a NICU nurse) or it comes with too much emotional strain (like social work). I have bad depression which makes me feel like I have no passions and anxiety which probably plays a role in being indecisive, and both of those make this choice incredibly difficult. I landed on interior design because I feel like I have a pretty good eye for color/space, and I loved reorganizing my room as a kid. I can't help but feel like it's just not what I really want, though. I want to do something big and meaningful, and something my future kids can be proud of, something I can be proud of, but pretty much anything I can think of that fits that bill for me, I don't have nearly enough confidence or access to do it (like astronomy, which my dad so nicely suggested I aim lower than that). I truly don't know what to do, and I feel like I'm running out of time. My partner wants to wait until we're both in our careers (they're one of the lucky ones, whose known since like middle school what they wanted to do) to have kids. At this point, we'll never have kids (which is what I've always felt called to do, unlike any career).",Honest-Ride-4074,1,1.0,2,1697662984,2023-10-18 21:03:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17b1axh/how_did_you_make_your_career_choice/,10,2023

I have went out and tried to improve myself by studying more applications and even getting a couple of certifications in Salesforce but even with that I can not get into these rotations because I am not already in the same role. College for me just is not something I want to do.

17b0ids,Career change and LinkedIN,"Hi everyone,  
Would really appreciate some suggestions from either recruiters or others who have been in a similar boat as me. Here's a short version of my story for some context.

My background is in freelance academic editing/proofreading and a PhD in the humanities researching social media algorithms, AI, and their impact on online public discourse. Due to financial/family reasons, I had to take a leave of absence from the program (currently indefinitely). I've been in close contact with the school's admins and my supervisor and they were all supportive of my decision and assured me that they'd be as flexible as possible to help me get going again when I return. While it's going to be difficult, I'm hoping to return to the program once I secure a full-time job and do both. Because I'm done with coursework and only have the dissertation left, I'm hoping to be able to bust my ass hard for a few years and finish the dissertation while working.

After leaving the program and my last editing gig ending, I took that period of freedom to attend a coding bootcamp (thought that going into the tech world as a practitioner would be a good benefit for my research as well, rather than as simply a scholarly observer) and would like to take the step to looking for my first tech job. And this is where the situation with my LinkedIn feels like a catch-22.

Considering how difficult the job market is right now for entry level software developers, I haven't been optimistic about securing a SWE position quickly and so have also been applying to editing positions. I was advised that LinkedIn is very important to maximizing my chances for getting hired as a software engineer.

Currently my LinkedIn page lists me as a PhD student and copyeditor. If I change my LinkedIn now to reflect the role I'm primarily hoping for (SWE), I'm worried that that'll work against me when trying to land an editing role. I also am a bit hesitant about removing the PhD title in my LinkedIn and potentially sending the wrong message to my existing network of colleagues and friends that I'm calling it quits for good. 

At the same time, if my LinkedIn isn't updated to describe me as a software engineer, I'm worried that I'm not really giving myself a proper chance during this tech position job hunt.

So I feel stuck and would really appreciate some suggestions on how to proceed. I'd especially love to hear from people who've had a similar struggling during a career transition or from recruiters/hiring managers who can provide some perspective on this situation.

17b0h8i,Iron Work trade while learning CS? seeking advice,"I’m 24 (m) and currently drive for FedEx ground (non CDL). I bring home about $3,000 a month. I do enjoy it tbh but it’s not what I want to do forever. I get by comfortably but I want a bit more financially. 

A month ago i was set on pursuing going back to college and finishing my CS degree. I’ve always wanted to do this since high school but financially I just couldn’t. I’m now able to definitely afford it. 

But…2 days ago my uncle offered me a position to work with him learning the trade of iron work. He would start me off at a pretty good salary. He says there’s alot of potential to make great $ and great benefits. I don’t mind physical work at all and I know this would set me up to definitely be able to purchase a home or a bigger apartment in the next year or 2. 

Would you say it’s a good idea to accept the job offer and also pursue college for CS? Or just focus on one? I just know the body damage that comes with this trade and would rather not do this forever but I also have my first child due in a few weeks and idk if it’ll take too much time away from her if I decide to do both.

17b09uk,"32 years old, needing to finally buckle down and commit to something new","Have worked the last \~8 years in the beer/cider/wine industry behind the bar and managing small businesses. I don't want to be in this industry much longer, but the money is decent and I love having my mornings free/making my own schedule.

In 2019, I relocated to a different state for the purpose of going back to school - then COVID happened. Schooling got derailed as the world turned upside down, I met a girl who I've been with for about 3 years and are now engaged. I ended up laid off about 6 months due to owners cashing out, and am only back to working part time in the service industry.

I have about $15,000 saved at the moment, although bills are outpacing earnings. Fiancé is a bartender and has the ability to make about $70K a year most places, neither of us have any debt. I have wanted to go back to school for the last several years to study engineering, so that would entail investing money and time (probably 3 years and $50K), but then I convince myself I'd be better served by jumping into an electrician apprenticeship or try to get HVAC certified. I've worked part time in home construction and custom remodels a couple times in the last decade, and the engineering side of problem solving and the financial security engineering can bring has drawn me to that so far. 

I don't feel as if I have a ton of marketable skills right now having just worked largely in the service industry recently. Sales is something that feels slimy and doesn't really appeal to me. I have an Associate's degree in General Studies and Criminal Justice, which I don't have a desire to use right now. 

I wish I had an idea or was sure of what I want to do when I grow up, but I haven't ever been able to picture myself in a career. I've spent too much time and money smoking pot in my twenties and feel like I'm just so far behind. I'm a detail oriented person, always been a deep thinker and have always kept myself in good shape. 

&#x200B;

I definitely qualify for it and it was exactly what I was looking for in my next job.  I did a 30 min online interview with 4 panelists and it went great, I felt really good about it.

At the end of the interview, I was told I would hear next week if I were selected for an on site interview.  

I sent a thank you email and then waited.  Toward the end of the next week, I hadn't heard anything so I reached out.

The following week, I got an email saying they had selected another candidate to visit on site that week.  That's all it said, and I showed it to some friends who agreed it sounded a little weird and that maybe I was a second choice so they didn't want to flat out reject me yet.  

Well, it's been about a month, I have never officially received a rejection.  I looked at my profile on their site and my application still says ""in review"".  Also, the posting is still up.

17ayv54,"Sticking to what I know, but being rather niche and will never be in demand? Or throw away that experience and start from the beginning?","I'm having a bit of a predicament and need some guidance. 

I currently am in my 30's and have 15+ years of recreation experience under my belt. I've never worked a fulltime job, no degrees, and have always supplemented my living expenses with my part time recreation job and freelancing.

By no means do I have a passion for recreation, it's just an easy job that I know very well. However, while I'm blessed in my living situation to not struggle with money due to circumstances, I'm no longer happy just being a part time worker. I decided to talk to a college counselor, with full intentions of going back to school for business administration. She immediately talked to me like I was a clueless kid who had no idea that business administration dealt with numbers and offices all day, which rubbed me the wrong way. She said with my experience, I should go for a bachelors in recreation.

I already know what path I'd want to take if I went the recreation route, but I know it's not in high demand and I'll struggle to find a job- but I have a ton of experience in it, and I know what to look for and what works and doesn't, as well as what the job entails and how to adapt to different situations. I'd especially like to get a job within the City, because, despite not having a passion for it, I care a lot about my community and giving them opportunities to be enriched. I also am already used to working odd hours, not having a set schedule and working evenings and weekends, so that's not a problem for me in the slightest.

On the flip side, business admin felt like it would open doors for me, but I'm starting from scratch and likely will feel my last 15+ years were just a waste, floating through life in some sort of confused, fugue state, lol. I feel the skills gained through business admin would be easy to transfer and hop around to find the best fit for myself. I enjoy tedious, detail oriented work and can sit for hours and concentrate on task after taste, while also highly enjoying working with computers. If I could have it my way, I'd want to be fully WFH, but we can't have it all, lol.

So, do I go into what even I think is potentially a crap degree in recreation because of my experience? Or go a more conventional route with business admin? I've also considered doing a major in business admin with a minor in recreation as a middle ground, but I'm so damn lost and clueless.",Extension_Air_7833,0,0.5,2,1697656690,2023-10-18 19:18:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ayv54/sticking_to_what_i_know_but_being_rather_niche/,10,2023

The go-live date for this initiative happens to be a month after my masters program finishes and during the month of my wedding. The job is a lateral move (same pay) but it is a permanent role which is appealing. I am worried about taking this on seeing as my personal life is hectic and this role will inevitably be busier than the role I am in now.

17ay4dx,27F and feeling unfulfilled in my role at a police service - should I leave?,"I've been in a civilian role (not an officer) for going on 5 years and this environment is starting to take a toll on me. It's just such a toxic environment for a multitude of reasons, as I'm sure many people can imagine. Ever since I had my child too, I've really felt the lack of flexibility in my position and it's just been hard. There isn't any opportunity here to work part time. You're either required to do shift work with days and nights, or do Monday-Friday, 9-5 essentially, which is what I currently do. Officers tend to get a lot of vacation time, but I only get 2 weeks a year, and you have to work like 20 years as a civilian to get 4 weeks vacation.

I've never really had a clear picture of what career I would want to do, but working here brings me zero joy. I've bounced around everything from therapy to something involving writing and/research, to a nutritionist or herbalist, or even working with animals. It's difficult because I feel like most of the things I'm interested in (other than maybe therapy) are hard to make money in.

I don't necessarily plan on walking away tomorrow, but I just have a hard time picturing myself staying here until retirement, and the thought of being stuck here forever makes me really stressed out.

I've talked to family about stepping away one day and they think it's a bad idea to leave because it's a high paying field with benefits and a pension. 

I understand that job security is important and that some people would do anything for a stable position like this, but I just feel like I would rather be happy and fulfilled and make less money, than make more money and be unhappy. After all, most people work at the very least from age 16-55 (if not significantly longer these days), so the vast majority of our lives is spent working full time and I just have a hard time wrapping my head around spending the majority of my adult life doing something unfulfilling. 

I want to be able to go to work and believe in what I do. I want there to be more flexibility. Even having a day off once in a while would be amazing for me. I just feel like especially since having a child, I have been in pursuit of a new career because I want to spend more time with my son and also have some extra time in the week to self care and keep up with the day to day chores.

A while back I read the book The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari and it was really inspiring to me. I don't really know how authentic the story is, but regardless of whether it's real or fake, it was essentially about a 20-something lawyer who left his high paying job in pursuit of happiness. I would do anything to leave this job one day and find my ""dream job"" but it just feels so unattainable.

Can it be done? Am I dumb for trying to leave a stable career in pursuit of the unknown?

17axly8,Trying to get an idea off the ground,"Ive owned rabbits for 15 years.  I have a lot of knowledge on rabbits. 

Diet, housing, emotional and physical welfare, medical issues, etc. I've nursed sick rabbits and dealt with plenty of bunny emergencies.

I want to be a rabbit consultant and bunny boarder.

Baaically, you get a rabbit and have no idea what to do. Thats where I help. I can give advice, materials, vet contacts depending on area, make sure the bunny has proper housing, food, and so on 

But people arent going to want to trust some random, right? So I have taken courses with certificates. 

I have taken a short 1.5 hour rabbit care course, and I also completed a graded course that was 150 hours that contains multiple choice and written portions.(like an essay). I also took a course called Animal Welfare and Behavior through University of Endinbrugh.

They do not replace a degree or college, so I'm wondering if I say I'm certified in rabbit care and all (and can prove it), if that will lend any credibility.

My own rabbit just passed away at 10.5 years old and she had a digestive disorder called megacolon. My vet said these rabbits don't live past 6, and i credit myself because I recognized the issue, her needs and took amazing care of her. Even my vets was amazed that she was immaculate given she was a white rabbit, a fur color that is very unforgiving

17aw6p0,Is it better to quit?,"Hi I’m a recent graduate with a data science degree and I have somehow fell into a software development role. 

I originally wanted to get into business analytics but after applying around (a lot) only one company got back to me but offered to hire into a dev role instead. While I did learn some compsci and coding I am very new at applying those skills outside of data science. They told me that there would be a lot of on the job training and that as long as I had the mindset I’ll be able to figure it out. So I decided to accept it out of necessity and maybe this could open a new path for me. 

Flash forward 6 months later and I feel very anxious about work almost like I’m drowning. After a three-month training period I was given a couple of small tasks that were considered ‘low priority’ and yet I struggled a lot right up until deadlines to figure how to get it done. I am now on my first small solo project and still feeling very much out of my depth. 

I do not like the work and I do not see myself in this field in the future. I never get to do anything with actual data outside of managing databases for platform migrations. The process of software development feels boring, tedious, and also high stress at the same time. And I have no idea where to start on tasks. Basically, I’m realizing that this is not my jam. I like the idea of software development and really respect the people that do it but it’s not me. 

Considering that this is my first job and the current market, I’m hesitant to leave this early. I also feel like it would be rude to bail on a project and have it shouldered onto a co-worker. The idea of being unemployed is also terrifying. With my current savings I can handle three months at most without a job. 

My questions/concerns are as followed: 
1. Will a six-month stint look bad on my resume? 
2. Would it be better to quit now and stop eating everybody’s time or later until I find another position? Or should I just wait until I get fired?
3. How do you quit a job on good terms? 
4. How hard will it be to transition from software dev into business analytics? 
5. How do I deal with feeling like I failed?

17avoqn,"Passed over for 2 internal jobs, should I quit?","I apologize in advance for the long read I didn’t think I had that much to say.

So I’ve been working at this job (position A) for over a year, im pretty good at what I do but about 6 months ago I was getting bored of it and was ready for something different. So I asked about cross training and different positions I could transfer too. During those talks they started talking to me about moving up and being promoted. 

I cross trained in a new position (position B) and I started really liking it but there wasn’t an opening there. So I was just covering shifts for it here and there for a while. Which was fine it was still good experience and knowledge for me, but I was still mostly doing position A because we were in our busy season and they needed me there.

Then about 2 months ago a supervisor position suddenly became available and I went for it. After a month long hiring process I was passed over. Which was okay at the time, not ideal, but they went with someone with much more experience and qualifications than me.

Then a job at position B suddenly became available about a month ago so I obviously applied. I was already trained and I liked doing it. While in the hiring process I was also helping cover that position as they were down a person and needed help. I tried reminding myself that anything could happen and I wasn’t guaranteed the job. But I was also pretty confident, being as I was literally already doing the job on my own.

Then I got passed over for that job too, for a different internal hire with no experience. 🙃 I talked with one manager and our hr person to try and figure out why because to be honest it made no sense to me. And I was basically told that I wasn’t chosen because they didn’t want me to ‘get stuck’ in position B and not be able to move up/be promoted. Which I guess is nice, they want bigger and better things for me ? But there is no open supervisor positions, and it doesn’t look like there will be for a good while. So im just stuck waiting.

In the meantime they offered me position C to finally get me out of position A. Which is not what I wanted to do at all but it will supposedly give me more experience and knowledge for a future promotion. Which sounds okay but I would have to work with position b more closely :/

 And I really liked position B. I genuinely liked doing it and now I have to go to work and see that someone else is doing the job I wanted so badly. And it’s not like I can just ignore it because I have to work with that person in order to do position c. 

So should I quit? There is still a vague promise of promotion. But I’m honestly so discouraged and upset. It’s hard to be happy there right now. And I don’t know what to do.

job B: working for a commercial business. make more money. use my degree. no commitment. work for 2-6 months at a time then have equal time off (not have to work at all). live internationally during that time working then free to live wherever when off. i’m worried i do not have that much experience in this. coworkers can be intimidating. more time to travel and do hobbies since i’m only working half the year. more freedom. $100k+",Bdinfisj,1,1.0,2,1697647264,2023-10-18 16:41:04,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17av647/which_job_to_pick/,10,2023

My question is, would I be crazy to give up such a great opportunity with the graduate role to go back and study? I can’t do both at the same time as I need will need to complete my Chartered Accountant qualification while working in audit.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",AlgaePure,1,1.0,1,1697639290,2023-10-18 14:28:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17as4y9/working_grad_role_or_going_back_to_study/,10,2023
17arlxj,I am a pharmacy student and I hate it.,"I'm in 3rd Year Bpharm course rn, I have been commuting daily 4 hours up and down. it leaves me exhausted , i just mug up and throw up in the examination . I have never liked chemistry even though I used to score decent which my parents was doable for me. The college that I travel two hours for has the worst crowd and absolutely no social  life
Now I have just one and a half year left for my course.
It's not just a rant, I'm seeking some advice from you all that what should I do in this situation? due to so much travelling my health has been deteriorating too and the study pressure is maybe too high for me. 
I'm just not interested in the chemicals and the industry at al
I'm not considering dropping out, I'm gonna finish this course. But I dont think pharmacy is for me, and I dont feel I would enjoy a career based on it. 

Can anyone suggest me some higher study option for me in India/abroad anything I can do to switch my field?",unzayn,4,1.0,4,1697637847,2023-10-18 14:04:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17arlxj/i_am_a_pharmacy_student_and_i_hate_it/,10,2023
17arfw1,I need help finding a good career for me.,"Main point: I need help finding a career. I don't know why, but it has been really hard finding a career lately. Original, I wanted to be a paleontologist, since I was interested in dinosaurs and other prehistoric life. However, I'm not good at the sciences and other subjects required to have that career and I suck at paying attention in university lectures. I'm now stuck in this situation where I can't decide what I want to do in the future. I usually let my parents choose for me, but they tell me ""choose what makes you happy"". I'm just wanting to make money for my needs so I don't end up homeless.  
  
So here are my skills and interests.  
  
I really love dinosaurs, and have been for most of my life. I love researching dinosaurs, drawing dinosaurs, watching dinosaur documentaries, and I would like go fossil hunting and collect dinosaur figures in the near future, if I have the money and skills for that.  
  
I also like researching things about animals and prehistoric animals, whether it be taxonomy, biodiversity, physical differences, where and when they lived, and other aspects that relate to this interest.  
  
I love drawing, mostly dinosaurs and animals. Lately I've been trying to improve my drawing skills, making my dinosaurs look more realistic.  
  
I'm good at volunteering in places that require moving and carrying items and organizing and cleaning up after the place. I got respect from my other peers for my perseverance. It's nothing, I just like being useful and helpful.  
  
And here are my weaknesses  
  
As stated above, I am not good at sciences and math (especially physics, though biology may be a small exception). I think there's just to much to learn and remember. That doesn't mean I don't want to learn about the subjects. Can anyone recommend me to learn about university biology, chemistry, math, and physics if possible? I would really like to improve on them.  
  
I have trouble paying attention, because I have... slight ADHD and OCD. I know, I know, its weird but because of that, its really hard to pay attention for long periods of time, and is one of the reasons why I couldn't pay attention to university lectures.  
  
I suck at socializing. I stutter a lot, I get nervous when talking to people, and I prefer being alone. I do like to talk to people I know and familiar with, like my teachers and parents, but when it comes to strangers, its only downhill from there. I'm kind of an introvert if I'm being honest.  
  
So, what do you think, what career is good for me?",dinofan62,2,1.0,2,1697637418,2023-10-18 13:56:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17arfw1/i_need_help_finding_a_good_career_for_me/,10,2023
17ao3dv,Grass is greener - job hopping. Want maternity pay,"Hello

Looking for some words of wisdom. I work in the data space and my current job tenures are as follows:

2 years - first job, outgrew it

5 years - start up vibes, learnt loads, consultantcy work

2 years - great company, got promoted fast and built my own team. Left as I was getting bored due to only working with 1 piece of software 

Currently 8 months - consultantcy, always wanted to work for this company so saw it and thought f it see what happens. Turns out I got the job, was very unsure whether to accept due to lack of maternity pay but didn't want to regret it later. Lots of learning opportunities

I'm now in the situation where I'm slightly regretting my last move. I want to start trying for a baby next year and whilst I've learnt lots in my new role I miss being a manager and having that influence. I'm also missing the thought of good maternity pay.

So do I look for a new role with that maternity pay? I've seen a manager role open in my city which I think I could be a good fit for. It doesn't state the pay or benefits but I'm considering applying. 

Pros
Hybrid - I miss being in an office
Manager title again
I enjoy making change and managing people
No timesheets 

Cons
Hybrid - I'd have a commute 
Probably less learning opportunities 
Fear of the unknown

I don't want to move again and regret it. Any advice. The difference maternity pay would make would be thousands",Spare_Perception_783,1,1.0,3,1697627293,2023-10-18 11:08:13,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ao3dv/grass_is_greener_job_hopping_want_maternity_pay/,10,2023
17andss,Have my own business but hate it... am I being too hasty thinking of leaving it?,"Hi there, 

Really hope I write this clearly and balanced!

I work in music marketing, and have done all 10+ years of my professional life. I started a business 5 years ago which affords me the best income I've ever had, by a long shot, and affords me the chance to hire a team that work around the business I sell.

I have unfortunately lost a lot of my love for it over the years.

I have also had a particularly rough year outside and inside of the business and I'm now in a position where I'm struggling to get through a full day without running home to hide from it all.

I want to strip out the responsibility for others and take it easy on myself for a while, thus downsizing the business to myself as a freelancer. This would also afford me the flexibility and space to pursue other passions (game development), but most importantly would allow me to work on less, good quality clients.

17ali25,Did my interviewer attacked me or am I overthinking this?,"Today, I applied for a journalist position at a company and was invited for an interview. However, upon arriving, I was kept waiting for 20 minutes before being seen. During the interview, they asked me standard questions, but one particular lady expressed doubt in my ability to handle the workload and assignments. Despite assuring her that I could manage, she insisted that the only reason I was called for an interview was because I graduated with first-class honors. She repeatedly questioned the authenticity of my academic achievement and even asked if I was lying. I provided my certificate as proof, but she still kept on asking how someone like me could achieve first-class honors. She also went on to say that I dont look smart and went so far as to say that I may think I'm smart, but I am not. I was taken aback by these remarks. It was confusing to me because I had previously interned at the company in a different department, and my internship supervisors had nothing but positive feedback about me. Throughout the interview, she continued to assert that I would not be able to handle the workload. It seemed that she was determined to undermine my qualifications and make me feel unworthy of the job.

  
I also can't help but feel that there may be an element of racism involved. I live in a country where people of my race face consistent discrimination and exclusion, so it seems like she couldn't believe that someone from my racial background could graduate with first-class honors. I'm unsure if I'm overthinking this or if this is a common experience in interviews. Could you please provide some insight?

17alfph,is the course worth it ?,"   
I completed my Masters in English from Amity University in 2021. After that I did online and offline teaching for some time but that did not really suit me. On a counsellor's advice for better career options, i was suggested that i do a course in Human resource management from abroad but my visa for canada was rejected. I also got acceptance from Royal Holloway University in London for the same course but for some reasons my seat 23' intake too was cancelled. The whole ielts exam and the procedure of moving abroad have consumed almost 1 1/2 years but I am still in India. I was told that there might be an intake for the same college and course in london in january but now the college has removed that course for the january intake. The college is now offering me few courses that i should take and i've been suggested to go for MSc International business management(strategy and leadership).  
Is this a good course/is worth it and have scope of growth in India as well if I come back after my studies. Are opportunities available and jobs are well paying?

17akw93,Should I focus on Uni studies or work experience?,"I am currently studying part time at university.

I’ve always worked part time to full-time whilst studying, but while I was working full time, my grades were suffering. Last year i undertook a traineeship and ended up getting fired from it resulting in getting financially screwed over. After getting fired, I got a part time survival job and noticed my grades started improving significantly.

I live on my own, so I need to work and earn enough income to support myself. Within the past year, I had three jobs, two of which I got fired from and i quit the other (because i got a feeling that i was going to get fired from that) 

Needless to say, my financial situatjon for the past year has been extremely unstable with me only just being able to make ends meet

The fact that I was able to keep my head above water was only out of luck and timing of having other jobs lined up

I recently started applying for jobs and landed two interviews, which are in line with my career goals. I am really scared, that even if i do get the job, I won’t have the skills that it takes and that I will just end up getting fired from them as well. Which means i will be absolutely financially screwed.  If it provides any context it’s within the finance industry and I have very limited exposure to the corporate environment.

My question is, I’ve got two options:
1. Keep working in my current survival job, which has zero applicable skills for my future career goals, and earn a low wage for the next three years, but I get good grades and finish my university degree then at the end of that get a high paying job.

2. Get a full-time job in the finance industry, but have a high risk of getting fired, most likely get poor university grades, but gain work experience and  get high paying job after a couple years.

Also side note that option 1. Im very happy despite having no money but want to finish my degree with actual work experience

And 2. Pays good money but is really stressful

Another sidenote is that doing a three-month internship is not an option for me because I need consistent work

17akkhc,What should I do at this point of life?,"\[33 M\] I have degrees from three different countries, PhD (UK), MS (The Netherlands) and UG (India). All in the field of Mechanical Engineering. My PhD and master's were in the field of combustion modelling. My PhD did not go as expected (I do not even have a paper yet), but I did manage to graduate. When I graduated with my PhD, I was under-skilled/lacked core skills compared to other PhD candidates in my field. This severely affected my career prospects. On top of it, due to the latest trends in the market, combustion as a field is already dying. But after a huge struggle, I managed to land my dream job as a scientific software engineer in the UK. I enjoyed the role very much. I was gaining physics modelling skills and software development skills at a good pace. Finally, I thought I was learning skills that could open new doors and add real value to my CV.  But then, I was made redundant in my 10th month and I lost my job.   
After that, I landed in a job as a product development engineer at a scientific software development company (a very small company with about 15 employees). In the new role, I am not doing any real product development activities nor learning product management tools/methods/techniques. The role itself is not well defined. My activities here do not demand any leadership skills or management skills. Even though I am a product developer, I am not making any product development decisions or strategies. Simply there are no opportunities for that. The company has just one client and I am doing random tasks requested by the clients (mostly user guide documentation and testing). I am not even learning anything technical. I feel like I am not really gaining any skills in my current role except for people skills (yes, I should agree that somehow my people skills have improved in this company). I have already decided to move to a job but just waiting to get 1 year of experience here. Otherwise, I would have too many jumps in my CV within the first 18 months of my career. So, I will start looking for a new job from next April onwards.   
As you see, I have some bits and pieces of experience without any coherence. I am already 33 and I am still struggling to achieve job security while my peers are already in senior roles. Even after a PhD, I am still not an expert in a field.  
To summarize, I have a not-so-good PhD, a good 10-month experience as a scientific software engineer, a not-so-good product development engineer experience and a 2-year career break (1 after my master's and 1 after my PhD). Altogether, I have 18 months of industry experience in the UK. I am not ranting, I just said the facts to show the real state of my situation. I have accepted my situation and I know that cannot do anything about the past. Given this situation, how can I move forward and build a successful career? What are the skills I can learn or develop to build my CV? What are the possible career opportunities available in front of me? Any tips/suggestions are highly appreciated.

17ai54r,Is there any way I can negotiate with my boss to just stay remote?,"



I’ve been at my company for about 2.5 years and with my current team for about 18 months. I love my job, my boss, and my team. I work as a data analyst, mostly doing data visualization. Lately my boss has been bringing me into more ad hoc analyst asks, which I have enjoyed. I’m also wrapping up my Master’s in Computer Science in Spring ‘24. My career change from biz management to data analytics/CS is all but complete. 

Anyways, I moved down to Florida for my first job with this company in the midst of the lockdown in 2020. Since then, I’ve been in office maybe 10-12 times between both jobs. This job I actually applied for internally was listed as fully remote, but changed me to local because I was here. Didn’t love that. I think it’s fair to say however that my team works best remote. My direct boss I think strongly aligns with how I feel, as does our Sr Engineer. We also have two junior analysts - one of which is truly remote because he was hired and lives in the Midwest. He is formerly of Florida. So there’s precedent on our team.

We’ve recently gotten a new CEO. He spoke highly of hybrid work and hinted at imposing a 3 day a week mandate next year. For now, he’s “encouraging” us to come in. He’s pro hybrid, but not pro fully remote. I have been remote the last five years of my professional career. It’s what works for me. I never want to sit in an office. I will come in bi weekly, quarterly, as needed. But I am building dashboards and doing ad hoc analytics. There’s no need to sit next to my team. We communicate fine via Slack. When I work in office - I lost 2 hours of sleep, don’t have time or energy for grad school at night, am just generally miserable. So far its been a non-issue, but our CEO has heightened my anxiety. My sole piece of leverage is I basically own our entire BI platform. It would be hard to replace me on a whim.

We’re currently in our “peak” season. Everyone’s swamped and stressed - especially my boss. But I’m losing sleep over this. And to make matters more complicated, I want to move out of Florida when my lease is up next May. I’d like to move to the Midwest in a state we also operate in. I am miserable in Florida and lonely here. I miss being near any semblance of family. I don’t like the climate, weather and politically. I just can’t stand it. 

Im just looking for advice when to talk to my boss and how to professionally discuss this request. My anxiety has me prepared for the worst. We speak weekly in one on ones but it’s usually all time for actual work. I try not to rock the boat or be difficult, but being remote is the most important thing to me. Part of me think ya it’s best to wait for peak to end, the other part of me thinks I shouldn’t have to live with the anxiety. I’m glad she at least seems aligned with me on preferring remote, and I originally planned to speak with her in august when we do our yearly bonus/career conversation, but that was moved company wide to January. I’m just tired of constantly hearing about the office, office surveys, etc. I think our CEO was speaking generally vs specifically to me and my team but I hate the lack of certainty. I just cannot do the office and all the social and financial drain that comes with it - especially since I am so high performing. Before I was hired, we had this project contracted to a consulting firm where 3 people did my job. We’ve completely streamlined it since.

17ahyup,Job Switch During Potential Layoff?,"
Need some advice i currently make around 85k at a small aluminum plant. Im not involved with production directly but my job is required by the company however they could streamline it to 1 person if they really wanted to but it would be a hell of a workload. They Recently they laid off 10% of the workforce due to the aluminum auto market being so bad i wasn’t affected but my department was. So long story short i freak out and apply to a couple places and Alcoa also dealing in aluminum has an opening for what i do and after a phone interview they offer me 102k and a few more vacation days, better benefits and so on. So i feel like it’s a no brainer but going there worries me because they have rumors of layoffs due to aluminum as well and i feel like i would not be as valued in that place as where i work now. So should i just jump on the opportunity and hope for the best or stay where i have personal ties and could possibly have that be an advantage when they do more job cuts.

17ahmvb,Tips for switching jobs,"So I am a new grad that graduated in May 2023. I just started a data analyst/consultant position at a company in August. However, I really get along with the work culture here.  My question is, if I am applying for jobs (entry level/ new grad) now, should I include my current job on my resume? 

I see there are 3 different options: 

1) Apply for jobs without my current job on resume (so that interviewer doesn't know I am leaving this job so soon)

2) Apply with my current job and hope to have a chance to explain why I am leaving so soon

3) Tough it out for some more time before applying for new jobs (ideally I would not like to take this option) 

 Which option would you all  recommend? ",confused_student2019,1,1.0,4,1697601680,2023-10-18 04:01:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17ahmvb/tips_for_switching_jobs/,10,2023

17agjhd,Seeking Advice: How to Kickstart a Professional Career while Working Security with Limited Connectivity,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I find myself in a situation that's been bothering me lately. I work as a security guard, and during my 8 to 12-hour shifts, I have virtually nothing to do, thanks to the quiet nature of the job. The catch is, I don't have access to Wi-Fi or a mobile hotspot during this time so using my laptop isn’t an option. However, I do have my trusty smartphone with me.

I'm really eager to use this downtime constructively and start building a professional career or learning new skills. I believe there must be creative ways to make the most of my free time. 

So, I'm turning to this community for suggestions. What apps, courses, or resources do you recommend for someone in my situation? Are there specific fields or industries that I can delve into that might not require a constant internet connection? Any personal success stories or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm ready to make the most of this opportunity, and I'm excited to hear your insights!

17afbyb,Want a career in wedding planning,"I kind of need some life advice and this was the only place I could think of to get genuine answers -
I'm almost 22 years old (f), not wanting to go back to college but I may need to for what I want to do. I'd like to become a wedding planner or work in the wedding business. I don't have too much experience, i've only really worked in retail and some food places. I've emailed some local wedding planning companies and only two have gotten back to me so far saying they aren't hiring and to try starting out as an event manager.

I have considered just taking classes for hospitality management and/ or business, but I really REALLY hate math lol and just don't want to deal with the hassle of college again. It's way too stressful and not the kind of environment I'd want to waste more money on.
Is there courses online or something that I could take and get maybe a certificate that would push me in the right direction? I'm really just ready to start my life and career and I'm not sure how to with this passion, but I feel like it's right for me.

I also can't figure out for the life of me which sites are and are not scams, and which ones would be worth it. Anyone with experience in anything I mentioned that can help?

17aechf,"You suspect you'll be laid off for any reason, Do you prefer to quit or wait for it to happen?","
Let's assume for a moment you know you are in the next round of lay-offs. Do you quit by yourself or wait until it happens?

Now your priority is getting interviews. With the next step in mind, to find the next job, Option A has the benefit you control the narrative as in, when asked what happened you can say you quit _for reasons A, B and C_ as opposed as being laid off for reasons that could be very bad, neutral or not bad but you don't have control on the narrative whatsoever when they ask for references. 

What could be the downsides of this strategy? I want to hear from you.

PD #1: Severance package does not apply, at-will labor relationship so termination or quitting can be inmediate.

PD #2: Yes, I know labor market is ugly out there but so are lay-offs.

17a9hnr,Passed over for 4 promotions… time to go?,"-Currently 28 years old

-Graduated 6.5 years ago with a BA in English from a solid state university.

-3.5yrs experience as Operations/General Manager at 2 small businesses in the transportation sector.

-Duties included: managing direct reports ranging in number from 12-50, hiring/firing and fulfilling general HR functions, managing a P&L + asset register, implementing process improvements that yielded quantifiable savings/revenue increases, customer outreach and relationship management, etc. 

2.5 years ago I was hired by a large corporation into a non-managerial role. I am essentially a customer-on-site, monitoring supplier compliance at several different sites across SoCal. 

I started at $80k salary + up to 10% bonus, which was a slight step backwards. I was willing to take a reduced salary and lesser title to get into a larger organization where I had the opportunity to climb the ladder, and also, frankly, to enjoy a better work/life balance. 

Over the last 2.5 years, I have received 3 substantial raises (now salaried at $99k), and have maxed out both of my year-end bonuses, which were then doubled to 20% payouts. I am significantly higher paid than all of my counterparts. Both of my year-end performance reviews have been scored as perfect 100/100s. I’m very well liked by my boss, my boss’s boss, the suppliers that I manage, and my colleagues. 

BUT - I have applied for 4 internal promotions, and been turned down for all of them. I have been very well-qualified for 3 of the 4, but I grant that one of them was a reach. These positions were all normal  manager positions, 1-1.5 rungs above my current position on the org chart - I’m not going out for VP roles, lol. 

My interview skills are pretty sharp. Before this, I had never failed to secure an offer after interviewing for a role. In 1 of the 4 interviews, I didn’t make it past the first round. In the other 3, I have made it through 3+ rounds, and in my most recent, was the final internal candidate. The company then decided to hire externally for the role. 

For all of these roles I have prepared extensively, presented 30/60/90 day plans, backed up my previous experience with quantifiable data (included in my resume), and have mostly felt like I’ve knocked my interviews out of the park.

The feedback I’ve gotten has been mostly along the lines of, “You’re obviously really smart, love your energy and enthusiasm, you brought some great ideas and plans to us, but we went with somebody that has a bit more direct experience.”

My boss appears to be fully supportive of me going out for these different jobs, and has claimed to have talked me up to all 4 of the hiring managers. He brought 2 of the roles to me himself, and urged me to apply for them if I was interested. 

So what gives? I’ve just submitted an application for a 5th internal role, but am not holding my breath. What’s your read on this situation, and what would you recommend that I do?",Smudaroni,8,0.800000011920929,11,1697578708,2023-10-17 21:38:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17a9hnr/passed_over_for_4_promotions_time_to_go/,10,2023

They always say that you shouldn't burn bridges but most people who left for the same reasons I want to leave did not speak up and the cycle continues.

I worry about the great coworkers I will leave behind continuing to be mistreated.

I'm certainly not afraid to give my opinion. Unfortunately, the root of the problem lies in the founder and their right hand man's horrible treatment of everyone so I don't know if the risk is even worth it.

I work in Analytics as a data analyst. Currently make $100K/year.

I, quite honestly, have no idea what’s next. I’d like to transition into a more strategic decision-making role rather than just pulling data and building dashboards.

- 50k in savings
- Living at home so I voluntarily contribute $500 a month to the home
- Car will be paid off in 2 more months
- No major monthly fees besides car payment and $300/month guitar lessons that I plan to cut in November

I recently applied for a position that I am very well qualified for. I did a phone screening and two interviews. They asked my desired compensation in the phone screening, which I responded that I would need to know more about the responsibilities of role since we were so early in the process. I asked if they could share the budgeted salary and they said they didn’t have it in front of them but that they’d get back to me. It wasn’t brought up again.

In the second interview, the hiring manager asked my desired compensation. I shared it with her and asked if that aligned with the budget for the role. She seemed surprised by the number and said that what I was looking for was more than she anticipated, but when I asked what the budget was for the role, she said that she needs to get with HR to determine what she can do. At that point, it really seemed like I was going to at least get an offer. Well, I got news today that they aren’t moving forward with me as a candidate. They didn’t give me any reason, they actually said that my background was very impressive, but that they were moving on with another candidate. 

I’m curious for some opinions on this- Could it be possible that they couldn’t make me an offer in the salary range that I named?

Hello,

I’m a product owner currently, working on a data analysis tool (won’t go into specifics). In short, my end goal is to combine this skillset with financial expertise (previously a financial market participant, equity and credit research), to either consult or raise capital and allocate it for M&A in the finance/software space. 

I’ve been headhunted for a product project manager role, it’s pretty much project management. I wasn’t sure if it’s a step down from being a product owner. The only advantage I could think of is that it’s more on the business side (my client is currently internal), and that it gives me access and knowledge acquisition across multiple fronts. On the other hand, my current employer is great, it’s a product I understand more and whilst in my department there’s almost nowhere to step up into (unless my manager departs), I think I have enough rep with execs to grow in other departments, on the business/strategy side. 

Would appreciate any advice. Im also cognizant of the fact the world may be headed into a recession, so not sure if role-switching is a high NPV decision. Salary increase is decent, but quality of life increase would be higher, as I’d relocate to a very livable country.

17a6rd5,Salary negotiation help!,"Ok I’ll try to keep it short. Graduated college in may for computer engineering worked at job for a few months while interviewing/applying to other places Got offer at company that gives “new grads” 70k. What leverage and what else could I say to help increase salary. 

Some items in mind: 
- I would have to move to another state.
- Position median salary is 79-82k for the area and credentials, can I leverage still having a few months of professional experience which puts me ahead of real “new grads” with real world experience in communication/cooperation/collaboration etc. (soft skills) 
- I am still employed at current position It just isn’t a fit for me.
- ask how long that hard stamped 70k new grad salary has been in effect (account for inflation) 

Any help would be greatly appreciated I feel my degree is worth something and I want to maximize it without impeding on professionalism and realism.

17a542i,Nursing vs Plumbing?,"Hello everyone! I'm at a crossroads in my life and I'm faced with a big decision. I'm torn between two very different career paths: nursing and plumbing. I know they are quite distinct, but I'm hoping some of you could provide me with insights or advice.  
  
I'm interested in nursing because I want to make a positive impact on people's lives, help those in need, and be part of the healthcare field. On the other hand, plumbing seems appealing due to its stability, potentially high income, and the satisfaction of working with your hands.  
  
I'd love to hear from those of you who have experience in either field.  
  
For Nursing:  
  
What's it like on a day-to-day basis in the nursing field?  
  
How do you find the job satisfaction, work-life balance, and opportunities for growth and advancement?  
  
For Plumbing:  
  
What does a typical day look like as a plumber?  
  
How's the demand for plumbers in your area?  
  
What's the work-life balance and income potential like in plumbing?

I have dreamt of working in big companies, and i finally landed a good one with a great salary. 

The problem is i hate it. I hate everything about this job. Starting from the hierarchy system to 
the co workers. I am not exaggerating when i say it is soul crushing. The way i feel as if i’m just a robot, a machine and they press me for a product. It’s crazy.

i’m new to work and they are already giving me paperwork’s with deadlines to finish without even a proper training. the only form of training i get is when the clients signal through emails me for doing them wrong and give instructions on how to do them right and in those emails my team leaders and coordinators are in CC so it’s humiliating.

I even took my laptop these weekend to work from home. It’s too much and it keeps going. I feel anxiety build up every time i go near my work computer. Today i went to the ambulance to get a Doctor’s note which says i should stay home for 2 days.

17a3pnn,No sure what to do after college?,"Hello,  
I am a senior in college graduating this spring. I am graduating with a major in mathematical finance and a minor in economics as well as being a 4 year D1 athlete. That being said I started my freshman year as a computer science major and I enjoyed it, because of some bad (and good) decisions I ended up changing my major to what it currently is. I had an internship this past summer with Goldman Sachs (GS) in a division that did wealth management for high net worth individuals. GS ultimately offered me a full time roll for out of my undergrad as a financial analyst OR if I wanted they would let me intern again next summer and get my MBA and come in as a associate (higher pay, more options to grow). I have selected the second option and will be doing a one year MBA at my current school. I am very fortunate to be in this situation and attribute it to good luck, hard work, and a good attitude. That being said my head very often wonders towards what could've been if I had stayed a CS major since I enjoyed it so much. I am currently taking the Harvard CS50 python course and plan on taking others afterwards. That being said this course has only re assured that CS is something that really interests me. Is it too late to pursue a career in CS, could I go to grad school for a MS in CS with basic knowledge of programming, are there any other suggestions?

17a3nxg,"New job lied about my job description, what are my options?","I am currently on break on my first day at a new job. A bit of background, I worked as an RBT for 2 years. Due to the long commute of my previous district, I had to leave as they were trying to place me at a school that was even further than what we talked about, that is a story for another day. I also did not agree with ABA Therapy techniques but since I served as more of a teaching assistant I kept the job (as I technically wasn't practicing ABA daily). 
Since leaving that job, I've been firm in not wanting to practice ABA ever again but it's on my resume so new employers can see that I have a background in it. 
I accepted a position as a Kindergarten Assistant at a new school and it was perfect because it's in the area I want to move to as well as only 10 minutes away from my second part time job. My description stated I'd be in the classroom, assisting the lead teaching, reinforcing instruction and helping with those types of things so I was excited as I didn't have the pressure of working in SPED again. 
When I arrived today for my first day, they pulled me into the office and admitted that they ""knew"" this is not the job I came here for but they have a sub in that position currently and really needed help with one student who is currently undiagnosed and working towards getting an IEP but needs support. Feeling backed in a corner I just kind of agreed. They stated I'd be with this student all day everyday and up until they finish with him getting an IEP. They have me collecting data on him as well as doing protocols (things I learned in my time working as an RBT) essentially, they have me doing RBT work. This was not mentioned in the description when I applied nor was it mentioned during the interview when I was told about the job. I was given no heads up that I'd be working 1:1 with a student today or in this position. In fact, during the phone call to schedule the interview, she told me about the class and how they are all great students and they just needed help in the room so I'm a bit confused as to why they'd switch everything at the last second.
Needless to say, I am unhappy. Everything else is great, the class I was intended to be in is perfect and the school is beautiful. The position I was supposed to have seems great and doable but they gave me a completely different job when I got here. I don't have a problem with the student however, this is just not the job I signed up for. I did not want to continue RBT work and I feel a bit blindsided. What are my options here?
It is only my first day and I do still want the Kindergarten Assistant position. I should note that I have trouble with confrontation and I'm already so nervous about ruffling feathers due to this concern but I don't want to do this.",FlamingoTough1553,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1697563643,2023-10-17 17:27:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17a3nxg/new_job_lied_about_my_job_description_what_are_my/,10,2023
17a3lxt,On the fence about a career in Forestry.,"

I’m debating going to Southern Illinois University Carbondale in January to pursue a bachelors in forestry , specializing in Wildlife Habitat Management and Conservation. I already have an associates degree in Horticulture so it would take me 2 years to complete a bachelors in forestry, and I would graduate with 20k in student loans.

I don’t have much going for me currently and don’t know what career to pursue. Forestry caught my attention because I like the idea of being able work outside and have a positive impact on the environment, and it seems like a lower stress job. I’m more so interested in the conservation aspect of forestry although I know that timber harvest is a big part of the job. I also like the idea of living in some beautiful places like east coast, west coast, Hawaii, etc. 

I’m hesitant to pull the trigger because I’m worried that I may have to live in bumfuck nowhere and it may be hard to meet a partner or find places I enjoy too like gyms, restaurants, and decent grocery stores. I’m also anxious that working outside may be worse than my idea of it, for example getting swarmed by mosquitoes all day or wading through thorny brush for hours. I like the idea of working for a state and getting a pension and decent amount of time off and benefits but Im also concerned about earning enough to be able to maybe buy a small house one day or at least not struggle to survive. 

I’m also wondering if there are any other bachelors degrees I could pursue they would be similar or fit me better than forestry? I was thinking of maybe I Ecology. I like the idea of having a career we’re at least for a while I can move around me not be stuck in a office and get outside.

I used to work as a cannabis cultivator but had to give up on my dreams after having cannabis induced psychosis last year, I had to give up on my dream because I no longer want to be tempted to smoke and risk another episode and I’m not interested in growing other plants, so I’ve had to rethink my career path and going back to school to go into forestry seems like the next best bet. Sorry for the long rant but I’m 25 years old currently working a dead end job as a carpet cleaner and it’s depressing feel lost and want to find a rewarding career.

Maybe because this speciality is so new/niche these openings didn’t get a lot of applicants or something because I’m now a candidate for two Director level roles, and have been interviewing this month. 

I find this crazy considering I’m still somewhat of an early career professional, and I have never led a team as a manager.

In your opinion, would taking a role as a Director in this stage of my career be harmful (because I’m honestly rather under qualified) or  beneficial bc I’d be reaching that level so early?

17a0d6y,Need advice?,"I relocated with my boyfriend of 3 years for his new job (an increase in 22k/year for him). I moved 3 hours from my hometown to be with him to a more industrial city. In moving, I left a job in my field (higher education) and took a lower-paying position (dropped 10k a year) that’s not in my field. I had hoped that I would be able to find a new job in my field once moving with him but have not had any luck, partially because I am not bilingual and the city we moved to is bilingual, meaning most jobs in my field (in the public sector) require bilingualism. My current role is “okay,” but it is a more junior position than I was working in prior to moving, is not challenging, and is in the private industry, which I have found I do not like compared to public. I am also finding that I am homesick and miss my family far more than I anticipated I would. I am very close with my siblings (4) and mother. My boyfriend is quite stressed with his new job and often stays late at work, meaning I am alone by myself much of the time. 

I left on very good terms with my previous employer and my previous manager has let me know that there is a maternity leave position opening up soon which she would encourage me to apply for if I’m interested in coming back to my hometown. This new position would be a 1 year contract, at the same pay I had before (60k), and would give me management experience. 

I want to return to my hometown and pursue this opportunity with my previous employer but my boyfriend doesn’t want to move back, and I want to stay with him. I am conflicted because I desperately want a job back in my field as I spent a long time studying to get to where I was before I moved (I have a master’s degree) and miss my family so much, but moving would mean being away from him and going back for a contract. 

I am also worried about the cost of living. We moved to this new city because it is further north than where we were living before and housing is slightly more affordable. 

What do I do? Do I go back for this new position or do I stay and try to keep looking in this new city even though I desperately miss my family and haven’t had luck with finding a job in my field?

This is a company I pursued ever since I got my engineering license, only now that got the opportunity to work here.

The pay and benefits don't bother me. So far I feel ignored. I spend time trying to reach out to senior engineers for work and then help but I get left on read or ignored a good bit. I feel very anxious because that's making me feel like Im asking the wrong people but at the same time when I'm reviewed will they say I wasn't independent enough to find myself work or reach out when I needed help?

This position I'm in is driving me mad. It's affecting my mental health. I had a fear there would be this prejudice against me for being a woman in a male dominated field. I had prepared for this and kind of adopted a ""people will think what they think"" attitude. I also started with 2 other male graduates and they seem busy and always with people. My direct manager is also supposed to do weekly reviews with me but I've been here 9 weeks now and I've talked to him twice, none of the subject matter being how I'm getting on. I've overheard him say the reviews are pointless so I feel he's not the right person to confide in. I truly do want to achieve my best here.

Due to the nature of the question itself, personal information may be exposed, so please only answer this question yourselves without showing the post to anyone else. This post will be deleted in less than a week from now. Thank you in advance.  
  
I (22M) did my bachelor's in Biology in the EU, am now studying Modeling of Neuronal and Cognitive Systems in France, and am looking into either doing a second master's in a different (more humanities-oriented) discipline before my PhD or going directly for a doctorate after this. I'm interested in an academic career that combines many fields into it; I am trying to combine my knowledge from Biology with the humanities, social sciences, and other fields, in order to study academic questions that have a deeply transdisciplinary nature (full list of fields of study in the end; topics that interest me include biocultural evolution of humans on both a behavioral and cognitive level, collective intelligence & group cognition, meta- and applied ethics, social systems ontology, etc). My career aspirations had started from an interest in cognitive and social neuroscience, but slowly grew into bigger and more global questions as I realized I cannot be pinned down into a single discipline and be happy with my work. Ever since I realized this, I planned on doing multiple Master's degrees in different disciplines and then top it all off with a PhD in a topic that interests me the most and will propel my future research onto as broad a path as possible.

Here is the issue: from what I saw when looking up master's degrees, my career will best be served if I study in the UK, US, Netherlands, or maybe in a Nordic country (only for specific degrees due to the prerequisites for master's applications, which is a huge criterion given my intention to go interdisciplinary). In Sweden, a country in which I would love to live and build my career, my Master's options are rather limited, because they require a minimum amount of ECTS (uni credits) in specific courses or fields in order to be accepted (same for other Nordic countries), which means e.g. I probably can't apply for a Philosophy degree if I previously studied Biology or Mathematical/Computational Modeling stuff. I am aware that there are MOOCs for me to take, too, I just don't know what is the best course of action, what can be left for a MOOC and what must necessarily be certified with an MA or MSc. And the cherry on top is that I probably can't do more than 2 master's and a PhD for financial reasons (I'll have to start working at some point, right?). What would be most sensible for me to do in order to end up exploring most, if not all, of the research topics I love?  
  
List of my fields of interest outside my current master's (I want to cover as much as possible):  
\* Cognitive Psychology & Neuroscience  
\* Cognitive/Evolutionary/Social Anthropology  
\* Human (Behavioral) Ecology  
\* Philosophical/Psychological Anthropology  
\* Sustainability policy

179ri1q,People hate me and it's mutual,"I (33f) work in customer service currently. Night shift at one of the only three places open in town all night since the rona. 

Its not exactly hard, but the conditions here are taxing on my already weak immune system and I also have a hard time being friendly with people I barely know. Probably some autistic trait or something. 
My problem is that people literally avoid me when I'm working. Im not sure what kind of rumors there are about me in town but I know a few ex friends of mine are the BIGGEST shit talkers in town. I left all of my former friendships when I realized how toxic they were and didn't want to be involved in their constant drama and competition. 
I know my face can be a bit scary as well. Since the old PTSD episode, my RBF is FIERCE! There are days at work when I can't hold on to a happy faced facade as well, so my voice is a robotic monotone in order to keep my sadness or anger in check. Not always, but enough, apparently that people will pull up and immediately leave when they see that I'm working. 
I hate selling alcohol and tobacco as well. Drunk people are infuriating. 

What kind of job SHOULD I get? I hate this place, this town, the people, my job, my home and my entire lifestyle. Is there anything I could try starting out with that isn't as customer oriented? The sun makes me sick as well so it would have to be night shift.

179pjfl,Thoughts on reneging on an internship offer at a Fortune 500 energy company,"Hi everyone, I'm currently in a situation where I may have to accept an internship offer and renege it later. I interned at a Fortune 500 energy company in a finance role this past summer and got a return offer for next summer (I am currently a junior in college). I'm currently recruiting for another industry and have some superdays/final rounds this week and next week, but my deadline to accept my return offer is tomorrow. I already got it extended by one week and they told me they can't extend it any further. 

My recruiter from last year at the energy company has been really helpful and does not want me to renege, but understands if I have to (I've been able to talk to him about this in confidence without him telling the recruiting team at the company). He offered a scenario where I decline the return offer and if my interviews this week and next week don't lead to any offers, he can help me negotiate my way back into the company, but I'm not very confident in that working out (he himself said it is far from a 100% chance of working). 

I know I'll be blacklisted from the energy company if I renege, but I'm worried about long-term effects. The energy industry is huge and I'll likely be in this city (I go to college in the same city I interned) for a long time, potentially coming back to the energy industry in the future.  If I renege, what are the chances this comes back to bite me in the future, say if I'm interviewing at another energy company that may have contacts with the one I interned at last summer?

I appreciate any advice, thank you!",muchfatq,3,1.0,0,1697515121,2023-10-17 03:58:41,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/179pjfl/thoughts_on_reneging_on_an_internship_offer_at_a/,10,2023
179oqu6,"I have a job in entertainment, but I also love community theatre. Do I change jobs?","I currently work backstage at a non-profit that hosts a slew of events from Orchestra concerts to Broadway musicals, and concerts. I get to meet some really cool artists and help with their stay. I basically deal with all hospitality, caterings, and hotel/transportation. I really like my job, it’s a great company and great people and really unique experiences. 

However, I also have a deep love (special interest) in theatre (specifically plays and musicals)  I’m an actor, director, designer, and stage manager. I’m currently directing a musical and I love it. I love acting and designing just as much - I am much more passionate about this side of theatre. And as much as I love my job, they naturally have very overlapping schedules. It’s become very difficult to try and balance my shows at work and my own rehearsals.

Now I’m stuck. Do I go to a job that will quite literally make me miserable, but opens up my schedule to commit to doing community theatre, occasionally paid. And allow opportunities to work on the side of theatre that I really have a passion for? It’s also good to know that my girlfriend, who I live with, is also a community theatre performer. 

Or do I turn my focus to my job and settle for that? It’s not what I want to do, but I can still experience these shows from a new perspective. It’s worth noting too that any show that I work on, if I’m not needed during the performance, I get 2 free tickets (which I’m not often needed during every performance of the Broadway shows) so I can see shows more often. It also doesn’t pay great. So.

179ooih,How to be completely honest to VP that she hired a completely incompetent manager and she needs to stop covering for her?,"TLDR: my boss hired an incompetent manager who earns a 6 figure salary despite not doing anything and my coworkers are picking up the slack while being severely underpaid. How do I bring this up?

Hi! So this company I work for is fairly small. I report directly to the VP but also help out in various departments. I work in conjunction with a dept that my VP oversees, in which 2 of my aunts also work in. My VP hired a manager for that department 8 months ago — they haven’t had a manager for almost 3 years. 

My boss (the VP) told me that the new manager she hired was extremely skilled in our HRM system, yet lacks experience. Apparently our CFO didn’t want to hire her but my boss insisted that she’s right for the job. 

Well, well, well. 8 months later and this manager is still COMPLETELY clueless about her job. She doesn’t know the basics of her job (processing) and heavily relies on her staff, my aunts included. She’s been making countless of mistakes and is also very rude to others when gets called out for it. Despite this, my boss insists that she’s right for the job. She thinks that my coworkers are just ganging up on the new manager bc she’s newer and fairly younger than them. The manager even admitted to one of her staff that she lied on her interview because she just really needs a job AND that she is planning her wedding while on the clock bc she’s not doing anything. But my boss won’t believe any of us. 

I work with the manager too and I agree that she is dumb as a rock. She doesn’t understand what’s going on and just memorizes steps without really comprehending them. I’ve gone head to head with her and thankfully, my boss sided with me. DESPITE THAT, she still doesn’t believe that the manager is incompetent.

Now, this manager earns $110k a year. My aunts and the other staff earn around $25 AN HOUR. And they have to pull so much OT just to get work done bc the manager creates more problems than actually being helpful.

I’m fairly close to my boss (I’m essentially a glorified assistant of hers) and the few times I complained abt the manager, she actually listened and believed me. But it’s just completely unfair to the rest of that dept and it’s taking a toll on my aunts’ health as well. One of them had to go home early about twice now bc her blood pressure went up after her manager belittled and argued with her. They think they’re being so underpaid while the manager is getting paid to do nothing. 

So, should I talk to my boss about this? She really trusts me and I’m something like a confidant to her as well. She is very nice and understanding yet this seems to be the hill she will die on. But I’m scared that this might just sour our relationship. How can I go about telling her this? She’s very hard headed and won’t admit that she’s wrong.

As a note, my aunts are middle aged Asian women. They kind of just keep their head down and are scared to speak up. My boss is a white middle aged woman and the manager is an Asian woman in her 40s.

I wouldn't consider myself as someone who was a very value person at the company lol. But, I did receive multiple awards. Never any raises though.

I noticed multiple have left that company though who seemed like top performers in my opinion. All I can think of is that the weren't receiving raises most likely.

One thing I do notice is all the executives are pretty much the same and they never leave very often. So I had this theory of ""maybe the executives are just greedy people and are trying to take advantage of people"". Is that most likely the case from what this sounds like?

179khpf,Career advice?,"Hello,  
I am a senior in college graduating this spring. I am graduating with a major in mathematical finance and a minor in economics as well as being a 4 year D1 athlete. That being said I started my freshman year as a computer science major and I enjoyed it, because of some bad (and good) decisions I ended up changing my major to what it currently is. I had an internship this past summer with Goldman Sachs (GS) in a division that did wealth management for high net worth individuals. GS ultimately offered me a full time roll for out of my undergrad as a financial analyst OR if I wanted they would let me intern again next summer and get my MBA and come in as a associate (higher pay, more options to grow). I have selected the second option and will be doing a one year MBA at my current school. I am very fortunate to be in this situation and attribute it to good luck, hard work, and a good attitude. That being said my head very often wonders towards what could've been if I had stayed a CS major since I enjoyed it so much. I am currently taking the Harvard CS50 python course and plan on taking others afterwards. That being said this course has only re assured that CS is something that really interests me. Is it too late to pursue a career in CS, could I go to grad school for a MS in CS with basic knowledge of programming, are there any other suggestions?

The company recently got acquired by a large production company here in London, which means they got a lot of big jobs and currently have me working with one particular guy. I've been with this company, and this working alongside this guy, for almost a year and am torn.

The guy is extremely smart in regards to workflow, knowledge on the tech we use, etc. but he's awful to work with. He's super anal about how things are done and more often than not expects me to know what he's wanting most of the time. It's almost impossible keeping up with him and any time I try to explain myself he simply tells me to not argue or get defensive with him. In fact, a lot of people on set don't like him either because of how he acts with other departments. On a previous production our boss got contacted about his behaviour and I was asked personally if he should be kicked off production or not, and regrettably I said he should stay. If I had a choice now I wouldn't work with him again.

I know a guy who runs a similar company but is more independent and works smaller jobs like commercials and music videos, working on big stuff like TV shows and films for second unit or pick-up stuff. He's pretty cool and we get along quite well, but he's got beef with the company I work with that I want little to know about.

I'm very torn because my friend has an offer for me and I'd love to take it since we get along so well and things seem to run more smoothly on his end, but it would mean giving up the big-scale work I'm currently doing.

179g6pf,Is there something I’m missing about how to get into an adjacent field?,"
Feeling pretty discouraged so any advice is appreciated. 

I currently work in the same industry I’ve been in for 8 yrs, sales/lending. 

I really want to break out and do something salaried in finance/biz dev/project management and being remote or hybrid is super important to me . 

I never tried to find a different job bc I was making 150-180k a year in commission and anything would be a pay cut. 

I would be really happy even with an 80k+ salaried job and I really think I could easily perform well in risk, biz dev, or project management bc I have a lot of experience in managing financial processes and finance in general but now having spent over a year applying to jobs on LinkedIn or indeed I haven’t even gotten an interview. 

What do I need to do? I just want something stable that will expand my resume. I only get offers for the same exact job I’m already doing. 


I have a bachelors degree also.

ETA, I would even be happy with B2B sales since the base is usually comfortable but I am always told that companies won’t touch you if you don’t already have B2B experience and I only have consumer sales experience. 

My bf is a resume writer and wrote up mine, so I feel like it’s not the problem. 

Additionally, wanted to say that I know a decent amount about marketing too (mainly social media marketing) since starting a side business and learning a lot about that, but I don’t know how much of it is transferable or what types of positions it transfers to. And hesitate to mention my knowledge of SM marketing since it’s not like I’ve grown a big account or anything. I just know the concepts and how to apply them.",pinkandbluee,1,1.0,4,1697489017,2023-10-16 20:43:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/179g6pf/is_there_something_im_missing_about_how_to_get/,10,2023
179g3jv,Leaving a job you like for more money?,"I make about 66k/year currently and like the people I work with. I have good performance, and like the work. There are opportunities for advancement, but not merit-based pay increases. I've been with my current company for 2 years. There's a job posting I'd likely be a top applicant for at a company I worked for in the past. It was the company I was at before I switched to my current job. I'm currently remote, and the new posting is remote as well. 

I worked at my previous company for 5 years and had 4 different roles there. I enjoyed 2 of 4, but didn't enjoy my first and the last roles. The first was paper-pushing, and I left the last because of some micromanagement, and felt like I had grown all I could in that role. 

The baseline salary for the new job is $85k and I believe I could negotiate for a bit more than that given my experience. I know that there are no guarantees I'd actually GET the job, but I've begun wondering. Would it be good to leave a job you genuinely like to go to a significantly higher-paying one?

179ftor,Is It Time to Say Goodbye to My Job? Seeking Your Insights.,"&#x200B;

I am a (27M) who recently started working at a company in April as an Account Manager in the United States. 

  
I've come to learn that the product is not that great and I really don't see myself working here long term. A lot of my customers that I have inherited have been underserved for years and a lot are cancelling.

  
Management thinks that this is my fault, despite only starting a few months ago. They have been asking me a lot of questions that a new employee just would not know. I get it, someone has to fall on the sword but I don't think it's fair.

  
I rushed into this job as it was remote and was seeking a remote position as I had a long distance relationship and needed money. This is no longer the case as I have saved almost every penny since starting (About 20K USD) and I don't have any debt.

  
To avoid falling into the trap of accepting a job out of desperation of getting out of my current one, I am thinking of leaving my role and focusing full time on finding a new job that fits the long term.  
Other things to note:

  
1) I anticipate a big bulk of customers leaving in January and February through conversations  
2) I am planning to move back to my homeland in Europe (Finland but I am American citizen as well) in the first quarter of 2024  
3) I graduated university in 2017, worked for 3.5 years as an Account Manager in Chicago, worked in Portugal for 8 months, family got sick in US so I moved home, to Chicago, now I am at this job. A little bit concerned with short stints but I can explain them.

  
It's really stressing me out everyday and making me wonder if I am cut out for this kind of work.  
Any input, good or bad will be helpful.",cjproblemo,1,1.0,3,1697488117,2023-10-16 20:28:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/179ftor/is_it_time_to_say_goodbye_to_my_job_seeking_your/,10,2023
179fcb6,"ChatGPT couldn't help me with my career unsteadiness, maybe you guys could...","I (30m) been working since I was 19. I never had a proper mindset of having a dedicated career, like I should study this and this so I could become this this...

I've always jumped into whatever came to my life. When I was 19 I started my bachelor degree in Sociology right after high school. Don't ask why... There was a girl in our class and she introduced me to her Digital Communications/ Social Media Agency as an intern. I could enter easily because I knew some HTML and was interested in informatique and tech always. The hours were flexible, I worked for some 3 years there. Full-time on summers and half-time when there is school. I did many different kind of ""technical"" jobs there but with no clear direction of where my career was going, I was just going with the flow. Anyways, I've learnt  digital marketing deeply, Facebook/Insta/Google ads (we worked with big brands so I could learn in detail), social media content and community management (increasing engagement overall), design (improved a lot on Photoshop and Illustrator), copywriting, video editing, Wordpress website creation, etc.

Then things didn't work out and I left, I wanted to focus on my school because I wasn't able to graduate since 2 years because of my absence. I decided not to work on anything for a while but I had 1 or 2 freelance clients through the people I knew. Then an old friend offered me to work as a Business Developer for one of his foreigner friends who would be opening a branch of his business in our country... I didn't know what a Business Dev. was, searched it, had an interview and starting working with them. I was naive and had no idea what I was doing... I was trying to learn a lot, trying find connections, making Business Intelligence reports to sell, etc. Some corporate reports were looking very cool because of my Creative Agency background. But nothing worked and I left. 

Then this friend who introduced me to this company offered to be partners as him being the developer and me being the marketer/operations manager. I accepted again not knowing where it was going and worked on this project for almost a year. I had lots of hope but nothing came out of it, mostly because we didn't have capital and didn't know how to make a business profitable. Looking back to it, many things would be different. Anyways, I should get prepared for my marriage coming in a few months and was generating zero income with this startup so I left it.

At the same time another friend of mine was founding a cybersecurity product company and he offered to hire me as a Business Developer. I don't think he knew what he wanted really, and I again had no vision or strategy for myself and I accepted. I did what I could do, I didn't have a formal education on how to be a ""Business Developer"" I just helped at any point I could, especially in creative documents and meeting with people since I was a presentable type in the company (everyone else was software developers).

I worked in this company for 2 years and then decided to move the country of my wife (France) -- again with no vision or plan. We came to France, not Paris but a moderate sized city, I was sure that I could find a job speaking English (silly me) but it didn't happen. Pandemic started on 2020 and we were locked to our homes, I had very little chance of networking, socializing, meeting people and finding opportunities or learning French.

I've found some freelance digital marketing jobs (like creating websites, making designs, social media management, etc.) and survived with this income for a while. Then I also started working with my old company remotely but I wasn't able to do much from far for a Business Dev. and it didn't work out. The problem is I didn't learn the technical aspect of the cybersecurity product in this company. And that's what really makes the money, harsh truth, many companies don't want to hire non-technical employees in this subdivision of cybersecurity (it's not all cybersecurity but a popular section of it). But finding freelance works in my city and working remotely for my old company (even though the payment was little), I was doing fine economically.

Beginning of 2022 I was able to land a cybersecurity consultant job in Paris as an English speaker. But most of the clients (like 80%) were French speaking (I still didn't speak good French) and there wasn't much need for my services since I didn't have technical foundation (I didn't know how to make integrations, implementation or deployment of these products). I could do cool presentations and I was learning the management of a technical tool. The trial period has passed and they laid me off. This was one the Big4 consultancy companies, a very big company globally, but I was laid off... This has traumatized me to be honest. I lost my self-esteem and wasn't even able to apply for new jobs in cybersecurity field. I was in denial saying myself ""I can find a job like this easily..."" but it never happened. And I told all my clients in my city that I was stopping my Digital Marketing services so nobody approached to me as well.

2022 summer, I worked as a private driver in south of France... I know, right? It had nothing to do with anything. Someone I knew there suggested me this, I told myself I would never be a driver for people... Then I became a driver. This city is a very luxurious city in the south of France (Cote d'Azur) and I worked there for 2 months and made very good money, in fact the best income I ever made with 2 months of work. It was the holiday season and then I returned home.

We travelled some with my wife, then came back home. I didn't do marketing for my 1-person Digital Marketing company, I knew I could find clients but I just didn't search anyone. I kind of wanted to continue in cybersecurity but felt like I was excluded from the inner-circle. I stopped working with my old company. I virtually had zero income for a while. Then I opened a booth in a festival in my city for a month. It lasted a month, didn't make much revenue but it was my first commercial experience, doing everything myself and gaining hot cash. I liked it. But didn't do anything similar later on.

2023 summer passed and till now I basically have zero income, my wife has left her job too for a while, we're depending on our savings which will last us for a few months (maximum 6) but depending on the savings never did good to anybody.

Now, being a 30 years old with no direction in career, I don't know where I stand or what I should do. Should I focus on my Digital Marketing company and find clients and grow it? Or should I focus on improving my French (which is good now but still not perfect) and get some technical formations on cybersecurity and find a job in France? (This is the option I want most but it's very hard not having a network in a new country and even if I get a formation, when I have job interviews they will ask me about my experience on those technical topics and I will only have formations- which will make me start from the beginning with a low salary). Or should I simply start working for a digital marketing agency in my city for a not big of a salary?

I don't know what to pursue and this paralyzes me and I can't do anything, I haven't been doing anything for a long while... I'm **open** to moving to a new city or country but I kinda like this city and not keen on moving much. My wife is very understanding and she doesn't push me for anything and she is always like ""money is not important"" but I know that I need to generate an income, for myself and for my family. Or it will go very badly at some point.

179dxq7,What role/position would be suitable for me?,"I’m currently in a situation for the first time in my life, that I’m looking for employment. I (27m) have been working within my fathers construction company, my entire working life. I left school at 15 and my dad put me to work on sites, I learned my trade. Gradually as I got older, he started to bring me into the management side of the business and for the last few years, I’ve been a joint partner with him, we run the company together. It’s a great setup and I’ve got a good life. 

However, we are based in a small rural town in Scotland. This is where I grew up and have lived my whole life. I always knew I’d eventually leave the nest, as did my father. I’ve never settled here at all. 

Well the time for me to fly is now and I’m just absolutely lost as to what position and/or industry I’d be suited for. I have 0 qualifications, my high school exams are not worth thinking about. I’ve basically been handed my positions and learned as I go. This isn’t exactly desirable to any employers looking for staff.

I’m planning on moving to Glasgow. Benefit being, I have no time frame. I’m not out of a job and I can take all the time I need. But I am lost as to what industry and positions. Part of me wants a complete fresh start, leave the construction industry and venture elsewhere. 

I’m sitting on a good salary right now. I live comfortably. By no means am I ultra wealthy. But I don’t think I can drop a huge wage bracket either.

I’m looking for some advice or recommendations. I know that I’m a good manager/team leader and capable of these roles. But without qualifications, I’m just any joe blogs off the street.

Here are the pros and cons of each: 

Staying Pros: Great people, possibility to move up in the agency, awesome fulfilling work with amazing clients. Cons: pay sucks, and they're going back to a hybrid 2 days a week deal which means I'd have to move, which will be expensive and stressful.

Leaving Pros: pay increase, fully remote position, reputable agency. Cons: I wouldn't be working on a great brand, it's boring at best, controversial at worst (but I might be able to jump around and work on other clients later. not 100% sure though, so I'm assuming I won't right now).

179cqnm,20F looking for career suggestions/Advice,"TL;DR at bottom .  
  
For the longest time, I'm just left wondering wtf i should do with my life. It's not good to compare urself w others but when u see literally everyone around u (family/friends/ppl) succeeding including yr younger sibling, it starts to sting way too bad.  
  
I'm so lost to the point I'm considering going to a career counselor when I'm in my 3rd yr of Clg which i think is anyways useless, they are always way overpriced and I've done a million personality/ career quizzes. There is just nothing that comes from the inside except despair. I have no idea who can help me anymore. Everyone has their own thing and everyone is busy in their hectic lives.  
  
For starters, i could never really and still can't decide what to pursue, or really have a passion for anything i won't get bored off or have any skills to get jobs. I'm currently doing my B.Tech Electronics and Communication engineering which was a dumb asf choice i hate it with my life and struggle to pass each sem.  
  
When I was in school I was always really ahead of everyone else, always class topper, then reality hit in 11th/12th PCM. I cud'nt even do that anymore and never did any extracurriculars either bze i thought its a waste of time. I was always academically oriented till covid hit and interest for studies and life was lost.  
  
I cud'nt decide for the life of me what to take in college, but since i remotely liked physics and science ( never looked outside that category bze I used to look down at other streams, typical indian parents mindset was instilled in me), I thought abt B.Sc physics bze maybe studying it could be fun but didnt see myself as a teacher or a person who could write papers in physics after college .  
  
My dad more or less pushed for engineering and since i had nothing going on for me i took B.tech ECE hoping i'd have some physics electives in there, bze its the closed engineering to physics . I Truly despise coding tho.  
  
Initially thought id go for something like photonics engineering. No particular reason . I thought working w lazers/ optic fibres would be cool. But it was only available as a masters so i just choose something as a base.  
  
Really wish i could go back but ashamed to say even if i went back to the time i was still picking out clg majors , I'd be clueless. Now ik lots of ppl will be like u still got time to figure stuff out , ur young and most ppl don't know. For the most part i doubt that's true. I quite literally see everyone around me actively pursuing their passions .  
  
Maybe they did'nt do too well in school and chose the wrong subs, but since clg they really picked up the pace and are so good at the things they like now, even worked jobs and everything. Like proper talented in their fields. Then there is me who is stuck. I even know someone who at the last minute changed their entire line from medical to product design for clg and took a gap yr. She doesn't regret it and tbh im v happy fr her but also v jealous bze im basically her if she had stayed in medical. And it's my own fault.  
  
I chose engineering as a safety hoping I'd figure something out but I hate it and i truly suck at it and no way wanna work IT jobs or even core electronics. I have no knowledge in this field at all inspite of 3 yrs in clg. College is stressful and hectic as hell , makes me wanna die everyday only. So i gotta figure out something before i go back  
  
Since 2nd year I have tried to look outside my field but I’m so bloody clueless. I don't even have any skills or anything I'm passionate abt and istg my attention span and lack of interact in anything makes shit so hard. Even when I try new things like knitting , gym or literally anything. I have 0 motivation. Nothing motivates me or makes me happy I always get bore of something after a couple days and leave things halfway .  
  
For this reason , its even so hard to figure out what to do . I am so so so lost man, like its hell embarrassing at this point . I sometimes get ideas about things to do or try as hobbies but it never gets implemented bze of so much mindblock.  
  
Been struggling w anxiety/stress disorder and depression since 2020 and nothing gets better bze whenever this topics comes up to mind, I have another breakdown just filed with so much sadness that I have no purpose.  
  
Probably the only thing I have been good at it being a good friend. Going out of my way to make a person happy, used to bring me happiness . Id always try to make sure others have a good time even if it's at my expense, I don’t care if I embarrass myself as long as I see them happy. And I always have crazy stories to tell bze of my unfortunate luck.  
  
TL;DR  
  
In short, I'm a 3rd yr ECE student. I despise engineering and want to switch fields. I have no idea wtf I should do bze i'm not good at anything . Learning new skills is also Extremely hard when the interest for most things don't come naturally and I leave things halfway. I looked into social media marketing/ events/ personal assistants/ data analytics , not really able to land any jobs currently where I live. Plus no experience / course done in them. Not really sure what’s the next step for me. I have 5 month vacay from clg and already proper wasted 2.5 . Think rest 2.5 also gonna go down the drain when I can do is eat and sleep.  
  
I’m literally in bed all day napping multiple hrs just to escape reality and stress. Everyday just seems way too stressful for me when i try to do anything related to figuring out my life bze i just get a cloud of tension over my head knowing i'm the biggest disappointment to my friends and family and prolly b living on the streets.  
  
The thing is, I so badly wanna genuinely work, contribute, be productive and earn money and be skilled in something I like. And its so tough having 0 clue about it. I can’t even start anywhere if I don’t know. And this same story is going on since 5+ yrs .",SuitableVictory274,1,1.0,0,1697480394,2023-10-16 18:19:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/179cqnm/20f_looking_for_career_suggestionsadvice/,10,2023

179c6rf,"Nearly joined Chelsea academy, now work as a consultant, confused about this unfilfilled dream - need advice","I have always been great at sport. I started playing tennis at age 5 and was regularly selected for competitions and tournaments. I was the best in my group. At school I was one of the fastest runners, almost winning the cross-country runs with little to no training. I was selected for the athletics teams, the sprints, the long distance. I was the best in primary, secondary school and college at tennis. I didn't start playing football until around age 8 but when I did, it changed my life. I only started playing football on the recommendation of my friends - I played at lunch time and enjoyed it but one day a friend pushed my brother and I to try out at their club. After our first football game for the club, the manager asked our parents, ""which club did they come from?"" He was bewildered when my parents responded, ""this is their first game.""

I progressed quickly after that and fell in love with football. Funnily enough, I only enjoyed watching football with other people - it wasn't really something I enjoyed doing by myself - actually playing football was something I much preferred to do. Every single spare second I got I would be running around the garden with a football, dribbling, shooting, doing kicky ups. I would make little videos on YouTube and share them with my friends.

Our school's PE coaches saw that a few of us had talent and referred us on to Friday football sessions, part of what I believe was a general Chelsea progression framework. We played there regularly for a few months before I was selected to go to the next level, one level below the Chelsea Academy. I was about 8 years old at this point. I would train Monday evenings, Friday evenings and have two matches on the weekends. I was still playing tennis on Tuesdays or Wednesdays. My life revolved around sport. My new 'Chelsea' coach would come to watch my home club football games from Chelsea. Now it was getting serious. 

I captained my school football team, I won player of the match countless times, game after game. I received player of the year award from my home club. I really thought I was something. I thought of nothing else but my dream to become a football player when I was older. I didn't give a crap about school, about grades. I was in the top sets for maths and english at school but I would say my grades were upper-average. My Dad supported Chelsea too which added to this whole exciting dynamic.

Myself and the 'Chelsea' people were going to visit the Chelsea academy and train with them when it was announced that my family and I would be moving country, far, far away. And so we moved for two years and had a great time and enjoyed the sun but it put my dreams of ever becoming a footballer into the ground. The level of football there was extremely poor and so was the education and when we returned to the UK, after not training much at all, it was clear my ability and general confidence, especially as puberty struck, had fallen dramatically. I was so confused at the time - I must have blocked it out of my head because thinking back to that time I cannot remember understanding that moving meant there was little chance for me to pursue a career in the future.

I have struggled with coming to terms with this fact since. And indeed, upon returning, I remember a stark day where I realised that I was going to have to change my mindset and approach far from the 'not giving a crap about grades' to pursuing it relentlessly. When we returned, we now sat in many of the lower sets, and in the lowest for the languages. I felt humiliated because many of my primary school friends, also at this secondary school, were some of the smartest in our year, sitting in all of the top sets. I was not used to this feeling. So, at age 14, I began to turn it around. By GCSEs, I had received respectable grades. By A-Levels, I achieved some of the best grades in the school. I went to a top-class university, graduating in applied mathematics. Now I work in London in consulting and am known as the GOAT for all things sport at my work.

But, and apologies for the rambling, I feel like I am in a career not suited to that childlike curiosity and passion for football and sport. Back then, I didn't give a crap about grades and school - all I wanted to do was become a footballer. But I changed that around to survive, to be secure, to keep my options open. I always feel so much sadness and regret and pain when I think back to the fact that I 'could have been something', in terms of football. I just watched the Beckham documentary series on Netflix and saw myself in the young version of him. I related to his love of the game. 

Is it silly that I still feel the pain? That I can't let go of this dream that I had? It feels like there is unfinished business. I tried to put this feeling away at university where it came upon me strongly, after working relentlessly during GCSE's and A Levels to get there. I might not have even become a professional footballer (the chances are unlikely). I may not have been able to deal with the pressure (I recall being very shy with my team members back then and on a few occasions said I was sick so I could stay at home). I wouldn't have been able to become a more well-rounded person, studying maths, reading philosophy, going to unviersity. And there are a number of things I am very proud of in the past few years: writing a book and publishing it, doing triathlons, raising over £50k for charity, getting a job in London, etc. I did a half marathon in 1 hour 25 minutes yesterday, after two years of injury (from football at university), and have signed up for a marathon, a half-ironman, and an ironman next year. I hope to get a sub 3-hour marathon and hopefully a sub 12 hour ironman.

There are so many things on paper that are absolutely incredible but I think that perhaps it falls short in my subconscious, falls short of the dream I had of being a Chelsea player and being the only thing I ever wanted to be: a professional football player. Playing casually isn't enough for me. 

I work in what many would class as a dream job - strategy consulting with a progression towards an incredibly lucrative career. And indeed, there is plenty of meaningful work to be done with international development and the energy transition area but why then do I often think that I wouldn't really mind working in a pub or a cafe, with the extra time that would give me. Yes, at some point I have to 'grow up' and recognise that there are certain realities that have to be faced, that we can't have it all but I really would much rather be working in a dogs kennel than this - I would be enjoying it a lot more.

Is this all silly? Do you have any advice? Do I perhaps still hold an unhealthy view, built up in (compared to the scale of the world we live in) small environments (school), that I am better than I really am at sport? Should I switch career to something more sports focused like attempting to become a physio at a football club or looking for careers in that industry? Should I try out for local football clubs and try to become semi-pro even though I am in my early 20s? Or should I somehow try and let it go and recognise the absolute privilege I have for being in the position I am in now? Is it just part of growing up that we let go of dreams, no matter how passionate we were about them, like this one? Because whenever I come back to sports and especially football, and I am praised, I feel that ache, that knowledge of the potential that lies untapped. I often feel like an imposter in my career and in life- people look at me and say that I am very intelligent (rather a lot of hard work) but I still, in many ways, have the same attitude as I once did - this is not really what I care about. I didn't choose maths at uni because I was passionate but because it kept my options open.

I appreciate that there is a LOT of information here so if you got this far, thank you so much for reading and have a great day.

And in addition, he is not that familiar with the methods I learned during my thesis, so he told me I have to teach him, therefore also for that there is no help. So I’m really scared now: how to start such a project, am I really capable of having my own (original) ideas, using interesting methods, or will I be a complete failure so I shouldn’t even start? 😅

179a697,Office Gossip Negatively Impacting my Performance,"Figured this was as good a place as any to post this, and I'm not sure how to handle this.  
  
I've been in banking for about seven or eight years depending on where you start the clock, and at my current institution for about seven months - everyone else in my department has been here for a minimum of five years. It's an incredibly insular group that I haven't been able to crack.  
  
My co-workers flat out do not like me. On more than one occasion I've received gossipy skype/teams messages about myself that were obviously intended for someone else, my manager is constantly coming to me with nebulous ""complaints"" about my ""behavior"" that have been relayed to her, and in some cases they've actively sabotaged me professionally (ie training me how to do something incorrectly and then complaining to management that I am doing it wrong). I should note that it's just the people in this department - everyone else in the office, from the leadership team on down, loves me. I truly have no idea what any of these peoples' problem with me is, and I have never had this problem in my entire life. People generally like me quite a lot!  
  
Normally I wouldn't care that much, except that I've now been written up for the first time in my life due to ""continued poor performance,"" and a key factor identified there is my ""lack of engagement with my colleagues.""

1797qb2,Advice for those who quit software development in their early 20s,"Hi.  
I am 22 years old 3rd year mathematical engineering student. I spent the last 4 years fully on software development. I realized that I don't like this job. My neck hurts and 95 percent of the work in the industry is about finding solutions to existing problems. Product manager type jobs seem to suit me, but I don't know what do i need and how I can find a job. So far, I have done a 6-month internship at a startup in the software field and I have established a few websites. The most famous received 35 thousand visitors. My department provides me with a mathematics background and a few software courses. Is there a any advice for me?  


I always wanted to be an engineer because I liked being able to produce something whenever I wanted without depending on anyone. But I realized that bootstrapping is a bit of a thing of the past. If you are going to start a business now, you need to invest more million dollars and move forward.",whyyoucrazygosleep,1,0.6700000166893005,0,1697467717,2023-10-16 14:48:37,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1797qb2/advice_for_those_who_quit_software_development_in/,10,2023
1797dkj,Career Change at 40?,"Hey all,

Been in tech all my life and fully understand that I've been fortunate with money and job flexibility, so this may come off as whining or complaining to some, so apologies in advance.   


Essentially, the tech world is wearing me down.  From seeing a new (often scary) technology everyday to just feeling trapped behind a computer all day I am done.  I've been feeling this since prior to Covid and the feelings just aren't going away, unfortunately.

I would consider myself an outgoing person who can ham it up with people, and the tech world has always been problematic for that aspect of my personality, even more so in recent years.  

Is there any type of profession or job that one can transition to outside of tech that pays?  I am fine taking a pay cut to be happier in life, but I don't think I can go back to entry level wages as I have a family to help support.  I feel like even trying a career swap to stay in the $100k range is probably impossible, so I am willing to go even less than that.

I've just been in tech for so long that I wouldn't even know where to start or what type of industry to look into.  I am open to just about any idea, if you've got them.  From sales to manual labor.  I am not looking for someone who has this magical job that I am looking for (though that wouldn't hurt!), I am moreso looking for industries that you may know of that are friendlier to career transfers or people looking for a change type thing? 

Thanks in advance!",succession_plan,2,1.0,2,1697466780,2023-10-16 14:33:00,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1797dkj/career_change_at_40/,10,2023
1796w72,I think I messed up the documentation for a candidate and now he might get terminated,"I don’t know what to do, I am writing this feeling super guilty. A bit of background: I am 23F and I joined this company straight out of my MBA. This is my first job ever and I am in an HRBP role. When I joined my team, my boss had asked the others in my team to give me tasks so that I learn how things work here. At my company, one HR person is allotted a few departments and they’re the sole point of contact for the employees in that department. So one of my colleagues was on her notice and had asked me to check the documents for this one guy and release his offer. When I checked the documents, I found that for one of his companies he does not have a relieving letter. He had an absconding letter stating that he did not show up to work from xyz date. When I asked my colleague about what I’m supposed to do, she said that since it’s dated, we will consider it. Now she has been gone for over 3 months and this guy has joined too. However, our riskcheck team has not highlighted this and said that if the guy does not bring forth the documents, he will be terminated. I contacted the HR team of his previous organisation and they refuse to give his relieving letter as he had absconded.

Their departure would wreak havoc for everyone at the firm and would definitely be stressful. Their performance has been subpar recently as well which definitely makes sense now.

1794uc7,First office job. Have a lot of email/meeting anxiety,"
I’m 3 months into a new job and I’m so worried about breaking the unspoken rules/making a mistake that it’s affecting my performance   

It’s a huge company and because I’m new, I’m still not 100% sure on who does what and who is best to ask about what, so I often feel stuck 

Like today for instance, someone sent me an email asking for my approval on an update they made to a report that my team produces - the report is something my team member (I’ll call her Jill) had been managing before I arrived, and I want to CC her into the email to ask for her input since it’s her area of expertise but at the same time part of me me worries that I might be expected to just “OK” the change and CC’ing Jill would make me look like I need my hand held too much. It’s a pretty minor change and I don’t see any issues with it but also I don’t want to jump the gun and approve a change that I might not have the authority to approve. I’m considering just privately messaging Jill to ask if I should be looping her on on emails in relation to this report going forward but idek how to word that question. Stuff like this makes me procrastinate on responding to people so much

Also when it comes to meetings, I don’t know when to schedule them. Sometimes I send an email asking some questions and then at the end of their response they say “let me know if you want to talk about this further” - does that mean they want me to schedule a meeting? Or can I just keep emailing? Another example is - if my manager mentions that me, her (my manager) and X person need to have a meeting, but then my manager doesn’t schedule it - should I take initiative and schedule it myself? Or just assume that my manager isn’t ready to have the meeting just yet & will eventually schedule it herself? Especially if she brings it up more than once 

I know a lot of these things are probably obvious but I haven’t picked them up yet so literally every email is really stressful. And even though I know this isn’t helpful, whenever I do email someone who turns out to be the wrong person to have contacted about that subject, and then they CC in the correct person, it just makes my anxiety worse",rgbvalue,3,1.0,0,1697459356,2023-10-16 12:29:16,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1794uc7/first_office_job_have_a_lot_of_emailmeeting/,10,2023
1794gpt,Refining corporate communication skills,"Hey reddit, I was recently given the feedback that I need to improve my communication skills, especially on simplifying messages and knowing how to communicate with senior project stakeholders.

17933nq,Career pivot advice,"I’m a Physiotherapist wanting to pivot my career to management. I dropped my plans to pursue msc in physiotherapy last year because I couldn’t write an sop for the same moreover i realised that i had no passion or interest that i could produce on paper for the adcoms in msc physi. 
I scored a decent gpa in 10th and 12th of 9 and 8.4 respectively however during my undergrad it dropped to it’s lowest earning me a cumulative of 5.8 gpa.
My interest in physio decreased over the semesters. After working for one year as a physio i have come to the conclusion that I would be happier working on projects/ in companies in the corporate sector. Higher pay is definitely one of the motivations
Also, I wanted to work in a field where I could use my head for creative ideas and solve bigger problems at the macro level thus now I will be applying for msc in healthcare management. I would opt for an MiM but i dont have enough time to prep for gmat/gre to get a good score.
Although i have written my thoughts down and tried to write an SOP i am struggling to put it in the words and justify my decision.
Any tips or advice for the same and how i can craft my story would be extremely helpful. I can send you what ive written so far for you to get a vague idea. I am banking on the sop to win the adcoms as my ug gpa is unsatisfactory.

1792kqf,Retail Manager thinking about asking to be a cashier again but wondering how this will affect my job search,"Hi. So basically, I accepted a manager position at the store where I work. It's not working out, and I'm looking for other jobs, but I'm not applying to as many as I'd like because I'm too tired/don't have enough time. I think it would be easier if I went back to being a cashier, but I'm concerned that a demotion (voluntary or otherwise) will look bad on my resume. I won't be applying to anything prestigious. I'm just looking for something like a front desk position or some kind of customer service agent type thing. Basically anything servicey with as many hours as I can get without having to manage other people. I feel like my current job has taken over my life, and I want to be able do self study on my days off (still deciding in what field, but I need to acquire a new skill set and move into a new industry). I just can't do that where I'm at. The job is taking up way too much personal time and mental bandwidth. Have any of you been in a similar situation and how did you handle it? I thought I'd just tough it out until I found another job, but things are getting worse by the day, and I feel like I need to something quick (before I just outright quit or get fired. It's that bad).

TL;DR My job as a retail manager has taken over my life, and I feel that my days in that position are probably numbered (it's not working out). I want to apply for entry level jobs elsewhere, so I can do what I need to do for myself on my days off, and want go back to being a cashier in the meantime, but I'm worried a demotion on my resume will make it harder to get employers to consider me for interviews.

17927b8,The other Execs disagree with my boss / Executive - makes me stressed out,"Hi all, 

Young twenties here. Started a new job as an analyst and, long story short, my (commercial) executive & boss wants me to implement a new system which will cause spreadsheets to become null. 

The job I am currently doing, will ensure that every single report in our big organisation will go through me. Each table of data, every string of sales, has to be provided by me. That’s what my boss wants. Everybody else disagrees. 

I’ve just been plodding along doing my work and cracking on what I need to do, per my bosses task of priorities he set for me. 

I’m finding however, that the other executives make comments about my boss & the work I was brought in to do. 

The finance executive questions if this is pointless and how exactly this will work. That my boss is investing too many resources (me & my salary, my time & skill) into this. He disagrees with what can only be called my bosses vision. 

Two regional directors outright told me it’s a waste of money and time for me to be doing this. 

My second manager (I guess, more a line manager) also has doubts. She’s telling me that I’m investing too much time to do this, but understands this is what my ‘boss boss’ wants. 

I’m obviously just doing my job as I was instructed to do, and this political scene is none of my problem. But, it does make you at times think ‘why don’t the other execs believe in our team?’ 

I’m hearing so much criticism about my boss… How he is lazy, unemotional, smart but deluded… It makes me feel quite crappy at times. 

I’ve heard some comments that I’m not actually doing anything beneficial for the org etc. 

I just… continue doing what I’m doing, right?",Outside_Lime_7650,1,1.0,2,1697449400,2023-10-16 09:43:20,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17927b8/the_other_execs_disagree_with_my_boss_executive/,10,2023

17920c8,"I haven't been to school since i was 12, is there any hope for me?","I have been abused my whole life, so much so my mother and grandparents (dad's a crackhead who doesn't acknowledge me) literally kept me from going to school AT ALL when I was 12. This has stunted me in many ways, to the point i'm not very good at math, just adding things is hard for me to remember and i cannot begin to comprehend things like long division. Basically through out my whole childhood all i did was watch youtube, chat online with strangers, and play video games. Even at age 13 i was acutely aware of the prospect i would be homeless one day and it made me so anxious and terrified i've had depression ever since. My mother is a non functional crack addict with an abusive boyfriend, my uncle is a pedophile, my grandma is a narcissist who loves to say i'm gonna be a homeless prostitute when i die, and my grandpa is a disgusting abusive drunk. I have adhd as well as possible undiagnosed autism, i'm also epileptic but rarely have a seizures so whenever i express interest in wanting a license i get screamed at. Due to my disorders as well as the abuse I struggle with basic things like hygeine, processing my emotions, brushing my teeth, motivation, and time management. 

I do have some skills though, despite my lack of motivation for things I am an artist who tries to draw as often as I can muster. I am not the best artist, there are a thousand people just as good as me but a million more who are even better, but i do want to learn and take criticism extremely well (most of the time). I have been writing fan fiction since I was little and have been told i have an intriguing and cool writing style, which i suppose could be handy later on. Watching literature and film reviews made me interested in film analysis, so i'm somewhat cultured. I legitimately love talking to people and get along with pretty much everyone, it's hard for me to go somewhere with out having a long pleasant conversation about things. I'm also appearently a very good and supportive friend who knows how to comfort people really well, even one of my ex friends said i'd make a good therapist one day. 

Is there any hope for me? I feel like i'm stuck in an awful cycle in this horrible house with these awful abusive people. None of them wanna help me, my mom is far too busy running off and getting high with her boyfriend and everytime i ask my grandma she says that's my mothers responsibilty. I don't need a glamerous job or something that'll make me a million dollars, i just wanna know if there's hope that i can get out one day and survive. My grandma says i could only ever work on an assembly line making easter eggs or boxing products for hotels, despite the fact she won't even let me try to get a real job. I don't really do any housework but i try to keep my room clean and help in small ways, i just don't help out because they're all mean and yell at me when i don't do it perfectly. I have no trouble cleaning up after myself when i'm a guest or something. I don't even know if anything positive i say is even accurate tho tbh, because according to my grandma i don't work well with others, i'm lazy, over sensitive, impatient and just kinda all around a lunatic weirdo. 

I just wanna be happy and live my life but i can't when i have to rely on them for everything, they never do anything they say they will and i'm so sick of it! I haven't had a dentist appointment is 2 years, and my front tooth has a crack in it! I don't wanna stay poor forever, i don't wanna have to keep begging for money, and I don't wanna have to rely on lottery tickets to decide if i'll eat tonight or not.

1791s96,I want to switch from Unity game development to something else,"Hello everyone!

I hope I don't break any rules by posting this here. I'm a Senior Unity Developer with ~5-6 years of commercial experience. I am almost in burnout from the industry practices - mostly long and tiring hours with tons of work. I was thinking of becoming a backend developer, since I already have experience with C# and I really like the language. I have a few questions:

1. The most obvious one, what should I learn? I said backend in the title since I think that would suit me more, but I am willing to try front end too. For backend I was thinking about .NET Core, since I already have some years of experience with C#. For frontend maybe react?
2. What would a 'learning path' look like? What do I need to know and what steps to follow land my first job? I found this: https://roadmap.sh/aspnet-core. At what point would I be 'hireable'?
3. How long would it take to find my first job? How long would it take for me to learn everything I need to know to land my first job?
4. Right now I qualify as a senior game developer, what will my title be in the new position? Middle, junior?
5. What should my per-hour rate be? Right now as a game developer, I am making $40/ hr, based in Eastern Europe, working exclusively remotely.
I am a bit nervous about everything, I've only game dev since I finished my degree (CS degree) and that's all I know. I also have a bit of self-confidence issues, so yeah.

1790ic9,"Work/Study advice - Bachelor of Science, Entomology, Forensic Science - Australia","Hello redditors, first time poster here so please bear with me.

To start, I am 25f, Australian.
I am looking into studying a Bachelor of Science, focusing on Entomology, Forensic Science or both. But I am totally unsure if it’s the right thing for me. 
I have just left a 6 year long career that I hated and destroyed my mental health, specifically the last 18 months, I stayed because it was a secure job that paid decent and had benefits. I didn’t finish school because I hated it and never went to university, because I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life, nor did I believe I was smart enough to study. I didn’t enrol to study while with my previous job because I had convinced myself that I was too old. I know, I must be joking, right?

I have a few questions:
 - Does anyone have any tips to studying while working? I’m worried that balancing both will be too much for me and I’ll procrastinate the course away and waste my money.
 - Are there any tips for studying with ADHD? I find it hard to focus and retain information when studying a subject I am not particularly interested in.
 - Are there any Australians that work in a Forensic Science or an Entomology field that could provide some insights to the job? Or any job with a Bachelor of Science?
 - Any Aussies here recommend any particular Universities, online, campus or both? I currently reside in NT, however, unsure if I will be relocating state in a year or so, I need to keep that in mind when choosing a Uni. 

I have been interested in Invertebrates my entire life, as a child I would capture and keep many different insects as pets. To this day, if bushwalking etc I go looking for insects to photograph and gawk at.

1790g85,Advice on any potential career paths I can take with a B.S. in Cognitive Neuroscience? Or any advice in general?,"I graduated uni a year ago and have been working as a non-legit EEG technologist in healthcare, but long story short the startup clinic I work at isn't willing to provide any real transferable skills that I can apply elsewhere (i.e. board-certified skills). I honestly feel scammed choosing this job as my first adult job as I didn't think the company would be like this (they also lied to me during interviews about growth). I did gather a lot of experience in healthcare and patient interaction/administration, but I just feel really discouraged and think I won't be able to get different, well-paying job elsewhere with my one year experience at this place as it feels like a fake job. I wasn't able to gather any research experience throughout my years in college and so I feel I don't generally qualify for research assistant positions. I feel like I wasted my potential by being too passive and not understanding what I should have been doing in uni. It's hard being the first in your family to go to college as your parents aren't much help in giving advice.  
  
My main problem is that I don't have a dream, but I am highly motivated to succeed by earning money. I work hard, but I struggle with figuring out what I want as a career in life. I have been considering radiology technologist as a backup career as it pays well and have been preparing myself to apply next spring, but the career doesn't genuinely appeal to me... a lot of my friends work from home as software engineers or UX designers and I have been thinking if there are possibly any careers that would allow me to work remotely that I can apply my degree and experience in healthcare towards? I am also willing to work towards earning certifications and 1-2 year degrees if needed.

178yoo0,Husband is very underpaid for his position.,"My husband has worked for his current employer for almost 10 years. He likes his job and the company. He has a lot of freedom in his position, they pay his insurance premium, they pay for his gas, he gets a small bonus during the holidays, and they have other small perks throughout the year. However they ask a lot of him and he often has to bounce between days and nights. He is one of their only employees willing to take this kind of schedule on. When he started with the company he had no experience in the field and therefore was hired at a base salary in an entry level position. He has received raises every couple years and is currently making about $12 more per hour than when he started. 2 years ago he was “promoted” and given a decent raise. The problem is that he is still making $20,000-$30,000 less than the low end of pay for this position in our area. 

With cost of living in our area rising out of control his pay really is not enough anymore. We don’t expect for them to jump him up to the average in our area, but he really needs an increase of at least 20% just to get him back to the equivalent of what he was making 2 years ago, although it would be nice to be making a bit more than that. . 

How would you approach this with his employers. What is realistic? He was considering looking for a new job, but with the uncertainty in the economy he would be more comfortable staying where he has seniority.",tabbycatattacks,20,0.8199999928474426,20,1697434079,2023-10-16 05:27:59,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178yoo0/husband_is_very_underpaid_for_his_position/,10,2023

178wj1g,What now?,"Hi all! Looking for a bit of guidance on what direction to go with my career. Some background for you:

I currently work for a big state university as a program specialist, and I've been in the role for just over 3 months. Beforehand, I worked at a mid-sized tech company (was my first big-girl job after graduating college) as a sales rep, then a marketing specialist for about 2 and a half years, before getting laid off in June. By the time I got laid off, I was so burnt out and unhappy that I actually celebrated the night I got let go. I did make decent money (I didn't think so at the time, but I'll get to that in a sec) and enjoyed a lot of the perks of working for a hip ""culture focused"" company, but was pretty miserable working fully remote, for a company that was truly only interested in $$ and selling/IPOing, and doing work that I felt legitimately no connection to. 

So fast forward about a month, and I was lucky to get into my new (current) role relatively quickly. I wholeheartedly like this job better. The people I work with are genuinely wonderful people, there's a sense of professionalism that I never experienced in my old role, and I actually am engaged with my work and feel like I'm making an impact. So here's the catch. (Quick disclaimer - I do know I've only been in the role for a few months and that things take time, these are just some of my concerns) The pay is 25k less than what I was making at my previous job. Considering the improvements to my work satisfaction, it may be worth it, but with the cost of living crisis in my area (nearly 20% inflation since the pandemic) and with my husband having minimal upward mobility in his job (he is a public school teacher), we are seriously hurting. The other big problem related to this is all of the other staff in my office have been in the department for at least 3 years with minimal advancement, both in role and pay. There is definitely a sense of complacency, and there have even been a few comments I've caught where they think I'll be in the role for ""at least"" a few years. Oh, and I forgot to mention that all of them have spouses that easily make at least 6 figures.

I guess what I'm trying to get across is that I am way happier in my job, but my overall quality of life has gone down. And there's not really a position or title I can even aspire to, whether it be for professional advancement or a higher salary. I know money isn't everything, but I've been feeling pretty demoralized feeling like we're barely scraping by, constantly thinking of getting a second job (I already work at least 50 hours a week) just so we can live our lives in a somewhat normal way. I will say that one of the things that is making me hesitate to leave is that my husband is getting his masters through a spouse tuition credit, which covers his entire tuition minus about 4,000 in fees per year. Obviously having the masters will help him make a bit more, but unfortunately with the way the education system is here, his earning potential is still nowhere near what we would need to be able to one day buy a house, have kids, etc. without me making at least double what I am now. Also, if I get a higher-paying job, we could cover the cost ourselves, and the difference would still probably be in our favor since we get pretty decent in-state tuition. **So here's my main question:** are there any jobs or fields I should look into that would provide more financial stability, but aren't as soul-sucking as a tech/corporate job? I'm not opposed to a corporate job necessarily, but my main takeaway is that I had a hard time working for a company that offers a product or service I'm not interested in/don't care about. I will also say that I really like working for an organization that is well-known (this part is less important) and well-respected, and provides value for more than just... corporations. If that makes sense.

The bonus structure is out of the control of the hiring manager and is standardized by the company based on the department you work for.

178vfg9,Is it likely I'll get severance if I turn down an internal job offer?,"Earlier this month, my company notified me that I'll be laid off at the end of the month. They said I was getting 30 days courtesy notice because of my good track record and will be given severance if I don't find/accept an internal position by then.

Of course, as most people do, I panicked and applied to nearly every internal position that was even remotely relevant to what I currently do. Unfortunately, the only one that I made it passed the 2nd round of interviews is the one I want the least due to it being a 30% paycut and a much lower title.

Going out of state, I have to worry about bills such as rent, food, car payments, college loans, etc. This is the only offer that I've received so far and I'm waiting on multiple offers from various companies in my state (NJ), but they're taking quite awhile to get back to me and those jobs pay around $40K - $55K roughly.

178tvs6,Choosing between staying at current job or going out of state (public sector),"Hello all you fine people. I find myself in an interesting situation that a month ago I never would've expected. Basically, I've been recruited to another organization (public sector, local government in a different state), one that would require me to move. Sounds great! But then, literally the next day, I get word that a higher position in my current org (public sector, local government) will be coming open soon, one that I'm highly qualified for and would almost assuredly get (I'll explain why a little lower).  
Few facts about me:  
\-Mid 30's, public sector data analyst, make $44/hr (closer to $46/hr after some additional premium pay, etc). Been with current org for 10 years, fully vested in pension (leaving it on deposit, I currently stand to make $1700/month for life starting at age 50, obviously earning more if I leave it longer, and even more if I stay at least a few more years (over $2000/ a month). Net worth- over $600k with careful investments, frugal living, even in an expensive area. I'm lucky to have super low rent from family friends. Friends have all left the area, but family is still closeby. Folks and I hope to move to a new area to stay close together within the next few years. The most likely candidate is the area I've been recruited to. We're all pretty worn out by the area we live in, and looking to move somewhere more laid back.  
\-Other facts about current position- hybrid schedule, 2 days in office each week, plus every other friday off. Healthcare 100% covered, pension, plus 401k w/employer match. Employees partially fund the pension, and we pay social security/ medicare taxes, so that's a bit more out of our paychecks every 2 weeks. I'm basically maxed out in my classification, so I'll only get COLAs and maybe some market adjustments to my classification from here on out, unless I get the new position. It's public sector, so there are no negotiations, everything is pay grades and time of service. I should also note that as a 10 year employee, I have a ton of leave saved (over 400 hours) and earn 6 hours every pay period.

\-Potential new job with same org- obviously same benefits, same schedule, same hybrid schedule. The manager of that team used to have my job. I work closely with that team supporting the application they administer, but I do it for my department while they do it for multiple departments. I'm good friends with the manager, and by being a current employee, I get bonus points on my application. I interview extremely well, and I'm almost 100% sure I could get the new job in my current org. It would mean a higher pay grade, eventually topping out at about $120k per year. I already do so much of the same work that the new position would offer, it seems like a natural progression. However, obviously it would be open to the public, so there's always the risk that I don't get it. I have the inside track, bonus points for being an employee already and the experience...but, there's always the risk of someone coming in off the street, or someone else in my org that could beat me to it, haha.   
\-Other job out of state: very similar position to what I do, but technically with a pay cut (down to $35/hr to start), but the area pays far less in taxes and the pension is 100% employer funded.If I did another 10-15 years there, I estimate I could net about $1900-$2300 per month from that pension as well, though there's no reciprocity with my current pension. As mentioned, I'm vested with my current pension and However, no social security, so that would be years of not paying into it and if/when I did collect, the Windfall Elimination Provision would also lower my social security amount some more. The position is in an area both myself and my folks enjoy, and if I moved there, they would move there within a few years. The position is 5 days a week, but nearly 100% remote, with the occasional meeting in person. A move is still required, because one must live within 50 miles of the employer. Their healthcare is a bit weird, not taking affect for 90 days, then several years of being on a high deductible plan before being put on the regular plan. They're also stingier with the leave, not allowing new employees to use it during the probation period.  
\-Other job pay: technically a minor pay cut to start, down to $36/hr, but the pay scale goes higher than my current scale (I top out at about $95k currently, unless I get the other job, so only COLAs would be left for me in my current position. This job out of state would top out at $102k). Plus costs in the area are less, along with taxes, no employee portion of the pension, etc. In the end, basically a wash. No 401k either, so no employer match, though employees can pay into an optional 457b.  
TLDR- choosing between staying in current position, where I'm topping out, but a higher position is coming open soon; or taking a similar position out of state with a lower initial pay, but higher range (though lower than the position coming soon with my current org), also some slightly worse benefits. Plus, 5 days a week vs a 9/80 (4 and 5 day workweeks, hybrid schedule (2 days at home, 3 in office), and lots of leave saved up. If I did take the job out of state, it obviously means no vacation time for a while, weird healthcare for a while, 5 days a week (but almost always remote, etc). I'm just hoping for some outside perspectives.",LAKings55,1,1.0,0,1697417730,2023-10-16 00:55:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178tvs6/choosing_between_staying_at_current_job_or_going/,10,2023

i’m getting not terrible response rates looking now, but i wonder if they are calling the place i worked and asking them about that. 

should i scrap it and explain the gap in employment, or keep it? i do have other work experience on my resume but not field relevant except a short internship in my last month of school (vocational college)

bonus question: what should i do about disclosure of disability and getting reasonable accommodations for it? i’m formally diagnosed with a condition that is a disability and can prove to employers",fig_art,2,1.0,3,1697411062,2023-10-15 23:04:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178ro8w/keep_or_discard_job_from_resume_after_being_fired/,10,2023

178rdfj,Turning down internal job offer,"I recently accepted an external offer for a position that would be a promotion from my current role. The new job has more responsibility, better salary, and all around better prospects for career growth. 

The offer is contingent on completing a background check, which I’m confident I will pass. The background check process can take up to 30 days, and because of their payroll schedule, they anticipate my start date will be about 6 weeks from now.

In an ideal world, I would wait to resign until I’ve completed the background check and all contingencies have been removed from the offer; but, I am in a bit of a tough spot because I was offered an internal role that I plan to decline. While the internal role is a good opportunity, it is a lateral move that isn’t as appealing as the external job. How do I decline the internal role and explain my rationale to my current manager without letting them know that I am planning to resign in 2-4 weeks? My current manager isn’t the type to take a simple “It’s not the right fit” explanation without further rationale, since they know the internal job is in an area that I’ve expressed interest in previously. I’m worried that I’ll be forced to be transparent about the new role before I’m ready.",lkmagee,2,1.0,3,1697410212,2023-10-15 22:50:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178rdfj/turning_down_internal_job_offer/,10,2023

Everyday I'm always constantly wondering about what could've been, I just do not wan't to be driving and doing warehouse work anymore; always having to put up with crappy coworkers who do nothing but slander all day, gossip, profanities, ho** and b******, these are the topics that will literally only come out of they're mouths, literally low education and iq topics. I despise these employers who will literally just hire anyone off the streets with no background checks because this is what I have to put up with at work all day everyday. It's not like I've been wasting my time either I have an associates, CDL, & the certifications mentioned earlier none of that still hasn't broken me free from these trashy jobs, employers just won't give me a chance.

178r3jl,Advice for my first IT job?,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of background information. I’m 20 years old working my first job in IT. I started an apprenticeship last year on a “help desk technician” course and have since passed my apprenticeship. During my apprenticeship I became extremely interested in the system administration side of things and tried to get involved with our systems / infrastructure team wherever I could.

After I finished my apprenticeship I was promoted into my current role as a systems administrator. This was a huge goal for me and I am still so happy to have been given the opportunity to work in a role I love full time.

However, I am still very keen to learn. Now that I am no longer an apprentice I wanted something to study or work towards outside of work.

I know there are plenty of certifications available but I am a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of options and pathways to choose, that I don’t know where to start or where not to start.

My current company is all on prem, so I have no exposure to cloud services aside from a 4 day Azure course I did during my apprenticeship. Which presents me with a unique problem.

Is it worth looking into cloud platform certifications just to broaden my horizons and get that experience, even though I won’t use it in my current role? Will cloud be unavoidable in 5-10 years time meaning I will be left behind? Or should I look at more “general” certs that will be beneficial in all environments like CCNA, Security+ etc?

What job roles are in demand at the moment, and what job roles will be in demand in the future? Is it worth specialising in something? Where is the most potential for earning?

I have a lot of questions and would appreciate any advice you could give me. I’m still very new to the industry and want to avoid making any decisions I’ll regret. So like I say, any advice is welcome and please feel free to ask me any questions below!

Thanks for your time :)",BhopBen,1,1.0,0,1697409426,2023-10-15 22:37:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178r3jl/advice_for_my_first_it_job/,10,2023

178q33v,My Friend with a Disability Is About to Be PIPed/Termed,"My friend, who has ADHD and has disclosed this to their boss and HR (but did not file ADA paperwork) is about to be put on a PIP. The feedback has been is that they struggle with staying on task and communication, which is common. My friend is medicated and takes it as directed.    


Does the company have any responsibility to cater a PIP with their disability in mind? Should my friend avoid signing something? My friend has admitted that they don't really like the job as much anymore and that they've struggled, but has been with this company for 7 years before being transferred to the new role.   


Their boss has stated that if they don't sign the PIP the other step would be to meet with HR to talk about transitioning ""out of the role."" I imagine that this means termination. My friend may not be too concerned about, but I'm wondering if they do sign a PIP if their disability should be brought up or if they have any protections here.

178mo61,"23M. Don't know what to do with my life anymore, need help:(","Hi. 23 years old from Mexico. 
I had an exchange in Finland at 17 during last year of high school, it was a mind-changing experience.
I thought I knew what I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to do something important, but during that year I think I spread too thin, I became more analytical, observer and contemplating than actually pursuing something.
When I came back to Mexico I joined communications bachelors out of need and hurry for getting in uni, but I quit after 2 months (it wasn't what I wanted)
Then I joined English and Chinese lessons, went to the gym VERY COMMITED, then at 19 I joined IR bachelors, but I quit again 2 months after (it was too expensive both tuition and the environment, I didn't want to be a burden for my family)
Then I got to continue with my language studies and look for a job.

By January 2020 (still 19) I joined International Trade bachelors, but then covid came, and we went to zoom university. I lasted almost 2 years, but I quit due to covid/lockdown hysteria and discomfort, existential crisis.
Am I weak for quitting due to covid madness? Millions of people my age continued despite online classes awfulness, but I just couldn't focus and study by being 24/7 in my room.

After quitting I got a job at a gym, it lasted short. Then I got side/freelance jobs with English-speaking businesses as customer manager, translator, social media, etc. Then in summer 2022 I got a ""more formal"" job with one of those English-speaking friends/business (I worked 9-5 some days and at office some days) the position was weird, because I basically was helping him build an online business, so I did a bit of everything (again spread too thin) it wasn't a tax/formal/official job.
But it lasted 6 months. I got ""fired"" because he changed his mind about the business and wanted to think more about what to do. It was November 2022.
Then I did nothing, other than worry about my future.
It was then in February this year (I finished a data analysis course) when I decided to go to study to Poland (don't ask why Poland) I knew I needed a degree 100%, I needed to do something with my life, I can't just get gigs and side jobs by nice gringos. 
I started to get hope (covid destroyed a lot in my soul)
I got a job at a gym again and lasted until July (it closed, and I was leaving anyway)
And here I am in Poland (2 weeks ago I arrived) in a not so prestigious university studying economics. This was my dream, to go to Europe, do something with my life, my own choices, etc. But I feel (again) empty and lost.

I feel old and weak and worthless. I'm studying a bachelors when people my age are studying a masters, or already building a career.

My life is just a collage of random experiences, interesting but worthless and pointless.

How the F at 23, after 4 universities, 3 countries and one world-changing pandemic I still don't know what I want??!
""You're so brave for going to a different country' with different language"" 
SO WHAT? Bravery doesn't pay the bills, or builds career reputation, or social status, it's just an interesting anecdote.

So what can I do? 
Why do some people know they want to be engineers or doctors since forever?
I have no problem with hard work, it's just I'm too old, I can't start from zero a 5/6 year degree in STEM, I can't even financially.

I thought coming to a developed country would makee me happy, give me opportunities, but I feel I'm wasting my life.

How can I know what to do?
Thank you for reading all this, but you needed to understand my context.
I'm a ""scientist"" by personality, I'm a very methodic, curious and creative person, I'm passionate about the world, nature, theory, etc.

Am I too old? What can I do? How can I stop feeling like so much crp?

178i044,Not sure what to do next...,"I've read a lot of posts similar to this but thought I would share my own story... I'm feeling lost in life and don't know what my next steps are. Looking for some ideas on what I could possibly pursue.

Some background info... I'm a 25 year old guy. I graduated college with a bachelors degree in Music and Entertainment Industry and a minor in Business Administration. After college, I started working part time at a recording studio as an Audio Engineer. I love this job and was very fortunate to get it because I graduated when covid was happening and most jobs in the music industry were shut down. I couldn't make this job full time though due to there only being one recording space in the studio and the other engineer running the studio working there 40+ hours a week. Because of this, I supplemented with another part time job at a call center. I worked there for a year and left because it was mentally draining. I then worked full time as an Assistant Manager at a retail store and part time as an Assistant AV Coordinator for my church. I worked both of those jobs for about a year all while scheduling studio sessions here and there. That's when the perfect job came around... I became a full time Production Coordinator for a music venue. I loved working with bands and running audio. I did this for about a year but left because the venue shut down. Now I am an Assistant Technical Director at a University. I have been with the university for just under a year.

There are some things I like about my job, like working with audio and training the student employees we have. Although, I hate most of my job. I find out my schedule week to week and my shifts are very inconsistent. I can work any day with any hours. It's also not uncommon to pull a 14-17 hour day when working tech for a big event. My boss is also not a nice person. A lot of people I work with have a hard time getting along with him, myself included. Additionally with preparing/running tech for events, scheduling student employees, building the departments resources/trainings (these weren't established before I was hired), learning the equipment, and everything else I have to do, I find myself always trying to catch up on my work and I never feel ahead. It is also stressfull working events all the time, esspecially when so many times things come together for an event last minute. They are all also mostly corporate events, not concerts which is what I love working. All of this and the fact that I make only $21 an hour makes me want to leave but that's the thing... I don't know where to go.

I can still schedule studio sessions but haven't been because of the stress from my current full time job and not knowing the hours I work in advance. There are just not many opportunities in my area/online looking for my experience/degree. So my question is, given my degree and experience, what careers can I pursue? Some things I've thought about are getting a google cert and doing data analytics or just getting some office admin job in my area. I don't want just a temporary fix though, I want to find something I can do long term as a career. I don't want to be in a customer service role, I like working on my own, and I don't mind if I do the same tasks everyday. I just want more consistency in my life. I am not willing to move by the way, I'm getting married here in the next year and want to be close to family. I also don't want to go back to school if possible. Any and all input is appreciated.

178hun5,Clueless on what to do now,"I really need some guidance and advice right now because I cannot seem to find a way out of my situation. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. 

Some background: 

In January 2017 I injured my right dominant hand and got a neurological disease which made me unable to use my hand in almost any way except using a computer mouse and lifting some very light objects. Back then I've been studying graphic design in University and was about to pass exams and start writing my thesis for a diploma. It was my last year before getting my Bachelor's. Sadly, I had to leave University altogether because without my hand functioning I just couldn't pass the art exams. Holding a pen was impossible because of burning pain and thumb weakness. Since there is a law where I live that allows you to return back to Uni until 5 years passed since leaving (leaving by your own will, like I did, not dropping out) I decided to focus on treatment of my hand and then go back.  
After that I've been doing everything in my power to cure my hand. Unfortunately, everything became a mess gradually over time. I thought I will go through treatment and go back to studying. But instead I was locked in a vicious cycle of going from one doctor to another because none of the professionals knew what was going on with my hand. And this vicious cycle continued for more than 5 years. Then I thought maybe, just maybe, I'll be able to treat it and then apply for the program again. That was until summer 2022 I went to another city for the appointment at one of the best hospitals that specializes in treating hand injuries and got a CRPS diagnosis. I was given a... not very good prognosis, to say the least. I spend one year in treatment but, sadly, it didn't work. Fast forward to 2023, I had to accept that I will probably never be able to draw or use my dominant hand fully again. It atrophied very badly and doctors just don't want to deal with my situation anymore. 

Now I am in a very difficult situation and I can't seem to find a way out of this mess. 

I put most of the effort into my drawing skills since I was a teen (about 14?). I was building my whole future career based on my drawing skills. My graphic design program was also very animation-focused and I planned to transition to animation after my BA. Now because of my illness I can't draw, I can't even sketch. Holding a pen in hand is impossible. I tried to transition into logo design/branding but it turned out that sketching is very important for searching ideas during the design process. I basically have to skip the sketching altogether and go straight to Illustrator which makes things... very challenging. Which makes me question whether I even have a chance in this field at this point because it is very competitive and those physical restrictions will limit me, my creativity and speed of work severely. 

I thought of changing the field, but since I put so much effort into my drawing skills I basically have no other skills. It's starting from scratch completely, as if I am 16 and clueless, but 28, old and sick instead. The only interest besides drawing that I had and still have is English (not my first language) but I can't really put it to use anywhere. I had no other interests or passions besides drawing and animation. I was also pretty bad at most science/technical subjects in school so I'm not really cut out to transition to the areas related to mathematics or physics. The only thing I seem to know is human anatomy and even then it's from the perspective of an artist. 

My only thoughts were to transition to UX/UI and front-end. I tried looking into UX/UI but saw people saying it's hard to get into this field without higher education. It is also more about problem solving than visuals and I am not the best at it. About front-end people say it is overly saturated and hard to get into. And I am not sure whether I am smart enough to code. 

Besides that I have no ideas. Completely clueless. 

I feel like my time is running out and I need to find a way out of this mess before it's too late. Any thoughts and advice will be appreciated.

178gt9c,My boss is on the verge of being fired so he’s resorted to lying - I’m uncomfortable meeting with him alone,"Long story short, my boss has been reported to HR by two employees on his team for multiple reasons. I haven’t yet reported to him HR, just his boss. Nothing harassment related, but in a nutshell he’s not a good leader. He’s very unorganized and doesn’t have a clue what is going on. The team has suspicions he doesn’t actually work and just schedules meetings with himself to appear available at all times. 
When he is caught by leadership for missing deadlines or not knowing information he should or is relevant to his job, he resorts to blaming his team. If he is questioned about anything he becomes very hostile and aggravated and shifts blame to someone else. Even asking him a question to follow-up on a task, he becomes aggravated. 

I’ve become a victim of his lying, despite documenting our conversations. He even pulled up a screenshot I took to prove a lie and started reading it and replacing names and context of the conversation in front of me AND his manager and when I pulled it up and read it verbatim he had an outburst and said “this is petty.” His manager then told him that he has to work on not seeing being wrong or not knowing something as a weakness. 

I’m no longer comfortable meeting with him alone and or without being recorded. He has shown that if he feels his back is against the wall, he will lie. I’m nervous he will lie and say I said something I never said. 

If I refuse to meet with him in person and only via a teams recorded meeting, do you think I’ll be in trouble?",ventingin2020,24,0.9300000071525574,16,1697380861,2023-10-15 14:41:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178gt9c/my_boss_is_on_the_verge_of_being_fired_so_hes/,10,2023

178gb5l,Crowdsourcing opinions on moves and changes,"Currently I find myself in a loop of choice paralysis and existential dread. After several years of doing the same thing for work, a career field I never really wanted to be in, I am without a job - thus determining this is the best time to re-center myself and and find something new and possibly fulfilling. So, thus I submit myself to the denizens of reddit to aid this search.  


I have been working in the Electrical Field (mostly new construction of commercial/industrial) for most of my adult life. I came into it as a child when my father owned his own contracting business. Literally been around this and doing work for him since I was like...10...I am currently 36. When I say working, I literally mean this to a degree befitting the station. While young I did easy tasks for him which as I was a teen an older became more rigorous and complex. While not the best environment for kids - I get it, don't need anyone to die on a cross for me here, I learned skills and made money all my life essentially. Learning the value of skilled labor, as I can literally go to another electrical company - but I really don't want to.   


After high school, went to college. Started as a business major. Dropped out for a bit, went to work, came back, and then graduated with a degree in B.S in Political Science, minor in Public Administration - focusing on accounting, budgeting and auditing - because I had credits from the first romp in school. It took me longer than most to complete this journey - Originally enrolled in fall '06, graduated May '14 - mainly because I valued employment and money first...because....bills.  


Get out of college and start looking for work - end up working for a friend of my fathers doing I.T. based field work - because I like computers and what not, and possess tool skills and the like. Bounce around after that to a server admin job then a webhosting company...long story short end up back in the electrical field with my old man again - he works for a different contractor years later. Do this for another 10 years or so it seems. Most of this off the books - which is great for pay, bad for career advancement opportunities. I have just recently earned enough on the book hours in my state to qualify for Journeymen testing in the trade. Which I will likely do - just to validate the years I have in the trade - even though I don't want to pursue it further.  


This brings us to the now. I currently have unlimited time on my hands to consider anything and it is...overwhelming at times. On one hand I desire something challenging, engaging, and something that provides self efficacy...but on the other hand I need to bring income in because.....bills.   


I am lucky that I have a partner in this who makes an large enough income - which covers our bases and then some. But I never  have relied on anyone to make my bill payments nor do I want to. So it purports a sense of urgency in decision making - which then I am concerned to make the wrong choice and be stuck again for years doing shit that I know I hate - just because I can do it.  


I have taken several career inventories, tests, etc. to determine what it is I like or 'might be well suited for' the problem is it's like a shotgun blast at a barn wall. My interests and skills are myriad. I grew up and operate in a manner of both learn and do things. It's likely also something to do with my likely never diagnosed ADHD and my WAIS results (165 performative/145 verbal)  - isn't  a circle jerk comment - it's just what it is - which also just adds to this constant feeling of personally wasting my life doing shit work.

So what should I do internet group think-tank? Where can I aim the brain machine and do better?  


TL:DR - Electrician doesn't want to electric anymore - help make better.

178fnt5,Can't decide if I should be this pissed,"I was with the same company for a very, very long time. We got new managers and people started quitting. I stuck it out but in the end, I was forced out. By forced out, I mean, meant to feel so uncomfortable that I would quit. I did just that.

I ended up taking a job with my old manager at a new company, that had left a couple years earlier because of the same crap.

My salary is the same as with the old job with much fewer responsibilities, which is just fine with me. I used to work a crazy amount of hours and now I only give over 40 hours when I'm willing.

When I started in the new roll the only position he could open was a level below (title-wise) then his other three employees. Now 3 months later he's able to hire more people and he's hiring them all in a level above me.

I have much more experience and knowledge than the rest of his existing staff. They all have a higher title but according to him my pay is commiserate with theirs.

On the other hand, I'm I'm making a very good salary (6 figures) for doing a lot less work than I used to.

I did tell him exactly how I felt however, I understand there's not a lot he can do. HR won't let him promote me after only being with the company for a few months. I should have negotiated more originally but trusted him because I knew him.

I'm honestly devastated that he's hiring new people at a higher level than me when I have more experience than everybody here already.

Help with career path

Let me give you my background: working 2 years às ordens management for a biotechnology industry in NY. Now I have 2 opportunities which I think both of them are unique and can help me to reach my dream (I want at some point move to San Diego and get a job there) 
Got a job offer for sales commission manager  in another company (this company has a division that sells biotech items as well ). I think this opportunity is unique because I can get a job as revenue manager and this type of job pays very very well. I had experience in past and that’s why the company approached, they had approached me bafore. The think is: currently I work remote, this new job I will need to go to the office, but I think the opportunity is unique. 

So, now I let me talk about my next opportunity, well I work in a very big biotech company and
Last week a manager told me she would like to work for her , this position is project manager related: the tittle is : business  integrations ( I will work in projects to integrate companies when we acquire news companies, which happens all the time). This job I will need to travel, this one of the things I need to think. 


But both of them can help me to reach out my dream, there is a bunch Biotechs in San Diego that needs people with experience. I am just thinking which one should I pick. Other thing is , the new company for the management position will pay me more, I make currently 65k, they pay 110k plus Bonus. The position in my company I am thinking IF I GO with them I will tell them I have this offer and if they can match. What you guys think ?

178e5e3,Conflicted on my career move,"I (27M) currently work as an analyst. I’ve been with my company for about 2.5 years now. I have very little to complain about in my role. I have a very supportive manager, am allowed to work remotely 5 days a week, am never asked to work late/weekends, and the work aligns well with my interests. My only real complaint is that I have received very high performance scores each of the past 2 years during our annual review periods, on top of being assigned more complex and critical work, without any promotion or significant compensation increase. I know that my manager recommended me for promotion earlier this year since he sent me the business case that he wrote, but I did not receive one. I never received feedback on why I was not selected… just decided to try to do more to build a case for Q1 next year. 

I was not looking to leave my current job, but a few weeks ago one of my connections on LinkedIn recruited me for a position as a Director at their company. I had several interviews and the opportunity sounded like it would align well with my skills and would put me in a good position to gain more leadership experience. I accepted the offer as a Director at the new company (completely different industry) with a significant salary increase, higher bonus % and almost 2x PTO. The only complaint I have is that the role is not remote, but the office is about a 5 minute drive from my home. I informed my current employer that I accepted the new role and they quickly counter offered matching the salary and a title promotion to Senior Analyst, which I politely rejected. My main reasoning for not taking the counter offer was that I felt that transitioning to a Director position from an Analyst this early in my career would help fast track my career progression, and admittedly I was a bit irritated that it took getting an outside offer to be recognized and worried about if taking the counter offer would put a target on my back at the current company. I don’t get the impression that it would, but I’ve never been in this position before so I just don’t know. 

I start the new job in 2 weeks. This weekend I’ve been overthinking quite a bit (which I do a lot) and wondering if I made the right decision. I really enjoy the work I do currently, value working from home, and I do feel valued by my immediate manager. I don’t think there is really a right or wrong decision for me to make here, but I am conflicted on what I should do. Part of me wants to circle back on the counter offer to see if it still stands. Another part of me thinks that wanting to stay is just me seeking comfort and avoiding the scary part of taking a new role… which is change and the unknown of if it will be as good as it seems. 

I would appreciate any feedback or advice to consider. Thank you.",droobie__,1,1.0,0,1697372241,2023-10-15 12:17:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/178e5e3/conflicted_on_my_career_move/,10,2023
178dzpm,Is it better to go back to school and “start over” or push through,"26F - I graduated undergrad in dietetics (no debt) and worked as a dietitian for 2 years. As much as I wanted to like it, I didn’t and the pay is so terrible. I did clinical for a year and virtual counseling for 6 months. I have a history of an eating disorder and the nutrition counseling job was a bad move for my mental health since I was dealing with clients with EDs. I tried to switch out of those clients but literally every person I dealt with had these issues to an extent. I saw my own therapist for it and since then have recovered. I felt like a fraud and it was really hard to practice this knowing I had my own issues. So I took time off and became a nanny abroad for 2 months to reset (this was a really fun trip but kinda lost money doing but it was worth it for the experience). I contacted a mentor I had in college and she recommended a job where she works. I got hired and was recently promoted after 1 year working for a nonprofit doing frontline fundraising. I make more now (65k) than I would have in 5-10 years of being a dietitian and there’s room to grow. I think I’d be able to get another promotion and raise in 8 months (75-80k). The problem is that I don’t think I want to be in this for that long. It doesn’t feel stimulating.  I see value in the job such as increasing my people skills, communication, sales kinda etc. I have thought a lot about getting another degree. A lot of my family and friends are in engineering/med but that would be quite the commitment and I’d take on loans. I miss medicine and science and have thought going on to PA school but I know that healthcare is very demanding and not the best environment and somewhat corrupt depending on where you go. It also makes me nervous because I really liked my classes in undergrad for nutrition but ended up hating the profession. So I partly feel like I can’t trust myself to make a decision either especially since it will cost money this time. I’ve recently become interested in getting my private pilots license (which I know is expensive) but I see value in having that and getting more certifications over time which can lead to making more money as well. I’m not really sure what I should do at this point. I mainly just work, workout, read, and do my best to save money. I feel a bit overwhelmed with it all and regret the choices I made in my undergrad. Anyone have advice?

178dr4k,"Dilemma, and out of time","Hi, I dropped out of uni/health care field. It was stupid.

I have a good part time job at a care facility. I am appreciated there. It feels good working there, it's not high stress. But I dread it sometimes. I dread patient interaction, but I like the teamwork and there are good moments. My health has taken a sky dive recent months. I have gone to a doctor and they told me to talk to someone, but I know that's not the problem. I need stability. 

I can stay, rent a room and take on loans to become a CNA while keep working. Groundskeeper/gardening is also an option. Or move back home, rest and focus on my health before another program in jan. I can apply to baking, property maintanace and CNA. My gut tells me to go home. I am very stressed and don't take care of myself. I feel dread thinking about having to work as a CNA at bad places, though I would appreciate the flexibility. I feel as though I should be grateful and feel lucky I have this job and make this choice and see where it goes. Begin to focus on things outside work. Though I dread having to apply to elderly care or similar long term places. The thought of baking makes me on the other hand feel excited even it doesn't really go hand in hand at all with things that are important for me like sleep, flexibility, physical health, it's like everything negative is thrown out the window when I thing about like it's no big deal... property maintanace sounds better on paper but I don't get a good gut feeling about it. Gardening is neutral.

CNA would look best on my resume and it's the ""right thing"" to do, but I just feel dread about it... how can I get over that feeling and just push and do what't necessary for my future? I am 26 and have no econmical stability.

178cxj8,"Seeking Career Advice: Overcoming Challenges, Finding Purpose, and Pursuing a Passion","Just a little warning, this post is incredibly wordy, so I've left a tl;dr at the end. Thank you.   
  
I have a 2.0 GPA in an English Literature Degree (Bachelor's) that I haven't finished yet. I lazily dragged my way through college and performed well in most English courses, receiving As and Bs. I received lower grades only when I skipped classes due to anxiety and depression. I should also mention that during that time, I developed some stomach issues (gastritis). While taking some Psychology courses, I received passing grades and found most courses interesting. However, their analytical approach to understanding humans felt incredibly ""cold"" to me. I should mention that my feelings toward Psychology have greatly changed over the years, and in hindsight, I realize that my negative feelings were likely just excuses I came up with to avoid asking more significant questions. Those bigger questions, of course, are: Why am I not trying hard enough? Is there possibly something wrong with me? Who am I really? What do I truly want? I mostly held myself back and didn't try hard enough on anything that didn't capture my interest. I should also mention that I was recently diagnosed with ADHD at age 27, which likely contributed to my anxiety over completing assignments on time. I need 15 more credits to actually graduate and officially acquire my degree.  
  
Now, with further context, I'd like to get to my point: when I do finish my degree, I need guidance on where I can use my skills as an INFJ (MBTI) 9w8 (Enneagram Type). I added this information not because I think it should entirely dictate the advice given to me, but because I believe those profiles are the easiest way to understand the core of who I am and how I see the world without going into great detail about my past twenty-seven years.  
  
I've worked for the New York Police Department as a Cadet, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't feel like I had much of a purpose beyond performing menial tasks. My goal at the time was to become a Police Officer, a goal pushed onto me by family, who saw me as an aimless child. Now, I'm truly trying my hardest to decide on where I should go and what I should do. I need help in guiding my career while creating tangible goals to work towards in a world with so much to do and so little time to decide.  
  
I have deep interests in music (all genres), video games (all genres), psychology, reading (mostly science fiction, self-help, and fantasy novels). Currently, I'm saving up money to finish my degree. I know graduate school is likely out of the question because my GPA is horrible. However, if by some stroke of luck I can matriculate into a University, I'd like to focus on Library Sciences.  
  
As a child, my grandmother took me to a gigantic library in NYC, in Manhattan, and I was absolutely amazed by the experience. In middle school, I often skipped classes (mostly to avoid fights with other students) and took on the role of ""Library Monitor"" for an old Librarian. I remember how grumpy she was and how often she'd scold other students, but to me, I somehow knew she was sweet. I'd find quiet corners to read and bring piles of interests with me. Sometimes I even napped for a bit. I don't know the point of sharing this, but basically, I felt so welcome. I still feel incredibly welcome when I walk into any library. This is why I hope to gain a Master's Degree in Library Sciences one day.  
  
I need to be clear about something before any advice is given: from ages 4-17, I loudly stated to everyone I knew that money didn't matter to me at all. I have always wanted to help the world in some way or at the very least, make people's days brighter by giving them something of real value (knowledge, experience, growth of any kind). However, from ages 18-27, life has tested me multiple times. I remember tearing my piriformis (a muscle in one's lower buttocks, located near the sciatic nerve) one day while moving the lower part of my body to the left, so that a passenger of the MTA could leave the train quickly. I felt a sharp pain at that moment but held my composure until the next stop. When I arrived, I got up and walked as far as I could. I made it up one set of stairs, and as I approached a much larger set of stairs, the pain became unbearable. Every step I took became heavier, and I began sweating because I was trying to move by sheer force of will. I made it as far as two Manhattan blocks down from the station and stood still in the cold winter while students, workers, and just general New Yorkers rushed by me. I couldn't move at all; I tried to move my legs, and they wouldn't budge without threatening to send lightning down my lower half. I knelt down on the cold concrete and crawled to a lamppost so I could prop myself up and rest. I remember the looks from people, from students. I was just another homeless ""crazy""; I tapped on a van parked next to me and asked if they'd let me sit in their vehicle to warm up. They laughed at me, then apologized and drove off. Around this time, I learned the value of money as a necessity. I don't want riches, but I do want to be comfortable enough to support my wife, our future children, and my health.  
  
I don't really know why I shared that personal story, all I know is: I don't want people to feel like I ever did. Though I know the world can be harsher to others at times, at the very least, I want to create a place of solace for people or be that moment in time for them that pushes them forward even when things are bleak.  
  
If you've read this far, I commend you and thank you. Please, if you can, give me advice on how to better my life.

Then, I took a year off and went to Rutgers University Newark, where I was majoring in supply chain management. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I passed all my classes in spring 2020, but struggled in fall 2020 with online learning and dropped out. I reenrolled in spring 2022 and graduated 2 months ago in August 2023 with my bachelor’s degree in supply chain management. My GPA was a 2.78 since school was challenging for me. Fortunately, I graduated with only $678 dollars in debt. I finished but, unfortunately, due to my low GPA, I couldn’t secure any internships or opportunities. I’m now looking for an entry-level job in supply chain management, but I have been facing rejections. Any advice would be helpful. The reason for my low GPA is that I have ADHD, ADD, and a learning disability. I’m not a good test taker, to be honest. I took five classes a semester just to graduate and get it done before 30.

1788atl,Lost in life at 24….,"I have a degree in speech therapy.30k in debt from it  Got 2 years ago and in order to become a SLP you have to get your masters in it. 

I feel I’m not passionate enough to pursue the masters head on. 

Don’t get me wrong I had choose the degree cause i want to help others and I had grew up with a lisp and stutter thought I could help others the same.

But I don’t think I’m passionate enough to go for it and study it and practice it for the next couple of years 

I’m in a cross roads in what to do in life. 

But since I feel like I’m not pursuing more education like getting a masters in something I feel stuck in life. Like lost…causing me to have more anxiety and depression. Plus makes me feel lazy cause I’m not pursuing higher education in something

I know now a days alot of people don’t like their jobs and usually just do it to make money and survive in this world 

Should I just suck it up and just get the masters in SLP. As I need job security and stability in life. I figured if I worked with children it would make me like the job much more and make me feel making a difference

1787tj7,"During the final interview, HR manager said what I wanted was too high (75% of posted range) and told me what they were hiring at which was at 50% of the posted range. Would like some advice on my situation.","I’m pretty unhappy at my current job. I make $137k and have to travel periodically and go into an office that doesn't have anyone I work with (all on MS Teams). I applied for a job where a peer of mine got recently got offered $128k and countered for $132k and got it. It’s fully remote with very little travel and similar benefits and probably less work overall. The HR manager during my interview said that they were hiring realistically at $120-125k. Just to move on with the interview, I said I wouldn’t want to do less than $125k. The job was for a very cool opportunity and the people are pretty smart. 

There’s a senior level position I could’ve applied for, but my peer said that’s usually reserved for people with much more experience than the posted requirement because they applied for senior and said HR opened the current ""mid-senior"" level position for them. I regret not betting on myself and trying to apply for senior since I was subconsciously not wanting to go over them.

I’ve been having a lot of anxiety about everything. If they offer me, say $123k, could I only negotiate to $125k since I technically already agreed to it? I was a bit shocked at the pay decrease from my expectations. They're hiring a lot for this new project, so they may be trying to keep costs down. I could take the 10% pay cut and be perfectly fine, but I feel like I didn't handle this the best I could have and just don't feel great about it.",SlayerSEclipse,0,0.5,4,1697345312,2023-10-15 04:48:32,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1787tj7/during_the_final_interview_hr_manager_said_what_i/,10,2023

I had a major eureka moment and want to bash my head in. I realized that the hobbies I enjoy: baking, game development, and coding have a common format. 

They all have processes that can be modify to produce a unique result.

They are logical in their set-up but creative in their result. And the reason why I struggle to produce with these hobbies is because I need a need to fulfill them. Baking - have to satisfy a craving or a special event.
Game development - I want to know how to do this in a game.
Coding - learning in a structured format.

I need a career that has logical rules yet creative results that can be done alone to produce benefits or solve a problem. I want a more of my rhythm then someone else's but understand deadlines will never disappear.

17848wx,i love my job but i want an income not dependent on an employer,"I fell into the niche of content writing within personal finance a few years ago and became pretty good at it. i worked with a few startup clients, one main client that got acquired back in april and I was lucky enough to get brought on full time. 

However, i also feel like my skill set is narrow here and i’m working on finding ways to expand that. i’m 24 and i graduated in december with a bachelors in marketing, so ideally i’m trying to expand in that area and adding SEO to my skill set would be nice, and i would also like to possibly pursue getting my CFP. 

I really love what i do but i also feel like my job isn’t that important or that i’m not overly valued. i have a decent salary (70k) but i realize that’s standard fair for a large startup and not indicative of my relative value. 

i currently work on and off with a couple or few freelance clients, but that’s not really sufficient for income. 

I really don’t want to get this idea in my head that i have it made with a good salary in a remote job that’s very very flexible and has no set hours, just to end up as a lost writer in the end. 

I want to be able to build an income aside from this. My current efforts involve having fiverr listings for my services and applying to any and every freelance opportunity i come across on upwork and etc. 

the other things that come to mind are the obvious cliche ideas — dropshipping, do some etsy store thing, flip real estate, remote setting, this that and the other ideas you see paraded online. 

recently the idea of affiliate marketing via a finance blog caught my eye because this is something i know about, enjoy, and can help me learn more about SEO. but the problem is that this, like most other ideas, seem to have most people saying that they’re just watered down and not even worth trying at this stage in the internet game. 

so honestly, i don’t know where to start, but i know i need to start on the right idea sooner than later because the sooner i start, the closer i am to one day turning it into an income stream. 

any and all ideas are welcome and appreciated greatly.",apvoided,0,0.5,3,1697332989,2023-10-15 01:23:09,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17848wx/i_love_my_job_but_i_want_an_income_not_dependent/,10,2023

1781c3s,how to deal with mean managers?,"title basically. i’ve been working at a coffee shop (very similar to starbucks) since july. i’m concerned that my manager is playing favorites, and is picking on me. one of my coworkers quit because she said that she felt like she was being bullied by our manager. i constantly feel like i’m walking on egg shells around her. i don’t know if this is all in my head & im just delusional or sensitive or if im actually being treated poorly. 

 ever since i got hired, my manager has been very vocal about how she hates having a toxic work environment & she takes many precautions to prevent this from happening. as a result, she’s very strict about call-outs, and at my interview she said, “i don’t do call-outs.” she preached about how call-outs create a negative work-environment because other people have to do more work to make up for the person who isn’t there. i work part-time & i’m still relatively new to the job, so i don’t have any sick time. there were two instances in which i was sick & forced to call out. the policy is that you must let your manager know 2 hours in advance, or you will get a write-up. on my second offense, she pulled me in to the back and told me that she was giving me a write up (even though i called 2 hours in advance), and basically said that i cannot call out again or else i will continue to receive write-ups. (getting 3 write-ups is when you’re basically about to get fired). she talked about how i have to come to work no matter what, despite being sick, having a family emergency, etc. meanwhile, another one of my coworkers has been calling out dozens of times, and somehow she hasn’t received any consequences. i was asked multiple times to stay a few hours longer to cover her shift. my manager is super nice to me when she wants something from me. but she made such a big deal about giving me a write-up once, when my coworker did not receive the same treatment despite calling out more times than i can count.

i’m so afraid to make mistakes at work because my manager acts passive aggressive towards me whenever i mess up. when this happens, she doesn’t even say hi to me when she comes in to work. she talks to me like i’m a baby, and makes me feel humiliated in front of customers. she treats me like i’m stupid. once, i accidentally charged someone for a medium cup instead of a small. right in front of the customer, she turned to me and said, “you see this is a small right?” my heart dropped to my ass, and i turned so red and i just didn’t know what to say. i had to go to the bathroom so i didn’t cry infront of everyone. another example happened today (which is the one that has hurt the most); i was on register and we had a lot of customers in the store, so it was very loud. from across the store, she tells me we are out of a sandwich so that i don’t sell it to customers. however, i misheard her (because of all the loud noise) and i thought she asked if i got a sandwich for a customer. anyways, eventually i tried selling someone the sandwich we were out of, and i heard her yell, “i just told her we were out of it, what’s wrong with her?” and she glared at me. once again, i was so humiliated in front of all the customers and i tried to hold back tears.

she does not talk to any other employees in this way. in addition, i was promised to be fully barista trained in 3 months, but i am still at register. my coworkers who began working there after i did are fully trained, but she barely ever tries to give me any bar time. i don’t know what to do. i’m considering quitting. every time i come to work i’m so anxious because i’m so  afraid of making mistakes, since i know how my manager will react and how condescending she is.

how have you dealt with managers like this? is it worth talking to her about? are my feelings valid or am i just taking things so personally?",Normal_History_5111,3,0.8100000023841858,5,1697324174,2023-10-14 22:56:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1781c3s/how_to_deal_with_mean_managers/,10,2023
1780v6p,"How to bring up concerns about a boss not notifying me about a full-time job I interviewed being filled, while still working part-time in the same department?","I've been working as an adjunct instructor for a year post-PhD (same uni I obtained my PhD - there are not many programs around so this is common). Throughout my PhD, I worked at the university as staff.  
A couple weeks after I graduated, the director of the program reached out because he needed someone to teach a class asap, and I was the first person recommended because I had taught the class before and had great reviews. I jumped at the opportunity because the director said that a few teaching positions were open and he wanted me full-time soon as faculty. I left my full time job as staff at the university, despite just getting their equivalent of tenure and a bonus (long story short, my former boss in this position was holding me down. I didn't want to cause issues, so I shut my mouth and let this happen, but I was looking for a way out).  
I interviewed for the position over the summer and was told that the job would start in the fall. I get a message from the director, a month before fall semester asking me to teach two classes. I said I was interested, but wanted to hear back about the full time job before I committed to anything (if I didn't the full-time job, I wasn't planning on adjuncting because the pay is incredibly low, even though I'm teaching grad students and it is a lot of work.  
Director told me that decisions were being made and everything should be finalized within the next week. He said he would touch base with me the next day and didn't hear back. So a week later, I asked for an update and was told decisions still had not been made. A couple days later director reached out and said he is getting pressure from the dean to add an instructor to the classes, and if it's ok to put me down. He said that once my contract comes in (the full-time), the dean said that my adjuncting contracts would be rolled into the full-time position.  
So I took this as a strong indication I got the job. Two months go by and I hear nothing. I checked the faulty website and see a woman who was interviewing for the same exact position as me is now full-time faculty. I sent an email to director and the dean checking in and letting them know I saw some updates to the faculty page.  
The director doesn't mention the professor job I interviewed for over the summer and let m know that something happened with the funding line, and he just posted the position again and letting me know that I'd need to upload my pervious application materials to this page.  
The job wasn't just posted - it was two weeks ago. The dean offered to meet with me to discuss the job status - I took him up on the offer, but don't know where to start. Any suggestions? I also have some slight concerns that my former boss in the academic role may be pulling some strings - but maybe I'm being paranoid. Something just seems very off about the situation, or maybe I'm reading into it too much.

177zbpp,23F Freelancer who has never been formally employed -- will this hurt me in the long run?,"I am currently a freelancer for 3 years now, never been formally employed and currently pursuing a BSC degree in human resource management (online university). At first, I only did this as a way of earning some money during the pandemic, but it quickly became something I could see myself doing for a long time. During my time as a freelancer, I have worked with many different companies (I currently have 4 clients), and I do plan to continue doing it as it is very lucrative, especially as someone paid in USD whilst living in a third world country. It has granted me the luxury of being able to pay down my student loans, save for my courses, and spend money on other wants and needs, all at once. However, I constantly wonder if I am placing myself at a disadvantage by not getting a physical job, especially one in my field of HRM which is apparently very hard to break into with no experience. For my current clients, I do email & calendar management, and data entry, and recently I've begun helping one of my clients in an HR capacity, payroll processing, and onboarding new contractors.

What if the soft skills I learned during freelancing aren't enough for the hyper-competitive job market, especially in the face of AI? These are questions I frequently ask myself, especially as someone who dreams to be well spoken and educated someday.  
  
I have contemplated executive roles to drastically grow my skill set, but I innately know that I would be overwhelmed by it, the fast thinking required attention to detail, and the ability to juggle a million things at once, given that I don't process information as quickly as I'd like to. Despite my self-doubts and imposter syndrome, continuous learning and self-development are non-negotiable for me.

177y3np,PwC Audit (Industrial Services) vs. in-house Bank Internship: which path to take?,"Hello everyone, I'm currently working part-time at PwC in Audit while doing my Master's in Germany. To be honest, I find the audit tasks repetitive and monotonous, especially chasing clients for documents and cross-referencing them with the booking system. It feels very administrative, and I'm craving more analytical challenges. I've been offered an internship at an in-house bank of one the top 3 largest companies in this country in the Team Risk Strategy & Validation area.

My long-term goals are:

\- Maximizing my salary potential.  
\- Possibly working abroad.  
\- Engaging in more analytical work.

Given the potential to convert the internship into a full-time position, would making the switch be a good move, both in terms of job satisfaction and salary potential? Has anyone made a similar move or have insights on either career path? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Current job pros: very stable and well known company, pension, benefits, guaranteed yearly raise, awesome coworkers/managers, I like what I do and my coworkers seem to think I’m good at it

Current job cons: not an industry/topic I’m very passionate about, mandatory 2 days a week in office which means 3-4 hours of commute per day 

New job pros: higher salary (10k more), fully remote, more interesting industry/topic, benefits

New job cons: I’ve personally never heard of this company before although they aren’t a startup, no pension, don’t know if I like the job or if I’d be good at it (it’s the same job as my current, but you know, new team/new subject, etc.)

Remote is a huge thing for me right now, given I have young children and don’t want to lose more time with them. But is it worth throwing away everything else I have going with this company?

177t7uc,"I was MIA for a critical meeting due to a personal emergency, and I’m worried about the consequences","Remote software developer here. I just started a new corporate job about half a year ago, and I’ve been intentional to make a great impression. I’ve always been organized, on time, and responsive throughout my career, so big “mistakes” are rare for me.

Last night at midnight, our team was launching a page I had built. I was scheduled to be on the launch call to essentially hit the launch button. (I was the only developer present with the ability to do so, though we have other devs on our team.) Unfortunately, about an hour before the call, my family had a medical emergency that demanded my immediate attention. It was chaotic and emotional, and as we rushed to the hospital, I realized too late that I had left my phone on my desk. I had no way to let my team know what was going on and that they needed to secure another developer to perform my duty during the launch meeting.

I was able to return home (another family member relieved me) at about 1am—an hour late for the call. As I expected, there were multiple Slack and text messages from various team members trying to reach me. Perhaps worst of all, no one was online to respond when I was finally able to give an update about what had happened, and there were no updates from the team about finding a replacement developer (though they had to have found one, because it was a non-negotiable launch date with stakeholders involved). I was mortified and sick to my stomach.

I immediately sent emails to my supervisors to give them context about the situation. I don’t divulge private details about my family’s health, so I kept it brief and professional.

Needless to say, I didn’t sleep a wink last night.

So… The primary blunder was leaving my phone at home. I realize that’s a very human mistake given the situation, but I am struggling to give myself any grace for this.

What’s your advice for:

1. How do I address this with my team on Monday? Though a medical emergency is beyond my control, I know I highly inconvenienced and annoyed/worried them.

2. In a situation like this, can I be penalized (lose my job/be put in job performance training), and can I expect my colleagues/supervisors to be understanding at all?

3. I can’t stop ruminating over this, and while I know this was a “life happens” moment, I still feel like I failed my team miserably. I have a long history of depression and self-punishment, and I’m trying my hardest not to spiral. How can I take care of my mental health in the midst of this?

PS: Family health status is stable as of this afternoon.


TLDR: I had a critical role for an important meeting, and I was MIA without a means of contacting my team due to a family medical emergency. How do you handle/recover from an event like this?",ModestMew82,50,0.8999999761581421,47,1697300647,2023-10-14 16:24:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/177t7uc/i_was_mia_for_a_critical_meeting_due_to_a/,10,2023

177saw5,"Need Advice on My Current Job Dilemma: College, Health, and Work","Hey, Reddit community,
I'm a 19-year-old male who's about to enroll in college in January. I'm in a tricky situation right now, and I could really use some advice.

I recently started a job at a petrol pump as a shift supervisor. However, things have been far from ideal. I'm not getting paid yet ( in training right now which will take a week or 2 atleast to finish and I can earn after finishing it), and my work hours are grueling - I worked 14 hours on my first day and 11 hours on the second day, often waking up at 5 am to reach there by 6 am. It's taking a toll on my health; I'm experiencing frequent headaches and exhaustion.

The biggest challenge is that there are no days off. I'm worried about how I'll manage to attend college classes, let alone prepare for exams, especially since I have to attend classes on Sundays at least once a month.

On the other hand, I'm waiting for a potential referral from my mom, who works at a bank. If it goes through, it could provide a more stable job with better conditions. However, it's uncertain when this referral will lead to a job offer - it could take a month or two or even longer.

I'm really struggling with this decision, and I'm torn between sticking with my current job and waiting for the bank job opportunity. Any advice or insights on how I should navigate this situation would be greatly appreciated.

Currently, I hold the SA-C03 certification(Solutions Architect - Associate), but I'm eager to learn and prepare for a technical role like a Cloud Architect.

177od0r,Master’s or grad school?,"I currently have one semester left in my bachelors for psychology and I am trying to figure out what to do next. My plan has been to move on to a doctoral program and obtain a PsyD or PhD as I know it would open many opportunities and set me up to have a great salary.

However, I have never been 100% sure about it as the length of the program is a scary prospect to me. I am pretty well established at my current job (I’ve been there four years) and have a serious boyfriend. The closest doctorate program is around 1.5 hours away from where we live and I can’t imagine being away for 5-6 years (he wouldn’t be able to relocate due to his job). 

I have started to entertain the idea of obtaining a masters in counseling (my goal is to do therapy) as we have local programs and I could potentially keep working while attending. My job is at a mental health office so I would most likely have a job when I finish. In an ideal world, I would want to settle down and start a family in the next 3-4 years and grad school would definitely postpone that. Being at a masters level, I would make around half of what I could at a doctorate level but it would still be a livable salary, and I have never cared much about having a lot of money or a high income. But I can see how a doctoral program could be beneficial. So I am struggling with deciding what may be best for me and trying to not make a decision I’ll later regret.

I'm a 25-year-old male from South East Asia who recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in agriculture. I'm reaching out to the community for some guidance on how to secure a job outside of my home country, as the job market here offers very low pay.

While I'm passionate about agriculture, I'm open to exploring opportunities in different countries that can provide better financial prospects and a chance to grow in my field. I'd appreciate any advice or insights on the following:

1. Identifying Target Countries: Which countries are known for offering good opportunities in the field of agriculture for international candidates, especially recent graduates like myself?

2. Work Visas and Immigration: What's the process for securing a work visa in these countries? Are there any specific requirements I should be aware of?

3. Networking and Job Search: How can I effectively network and search for job openings abroad, considering I'll be applying from a different location?

4. What should I prepare for when it comes to interviews for jobs in a different country? Are there cultural or professional differences I should be aware of?

5. Cost of Living and Relocation: What are the typical living expenses in these countries, and how should I plan for the costs of relocating abroad?

TL;DR: Next time I'm in the market for a job, how is a hiring manager likely to view a seemingly backwards move on my resume?",WorriedCress7965,2,1.0,0,1697256989,2023-10-14 04:16:29,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/177h647/recruiters_is_this_a_downgrade/,10,2023

177grfk,Career Crossroads help needed,"Hi

TL;DR

1. Stay in current job, risk further downsizing, get redundancy payout if it happens. Remain bored and frustrated. 
2. Take niche government role - exciting work, fresh start (pros and cons)
3. Join former boss's new shop for pay bump. Previous conflict with former boss. Similar/same work as option 1. Significant pay bump. Less career advancement options. Riskiest option. 

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I need to weigh up between three main career path choices, each of which will have a big impact. I am 40 / married / mortgaged / 6month old. 

Im a senior manager at a F500 company. The company has recently gone through a pretty rough patch, and a first round of restructuring/layoffs has occurred (approximately 1/4 of the workforce in my area). The future for my business group (3000 people) doesnt look amazing, but i am reasonably secure due skillset (R&D and pre-sales analysis teams report to me. They are needed for future sales/strategy steering). Primary customers are military and other gov departments. Overall, im quite bored and frustrated in this role, but i can navigate the organisation, and have plenty of political capital built up. Recent downsizing limits progression options. 

Based on a lack of faith in the future direction, i had started looking for new roles, and am midway through the process for a pretty niche government role where they can pay additional loadings above standard government salary to secure the talent they need. Heavy technical focus, leading a team of engineers, and paying a little more than my current role. This role looks quite exciting, but would mean basically starting again in a new organisation. 10% bump to current salary. 

A former boss has now approached me and advised that they are starting a business that focuses on doing the work that my current role performs and would like me to come in and be one of the founding managers, bringing the majority of my current team with me. Funding/backing/first customers are already secured. Expected pay bump would be in the order of at least 30-40%. The work would be largely identical to what i am doing now. The complication is that the former boss and I have had a rocky relationship in the past - they dont handle disagreement / conflict very well, play favorites, and are very quick to take offense. They do however, work hard, help when asked, and are good with customers. If i dont take this role, and stay in my current role, i will likely lose most of my team to this new venture and need to rebuild. New business will either be booming, or bust at the 3-4 year mark. 

Im leaning to Option 2 - but thats not yet in the bag. My concern is that i will need to make a decision on 3 before 2 is realised.

177dzi9,Joining a fraternity to improve job prospects?,"I'm less than a year away from graduating with an associates in infosec. I've been emailed several times with the offer to join a fraternity by the name of Phi Sigma Pi. Two things I'm confused about: First they are listed as a fraternity, but I thought fraternities were just for men, and I am female. Second, from their website, they seem to be more geared toward African-American members, which I am not. Just to be clear, I personally couldn't give any less care to social clubs, and being a member just to say I am makes me want to puke. I hate cliques in all their shapes and forms. But if being a part of some sort of ""club"" will better my job prospects and maybe even get me in touch with others who can open the door, then I see it as a logical investment. I could rant for days on how unfair it is that those who graduate being members of so and so get a higher hand than those who were not but who deserve the job or are more competent for it. Regardless, I realize times are tough and it's important to accept the way the world works.   
I have been told repeatedly, and have also read, that leaving college with a degree and even a nice GPA isn't enough. You need to have some sort of network to make connections with and maybe connect with on LinkedIn and ask for endorsements.  This fraternity seems a bit vague on what it offers. It's mainly community volunteerism, scholarship access, and leadership online courses, etc. It's a $300 fee to join, which I can afford. But it stinks of a scam to me. Many aspects of college are scammy, and I already have doubts about my job prospects even though it is in tech. I don't see college as a black and white, scam or not a scam. It all depends on your field and internship as it will count towards experience. For my major, I will need to complete an internship.   
So my question is, is it worth it to join one of these organizations? Do you think it is worth the $300? I wish there was a poll that could be taken on how quickly fraternity members received interviews or job offers vs. people who are not a member of anything academic-related.

Hello everyone, a few months ago (August) I agreed with a family friend who owns a small company to start a program paid by government to earn work experience that lasts 7 months, he told me that if we start I have to be there ( although the program itself mentions that you can quit anytime) for the entire duration because he will be left hanged and will have trouble finding another candidate and I agreed. The program is supposed to start late October. 

A few days ago a bank contacted me and said my CV matches a job that opened recently and I would be a good fit, though I have to get through interviews and skill tests. Working on a bank is very appealing to me and it's very hard to deny, the salary is better and the contract is fixed for at least 5 years so I won't have to search for job again and I will get valuable experience aswell. 

I feel like I have to take my chances for the bank which is also a lot better for my career if I get the job. Though I feel confused and I don't want to hang my family's friend. Sorry for the long post, any advice/recommendation would be helpful.

1779je4,Help! Need Career Advice,"I’m a M 25 since college I’ve had multiple jobs but no career position yet. I’m currently located in NY and work full time as a manager at a restaurant. I’m average about 80k a year. I honestly hate it. The Long hours are taking a toll on me (12 hour days 5/6 times a week) and the money isn’t the same as it use to be. I’m looking to relocate for a new job. 

This is the end of the summer season at the restaurant, I really want this to be my last year full time. It has been my summer job since 17 years old. I became manager during COVID when everyone left. It was me the bar manager and the executive chief; everyone else went on unemployment. Since 2021 I’ve technically been in charge. The place has made me a lot of money and put me in a great position. But I can’t work in a restaurant forever if I want to own a home, have a family and some animals. Nothing crazy I’m a normal guy. I don’t need a Bugatti 

Ive been recommended to apply to a few things. The things that resonate with me are UPS and Sanitation. 

UPS has solid benefits, good pay and plenty of other pros/cons to the Positions available. A pro would be the upward career growth available; a con would be starting part time as a seasonal helper and hope I get to stay around after if I prove my worth. 

Sanitation doesn’t sound fun but getting out of work at 11 and going to the restaurant to work dinner shift is super appealing. Sanitation jobs start at 56-63k near me with benefits. Anyone have an idea what it’s like down in NC, SC, GA or FL for both of these Jobs? Is the pay way less of in the ball park?

Trade jobs sound up my alley too. Learning to be a electrician, plumber, HVAC & Welding are all things I would love to learn. 

My parents want me to work for Con Edison in NYC, great job bad commute lol. And since I want to relocate I don’t find it ideal to start and quit.

I don’t want to go back to school. School didn’t teach me half of the things you need in the real world like doing payroll, tax documents, and scheduling logistics. 

I also have the power to open my own spot if I wanted too I have enough friends that we can make it happen. I know risking it sounds fun but stability is more what I need. 

For background I have a BS in Business Administration and a minor in Finance. I’ve worked a lot of jobs but it was never a bad or negative thing when I walked away. I worked at a vacation efforts during the pandemic 3-4 days a week. 2019&2020 During college I sold shoes in the winter. Since becoming manager I’ve been asked to work at various other restaurants near where I live one being a Fusion Taco Chain, Brewery’s, and a few Catering Halls. My parents own their own business so everyday I help them but don’t ask for money… they do enough!

1778vgz,"A little advice about ""anonymous"" company forums that might save your career.","There are a bunch of websites that allow you to discuss, ""anonymously"", aspects of your work, your employer, your coworkers, your clients.... There's one in particular that I think everyone is familiar with, but there are many and I don't want to mark any as being more or less risky than the rest.  
  
You prove you work for your employer by having them email your corporate address with a confirmation code. The instant that email exchange takes place - whether it is initiated by you or by them - your company knows you're subscribing to that website. This is a massive HR red flag.  
  
If you think your company couldn't possibly be monitoring that stuff because they're too small, too progressive, too... something... you're wrong. It's built in to most HR/email systems. If you think the ""anonymous"" website is doing something clever to get around this, nothing they do can't be reverse engineered by an employer or HR/email service who can generate hundreds of testing accounts.  
  
The idea that your posts on that website will be anonymous is laughable. Off the top of my head, I can think of a number of ways your employer could get full access to everything you say and do there. They could just do a low-tech password reset. They could pay the website for a backdoor (yes, the option is there for many of those sites). They could just fire off a subponea. If you're stupid enough to access the website on your work hardware and your company uses Forcepoint or similar, you're done for. One company I worked for had us install an email app on our phones that installed trusted certs on the device, giving the employer man-in-the-middle access to every ""secure"" http request the phone made. I say this is off the top of my head  
  
If you've taken the massive risk of using these sites, make very sure that nothing you say there could be construed as legally actionable or worth firing you for. No matter how much you believe your statements there to be anonymous, you are very, very, deadly wrong.  
  
Please be smart and safe out there.",snigherfardimungus,4,0.5600000023841858,18,1697231574,2023-10-13 21:12:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1778vgz/a_little_advice_about_anonymous_company_forums/,10,2023
1778r55,Going through a recruiting agency vs direct hire,"A recruiter from a recruiting agency contacted me about a role a few days ago and I was interested at first but some things came up where I would not be able to relocate by their deadline. I told the recruiter this and I would have to pass. That evening on linked-in, per usual I sent a few connection requests to professionals in that area at random and one of them ended up being the hiring manager of that comany. 

   
The next day the hiring manager emails me about the role. I am thinking that the recruiter accidently passed my information to him and I am really busy so I do not respond. However, that was not the case. The next day the recruiter sends me a nasty email saying the hiring manager told her that I had contacted him and accused me of trying to go around them, said the recruiting agency was going to sponsor my clearance and not the actual company etc. 

  
I told her that I requested him on linkedin thinking nothing of it and probably applied to the position directly a week before she contacted me about it and that is how he got my email.   
I just went and found the direct hiring link from the company's website and it says the role is Full time. This is different than what the recruiting agency told me. They had told me that it was contract-to hire. Basically I would be an employee of the recruiting agency for a few months and then I would get hired full time by the company when the contract is up. 

  
My question is if I had applied to the company directly initially would they have given me an offer that is different than the recruiting agency's?

My dilemma lies in the decision of whether to accept the Columbia position, which carries the weight of a renowned institution on my resume but represents a shift from a managerial Analyst role to a coordinator position, where I would be supporting three managers.

As the title says I’ve now “bombed” two different interviews for higher up positions within my department. I don’t know what actually I’m doing wrong. There’s absolutely no feedback and I’ve reached out to a few of the hiring supervisors with no response. 

I’ve also had a few conferences with my immediate supervisor and asked what I needed to improve in my work to obtain a higher position in our department. Her response was to keep doing what I’m doing and that it has nothing to do with my work, it’s exceptional, there is just a lot of competition. My yearly evals are always excellent, no write ups, and my supervisor has delegated some of the tasks of a supervisor to me like specialized reports and training to new workers on how to interview, etc. (I’m a social worker in a government position) I’ve also started reviewing their work and was invited by my manager to be on a “corrective action team”. 

What gives? What am I doing wrong on these interviews? I put thought into my answers and am very polite. I also have over 6 years experience in the department.

1776ck2,Breaking into America's Professional Class,"A book by Richard Reeves, titled Dream Hoarders, takes aim not at the .1% or the 1% but the top 20% of earners in America, the upper middle class. He posits that having carved out their portion of the American dream, the upper middle class is desperate to hold onto it, lobbying for tax breaks, hoarding their modest wealth, and–most importantly–setting their children up for success. They will send their children to private schools, some to ‘feeder schools’ with direct pathways to the Ivy League or to other elite colleges and universities that allow admission into high-earning professions like medicine, law, engineering, consulting, etc. Anyone who has spent any time around the upper middle class has seen this pattern, time and time again. It could be argued that this sort of grooming is more important than any sort of monetary wealth parents could impart to their children. As the saying goes in regard to family wealth, the first generation earns it, the second spends it, and the third generation blows it. But passing on the wherewithal to earn it seems to have much more generational staying power–teach a man to fish, and all of that.  
  
I grew up the son of a truck driver. Neither of my parents had graduated high school, although I believe they may have eventually gone back for a GED. My grandma is functionally illiterate, that is she doesn’t have command enough of written English to function in any real job, although she was born here. However, I am now a physician, albeit a new one. I am engaged to another professional, a therapist who is the daughter of a physician. I live in a beautiful, safe, idyllic suburb of Boston. My social circle is filled with other successful professionals with advanced degrees and elite college educations. Growing up, I had never met anyone–outside of say, my pediatrician–who had a college degree. Now, every time I go to dinner, more people at the table have a doctorate than don’t. What is that to say? Really, not much. I am not avoiding people who are less educated than I am. I am not seeking out people who are educated. Now, I live in a social world where these are the people who happen to be around me. How did I get from there to here? And should one want to?   
  
As we enter an era where men are going to college at lower rates, as college debt increases, as dissatisfaction with traditional jobs mounts, I don’t think that’s a silly question. Trades are becoming increasingly popular and allow for quite a good living. This is a very viable option for those disenchanted with traditional pathways to wealth. However, statistics don’t lie. On average, the highest earners in America are still professionals in careers such as medicine and law. As America’s upper middle class, the professional class, continues to shoulder the rest of society out of these careers, I feel compelled to share the blueprint I used–consciously sometimes but oftentimes subconsciously–to work my way from the son of a rural truck driver to a suburbian physician, with the caveat that this is not for everyone and shouldn’t. My father was the most honest, hardworking man I’ve ever met. We need blue-collar workers, lest America will fall apart. But for those who want to access to these careers, or those who are just interested in seeing into the life of the upper middle class, I feel well-positioned to speak on the subject.  
  
The upper middle class is about more than income. It’s a social strata. It is the professional class. And to break into it is the assimilate, to avoid fatal career or social faux pas, it is to set yourself up for success in interviews, at post-interview dinners, at casual social events. In a world of Andrew Tates, I want to provide an actionable, honest guidebook on how to secure a comfortable, professional life for yourself and your family. It is below.   
  
1. Modesty is king  
  
If being a professional was a religion, their first commandant would be, though shall not boast (at least not overtly). The upper middle class does not drive around in G-Wagons, Plaid Series Teslas, etc. They drive Priuses, Camrys. They don’t wear Gucci belts, gold chains, although you may see the occasional Rolex. You will never hear someone talk about their net worth, they will never say how brilliant they are. They may say that they’ve just published in a prestigious scientific journal that only those in the know will understand the significance of. The upper middle class is unassuming, and for you to flourish in the world, you ought to be, too.  
  
2. Travel (even within your city)  
  
Not everyone can afford to travel. The only place I’d ever gone before I graduated college was Disney, once. I did some extreme budget traveling upon graduating from college and saw a good bit of Asia for very cheap. Since then, I’ve taken budget trips to Central America and Europe. I didn’t do this because I felt I had to; as a lover of Anthony Bourdain, I felt compelled to get out of my little corner of America and go see the world for myself. These are experiences I wouldn’t trade for anything. The professional class, and their kids, travel–a lot. A big topic of conversation is about your last trip and your upcoming trip. Where is your dream trip? What was your favorite meal you had there? What did you bring back? Oftentimes, they will even bring back gifts for their closest friends. They will have a command of geography. They will understand current geopolitical trends. Even if you can’t afford, or don’t have an interest in, traveling, it would behoove you to take an interest in the world, even if just for your own enrichment. If you can’t, ‘travel’ around your city or town. Eat foods you haven’t tried before. Go to ethnic grocery stores. I hadn’t even had a burrito before going to college, never mind Thai food or Ethiopian food. But if you are trying to fit into or break into this world, it would benefit you to know how to scoop up some rice and curry with naan bread.   
  
3. Learn a second language  
  
Many of the upper middle class are bilingual or multilingual. This is multi-factorial. Some had foreign nannies, some had foreign parents, many went to schools that had strong language programs, many travel extensively, many enjoy intellectual pursuits. I’m not fluent in a second language, but I speak decent Spanish, a bit of French, and I’m learning some Vietnamese–mostly because it’s fun!  
  
4. Read  
  
Growing up, my parents read to me constantly. I think it was my saving grace. When I was old enough to read for myself, it was all I did. I would get gift cards to bookstores for my birthday. I’ve continued this habit throughout my adult life, as well. It, of course, increases your vocabulary, increases your comprehension, and allows you to tackle those difficult texts in college and grad school. However, it has other effects. Here is a tangible anecdote of when it came in handy. During my medical school interview, I was asked which book I was currently reading. I had said Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, a very interesting book about a man who had received ‘shock therapy,’ lost his memory, and embarked on a motorcycle trip around America. Incidentally, it was my interviewer’s favorite book. This is just one factor, but I gained admission to this medical school. Not to mention, reading can be a very pleasurable activity!  
  
5. Know a bit of culture, ignore pop culture  
  
Know the Beatles, know Stevie Nicks, know Leonardo Divinci, know The Rolling Stones. You don’t need to be a scholar; you just need to have a good, well-rounded liberal arts education, whether you acquire this in the classroom or outside of it. Don’t spend too much energy on popular culture. This comes and goes. I don’t often find myself around a dinner table talking about Kim K.   
  
6. Be generous without hope for gain  
  
This is a good rule for life, in general, and is worth noting. The upper middle class, gives. They donate their money and time. They help their friends and family. You should too.   
  
7. Pick a life-long sport  
  
Many of the upper middle class are fit. Many were athletes in high school and college. Many continue athletic pursuits throughout their lives. Running is a big one. Runner’s World did a study showing that their average subscriber had a household income of $139,000 and an average net-worth of nearly a million dollars. The USA Triathlon reports showed that the average triathlete’s household income was $126,000 (Link). Not to mention, studies have shown time and time again that fit people get hired at higher rates.  
  
8. Don’t be rude  
  
This should go without saying, but most of those in the upper middle class are not rude to their peers, not rude in the workspace, and not rude to waitstaff. You shouldn’t be either.   
  
9. Go to college (or send your kids to college)  
  
If you are young and found your way to this article and want to be a professional–you must go to college, and you must go to a decent one. I went to a state school. It was what I could afford and was what I got into. But it was a large, research university that was ranked in the top quartile of universities in the country–not Harvard but not some school with no name recognition. If I could redo it, or if I had the sort of grooming that upper-middle-class children have, I would have loved to go to an elite university. It simply sets you up for the rest of your life, especially for admission to graduate school or professional school. If you are a parent reading this, try to send your child to the best school possible. Prepare them for college admissions. I don’t care what anyone tells you, it’s not an IQ contest; it’s a game.   
  
10. Send your kids to summer camps  
  
Upper-middle-class kids go to summer camps. They go to tennis camp, foraging camp, running camp, science camp, you name it. It exposes them to interesting subjects. Integrates them with their peers. Socializes them into that world. And it’s fun! I received a scholarship to attend one of these and it really expanded my horizons.  
  
I hope I was able to share this list with minimal pretension–my intent was no-nonsense and practical. Of note, you don’t need to do any of these things. I have physician friends who check nearly none of these boxes and function well in this world. But if you want a streamlined way to fit in culturally to the professional class, I believe this is a good starting point.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: 

To culturally break into the upper middle class, be modest, travel, learn a second language, read, know important cultural references, be generous, stay active, don't be rude, go to college, and send your kids to summer camp

1775ryx,New Computer Science Grad Seeking Employment,"Hello, everyone. I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science, and I have a fairly decent GPA of 3.4. I am making one last effort to break into the software development or IT field before I reluctantly consider a marketing job I really don't want to pursue. I have worked on several academic projects using React and React Native in both Javascript and Typescript, and I possess a solid understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). However, it seems nearly impossible to secure an interview for even an entry-level software engineer or web developer position. Once I start working full-time, I'll have limited time to devote to more projects and furthering my learning, especially since I am a single mother managing a household as well.  
Any recommendations to enhance my resume or profile would be greatly appreciated, as would any job leads. I understand that the job market is tough for everyone right now, and I hope that those who are still seeking employment can find it. I've attached my resume, as well as links to my Linkedin and Github profiles. Thank you in advance for any assistance. :)

I seem to dislike most things that in today's world   push your career forward: Self promotion, job hopping, networking, etc. I can do every of these on an average level I would say, but all of them create a cringey feeling inside of me. I am shy/ anxious by nature and I constantly try to fight this feeling but I wonder if am I in the wrong place? It is difficult to gauge how much other people actually like these things, social media swallows any honesty, but at the same time they don't seem to be in constant inner conflict, I am not even talking about extraverted people who actually enjoy it. I do have ambitions and to some level I enjoy being admired so I can't seem to find my place.

1772qzm,"My husband wants to quit his new job, and I said that's a mistake","My husband was fired from his old job in October 2022 as a data manager.  He found a new job in July 2023 as a quality control engineer.  In between these jobs, he worked on an app as a volunteer. Ideally, he wants a technical job like software engineer/data analyst. He was a data analyst for 9 years before he found his data manager job.  

Currently, a technical recruiter found him a temporary job as data analyst  that pay 20k more than his current job. The contract is 5 months. he said he wants to quit his current full-time job, and go for the data analyst job. I said that is a terrible idea.  After 5 months, if he doesn't get a permanent position, then he will end up with NO JOB. That means we can't pay the bills and such.  He said he doesn't like his current job and it has nothing to do with being a data analyst. I said, yes that' true, but it pays the bills. If he doesn't get a permanent position at the temporary job, we can't pay the bills. 

I advised him to do something on the side to get a more technical job as a data analyst, like..maybe do something on github.

1772p1v,How to take resignation back?,"RESIGNATION: Emotional Turmoil

RESIGNATION : Emotional Turmoil

So , I did a blunder. 
I am a 2023 grad and joined a company paying decent in my home city , a very stable govt company and that too near my home.
The company culture is shit and feels like a jail and very very strict management like shuru mein toh dar lagta tha ki kahi school ki tarah maar bhi na khaani padey.
Increment and growth is also like a govt company.
And I had another offer An average MNC 2000 km away from home and paying alsolutely same in a very costly city.
So I was thinking of joining the MNC but was reluctant to leave the stability that comes with govt job as we have all seen with recent layoff. I am Definitely not a risk taker and not even in a situation to take risk because I have zero skills all i know was some DSA and not a 5 star or expert kind of thing, just a guy who did 500 DSA problem to get the job only.

But the thing happened is I got triggered by something done by my boss. So My brain started playing mind games with me and as we know VINASH KALE VIPRIT BUDDHI and going against my family wish I put the resignation without discussing with my boss also.
Then I told this to my family and then OH MY GOD, It created a Emotional Turmoil, Disaster, i would say that was the worst day of my life everyone around me crying shouting weeping and what not for that moment I just wanted to kill my self.
And I am not strong enough to keep going forward even after all this.
So I decided to take my resignation back, But I am not getting how and what I have heard from my colleagues is that after taking the resignation back I will be treated as a stray dog here but that's suni sunaai batey , I don't want to take the guilt of not taking the resignation back when I had the time,

So what should I do give me some advice
Or how should I go and what to say to take it back .
Or Weather will I get it back or not ?

i posted on here a while ago about what to say to a friend on the phone i was asking for career advice. well, that conversation went VERY well, and it looks like i’m about to have a few opportunities land on my plate soon. 

the thing is, the opportunities are one-off (this is my attempt at moving into the world of live music touring). they’re intense, involve moving around the world and being in different timezones, and basically would mean i would have to quit my 9-5. i am all for it (my company recently got bought up by a large conglomerate and several people have left already as a result of the company going downhill) but i am painfully aware of the fact that i’m 23 and that’s a very young age to go freelance at. 

my worry is that once these opportunities are over, i won’t have anything to fall back on, and i won’t get anything due to my age and being inexperienced. i’m all for freelancing for my current company and similar ones in the future but i don’t even know if that’s a realistic assumption. does anyone have any advice as to where i go from here?",spudyoulike,1,1.0,0,1697213610,2023-10-13 16:13:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1772cvg/jumping_to_freelance_at_23/,10,2023
177261g,I got fired from a job I liked,"A little back story, I’m in the HVAC trade. My start to my career was pretty rough. I graduated from school & immediately got hired. My wife (fiancé at the time) talked about finally getting a place once I get hired and know where I’d be at. So we moved.  Within a month they had terminated my contract. It took me months to find another job. I got hired on as a helper. I learned a lot but I was on piece rate making like $200 a week. I stuck it through & waited a few months to get promoted being given false promises. I got into my own service truck. I did not receive my raise, I applied to other jobs got a few offers but I took an offer from a bigger company. At first it was great I was excelling at my role and enjoyed my pay. But little by little I realized how unhappy I was working for a medium to small shop that tried acting like a white shirt company(corporate type feeling/up selling etc). I stayed until I found another job. I was uneasy about taking it but as soon as I started working I was happy. I was making good money, making sales, doing repairs, and installs. I didn’t mind working late, I didn’t mind waking up early that job gave me purpose. Unfortunately after season we were surprised some people were let go, and I was one of them. I immediately accepted a warehouse job just to be able to pay my bills. A few days later another company called closer to family. We decided to go with family and give it a try. It’s a great opportunity making $30a hour doing similar work. Im miserable though. I got offered another job within that area too for $25(same as I was making before). I know I seem ungrateful and probably wimpy. I’m not sure whats wrong with me and not being able to commit. The $30 job means I’d eventually (closer to the end of my 90 days) relocate to the area if things go well. While the $25 a hour is closer to my family and we can wait a little but honestly I’m not feeling that job either. Not sure if this is some mental health stuff or I’m being a baby (probably both tbh lol) or what it is? Honestly looking for some perspective or advice or maybe venting idk tbh.

1770qvz,Is a job in software development still worth pursuing?,"I’ve got the same story as many other people in this subreddit - I work for a big corporation (I won’t say which for privacy reasons) that’s pushing return to office on workers and going through waves of layoffs. I’m underpaid - I make less than the minimum salary for my role thanks to loopholes for internal hires, I’m overworked, and I’m terrified of a layoff that could come at any moment. 

I’ve been sending out applications by the dozens every day since August, but rejection after rejection in my current field of work has me worried that my current skill set is too niche to be applicable anywhere other than the company I currently work for. If I leave, I think I need to make a complete career change.

For years, I’ve toyed with the idea of pursuing a career in software development, specifically front-end development. I know a decent chunk of HTML, CSS, and Java, and with the help of a class or a coding boot camp I could almost certainly get a certification. But with how things have been in the tech industry recently, I don’t know if that’s even worth pursuing anymore? I’ve heard whispers that the industry is over saturated, and that they’re seeing lots of layoffs now too.

Then I will develpe good skills like initiative, problem solving, service, maybe some juridical knowledge. I will meet many different people and maybe feel if I want to learn more about the technical side of maintanance, or maybe a trade. And maybe later proberty management. Or maybe I realise I am more suited for gardening, then I can maybe transfer with some experiecne of grounds keepeing, tools and working vehicles. 

Or do I start with gardening?? Work and do more schooling, maybe learn more about cultivation or biology, ecological systems, city gardens. Maybe later work in a beautiful location, green house or with counseling (I've always been interested in biology and nature science) Though it seems like it's very competitive/not mutch work.

i’ve thought about it for a while now and i’m only sad about how it will affect my family. it makes sense logically to kill myself. if i quit my job i won’t be able to pay my rent or bills. my parents don’t have money so they can’t help me. i wasted 4 years in college to get a degree and i’ve wasted another year teaching. i’ve been applying for different jobs for going on 2 years now. i’m tired and i don’t see another option. the world is structured to break us down im convinced. i’m fully prepared to kill myself and honestly since i was a kid i always had a feeling i’d end up doing it. there’s no where for me to go, no where to get help. this feels like my only

Over the past week, my manager has been pressuring me to do a certain type of analysis about a product in the industry. We are both aware that I don't have the requisite experience or know-how to do it to the standard that it requires yet.

However,I started working on it and showed him a little of my progress. He said I was on the right track and left me with more pointers on focusing my work.

Last night, I received an email saying I need to lead a meeting Monday to discuss this analysis. He also said I should take meeting notes and focus on the future roadmap for this analysis.

I am kinda lost on how I am expected to tell folks with 20 years experience about something when I've been here 3 weeks. I don't mind failing, I just don't want it to be held against me. Not so soon at least.

176x8vq,Engineering or finance?,"Originally posted this on another sub but wanted to get some other opinions too

I got admitted to a globally top 15 ranked finance bachelors and also a globally top 10 ranked engineering bachelors program (both in mainland europe, different schools) and don’t know which one is smarter to choose

I really like and I’m very good at math and physics however I’m also interested in finance world + already started investing & like to research that kind of stuff so both of them comes appealing.

In terms of career I don’t know that much, it seems like finance can bring in more money compared to engineering. But there is a chance of doing msc finance after engineering whereas other way around is not possible. But if I want to get in investment banking bsc and msc finance path seems more straightforward. Another important point is if I study finance I kinda feel like my quantitative abilities will go to waste and I don’t like the idea of doing a relatively easy degree (compared to stem).

What do you guys think, please don’t answer “do what you like/passionate about” because I like both and after long research at 18yo I don’t have a passion for a particular thing.

176w004,My job is toxic and I don’t know what to do,"Hi, I'm writing this because I don't know what to do anymore. I started working as a transportation claims analyst for a company a few months ago, and it has been the worst experience of my life. Here are some of the problems I'm facing:

- I was hired without any HR involvement, and the job description was vague and misleading. I had to go through three rounds of interviews, none with any HR representative, just with my manager and some team members.
- I was told that I would be managing claims and supporting ASN error management, which are already very demanding and time-consuming tasks. But then I found out that I also have to make visualizations in Tableau for different departments like finance, operations, etc., which I was never told about or trained for.
- My manager is very aggressive and unreasonable with me. He expects me to do all three tasks perfectly and quickly, without giving me any guidance or feedback. He doesn't understand how Tableau works and just wants me to have the reports ready ASAP. He also makes me work overtime without paying me extra, and questions me if I don't finish everything by the end of the day.
- My team members are also very hostile and unhelpful towards me. They want me to do their part of the work and don't give me any support or information. One of them is supposed to help me with Tableau, but he always avoids me or gives me wrong or incomplete instructions. It's like he has something against me.

All of this has taken a toll on my mental health. I feel anxious, depressed, and exhausted every day. I don't enjoy my work at all, and I dread going to the office. I feel like I'm trapped in a nightmare, and I don't see any way out.

I want to quit this job, but I don't know how to do it without burning bridges or ruining my reputation. I also don't know how to find another job that suits my skills and interests. I feel like I have no options or hope.

Please, can someone give me some advice on how to deal with this situation? How can I escape this toxic job and find a better one? How can I cope with the stress and pressure until then? How can I stand up for myself and protect my rights? Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.

176uh63,I just finished my masters but I don’t know which career is best for me.,"I'm a 24-year-old grad with a master's in mechanical engineering. I'm super keen on diving into the world of robotics, and I've been applying for those jobs non-stop, but I've been getting ""thanks, but no thanks"" from all of them. During my master's, I tackled four robotics projects and a couple of mechanical design ones to earn my degree, but it seems like that's not cutting it in the job hunt.

I had this grand plan to jump into my master's right after my undergrad, but life threw me a curveball and I had to delay it by a year.

176tpj7,Is it me?,"Hey everyone,

I've been at my job for almost 2 years and put my notice in over a month ago (without anything else lined up, my last day is 11/3). I work for a very well known global nonprofit, though the chapter that I work for is very small (10 or so employees between two site locations). 

I'm incredibly burned out and am struggling with knowing whether my work environment is toxic or if it's ""just me."" Here are some examples:

\-Before I started, my location had around 4 employees on-site at a time. Since I started during COVID, when I came on board all staff were asked to work remotely except for two operations staff (myself being one of the two). Since then, some positions have been cut and what was once a ""temporary"" remote work option for other staff (Advancement/Development Team and Finance Team) has become permanent - some staff even moved out of state. I think flexibility for staff is great, but it's left me in a position where I'm doing a lot outside of my job description... taking photos for social media to send to our Advancement Team, being asked to speak at events in the area to represent our chapter to large corporate groups/donors, taking photos of checks that come in and then emailing those to our Finance team. None of our remote staff have phone numbers that they can be reached at, so I'm also acting as secretary. In addition, in my role, I am on call 50% of the year... often have to work holidays and weekends if we can't find coverage... and have to staff our program 9A-5P, which even though I'm salaried leaves little room for me to have any flexibility. It seems like other members of the team get a lot more flexibility... (and have more staff! Both the Advancement and Finance Teams have 3 remote full time staff each, whereas operations only has 2). 

\-I commute to work (it can take me 2 hours each way with traffic) and was often asked to pick up/drop off things between locations since my home is actually closer to the location that I don't work at. I eventually mentioned that we don't have a mileage reimbursement policy and since I already commute extensively to get to work would like to be reimbursed for anything I am asked to drive additional. Our HR representative told me that ""the rate is around 30 cents, it is insubstantial,"" and I mentioned that it was actually about double that, and also legally the state that I live in requires reimbursement (and will fine an organization that doesn't reimburse). The HR representative was very elevated in her conversation with me but eventually the organization emailed out a mileage reimbursement policy.

\-There have been a few issues where one member of senior leadership has come to my site location and made strange comments. She said (in front of other members of the team)... ""Some I get so nervous about the world that we live in... one day I'm going to have to tell my kids that they need to be careful, because people have AIDS! And that scares me."" It was very... random. PS, both myself and my other coworker are gay men and this was a straight white woman. She also said to me once, while I was driving her to the store to pick up something for an event, ""No offense, but how can I make sure that my son grows up to be gay? I love gay people!"" I didn't take offense but it felt incredibly... strange to say the least. 

\-I often get no response from colleagues when I email... even if it is an email pertinent to assisting their department. Sometimes it feels very purposeful?... and my black colleague has often been left off of emails entirely. 

\-The team recently ousted our CEO by asking the board to do a review, so you can see that we are a bit messy as an organization.

\-I gave 2 months notice, and finally after a month I saw that they posted my position on Indeed - but only there and only for a week. Not on our website, on LinkedIn or other social media, or any other job sites. This leads me to believe that they have another external candidate in mind. My colleague submitted his resume and this seemed to almost catch the senior leadership team off guard... I'm still not sure what their plan is to replace me, but I feel like their way of posting instead of actually seeking out a diverse pool of qualified applicants is cringey.

\-I wrote to our temporary CEO about possibly covering topics around DEI and upcoming full team meetings after she wrote asking for feedback/ideas. This is talked about as a strategic objective, but we haven't actually ever had any conversation/training around this as a team... ever. She wrote back briefly, ""Thank you for the suggestion. We will continue to have conversations around topics pertaining to DEI."" It felt weird because... we haven't had any conversations around this?

So, I definitely feel like some people in the organization are ""protected""... I feel disappointed because I've worked really hard and really believed in our mission, but... something feels incredibly off. Is it me?

176qkm1,Fired for something I didn't do.,"I got ""separated from employment"" today because a woman (who just started there last week) claimed I said ""\[another employee\] can suck my d@$&"" last week. I'll admit to having VERY colorful language, as does every other nurse/cst/surgeon in the OR, but I've never said those words in my life (& being a woman, it just feels weird to say it). Clearly, something I said sounded like it, but I have no clue what seeing as how I couldn't tell you what I had for breakfast yesterday, much less recall something I said last week. HR claims their ""proof"" was other witnesses, but the only other person present was too far away to hear me say anything at all with 2 massive autoclaves & 2 instrument washers running beside us. I was there over 2 years without anyone having issues with me, so I'm a tad angry they'd take her word over mine, but the new CNO has been steadily firing people who stand up to her asking us to do unethical/illegal things (I make #6 in the last month), so I feel like she's just using this to get rid of me (especially when the employee that everyone complains about yelling racial slurs all day everyday hasn't even been written up). 

I was already looking for another job out of fear of ending up in court &/or losing my RN license from the crap going on up there, but now I don't know what to put for ""why did you leave your last job? Were you fired?"" kind of questions. I don't want to lie, but the truth is just 1 big dumpster fire!

Also, what would they likely have my termination reason as? I'm afraid of what I might say to them if I call & ask. They said I can apply for COBRA (which I couldn't do if it was ""gross misconduct""), but just regular misconduct (& my 1st offense! & not really my 1st offense because I never said it!) wouldn't have been grounds for termination (but will still keep me from getting unemployment).

176q8l8,6 month job: going remote or moving companies,"Hello! This may be a long story but I will try to keep it short.

I recently graduated and got a job this year. The job is fine, but I barely use my degree. I actually like the world we do and it gives me purpose and a wage. The coworkers are alright, but we do not mingle or anything. Just say hi and small talk.

I've been with the company for 6 months and my progress report will be coming up. I felt like I've done well, so I think I'd be able to get a raise (at least my colleagues think I've done well). But what I really want is to go remote.

My girlfriend and I have been together for two years. It's a story that would end up flooding this post, but we have tried countless time to move in but haven't had the opportunity. It's starting to become a strain on our relationship having to drive over 100 miles every weekend just to see each other. I'd give up a raise just to be with her and still keep my job.

I don't know if my boss would allow someone so young and inexperienced work from home. He's given a reason to not promote it fearing that people will become lazy. But we do have remote workers with the company.

I also recently found a company that just posted a wanted ad that really appealed to me. I'd get to use my degree, possibly use the knowledge from my current job, get remote work or hybrid work closer to my girlfriend, and a 20% pay increase. I really feel like I have a fair shot if I applied. I'm just working about pissing off my current employer or having any employer think I'm flakey.

176px3r,Am I eligible for a raise?,"I started my job in June 2023. I work in a newer branch of a nationwide construction company as a service coordinator. I basically set up our accounts for the account managers. I currently make roughly 47k in a LCOL area.
Since I am in a new and growing branch, there are a lot of changes and we are adding to the team constantly. 
However, one of our account managers is being pulled away for a special project. 
I’ve been given the opportunity to take over her position as account manger until she finishes with the project, at which point she will return and we will split the workload together (the workload is estimated to grow exponentially in the coming months).

Our end-of-year reviews are coming up and I’m wondering if I should be asking for a raise at this time. The account managers make significantly more than I do (at least 60k a year) and I would like to see myself at at least 52k for this new workload. Being an account manager will get me to the ceiling in this branch. We all report to one manager, so there’s no real room to grow until we become a much larger branch.
They are already interviewing for my current position (whom I will have to train).

My hesitations are that I’m less than 6 months into this job, and while I have worked my ass off to contribute new ideas and cleaned up months of backlog- I haven’t had the time to come up with a comprehensive list of my accomplishments over a significant period of time.

I am currently in the transition stage, slowly starting to take over accounts and get a feel for the process- while managing my existing workload.

176psoz,Advice needed between two jobs?,"I have been stressing over making a job decision and it is causing me lack of sleep. I am down to the last few days and need to decide. I can't seem to make up my mind. I am a very indecisive person and hate change and don't deal with change well. I recently retired after 28 years as a teacher, I worked in the same school for 28 years, and worked with many of the same people for over 20 years. I retied early because the last year was hell because of a new administrator and a very troubled  violent student. I am 61 and would like to return to teaching for 2-3 years to pay for my health insurance and because I can collect my pension and my teaching salary.  I am getting older and sometimes teaching is draining. I am a perfectionist of sorts and put alot of pressure on my self to be the best. Here are my options and I would appreciate any suggestions:

1.Option 1- In person teaching job at a new school that is beautiful and the administration is very nice! Things are very organized at this school and it is a low income school so I would only have 14 students. However it is an early start school and I hate waking up early and it will require alot of work at first as I am starting three months after the school year has started and I have to learn alot of new programs. However since I have taught in building and was good at it - I feel like I can do the job without much help. Downside is I have been off for 5 months and I am used to sleeping and being home and have started liking it. The school pays about 20 thousand more a year. This isn't a major issue as I will be making enough between my pension and pay. My best friend works at the school so thats a plus and its a 20 minute drive so not too far. Part if me is excited about this jib, but I worry after a few weeks I'll wish I was sleeping in and working from my home.

2. Option 2 - is an online public school part of the same school district as Option 1. It is the same grade I have taught for 28 years and my daughter works in a different grade there. The job is an hour less a day and its from my home. No driving or getting dressed up from home and I can get up an hour later. The programs they use I am familar with and I have taught online before for a year. However, this school uses a different online platform that I am not familar with. The teaches in the grade level dont all get along, but that could be the case in option 1 as well. It's harder to reach out to coworkers for help when you are online. I am not the best with technology,but my daughter tells me I can learn it with time.  However, I would need a lot of support with this job from my daughter for awhile and I am worried I can't do the job. Also, the parents are always in the background so that stresses me out a bit. I am concerned I am giving up a good remote job opportunity that might be well suited for me because of the fear of failing .

I am almost looking for someone to just decide for me. I know it's crazy, but I can't do it.",Realistic-Meal-3505,1,1.0,0,1697169150,2023-10-13 03:52:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/176psoz/advice_needed_between_two_jobs/,10,2023

176p70q,Exec Assistant to Project Management Pathway?,"First Job as EA. What is my career path to PM?

Hey yall. I just turned 22 last month and also was fortunate enough to get paid a lot of money to become a Legal EA for a very prestigious law firm. This role is pretty mid level, as it requires experience to enter. 

I really want to get into project management. I think having a first job supporting partners as an EA will most likely give me a big head start. I have made a couple goals that will either prepare me well for strategic planning & project management, and have asked the firm to set me up for those skillsets since they asked. There's opportunity to move to these roles within the firm. 

Do you have any advice on how long I should stay in this role before attempting to branch into a PM role? Salary wise, what can I expect? (Currently making $73-80k range). What work does the job uniquely entail? I am fine with even spending the next 2 years to develop myself as a candidate.

176p49g,Seeking Advice: How to Kickstart a Professional Career while Working Security with Limited Connectivity,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I find myself in a situation that's been bothering me lately. I work as a security guard, and during my 8 to 12-hour shifts, I have virtually nothing to do, thanks to the quiet nature of the job. The catch is, I don't have access to Wi-Fi or a mobile hotspot during this time so using my laptop isn’t an option. However, I do have my trusty smartphone with me.

I'm really eager to use this downtime constructively and start building a professional career or learning new skills. I believe there must be creative ways to make the most of my free time. 

So, I'm turning to this community for suggestions. What apps, courses, or resources do you recommend for someone in my situation? Are there specific fields or industries that I can delve into that might not require a constant internet connection? Any personal success stories or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm ready to make the most of this opportunity, and I'm excited to hear your insights!

176oicm,Stay at the same company for years or change companies every 2-3 years?,"Hi everyone, I don’t know many people in the corporate world so I’d like to know about your experiences. 

I have stayed at the same company for 4 years now. First job out of college. I’m considering making a jump to another company. I have a good relationship with my manager. I know my next promotion is 1.5-2 years away. I have formed relationships with other department managers and have a somewhat secure spot on a different team. However, it’s very uncertain about when I would actually be offered the opportunity to jump to the other team and learn something new. For salary, I’m likely gaining 3-5 % a year. ~10% for getting up to the next tier of my department (i wouldn’t be a manager). Currently in the low 80s. Work in supply chain. 

I know it’s popular to stay at a job for 2-3 years then hop to another company and get basically an instant 10-20% raise 

Have you stayed at the same company for long? Do you think it was worth it. Or do you regret not hopping to another company?

If you have hopped to other companies, how did that go, did you find the transition easy, were the raises actually significant?

176o2u1,Why am I not able to grab opportunities?,"

Hello everyone, 
I am a final year economics undergraduate at Delhi University. I have been applying to hundreds of opportunities and cold emailing a lot to grab and internship opportunity and have been terribly rejected everywhere. I don't know where I am going wrong and would like to take a chance to discuss the probable reasons out here. 

While my peers who did not have any profile at all were also able to grab opportunities at prestigious organisations like NITI AAYOG, or KPMG/Deloitte/etc either through personal approaches or winning competitions, I have had a hard time getting one. 

I don't have an empty profile. I've previously interned at a growth-oriented role at a financial services booming start-up ( my role included preparing presentations, undergoing market research, directly associating with the clients to understand their requirements for business documents such as investor pitches, business pitches, etc. I have honedy research, design and communication skills altogether. 

I have also been a founding member of an NGO in the sphere of mental health that is now successfully registered under the Government of India. I've been organising all the field visits, drives and talks, handling the social presence, etc. for the NGO. 

Apart from this, I have co-founded the consulting club at my college and lead both corporate relations and as a general secretary simultaneously. I have also lead the same corporate relations at the entrepreneurship cell of the college. 

I got my CV reviewed by a few people who commented that it seemed well off. I don't know where I'm getting wrong since I haven't really reached even the interview stage to prove my worth to the recruiters. 

I would be glad to hear some insights either on the right method, ways to improve, the current market dynamics, or guidance on where I could be going wrong, etc.

176nya3,FAANG worth burning bridges?,"I just started a new contract(open-ended) job working as a Salesforce Analyst at a pretty large industry and a very respected company.  This is a career pivot from what I used to do which is manual software testing(I have no programming skills for automation but would like to learn).

So, here’s the situation.  Before I started my new job.  I landed an interview with Apple and next thing I knew I got a job contract(open-ended) offer as a QA engineer.

Which career path has more growth?  Tech jobs seems to be getting harder and harder to land.  And from what I heard a lot of people don’t like the culture at Apple and they either quit within a year or suck it up and get the experience until they find a more favorable job.  I honestly never let office politics affect me, I just keep my head down and do my job. 

As for the Analyst job, it’s a lot of meetings, will require traveling in the future which I don’t like.  But I feel is a very stable career path with a high chance of getting a permanent position.

176naop,How This Hooters Waitress Became The President of Cinnabon,"**Kat Cole shares her story:**  
“When I was nine, my mother, siblings, and I left my alcoholic dad and went out on our own. \[My mother\] worked multiple jobs to make ends meet, feeding us on a food budget of $10/week for three years.  
My mom was really an example to me. She was courageous, gritty, resourceful, entrepreneurial, and could do a lot with a dime. So, that colored my beliefs and made me want to work at a very young age.  
From waitressing at Hooters, working in the mall, and cleaning gym equipment, work was a way out of that situation. It was freedom. And in that early work journey, I was often either elected to leadership positions or asked to take on leadership positions. It felt quite natural because I had been in a leadership role with my sisters for many years.""  
**Q: Later, when you were admitted into college, you dropped out to work at Hooters. Why?**  
“So I started at Hooters in high school when I was a junior. I was the first person in my family to get into college, majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. My plan was to get that degree and then go to law school.  
Hooters was a way for me to pay for my education. I was a hostess, waitress, bartender, and trainer, where I taught new employees. This is all in my first two years there. So, even though I was going to college, I was making the most, working in the restaurant.  
I dropped out because Hooters had asked me to be a part of international training teams, travel around the world, and open franchises. At 19, I was in Australia, Central America, and different states in the US, traveling, being elevated professionally, and taking on a ton of responsibility.  
But that meant I was also never in school, so I was failing, and through my actions, I had already made my choice. This is where I'm spending my time. These are the opportunities right in front of me that feel more unique and more important than going to class.  
So I meet with my counselor, and she says, *‘There is a way to make up your classes, but you're not only going to have to stop traveling, you won't even be able to work as much.’*  
I could not financially afford to stop working. So, I dropped out and took a corporate job at Hooters. I just believed there would be more opportunity. I moved to Atlanta and started working in the corporate office. As the company grew, I grew. Every 18 to 24 months, I was promoted to a new management role. By the time I was 26, I was one of the vice presidents of the company, doing around $800 million in revenue. I didn't know anyone in my network who was my age, whether they had been to college or not.  
However, I did realize there were things I missed: the language of finance, the language of business and accounting, and the mentorship of business people who were outside of the restaurant industry. So I went back to get my MBA without a bachelor's degree.”  
**Q: How did you get your MBA without a Bachelor's degree?**  
“I had a mentor who took a great interest in me. She was a recruiter and still is a dear friend today. She's like, *‘Look, if you want to stay in the restaurant industry, you're going to have no problem getting any job you want. But if you ever want to go anywhere else, you are not going to get past their HR filter. You're a child of a single parent, alcoholic father, college dropout who's worked at Hooters her whole life.’*  
I didn't like the idea of doors being shut. She said, *‘I know someone who's a CEO who got their masters without a bachelor’s. It's not easy, and it's rare, but it's possible.’*  
And that's all I needed to hear that it was possible. I started calling all the business schools that had executive MBA programs with locations in Atlanta and was accepted into multiple MBA programs. They told me I had to take the GMAT very quickly. So I took the GMAT and had to get a higher-than-typical passing score, which I did, and that was it.  
I started at Georgia State University, Robinson College of Business in 2008 and graduated in December 2010. Two months after I had started as president of Cinnabon.”

176m1l6,Is it appropriate to email the individual who posted a LinkedIn job if they opted to NOT be shown as the job poster?,"There’s a company that I have wanted a chance to apply at for a while now, but they’re in a very different industry than my work experience. They just posted a job for a position that’s very relevant to a lot of projects I’ve taken on over the years, but I’m worried that even after tweaking my resume, I still wouldn’t stand out much. I’d like to include a few examples of previous work but think it will go completely overlooked.  
  
I guess LinkedIn has this recent feature that shows “Verifications” on profiles. So it does not show who the job poster is, but it does show that they joined LinkedIn in 20XX and verified their work email over X years ago. So I went to the company’s profile, looked thru the entire list of employees (less than 100 combined in HR and the department the job’s in) and found exactly one that matches those verifications. Their position is exactly who I would expect to interview with.  
  
But since I’ve found that LinkedIn messages are usually ignored, even the “InMail”, I decided to do some googling. I was able to find their work email online. I’m debating emailing just to say I’m very interested in the position and confident I would do well, but am hoping to avoid being “filtered out” because of my direct experience.

176l3ri,Should I quit my job because the general manager almost denied me 1.5 days off for wisdom teeth removal and blamed me for not scheduling better?,"**TL:DR** I have a dentist appointment at the start of December to have all four wisdom teeth removed due to pain. I went to the general manager for approval to take 1.5 days off during the holiday season, explaining my medical need, and his first and second response was to deny it b/c it's going to be busy and asked why I didn't take care of this sooner. I'm a salaried manager that makes enough to be comfortable but I feel like quitting before we start the holiday season and do 5 12-hour days b/c the general manager put the company before me and I could use the time to job hunt instead. I have about 10 months of post-tax take-home saved up.

**Full Story:**

I've been a warehouse manager for a large U.S. company for more than two years. Two months ago, I applied for a transfer to a site in a city I preferred living in and moved a month ago. Two days ago, I finally got around to going to the dentist for the first time since pre-COVID for tooth pain that started two months ago. I need to have all four wisdom teeth removed.

I tried getting a surgery appointment for before December, when the busy holiday season begins, but they were booked. I scheduled for a Thursday (dentist only does the surgery on Tu/Th) so that I would only need to miss half of Thursday and all of Friday with the weekend to recover.

I let my direct boss know about the surgery and needing time off and they told me I'll need approval from the general manager since December is black-out for time off.

So I went to the general manager (who hired me two months ago) and told him everything in the second paragraph. His first response was to tell me I can't take time off because it's the busiest time of the year. (Note: He knows that I've already worked for the same company for two holiday seasons.) I was shocked and disappointed in him b/c I had just said that I'm in pain and I need to have my wisdom teeth removed. When I pushed back, reminding him that I know how busy it will be but I need this surgery done now, the general manager asked me why I didn't take care of this sooner if the pain started two months ago.

At this point, I requested that we step off the floor and have a private conversation. I told him how his questions came off to me, immediately shifting the focus of the conversation to questioning my scheduling rather than my pain and medical needs, and he asked why I was getting defensive over a simple question, ""Why didn't you take care of this sooner?"" Eventually, he gave approval for me to take the time off as long as I ensure with my direct boss that there's enough team coverage.

I've heard good things about the general manager, and he did recently win a big fight to reduce our salaried work hours by 20%, but this interaction left me with a terrible taste in my mouth. In the last part of our conversation, the GM did talk a better talk, but I don't like where he took the conversation in the first half at all.

For all of December, we're going to be working an extra 12-hour day per week at no additional pay (salaried) due to business needs. I have a 1.5 day medical need and the general manager's immediate concern was having headcount on site, not me. I'm sure something like this will come up again and it makes me feel like quitting before the holiday season starts b/c I already was considering switching careers and spending all my energy working 5 12-hour days a week, with barely a weekend breather to do job searching sounds terrible. I have about 10 months of post-tax take-home saved up.

176gyjr,Small team but our director only ever talks to one person (not our team lead),"Hi everyone, 

Idk if this is the right place to ask. Please let me know if I should be doing more. 

For a year, our director consistently invites only one co-worker from my team to process meetings, excluding even our team lead. I'm a QA specialist in a specialized industry, part of a three-person team. 

My boss has 4 years at the company, I have over 2, and the favored co-worker just over a year. 

Despite my boss and I having more industry experience, our director seems to prefer this co-worker for process discussions. My boss is disinterested due to burn out, but it bothers me. She often makes this co-worker the lead on projects. 

I’ve expressed my interest in process improvements and have even provided  project drafts with the hopes she would consider including me. FYI, I've never had issues with our director. 

Anyways, she still doesn’t include me or respond to my ideas. She actually stood me up in a meeting before. It was an online meeting to review the trainining manual our company uses that I made by myself. 

I joined the meeting on time, reached out to see if she was running late but got no response. Turns out she met with the co-worker instead and did the whole meeting without me. It was my work and to this day they use that manual I made. 

I’m confused. Should I be doing more? I’ve never had this issue. And no, I’m not being fired. It’s obviously when they plan to fire you. They aren’t discreet and are creatures of habit, so their firing process is recognizable.

I’d love to have advice on what I can pursuit to invest in myself and become more valuable or learn a new skill while making more money.

My first job was doing Recruiting for a Staffing agency.

Now I’m doing Recruitment and SOME HR duties for a large labor union.

I like recruiting but don’t want to do it as a career. I feel as the longer I’m doing this, the easier it would be to get trapped in it. I wouldn’t mind taking classes to learn a new skill in ANYTHING.

My passions right now are photography, politics of unions, literature, and film.

176fw2r,Resume advice for better jobs?,"So I’m tailoring my CV as I’m back on a job hunt. I’ve realised I made some fatal mistakes last time that limited me with options. Mainly, I was 100% honest and truthful on my CV. Come to find out, a lot of people in higher paying jobs, weren’t. My friend just landed a £38k a year job by bullshitting. I would like to break 35k. 

Now, I’m not stupid. I did CS, but I’m not gonna apply for a senior dev role, as I’d be found out within a day. The jobs I’m going for, I feel I can genuinely do and perform well at, I may not have all the skills now, but I can learn and adapt pretty quickly. I’m not gonna reach for something where I have to learn a complicated software, or new coding language in a week, as that’s stupid. 

In terms of experience, I have some admin, customer service, logistics, and store manager experience. I’m trying to go for roles like contracts manager, transport operations manager, productions supervisor etc. There’s one job as a general manager for a bar, which has a live in option in a nice area, and 35k a year, I’d like that one. 

Skill wise, I can code in several languages. On the side, I resell items from tech to guitars, so I’ve got a lot of experience dealing with people and sales. I’ve also got some experience with console repair for last gen, which was a side hustle for a while until next gen came out. 

I’m still unsure of if I should write multiple CV’s for just the one, and what do I include, skill/experience whose to land these jobs. Also, I’m 25, that’s probably important to say. I would go back into tech but the entry level jobs are paying really badly, worse than a temp role at Royal Mail (genuinely), and I need the cash.

176e82m,FTE and contractor pay equity question,"My org recently posted jobs for my role (same job/title, but in a different program than I work in) that are contract; however, these jobs are PT at 22.5 hours/week, the salary is only a couple thousand less than I make working FT, AND the positions include healthcare PLUS retirement benefits!

I recently made a request for an ADA accommodation, part of which includes primarily a 3-day schedule on weeks that are slower, considering FT pay for PT work is apparently something my job does now. My org responded to my request with their proposed modified schedule of 22.5 hours/week in my position, however, they claim they'd have to pro-rate my salary to $46,500 on this schedule, which is frankly, not enough for me to make my bills on.

Without going into the specifics of my ADA request, what I'm wondering is if what they're proposing could be considered discriminatory. They seem to have no issue paying comparable to my current salary for PT work, but when I request it, they can only do it by busting my pay down to less than what they were paying me when I started?

Hi guys so I joined a company about a month ago . They’re in a different state . Like a random state I do not want to live in( the lay is decent though ) . Since I was a new grad in this market , I said yes after looking at their relocation policy which said we have up to 1 year to relocate. Even my recruiter at the same time told me directly that I have up to a year to relocate, told me I can maybe visit now and then if the team needs , and that it’s okay for me to take up to 1 year to move . My plan was to work here for almost a year and quit before I have to actually move , hoping that I would find something better . 

My manager however seems keen to want me to come in person ASAP . Even when I did go in person , for a week , I received no help . No knowledge transfer secession. It’s a niche technology . Not something I can look up either . I felt like he’s doing this cause he wants me there. My recruiter unfortunately switched companies and I can’t reach him either . 

What do you all suggest I do ? I can’t perform my best because I don’t receive any help / context of the codebase or tools . I’m essentially left on my own . Not 1 damn day did the manager or anyone have a knowledge transfer secession . I have had to ask and figure it out myself . Which is what takes the most time . The code itself is not hard actually.

176ajb4,"Failed pre-employment drug screen weeks ago, but employer wants me to start Monday. Am I screwed?","Like the title says, I tested positive (lab confirmed) for THC during a pre-employment drug test. I know it's stupid, but I live in NY, where it is legal to consume and possess, and I do so recreationally. Now, in NY it's specifically illegal to discriminate for marijuana consumption for 99% percent of jobs. I was an idiot and wasn't aware of the fine print that says organizations that receive federal funding are exempt from this- and it's a job at an outpatient clinic owned by a hospital. It's essentially an admin assistant position, but I'm (fairly?) sure the same rules apply, since the hospital would technically be my employer. 

Now here's where it gets confusing: I received my test results two weeks after, when I was called by an outside company. This was after I already went back to receive the booster vaccines that the physical said I needed. The woman I spoke to specifically said that the results should be available to my employer within 1-2 HOURS. So I automatically assumed all was lost and started looking elsewhere. 

Then on Monday, they email me asking if I can come in Tuesday to check my blood titers. The person I've been communicating with forwards me the exact email from health services, which just says ""\[My Name"" needs blood titer check this week before we can complete health clearance"". I go in again, Employee Health services says nothing to me. Today, they sent me my orientation documents and told me since they're assuming my titers should be fine, my start date is Monday, as soon as they finish clearing me. 

My question is... what the hell? Did I misunderstand the loopholes in the law and they were just checking to make sure I'm not on meth? Is a 10-panel drug test just cheaper to order? Is it normal procedure for a failed drug test not to show up until the very end of the hiring/clearance process, or is that something that would immediately pop up as a big red flag if not allowed? Would that information go to HR and maybe there's been a communication gap between HR and Health Services? 

I'm super confused. I don't want to get my hopes up, but if I do have a shot here, I do need to start getting ready. Any insight or advice would be really appreciated.

1769hwm,Advice for job with high turn over rate,"My job has a high turnover rate. I work in the corporate world, the job is demanding. I've been here for 3 years. People usually quit around 6 months, they never make it a year. Especially the receptionist position. So when people quit, we are expected to pick up all the work from the person that quit no matter what they're position was, and people just think it's normal. The higher ups just go on about their day as do my coworkers but I have a huge problem with this. The boss just interviews the next person, hire them, leave them to the wolves, they complain and quit. Process repeats. Don't they see that this is a problem? Why won't they address what's going on and make some changes? Why should we be expected to not only do our positions but be the receptionists job too. It's way too much. I'm usually running around the entire day. Sorry I didn't know where to post this.

1769e69,Second job interviews for Admin roles,"I just concluded a Zoom interview with a University for a temp Admin role. I answered the questions comfortably because I have a lot of experience in this role, too much if you ask me. As the interview was wrapping up the interviewer made me aware that she would relay to the hiring manager and schedule a second interview. This interview was basically a screening for wanted candidates.

This job is for approxitmately a couple of months, potential for it to be extended. If its not a managerial or Executive role what need is it to be fussy and waste the candidate's time with having multiple interviews? The second interview may also be in person or sometime later today so now I feel that I'm in limbo on standby. I have things on my agenda and can't just wait around.

17693ji,Im tired of this life,"I have worked in medicine for 12 years, specializing as an X-ray technician. I have a second higher education as an ecologist, a specialist in technosphere safety. I dreamed of becoming a scientist, I live with my family in Russia. All my life I was interested and actively cognized science, art, cognition is my passion and meaning of life. I live very poor, in medicine I get a salary of 300-350 dollars a month. I do not have enough for anything, I have never been abroad in Russia, and now I have no hope to be. Given the constant ideological pressure, it is difficult to find even a working specialty, because if you do not agree with the party line, you will just be humiliated and spoil your life, and they may even put you in jail. All my relatives are in other countries, one sister is in Israel, another in Ukraine, the third in Germany, and my father, with whom I have a serious quarrel, lives in Spain. No one helps me and has never helped me, I have always lived in self-reliance, even in bad times no one called me. In the future is a fog, total poverty and lack of prospects. Routine work in a city hospital barely covers the need for food.

1768fsr,How do you rebuild your confidence and happiness at work after making a mistake and feeling awful?,"I work completely online, I give assessment and have good reviews on my job, never had a problem and tons of experience in my field.  
A customer complained about me and the assessment bookings. There were 3 points on his complain and 1 was completely mine, however the other 2 (which I realize just now) were the system, lack of communication and the customer. However, my boss said I made the 3 mistakes. She called to have an online meeting and even though she was nice, I felt like she was making it bigger than it was since the customer was rude (she said he was a difficult person) She said that the good thing was that the customer wants to keep working with me. She ended the meeting in a nice tone.  
I felt overwhelmed and could not explain the situation of the other 2 complaints. Should I do it now?  
I cried after the meeting and I feel awful. Maybe I am making a big deal about it too, but I like my job and I never have this kind of problems.  Any words of wisdom? Advice? Experiences?

1761zmv,Is something wrong with my CV?,"Hello everyone! 

I hope I won’t annoy a lot of people but I need to get this off my chest because it keeps bugging me for over two months now.

I currently work as a consultant on a fixed-term contract with no renewal possibilities, which is about to expire at the end of this month. I kept on searching for new opportunities since this summer in order to have a continuity in my experience but I am unable to land even an interview.  I have more than 3+ years of experience in my domain or similar domains (I work in remote sensing and sustainability data applications) and I tick almost all of the boxes for the job ads (I even have a Master of Science) but for some reason I keep getting rejection emails.

I went and got certified with data science skills and languages (mostly python, SQL, also applied to GIS software ) in order to make up for this gap in my formal education but its still no use.  It is really heartbreaking and believe me when I say I don’t want to flaunt my skills but I worked hard in University, I got Valedictorian in both my Engineering BSc and my MSc, I worked on research projects and international consortium with published articles and it is frustrating that I can’t even land an interview for an entry level job which barely pays my rent. The peak of my career was my Traineeship at the European Space Agency and I tought it would boost my CV but it hasn’t changed much.

I know this might be an issue regarding my CV, I have modified it a million times and I still don’t know if it’s good or not. If anyone would be kind enough to have a look at it and give some advice it will be greatly appreciated so I will also [post it here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qlTTWugHqCzlUUGBjkJd68aBWcDPS-bm/view?usp=drivesdk). I am looking for anything remotely related to what I do data science, GIS, consultancy, environmental impact assessment, research, anything, even open to relocate or to work remotely within the EU.

I am afraid of the future and how could I afford to live these next months. I just don’t want to work in a supermarket just to be able to make a living (no offense ce intended to anyone I am just venting I apologize).

175ynm4,"kinda-artist working in kinda-retail wanting to move into creative tech jobs, and i have no idea where to start","Hello, I live in the south but I'm near some larger businesses and retailers that may have decent paying work for someone like me. I'm extremely lost on what to do next in my career and need some guidance.  
  
I graduated high school in 2011, worked in retail since then and have been promoted several times into senior roles. I was in college part time and took a \[forced\] break to save money, and I was able to go back and get my bachelors degree in visual art in the last few years. So now I'm over 30 with an art degree and 12 years of experience in retail and e-commerce operations and management, with some light visual design projects sprinkled throughout the years. It feels pretty pointless lol.  
  
I worked with a large retailer as an associate cashier/shipping/receiving employee and moved my way up to management and merchandising in clothing specifically. I really enjoyed this part of the job where I got to plan out where displays and clothes went, using corporate guide books but ultimately deciding where color stories and textiles were placed on the sales floor. It tickled my visual design part of my brain.  
  
Then I moved over to an independent retailer that is WAY smaller in business but had a lot of heart. They specialized in music and I had a similar trajectory here, going from basic cashier/associate to merchandising and buying. I also became a manager who helped hire, train, and recruit people. I hated managing under the CEO though because he was constantly angry at people and I had to basically take the brunt of it all. I did enjoy training and being a sort of mediator between senior roles and associates. I designed lots of visuals for their brand and merchandise, and I loved the backend website/inventory management aspect of the business. But this business is doing poorly and there was some heated discussions about workplace ethics and ""coincidentally"" they let me go because my ""role has been terminated"" (they fired an illegal employee \*they were paying under the table\* for talking about/asking about pay, and I outwardly objected to their termination - but I live in a state where you can be fired for nothing and anything).  
  
I'm having a really hard time finding a new job that lines up with my skill set but also gives me a chance to grow and enter the role without needing 20 years of experience. I am thinking I will list my favorite job roles and skills here and idk I guess I just want some spitball ideas that aren't completely out of the realm of possibility.  
  
People management  
  
Store and website merchandising  
  
E-Commerce operations  
  
E-commerce site upkeep and management  
  
Website building (basic HTML and other coding languages but hardly an expert)  
  
Web design (designing elements for a website, color theory, typography, asset creation, etc, basically anything that isn't coding)  
  
Merchandise design, like logos and graphics for a brand's identity  
  
Presentation Design  
  
Employee training and instructional design  
  
Social media and email marketing  
  
The kicker here is that I don't really have a good example to show employers when they ask about anything other than my design work. In my old workplaces, I just kinda did a little bit of everything. I helped with e-commerce, but I do not have any experience with common sites like Shopify or Squarespace. I helped with their website but I was not the main person working on it every day (one of the owners did this and refuses to let anyone learn it or help in any other way). I designed merchandise and some website assets for them but they are one brand and did not have a lot of visual diversity so it looks like my professional experience is very limited on my portfolio. I did train people and create documents and presentations showing them how to use programs and the point-of-sale system, but I did not really make them aesthetically great - I just wanted to get the point across in a clear concise manner, so I wouldn't really be proud of showing anyone those documents.  
  
I think I have a very high aptitude for learning new programs and processes as needed, but I'm having a lot of trouble committing my free time to learning something I may not even be able to get a job for. I looked into programming, UI/UX design, web development, app creation... I do not have any experience in any of the programs or coding languages required to do these things. And even if I were able to learn it, I would feel like I wasted SO much time learning the basics of it all just to not be trusted in even an entry-level role.  
  
I have applied to SO many jobs that specialize in at least one of these roles listed above. I would bet since January of 2023 I applied to over 1000 positions and have maybe received 20 genuine responses, and have had less than 5 interviews. I feel pretty confident about my portfolio and resume, I know I can design those really well and articulate my thoughts and expertise clearly and confidently in those documents attached to those applications, so I just do not understand how I am being passed up by so so so so so many companies. It has been so hard to not feel defeated, dejected, rejected, and useless.",sotiredlol,1,1.0,0,1697086309,2023-10-12 04:51:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175ynm4/kindaartist_working_in_kindaretail_wanting_to/,10,2023
175yi30,Should I Stay or Quit my First Job as a Junior Software Developer after only 4 months?,"I’m 21, BCA graduate this year, from India. I come from a tier 3 college with no placements or coding culture among peers, also a day scholar. I had been self learning coding alone for past 2 years. I recently got a job as a junior software developer and I WFH. I was in need of money so was in a haste to get a job.

I feel miserable because of it. The shift timings are from afternoon to night (9 hours), which doesn’t suit me, the work is quite boring, there is a LOT of pressure to complete the tasks on time (as a fresher I find it quite difficult to do so in such small time), not liking any of the co-workers, they help me some of the time but rest I have to figure out alone, and it takes time out of the already tight deadline. 

Because of the lack of the “coding environment” my passion for it is dying. I have always stayed at home and learned alone, needed an environment where I was surrounded by like minded people where I can learn and grow. 
I only feel at peace for like one hour in a day, after my shift ends. I am always angry and anxious after waking up because I have to start work which I hate. 

It’s been 3 months since I started, I need the experience but I don’t want to work at this company anymore. It’s very hard getting a job given the circumstances, but should I quit my job serving one month notice now. (Will be total 4 months experience) and prepare for better companies?

175x95d,Deciding between two jobs with different pros/cons,"Hello. I know this is a “you have to decide for yourself” situation, but I want to see what other people would do.

I’m currently at a job I hate making $65k. I’m a copywriter and strategist that got stuck doing end-to-end social media management for a boss who thinks I’m a newborn. Kill me.

However, I’m currently freelancing for two other companies, Software Co and Agency Co (obviously not their real names). Both companies have expressed serious undeniable interest in hiring me full time in December-January. At 50,000 feet this is a good situation to be in! But I feel very much at a crossroads.

Software Co is a small SaaS company where I would be heading up their growing Marketing department. I’d basically be building it from the ground up. The COO of the company winced at my current salary but said they would “try to advocate for me to get $70k”. I’m not super confident that I would get 70, I have a feeling I’d be starting lower with the opportunity to get to 70 eventually. 

Agency Co is a very small marketing agency that I have really enjoyed working with. The clients are nice, the agency team works well together and my contact there really trusts me to do good work. And I do! The founder called me last night to let me know there is a very real probability that they will need to hire a full time person soon, and that they wanted me to be the first in line. When I told them I was making $65k, they said “oh my heart just sank. I definitely can’t match that.” But they reassured me that this was a conversation and is really hoping we can find something that works for both of us. They asked if I could provide a salary range basically that is the lowest I would accept to whatever other number.

Pros of Software Co: Opportunity to build something. Get a chance to have control over a company’s full marketing strategy and challenge myself in a way I haven’t before. Higher possibility of getting paid the same or higher than my current job.

Cons of Software Co: Some required in-office days. 2 weeks of PTO. The culture, from what I can tell, seems a bit forced. Not as bad as Office Space forced, but a lot of initiatives to connect with one another when it’s probably fine.

Pros of Agency Co: Fully remote. Unlimited PTO and flexible schedule. The founder created this agency because they were sick of toxic marketing agency culture. The cut throat, “bro-y” vibe where you’re expected to do more work for less and work until you’re burnt out. I’d get to be in a role I really want to be in and am good at. I feel like I could make a mark here.

Cons: Strong possibility of having to take a significant paycut. Possible instability with fluctuating client projects. Would have to purchase my own laptop.

Which one would you choose?

And what would be your personal dealbreaker in terms of salary at Agency Co?",altclass,1,1.0,0,1697081544,2023-10-12 03:32:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175x95d/deciding_between_two_jobs_with_different_proscons/,10,2023
175wo3f,How do you deal with a boss who feels the need to push you as hard as possible?,"I am a professional in the content creation industry as a social media manager.  I work for a rather prominent company that is known as the ""gold standard"" of content creation in our particular industry.

I love my job, and love the people I work with, and it is a dream role for me. I get along with my boss pretty well, but there is one major problem.

Since I started every few months the expectations have been raised. A day in the office that we used to get off, increased output of content, scheduling further out on the calendar, ect. These changes came frequently and slowly built up over the course of the year. 

A few weeks ago I was asked to essentially double my daily output. Making twice as many pieces of content as I was and pushing out more on a daily basis than ever before. This was pitched to me as an experiment for a few weeks to see if drastically increasing our volume would have a big impact on our numbers. 

Anyone who's worked in the creative industry will tell you that quotas and daily minimums are the killers of innovation and creativity. It's all about hitting a number, so you turn out lower-quality things to hit a number.

Keep in mind, prior to this change we already had the highest volume of content of anyone in our industry, we already put out more than our competitors, and our numbers were extremely impressive. In my time there I have grown their accounts by an impressive amount of followers, and if you had told me at the beginning of working here that we would have these results, I would be overjoyed. I was busy and occasionally overworked, but it felt like a fair minimum and I was happy with what I was expected to do.

For three weeks, I came in early, stayed late, and dealt with insane levels of stress. Creative meetings and otherwise fun parts of the workday became unbearable, realizing every moment spent not working on posts for the day was later I would have to stay at the office. I worked weekends to get ahead, and felt like I was climbing a mountain to try and get everything done.

So we did this ""testing"" for three weeks, and the number of engagements was basically flat from our old output. 

When we met to discuss the results, I was told that the old number was ""unacceptable"" and that ""we need to keep pushing as hard as we can."" When I raised objections to the fact I was working too hard and that it was unsustainable with almost no results, my boss basically just said ""It doesn't matter the goal is for us to push and keep pushing."" 

I am at a crossroads. I love this job, it is a dream role, but it has eaten me alive. If I can barely keep up now I can only imagine what will happen the next time the bar is raised. It's clear that my side of this will never be seen, and I am not sure how much longer I can mentally and physically keep up with this style of management.

They asked me if I wanted to interview for the same position but at a different location. 
I know that I am qualified for the position based on skills. Which is why they offered to let me try again at a different location.
However, it seems like the interview with the clinic managers are more for cultural fit and personality check.
I must not have fit the manager's personality that I saw today. Now I'm super worried about this next interview with a different manager.
I'm a very positive, kind and hardworking person. I try my very best to show that during the interview.

175uzth,I want to advocate for a better raise this year but the company is stingy,"For starters I have no intention of staying with this company longer term but it's been 4 years and I have failed to get better work. I'm working on that. In the mean time I want to secure a better raise for myself.

For starters I work in a warehouse. When I started working there I took a pay cut. They would not match my pay at $16.75, offered me $15. When I asked for more than that they gave me 0.25 cents with a lot of hemming and hawing. I now make $18.65 and want to push for at least $21 but preferably more.

Why push that much? Not to sound arrogant but I'm the best worker they have. I see people constantly making mistakes, not doing their work and disappearing for long periods of time many time per day, 30 to 60 minutes. Management does not care. As long as the work gets done, there can be 6 people on the shift with only 2 doing the work but that's fine, as long as it's done. 

I'm one of those people getting it done. I catch others mistakes, I've learned how to process bigger, more complex orders that others can't be trusted to do correctly. I come in early ( just for the OT pay) and actually get things done with that time. Just today I overheard my supervisor saying that I'm too valuable to lose. They have a terrible time recruiting and keeping people. Turnover rate is high and for good reason. The job sucks. They've lost two people over the past 8 months and might be losing a third soon with no replacements in sight.

Now I can't say all this to my boss as I've typed this out. I have to be a little more nuanced than that but I am tired of working myself this much and getting chump change. I've seen job postings elsewhere paying minimum $21 per hour with no experience. For some reason I can't get interviews but that's not the point right now.

I don't have a credible threat. I can't say ""I have other offers, give me a bigger raise or I'm gone."" I of course wouldn't say it like that but if I don't get a better raise I can't just leave. I hate it but I have to have this job.

I know for a fact they're good for that money. They had $1 million last year extra after everyone was paid, bills paid, everything. $1 million just sitting there. They can spare me $5.

I don't know how to better advocate for myself for a raise. I know I'm good and so do they. Anytime people ask for more money it's met with the hemming and hawing and ""industry standards"" and ""our rate is competitive."" The same BS. Is there any way I can talk about this and actually get somewhere? Or should I focus entirely on getting the heck out of there ASAP?",podsaurus,1,1.0,1,1697074811,2023-10-12 01:40:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175uzth/i_want_to_advocate_for_a_better_raise_this_year/,10,2023

175u1pw,Struggling Mentally / Wrong Career?,"I apologize in advance that I’m currently not in the greatest state of mind, but hoping to get some insight.

I’m in my late 40s and in a 20+ year professional career.  I had been given great opportunities in project management after my then-boss left the firm I was at some 15 years ago.  It meant that I was thrown from “doing the work” to “leading the work”.  And for the last several years I’ve found they trusted me too much by assigning me some if the biggest projects in the country.

I burned out bad, ended up resigning, and took several months off.  However, being without an income caused me so much stress that it didn’t allow me to recover (and have 6-figure savings).  I went to a competitor with a promotion.  Been there a couple of months and, while the team is great and supportive, I feel all my mental health issues coming back.  Overwhelm, anxiety, depression.  I feel in over my head, though others don’t seem to believe so.  Bottom line, I feel this career is no longer serving me and I need out.  However, while I was off all those months, I applied places and it seems tough out there.  I have the graduate degree, all the professional credentials and more, performance reviews always exceeding expectations.  I literally feel at the brink of another nervous breakdown and that if I were to resign, I’d feel terribly embarrassed, would probably be blacklisted in this industry (it’s a small community really).

I want to work, but feel I can’t do the corporate life anymore.  I get incredibly drained from running meetings, managing things, being in control.  I’m willing to take a significant pay cut to achieve balance, have some flexibility, just have someone assign tasks to me, and not work in a constant high-pressure deadline-driven environment.

I took this newest role because I was headhunted by them after not having success finding something else.  I did it mainly for the income.  I’m single, no kids, and my dream is to ine day be able to move into a house outside of the city (where it’s more expensive).  I feel almost jailed, both at work and living in an apartment.  And yet I am even too drained to come up with ideas of what to do.   The last three years have been so bad.  Literally the only time I feel at peace is when I drive to the mountains.  

With diagnosed anxiety and depression (on medication and seeing a therapist for two years), I feel I probably have ADHD too.  I just feel like I can’t cope anymore.  I know all the good stuff to do like going for walks, eating well, getting sleep, but it’s not helping.  I have horrible insomnia, can’t concentrate for the life of me, easily distracted, and on and on (thyroid and all are fine on blood work, so it’s not that, been speaking with my doctor at length).

I currently work in a Big 4 Accounting firm as in Australia. I am in finance consulting. Previously, I have worked overseas and within smaller in-house accounting teams.   


I feel as though the number crunching is not my thing, I want to make more of an impact, operationally and strategically. Posting journals, reconciliations, analysis of pure accounting figures is very dull to me and I find myself not applying my full efforts due to a lack of interest.   


My people skills are quite good and have got me where I am today, but they are not top tier.   
I believe that there are two pathways to making more money:   
1. Having good soft skills + generalist (e.g. great leadership)  
2. Having good soft skills + expert in the process/field  


I believe I am better suited to #2. But this doesn't paint the full picture.   


My question: How do I figure out what my next step should be, and how I want my career to (generally) go?

175r40j,Stuck on a crossroads,"I am only 30 years old, living in Canada and have always struggled to save money or spend wisely. Now I started a program in Occupational Health and Safety, only about 1 month in. I actually enjoy the heck out of it, learning how I can potentially save others lives. My strengths are here, I always knew that I could have gotten into finance or tech, as well as the automobile industry, as those are all things that I really enjoy. I decided that I would become a OH&S professional here (preferably within the automobile industry), as I can get around 200k a year in that field with the relevant experience.  
  
Basically, my post here is for the present. I have a plan set out for the future, but right now I am stuck in a job that I only take out the trash, or just sit around and wait to be told what to do. To me it is so depressing, I like to be active and this job doesn't do me any good, though it is the best pay I can get during these inflationary times. I really wish I could have a job in OH&S currently, entry level to get some experience, but it is really difficult finding a new job. What advice can you kind people of this sub provide to me?

175q4np,What would you do?,"i (23f) began working as a receptionist in a major city at a midsize firm last spring. at my location we have about 70 employees. last november, my boss hired a catering coordinator, who i’ll call Sarah for this, (57f) with ~15 years of previous catering experience at a small firm. 

My boss hired Sarah knowing that she doesn’t know much about technology especially computers. My boss asked me to help her and essentially train her on her basic job functions that I had been performing before she was hired as well as teach her how to work a computer & all of the programs we use. Sarah brought a chair to my reception desk (she has her own cubicle) and it has been there for almost a year now 🫠 (My boss recently asked her to move it and sit at her own desk for a variety of reasons including the fact that she never reads her email or answers it. Sarah explained to my boss and later told me she told my boss it’s because she’s old school and doesn’t like to) 

Over the past year, I have tried to help Sarah learn her job in order to do it on her own. Most days she has sat right next to me at my own desk. She constantly asks for help ordering food for firm, submitting expense reports, constructing emails, setting up food, breaking down conference rooms, creating pdfs, etc. She doesn’t order any supplies and asks me to. She does not answer her pm’s on the program we use, phone, or email. She constantly asks me to perform these tasks like writing emails citing“you’re so much better at it.” I have made her do a lot on her own but for all intents and purposes, I am doing a lot of her job simply so it will get done. My boss is aware that I help a lot but not the extent of what I do.

As a note, shortly after Sarah began working here, I was made aware that she makes more than me. I haven’t mentioned this to anyone else. 

Earlier this month I received my annual review and was thanked for my work and my boss had nothing but gratitude and praise. I received my raise in the month I began but just received my review. It was noted the raise was capped at 4% for nonexempt employees firmwide and that’s what i received. Sarah is due for her review in November and received her self evaluation to complete. Sarah asked if I could do it for her to which I declined. She filled it out at my desk and only submitted a couple responses. 

I want to go back to my employer and ask for a higher raise, especially considering that I am completing my duties as well as many of hers but I don’t know how to go about this. I know it’s incredibly frowned upon to ask for a raise based on a fellow employee’s salary but this situation is incredibly unfair. I’ve tried to mediate with Sarah asking her to help with *her own job* more and she gets incredibly defensive.

175pot0,"How to quit, advice needed","After 5,5 years I feel like it's best I leave my employer. It would suck because I really like the job, IT, I work with computers and tell users what to do. I've worked for 20+ years at several companies but I've never had such a toxic workplace. It's was great the first 3 years but there are too few employees for the workload, lots of complaints from customers and the past 2 years it's all stuck, employees just keep repeating things without much progress. It's a small company, no HR, employees have to speak up for themselves, there's too much that's just wrong, I don't believe it'll turn around. My employer is convinced the processes are the cause for complaints and he keeps trying to change those (spending money on advice/consultants/experts), I say it's too few (skilled) employees. I've tried talking about it and it only appears I'm making it worse for myself and some team members even though I mean well. I just did not study for that, I have no psychology or HR degree.


But I like the owner/boss anyway, I believe he means well but is simply unable to turn things around. I'm also grateful he made my workplace, not specially for me, I'm just that way.


Now I have to choose: apply and leave and tell him out of the blue, give him my 1 months notice. I'm replacable but it's difficult to find new employees, he'll either has to find one and likely pay more or get two people but costing less (each). If people apply, he's basically lucky if he finds someone suitable. Then they have to learn how the job is done, takes a year, maybe 2. I feel I'd be giving him the shaft and he does not deserve that. But it's in my advantage, much safer and also easy to explain at job interviews. There have been new hires but not all make it and were let go (in a respectful manner except one but he did something and was fired on the spot by court order probably a liar and he got caught).


The other way is I talk with my employer, speak my mind and basically say I'm not a fit for the job anymore due to all the problems in the team and it's best for both of us if I leave. Making room for someone else who would be a better fit but also because I might fit better somewhere else. Maybe with a kind of contract how I'll keep my job but apply until I find something (I'm picky) while he can search for a replacement (whom I would not have to train). At least giving him a chance to find a replacement. It's 50/50 this might turn out good. He might take it to court and make it look like I'm not functioning sufficiently but I've already consulted with a lawyer (insurance) and I have things like my daily worklogs, emails, teams chats, it's likely I'll win (disrupted work relations) and get some money out of it (my country has many laws in favor of the employee).

175pm8g,Do you agree with me or my coworker more when it comes to how new people at a company should be trained?,"My belief:

If there's a company specific process someone has to follow with a bunch of steps, I feel like someone with experience should spend at least a little time on a screenshare showing them what to do. Unless, the task truly can be followed by following steps in a document. Then, the person could just be handed a training document. For example, if someone has to setup a password for a login account for a website I think someone could just be givea training document for that. However, if someone is working on a 50 page report that involves going to 10+ websites, talking to 10+ people, making 10+ high impact decisions, I think someone should get on a screenshare with the new person and explain to them what's going on.

For any task someone new can just be given a training document.

So far:

\- I don't feel like I belong there. 

\- I am not using the technologies I initially wanted when I applied for the job.

\- I was lied that I will have a performance review on the sixth month.

\- I don't like the project I am currently working on.

\- I probably can earn 1.5/2x more (which wouldn't be a factor if at least I had a sense of belonging there since the money I am currently earning is really good for where I live).

\- Its onsite.

&#x200B;

Now... I am not sure whether I have to go and look for another job or not. On the one side we have the stuff I mentioned above. On the other side: its not stressful, the money I am earning is more than enough for where I live. Its just that I am afraid that if I go to another place it might the same. Again the sense of not belonging (which is a big one for me, that's why I put it on the first place). I would be fine with the other stuff tho. But yeah. Just don't think I belong there, which... I am not sure whether it's a personal stuff I need to deal with or its related to the workplace.

I am also kinda afraid that it would be considered job hopping since it has only been 6 months. A friend of mine told me that its too early to do that. That I earn enough, its not stressful and I just need to get used to it.

175f788,Should I leave teaching for HR? Teaching is stressful but is HR worse?,"Hello Everyone, 

I’m struggling as a teacher. I find I am so drained from the kids not listening to me, that I don’t have the energy to go home to plan, prep and mark. I’m stressed out all the time and I can’t find any work-life balance. My mental health is suffering, I’m bitter all the time and I’m so miserable not knowing what to do with my life that I dream about dying, but I don’t have the guts to harm myself so don’t worry about me killing myself. I’m thinking of getting into HR instead, hoping I can find a job that will give me a better work-life balance. A job I can do well (because I always give my all in a job), but not have to bring home with me so I can separate my job and work. I’m afraid I’m going to find HR just as stressful as teaching. I want to find something I’m good at that doesn’t take away all my personal time at home. I’m thinking it could be HR but I don’t know if I’m wasting time and don’t want to go back to school for HR and risk losing my permanent teaching status in Ontario that was hard to get, just to be incredibly stressed out in HR too.

Do I just take it to be safe and decline later if something better comes up?  Its with a large company and a direct competitor of my prior role.  The pay is fine (same as my last role almost exactly) and the hours are 9-5, and benefits are good.  The issue is that the role isn't interesting and is no way going to further my career.  I also don't want to put pressure on the two other jobs as I want to slow walk them to see if I get an offer from the dream job.  (I think its a long shot dream job hires me.  I'm shocked I'm being interviewed.)

I'm worried if I do not take it, and the other jobs do not pan out, I will be kicking myself in a week or two.   I would stick with this job for a time if the other roles try to low ball me, etc.  The two other roles would likely be A LOT more work (nights and weekends) and I would want more money to go to them.

175emt4,Can i switch from saleforce(service based) to a SDE role (product-based),"I graduated from B.E-CS in 2022 and joined a service based company in a month and got trained on salesforce so after 2months of training, i was in bench for like almost a year actually but recently got into a project its been a month and its a new project started just 2months ago or something and its a support role as of now there not much work right now , but i m not liking it here , i know i should be grateful that i have a job and yeah i m glad about it. But at the end of the day i feel miserable. 

So can i switch now to a product-based company for an SDE role. Since my 1year experience in salesforce( there is no experience lol since i was in bench only for that 1year i did some udemy course on lwc that's all and some small project related to it)

If i can how do i prepare and what do i put in my resume for that 1year experience and it won't even matter since they both will be different domain.

Context- I m from CS background only i have basic some knowledge about Java and python language and i m not good at dsa at all i haven't even solved one question in leetcode or anywhere ( it sucks i know).

I know i should have started when i was in my bench Period only but then i was trying to improve my Salesforce knowledge but now I don't feel like i have future in that.

Based on research and advice people have told me i should be having knowledge on DSA,OOPs,CN,OS,DBMS, Design etc.
Some of these subjects i have read in my engineering that's all I don't even remember them properly now.

But I m planning to prepare for these in next 3months also doing some projects(i m not sure how much i ll learn).

And when i read people telling their story about not getting a job even after solving like 100+ problem on dsa and who has done projects and still struggling with job search and with the current job market makes me just quit that idea there itself but still i feel like I can't continue like this.

FYI I joined in September 22 so its like 1.1year .

So is it possible or should i just continue in Salesforce.

So yeah please give me a advice or suggestions as how can i switch.

Thanks in advance 🫡.",confusedsoul_a,1,0.6700000166893005,1,1697032626,2023-10-11 13:57:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175emt4/can_i_switch_from_saleforceservice_based_to_a_sde/,10,2023
175el0b,How do i prepare in 24hrs for a high level management position?,"How do I prep in 24hrs for a high level management position?

I got a call yesterday from a top manager at my company urging me to apply for the Branch Operations Management position. They are interviewing internally at the end of this week. So I basically have 24 hours to prepare. 

Context:
-I was a customer facing lead at my last company (same industry) and was on track to transition into a higher level working internally (production/operations type role) 
-I decided to move across the country and did not yet have a job secured. After looking for a long time, I got this entry level job. I basically took a step down but stayed in the same industry 
-TODAY is my 90 days in the company. I’m brand new 
-the job I am interviewing for is 3 steps up and likely a double in salary 

My questions:
-what do I need to do to prepare for this interview? (I’m currently going over role expectations and taking notes)
-what questions should I ask them?
-what should I be prepared to answer? 
-how do I keep from letting my imposter syndrome get in the way of doing well in this interview? 
-how do I make myself stand out? (I am at a branch furthest from the admin office, so that fact that any high level mangers remembered me or even thought to bring me up in their meeting wondering why I didn’t apply is surprising)

175dlnp,"My job is leaving me to do everything 3 months in, I'm confused. How do I address this?","I work on a small farm, there are only 2 other workers (managers) and 40-ish animals to take care of ranging from cats, goats, pigs, horses and small animals.

 I'm being told now after 3 months of working there that my woman manager who has been helping out this entire time was actually just doing me a favor and I should never expect her to help out with the farm chores. Apparently she has 3 other jobs, but tbh all I see her doing all day is making new flyers on canva. She's supposed to be the adoption coordinator and volunteer coordinator but we barely get any requests for either of those. 

My other manager is a huge slacker, (and creep) and either does the bare minimum required until I have to clean it up the next day, or literally sits around doing nothing with no shame. He occasionally chats my ear off for hours on end too, distracting me a ton, so I don't understand how the boss is okay with that. 

My old coworker ended up leaving because she said the workload was unfair. Everyone called her a slacker, and she was slacking off but now I understand why because they go from helping out a ton to barely lifting a finger and it's confusing and feels like you were deceived. 




On top of that, my boss is saying they can't hire a new staff member to replace my coworker who left due to low funds, so the boss is helping out a few days a week but is very inconsistent with it. Some days they get a ton of chores done and other days all they do is the bare minimum because they have other things going on (like scheduled therapy sessions). 

Basically I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and I'm wondering how I could have misunderstood the work load for the past 3 months this badly. It makes no sense at all because they were training me for 3 months. 

It's not like my managers told me ""hey you're going to be doing all of this on your own in 2 weeks"" they just stopped helping out and left me to do it all with no communication besides ""x is doing you a favor when she cleans a stall"" even though she's been cleaning stalls and then some for months. 

Do I even attempt to address this, or do I just leave? Considering how they treated my coworker, I don't really feel safe bringing it up to them.",throwaway-Critical,4,0.8399999737739563,2,1697029631,2023-10-11 13:07:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175dlnp/my_job_is_leaving_me_to_do_everything_3_months_in/,10,2023
175demd,Salary/Job Advice Needed,"I’ve been working at my current job for almost 6 years. During that time, I completed my bachelors degree and have had 4 promotions. Trying to keep this as short as possible and trying to stay anonymous, promotion #3 was posted at $X (as internal only) which was a good bit higher than the usual starting salary for that type of position. The job was essentially posted for me and $X made sense due to what I was already making. When the job was officially offered to me, I was told HR was only approving a salary less than $X. Long story short, they finally did approve $X but I had to fight for it. Fast forward 6 months, I got promotion #4 and was now making $Y and I was happy. Fast forward another 6 months, and the same job as promotion #3 was posted externally…with a salary range of $X-$Y. Someone brand new to the company was hired somewhere between what it took me 5 years to start making after 3 promotions and what I was currently making after 6 years and 4 promotions. I love my job but that essentially made me feel like they don’t value me or my knowledge if you are bringing in someone brand new at the same amount I’m just now currently making.

So to get into the army there's a exam conducted twice every year and you can fill the form till 24years of age.

Should I leave this idea and continue to work in design field? or try prep for army? I love both the fields and know that I'll progress in both but design field is kind of uncertain with job stability and army is high reward high risk and also difficult to get into at the same time.

175c34h,Am I still a strong candidate for MBB consulting or similar?,"25 & lost with careers (long post 🤦🏾‍♀️)

I graduated from Oxford in 2020 with a 2:1.

My degree is quite broad touching on both biological and social sciences. I enjoyed it a lot.

I did 2 internships during my summers with Lloyds Banking Group Foundation and Lloyds Banking Group Commercial bank respectively. Coming from a disadvantaged background, I secured this the year before university via a programme (I didn’t go through the multiple applications and assessments that many do during university to secure this - I now regret this).

6 months after graduation I took the first job going. For the past 2 years and 8 months I managed programmes which improved access to top universities and top law firms for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. I was promoted to associate, made some positive contributions but left 2 months ago due to difficulty navigating my progression. Graduating and starting my new job in the pandemic which was fully remote + some family drama I think also just messed up my mental a bit. 

I now realise that I wasn’t as well equipped for the working world as I thought. I wish my CV had more going for it at this stage. I would love to transition to a top consulting firm. I did actually make it through the first stage of case interviews at BCG (I basically did this for fun & only now realise how massive an achievement this was). I wish I never took my first job or at least continued to apply whilst I worked. Even if I didn’t have this career long term, my CV would be better to leap from to the next step compared to now.

Given my background, degree and lack of corporate experience, I have also been advised to focus more on the public sector, e.g university admissions, NHS or Civil Service. My corporate friend said I should apply for an analyst role at a bank? 🤷🏽‍♀️ I feel like I’d be quite entry level for both these options & not sure if if I’d be supported in progressing.

I’m 25 so I feel young enough to still aim high (I.e a top consulting firm) but it does all just feel overwhelming. With no careers service etc, I just feel a bit out on a limb trying to do this all by myself. I don’t want to rush into something again, but I also understand the gap in my CV isn’t the best. I’m happy to do internships if they exist for non-uni students. 

I’m volunteering at my local drop-in centre setting up a new programme from scratch to make up for it. I’m also managing an air BnB for a relative. Random, but I’m also a solo hairdresser. I’m in a good situation financially, so I want to take the time to rebalance. But I am concerned about my CV & losing the opportunity for a top salary career whilst I’m still young. I’m around the 30k mark currently.

I know my question isn’t really clear 😭 just not sure what I am/aren’t qualified for.

Some clear questions I have would be:
1. How do you contact/hear from these recruitment teams at top firms to gage your eligibility?
2. Would it be worth doing a masters just so I can be eligible for more internships/graduate schemes?

Happy to answer any questions. 🫶🏾",Several_Echo_5066,2,0.7599999904632568,4,1697024865,2023-10-11 11:47:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/175c34h/am_i_still_a_strong_candidate_for_mbb_consulting/,10,2023

I noticed that I have a section there for professional training that includes things that I forgot about ,  courses that I did in one of my previous jobs (about 7 years ago), such as writing for the web and others. 

Whilst I retained some of the knowledge from those courses, and used some of those skills (eg project management in my work) I did not really get to use these skills since then, and it feels a bit strange including them in my CV, since for example, I would not know how to do SEO now. On the other hand, some of the courses are relevant to the jobs I would be applying for now, and I do want to show that I did extra things apart from working.

175b5ic,I just landed my first 'real' job and I hate it. I need some advice,"I (23m) am in my final year of a degree in business/finance. I previously did 2 years of a psychology degree which I thoroughly enjoyed but I changed to business/finance as I also enjoyed my previous job and wanted to pivot in that direction. 

I previously worked for a small medical aesthetics clinic doing most of the management, marketing, reception duty etc just essentially running the place, so I was always busy either talking to customers on reception, doing social media or other business/admin, and I really liked my job. 

I recently  landed an entry level finance role within the local govt, I took a minor pay cut (£1000/yr) because I thought it was going to advance my career and give me some relevant experience. I thought it was going to be actual finance stuff, but I have a bunch of issues with the job: 

  
\- I started last month and since then all of my bosses and mentor have taken 2+ week long holidays, so have really just been left to get on with it. Both my boss and mentor went on holiday 2 weeks ago and won't be back for another week so I don't have anyone to talk to this about until they're back. 

\- They have given me hardly any work and there's only so many times I can ask for more

\- The work they have given me is taking me an hour at most to complete but they seem to think it'll last way longer, so I sit there for most of the day doing uni work or other stuff (wfh). 

\- I'm doing really is contacting other depts and asking for budget figures and putting them into our system. 

My issues are that I am so incredibly bored of this job already because I'm used to being busy all the time and I don't know if this is the right thing for me. Is it just local govt that's like this or are all corporate jobs like this? 

My other problem is that I don't feel fulfilled in my new role. I don't think any of the work I do is relevant to anything really when all I'm doing is inserting budget figures into a different system. In my previous role I loved to speak to the customers and hear about things like how their confidence is improving after their treatments etc, and that made me really feel like we were doing something good.

I'm beginning to think that I am going down the wrong path, and don't know if I want to go into working a 9-5 corporate job for the rest of my life. I miss feeling fulfilled and mentally stimulated throughout the day. I'm telling myself to stick this out but I can already see how it is impacting my mental health, I feel so drained working at my new job. 

I applied for the Navy, but don't think I will meet eligibility due to previous medical issues, if I do, I'll join the Navy, but if I don't I don't know what I will do.

I chose this study mainly because I grew up at an agricultural company. When deciding, I was 18 years old and didn't really have an idea of what I wanted and never thought about it that deeply, so I just chose that study.   


During this 4-year study I gained experience in areas such as: **Market research**, **data analysis**, **strategic marketing**, **customer relationship**, and **creating surveys**. In the end it wasn’t that bad, but if I was able to go back in time, I would definitely choose a different path.   


Now I feel like I have **no idea which direction I want to go**. I've literally been struggling with this for almost about three years now. In the meantime I have had several jobs, but none of them felt like the right fit for me.   


This year I did a solo backpacking trip through South-America for six months, it was absolutely the best time of my life. After returning home, I’ve been working a lot on creating content such as: guides, lessons, experiences, tips regarding my passions which are hiking and bikepacking. I feel as if I enter a flow-state when doing this. Also, I have an Instagram account regarding these passions since 2020 and I’m currently working on creating a website. Something is brewing here, but at the moment it is all still too small to earn money with.  


Some things I find really interesting are: **Copy writing, SEO, data analytics**. But to me, it feels pointless to apply for jobs regarding these topics since I’ve only got a little experience in them.

1759kvy,"Most people on my team left, and my manager wants to have a one-to-one. What to say or not say?","**Context**:

We are a small tech business, with around 50 people at the start of the year. In the last two months, 5 key members (10%) quitted and the total turnover for the last year was 15 employees (30%). I have also been looking at new jobs, and I know 4 more people are too.

My manager, who's been directing my product for 3 years, recently asked me for a one-to-one meeting. She knows I'm stressed and upset about the situation, as I'm struggling to manage my workload and had to refuse some tasks given. She also asked me my opinion on ""what I thought about us continuing to take the project forward"", as a team and on a personal level.

For context, the product we're in is a core product, which is just about to release to market. I am the lead software engineer, and one of the three remaining engineers, which sucks. I am also close to my manager,  I know how much the product means to her (it's basically her second baby) and I'm worried if I lie it'd affect the product and our relationship. 

**Question**:

- How much or how little do I say?

TW: suicide attempt

To make a very long story short, I tried to end it. I went home to treat my mental health, taking a gap year. I’m saying this because I feel like I need to justify the conditions of my request, and explain why I’m requesting it, or I’ll be seen as lazy and spoiled.

I’m looking for low-stress things to do, hopefully things that are good for my career, to do. To make matters worse, anything paid won’t work (immigration restrictions). I’m doing something called Google Career certificates on Coursera. Probably wasting time and money, but I need something productive and concrete to do and it feels nice making progress on it.

1756b08,Cybersecurity opportunity,"Cybersecurity Opportunity

Hey everyone, reaching out because unsure what to do with my career.

Currently, working as a Helpdesk member in a really and I mean really good company (no on call, free insurance, amazing work life balance, okay pay) that I want to stay in and advance. However the issue is on the advance part, there is little to no opportunity currently (1-2) years as it is a large firm. 

I am offered a security position that seems to be one of those jack of all trades in a mid sized firm. The offer I received has a 10% pay pump or 20% if you count the bonus. The benefits are okay, not the greatest but not the worst. It would be more work from home which is a plus but a new environment as well which is scary.

Now I don’t know what to do, on one hand I love the opportunity to do security and venture into something I want to but the current company is really top notch in regards to culture and a good work balance.

1754k0k,No raise (only small equity refresh) despite being top performer,"I will preface this by saying I am extremely grateful that I am currently employed. There are so many talented people who are still looking for jobs. I’m also big on advocating for oneself at work, and so I’m hoping someone out there might have some advice.

I’ve been with my current big tech company for over 2 years now, and I have consistently been a top performer. I even won an organization-wide award and the written feedback from my cross-functional peers is extremely positive. Despite all this, my company did not give me any percentage raise against my base salary, instead opting to only give me a small equity refresh that vests over four years. They cited that my current salary is already above the band for my leveling (this is due to me negotiating well before joining), but they still wanted to give me something for my work. 

This seems like a cop out to me, because future stock price is not guaranteed; what is worth $100 now may be worth $25 tomorrow, especially given the volatility of the stock market. I’m addition, the stock vests over four years, so it’s not cash in my pocket right away. And when you divide the total refresh amount by 4, the annual amount is pretty small percentage (4%) of my salary.

I have been going above and beyond at work, doing the work of 2.5 people and it just feels really demotivating to get this news. Is this worth leaving over because I don’t feel valued? Salary aside, I do like the job itself and the people I work with and the flexibility of my role.

I’m currently in my 4th year in organizational development undergrad program in Canada. I’m currently on a hunt of an internship or any job that would help me gain the right skills post grad.

I saw this ad on indeed and I’m confused by this “honorarium” term. Does that mean interns get paid after the contract? What exactly does this mean?

Here is the ad: 

“We're looking for a consulting intern (human resources / organizational development) that'll be supporting our team's consulting function. This apportunity is for 3 consecutive 80 hour internship placements totaling 240 hours over a 6 month period. An honorarium will be provided upon successful completion of each 80-hour placement (roughly equaling $15.75-$17/hour). We hope to get the right candidate started by the end of October / early November.” 

Any advice on internships/jobs would be greatly appreciated 🤗

1752645,Feeling lost with getting into dream career.,"I’m in the UK and want to get into canine/small animal hydrotherapy. I currently hold a level 3 diploma in Animal Management and have some  experience as a veterinary care assistant.

The only ways I have found to get into the career is via a course I’d have to pay for out of pocket, which is pretty expensive - and even then I’d have to sit and wait for a vacancy as I don’t want to be completely self employed straight away, or alternatively qualifying as a vet nurse and then going on to do hydrotherapy. However, I haven’t had a positive experience at all within the veterinary field so I’m not sure if I’d want to work in a practice again.

Does anyone have any advice for me getting into this career? Or knows someone in the field that could share some knowledge/advice?

If it helps at all, I’m not in the animal sector at the moment, I have returned to a job in hospitality whilst I figure things out.

I researched in depth my options on the continental US and the boil down to NGO, academic, or government. My school wasn't really equipped to handle people taking this degree. and honestly they shouldn't have offered it unless the career counselors and academic counselors are trained on where to direct their students so they don't end up like me.

 I could have made up for the fact that I was slogging through full time work and full time school at the expense of my gpa and student loans if I had gone for an internship near or before I graduated. I didnt, I didnt know. Fast forward 5 years of slogging through research and realizing how I screwed myself. I have a resume, I can code a little bit and am super proficient with Microsoft office. I learn fast and in any field as long as I am physical capable doing the work. I have worked in a ton of different spots, retail, education, as a peon in a community college, as a technician in a tire shop, and most recently and most happily in a lab. I loved learning the ins and outs of chemistry and the lab work in general. I was fired due to lack of work from that lab and now I am back to manufacturing.

I am going to keep on stalking those job boards and keep searching. but know getting any kind of education or skill training just became too expensive.

But at this point I am completely lost because I am very limited by my health. 


- I have social phobia and ADHD, so anything communication related, sales related or receptionist/admin/organisation positions positions are impossible. I won't get through the interview because it's obvious how anxious I am. Trust me, I tried many times. 

- I cannot work shifts for health reasons 
- I have fallen arches to the point where I can't work physically demanding jobs - I can do three or four hours of brisk walk max, hour of standing, so warehouses and similar things are impossible. My doc says if I work physically demanding job I'll be in a wheelchair by the time I am 30. 

- I don't have a driver's licence 

 I'll be honest, at the moment I am very mentally fragile and I crack under pressure. I do not care about how much I make, I just want ANY job because while I am in intensive therapy right now I can just feel my brain melting and my anxiety worsening from zero stimuli or interaction .need to get over this phase to get back into the swing of things, but till then I need to slowly easy my way back into a working society.

2. Emails me at all hours of the day including 1am.
3. In team meetings says things like ‘I am a good employee unlike everyone else’
4. When I tell him something to do like a new task or process (which is just normal business practice) he will say ‘ohh no we never did it like that’ or whines.

But I’m coming to realize that trade work may not be the best route for me, and that I’d like to go to college. Only one problem. My high school GPA is a 1.812. I’ll spare the long story, and let you know my GPA was never a result of stupidity, but just that I was a punk kid who never cared about school. 

I’m 25 now and looking at getting into college. I figured given my age and my extensive military transcript detailing all of the courses I attended while still active, I would be able to at least get into a half decent college to start with and transfer to a higher level school once I have a college transcript.

174vjph,My boss is lending me to another area for one month and I’m afraid she’s trying to push me out?,"Hi all. I work in one of the big 4 and have done for going on 3 years. I spent 2 years of my time doing client facing work (document review, call handling etc) I decided I wanted a more people focused role so I applied for a job in the resourcing and development business area and got it. I’ve been there for 5 months now and have mostly enjoyed it even though I don’t think it’s going to be what I do long term. The reason for the question is I have focused on resourcing for one sector of the business, which was actually the sector i was a part of before I joined resourcing (I’m now deploying people I used to work with onto projects in that same area) so I have a pretty good understanding. My senior manager pulled me onto a call today and said that she had agreed that I could do a 50/50 split between the sector I am resourcing for now and now another sector on top of that. She said it’s only gonna to be for one month until they find someone to look after that other sector permanently. She said I am doing a great job and have a great reputation and that I should take this a compliment and an opportunity to expose myself to another area. But I can’t shake the feeling that they’re trying to push me out? I made it clear that I like the sector that I look after atm and don’t wnat to move to the other sector permanently after the one month and that I woukd need to come back after the one month. Am I overthinking this? Is this actually a good thing? Or am I at the start of being pushed out? My manager told me a few weeks ago that I’m doing a great job and she didn’t have any complaints so I’m confused why I’m not just conning to do what I do now?

174v2fw,"Lying to one job about pursuing my actual career, wondering if I should drop this job and hold off.","So, per the title I have been pursuing my “dream” career working with animals. As someone with no experience, it’s been hard to navigate and try to find opportunities.

I did find an opportunity to potentially be able to work for a company (paid) while they give me an education for free. Right now, I am simply doing an internship pretty much. Unpaid. This is a great, tight knit company and I know unpaid internships are looked down on sometimes which I get but this is something I wanna do. 

However, I need money. I had to quit my toxic job a few months ago and after that was when I had the time to find this opportunity. But I already asked the hr person and she said it’s their slow season so getting a paid position right now while I wait to be accepted for the next round of the education program could be a couple MONTHS. Which isn’t long per se but when you need money it definitely is.

I have been working in retail the last few years. At the front end. So, I decided to find a part time gig. Unfortunately, I stupidly said during my interview (because they asked why I’m unemployed) that I was “figuring it out” and was interested in working with animals and had volunteered before but now I wanna pursue this. 

I don’t know why I said that. But anyway, it’s only part time two days a week. So far for my training though I’ve had to lie once about my availability. I had to say I had a doctor appointment for one day because that a day I’m in the clinic. 

My city isn’t small but it’s not huge. I don’t know what to do. I only told that to the person who interviewed me so maybe I can get away with saying that I realized I still wanna try to pursue it but I do wanna work here.

174upgo,"Director-Level Manager Insults, Bullies, and Micromanages","I have 30+ years of experience and joined my current company in May 2022, transitioning into a new industry with the help of a referral from a former colleague. Adapting to the new company has been challenging due to significant differences in processes and culture compared to my previous experiences.   
However, my senior director manager is the worst manager I've ever worked for, and the workplace is highly toxic. He insults, degrades, and is condescending to most of his staff daily, including PhDs and engineers with decades of experience, and micromanages everyone. He told many people in his group that they should be fired, didn't have the experience for their position, or were unqualified, and their level was too high. In my third week, I asked him to clarify a new project that didn’t make sense to me. I later learned that it was a backward process that had been in place at the company for many years, and I told him I was a little confused. He closed his office door and told me he had to re-evaluate my resume to ensure he hired the right person.   
I am highly demotivated. Despite the toxic environment, the company offers exceptional pay and extraordinary fertility benefits, which are important to us to have a child by surrogate soon. My workload is manageable, and I work remotely 2-3 days/week to avoid my manager. I've applied for another internal position, but there's a freeze on internal movements, possibly until year's end.  
If I stay, I think these are my options:  
•	Contact the company's whistleblower line.  
•	Send an anonymous email to the HR feedback address.  
•	Write an anonymous email to the recently hired VP, who expressed having an open-door policy.  
I’m looking for any realistic advice.

  
TL;DR Workplace is the most toxic in a long career, and I need advice on options.

174u4yo,Should I reapply for a job I turned down earlier in the year which I now regret?,"Earlier in the year I turned down a job to stay with my current employer. The main reason for turning it down being that it’s temporary ending in April 2025, but it could possibly be extended. I found it so hard to turn down as the workplace has a very good work life balance which my current workplace lacks. I value work life balance above everything else. 

However, I turned the job down in May of this year and since then it seems like they can’t fill the position as I’ve seen it advertised twice since then and now it’s just gone up again last Friday. Does this seem like a red flag to you guys? 

For some reason I’m regretting turning it down and think about it everyday and it’s making me miserable in my current role thinking about the work life balance I could have had.

I have 100% covered health benefits with no deductibles and 5 weeks paid vacation. This position is non-unionized but the company seems very stable and hasn’t had layoffs in decades.

174pbsd,Should I move jobs before promo?,"Having a bit of an internal crisis figuring out what to do.   I’m recruiting for a job that makes 40-50k more than my base salary today.  I’m currently an analyst at a prominent, but not stellar, consulting firm.  Think EY, Accenture, Deloitte, etc.  From what i’ve heard, it’s very likely I’ll be promoted to Senior Business Analyst in November/December, at which point I would definitely leave.  I just graduated college.

I actively dread going to work every day and feel as though I am trapped on a long term project that adds no skills towards what i’m trying to go into long term.  It’s highly boring work that mostly consists of PMO.  My coworkers are awful, like, I’ve almost submitted several HR tickets awful, and it’s likely that I would be stuck on this project for another 6-12 months.  I think about quitting every hour, not an exaggeration.

The other job is a PM role in a different service area than my ultimate goal, but offers more pay, better WLB, and more skill opportunities due to the company being a startup.  It could potentially still be boring, but I’d be able to have more control over my schedule and the ultimate product vision. I like doing product management and am definitely a “big picture” creative thinker, so my ultimate goal would probably be to start my own company eventually.

My problem is, if I get offered this job, that definitely pays WAY WAY more and offers equity, should I take it even if it means I can’t put the “Senior Analyst” on my resume?

This is the farthest i’ve gotten into an interview process in this job market.  I guess I’m just wondering if it’s the right thing to do when I’m still unsure of my path….

Additional points to consider:
- I hope to quit whichever job in two years so I can take a year off and travel
- I live in a HCoL city (NYC/SF)

174o4f9,Thoughts on leaving a stable job?,"TLDR - Advice on leaving stable jobs / lifestyle for your real passion. 

So I may just be looking for validation here, but I would appreciate any and all feedback.

Brief back story. I graduated high school in 2013 did 2 years of college and didn’t do so great because I spent more time focusing on a company I was trying to bring to life than my studies. My Dad more or less kicked me out at 19 after that. After about 9 month of waiting tables and barley getting by I enlisted in the military where I worked in aircraft maintenance for 4.5 years. During my enlistment I obtained my B.S. in Cyber Security I had plans on getting out of the military, but ended commissioning as an officer. Jumping to now I’ve been in the military for 7.5 years, I’m a junior officer, I completed a masters in cyber security in my own time, and I work in the intelligence community. 

My issue is that I absolutely hate my job. I make about 90k it’s very stable and great benefits, I honestly don’t work a crazy amount, and overall it’s not hard. It doesn’t challenge me in anyway. I like cyber security, but with how much I’ve disliked being in the corporate side of the military I have no idea if it’s really for me anymore.

In a year and a half I will have the option to get out of the military at a little over 9 years in. I can’t stop thinking about starting my own business. I work on business plans in my off time, I think of new business ideas, and fully flush them out. I have a variety of them just shelved because I can’t exactly just leave the military whenever I want to focus on them full time.

174lupf,Writing a resignation letter when you are not leaving the company (reassignment),"I have been at my job for a year or so, and I struggle with various disabilities. I started the process of requesting reasonable accommodations under the ADA. HR led the process and was in communication with my supervisor. My supervisor claimed the accommodations I was asking for were not compatible with my position, forcing us to explore reassignment. 

I have never had any communication with my boss about the accommodations; it has all been through HR. This process has been long, but I am finally being reassigned as a reasonable accommodation.  
HR has been in communication with my boss, and a few weeks ago, she let my boss know that they were working on a position for me (and my boss just asked that I give her enough notice to find someone). My boss does not know that I am officially being reassigned; I am staying within the company, just in a different department. I will still have a relationship with my current department and will want to keep my professional relationship with my boss (especially in case I need a reference in the future).

  
My question is, how do I give notice to my boss? I don't technically need to since I'm not ""quitting,"" but I want to be respectful. How much time should I give? HR is pretty much leaving this up to me - I have struggled in my current state for so long, so I don't want to wait too long to transfer. **I guess my question is, has anyone written a formal letter of resignation when you are just being reassigned within the company?** My job is going to be hard to fill, so there is no way my boss will find a replacement in 2 weeks, but if it helps, then I suppose I can wait 2 weeks.

My manager hired me in January 2023 and told me that I would have to learn the whole chemical plant and it's processes.

When I applied I asked him a very direct question about what his expectations where in the first:

- 3 months 
- 6 months 
- 1 year etc...

His answer was that I'd be spending the first 4-5 months in the laboratory doing tests. And didn't specify anything afterwards regarding on where I should be in my unit knowledge.

I started working with a 6 months contract in January, 5 months in I had an examination regarding my knowledge and had to explain a part of my unit and they were happy with my explanation.

Further on they extended my contract with another 6 months till January 2024. 

I was happy of course and thought nice I'm meeting their expectations, till last week....

When my manager called me into his office and told me he wasn't satisfied with my performance and that I was behind in my learning compared to other colleagues.

He said that my contract wouldn't get extended with a permanent one and that I would have to start looking for another job.

**There is also 1 thing that I wanted to add: the company isn't doing very well economics wise, we produce a lot less compared to a few months ago.**

And I think they are cutting personnel since the board of the company announced a huge reorganisation within the firm.

They are analyzing where to cut costs.

So my question is:

What do I tell my next employer when they ask why I want to jump ship so soon after 10 months?

1. Do I tell them that the company is reorganizing and that I want more security?

2. Do I mention that I've already been laid off but it's actually till January 2024 that I'm supposed to leave?

My manager told me that he doesn't have any problems with me as an employee (personal) and I was good in my team and my colleagues liked me.",halayuc,0,0.5,1,1696937814,2023-10-10 11:36:54,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/174iz5e/what_to_tell_future_employer_after_being_laid_off/,10,2023

174iwcg,Setting boundaries with the boss,"Lady here with a dilemma. I work in a male dominated industry and I learned early that if you don't push back and set boundaries you will be overlooked, undervalued and generally treated like dirt. This has worked well and allowed me to get along with all my co-workers until my current manager... He is a stereotypical alphamale type on the outside but incredibly sensitive and I would even say insecure on the inside. He can be warm and kind and understanding for a while but then something goes wrong in his life and the Karen-like micro aggressions start at work.

He is close to my age but acts like someone who did leadership training in the 70s by which I mean:

* non-pc, lots of jokes and unsolicited opinions about what I eat and my fitness and some really insulting assumptions about my lifestyle very obviously based on my appearance.
* very judgmental or dismissive of people who are different to him.
* bad at compartmentalizing, so very comfortable with using professional situations to take personal frustration out on those he deems lesser.
* brilliant at what he does and very good at creating processes to fix problems, but he always wants to enforce this by publicly shaming people, which I would be less sensitive about if he didn't always want to be the exception to every rule. He handles pressure so badly, and as an assertive person I usually bear the brunt of this.

I have tried letting him know I disagree or have a boundary by trying:

* in a direct but non-emotional manner - he will either say that he is just going to keep doing it jokingly to dismiss what I said, but then continues to repeat said issue anyway or straight ignores me, same result
* more passively, by directly telling him after the fact in a one on one even throwing in apologies for things I shouldn't have to apologize for and even bringing treats with to make him more receptive - he says that he doesn't recall or doesn't know what I'm talking about or just lies and says he has no issue at all and calls me an overthinker
* passive aggressively (purely in frustration) to make jokes about those situations or even get personal back to show him how it feels - he is ultra competitive and will not stop the back and forth until he's had the last word even if it means escalating tension to levels of pure hatred and *his* feelings are hurt.

This ends in him letting the tension build to a point where he picks on me and picks, then when I'm miserable and sniping back he will blindside me (again using public humiliation) by letting everyone at some meeting or event know that I bully him, and because he's such a bro with all the guys I just look like a b... and I have to endure lectures from the others about how woman are so vengeful and don't forgive.

The last time, he revealed that I have a health issue and shamed me for taking pills instead of just getting fit, to the entire team completely out of the blue just to put me in my place. The next week I guess he felt guilty or was nervous of HR so he starting talking real sweet like I've never heard before but he won't even allow me space to withdraw and be quiet, he will be on me to smile smile smile so he feels less uncomfortable. I feel like I have no moves left and I don't know how I can carry out my job if I can't challenge him without being the target of this passive aggressive relentless controlling man. I make him so insecure that he reads something aggressive in everything I say.

To avoid any questions about attraction or sexual tension, we have never had that vibe at all. Here's the challenge: I love my company. I don't want to leave. What is the most non-threatening way to do my job, not be a doormat and for bonus points heal my relationship with him? I just feel so boxed in and ground down to dust. I'm so tired of apologizing and being held solely accountable for our bad interactions.

174igok,Management testing the waters with me regarding upskilling,"Would like a little advice on how to best play this out.

Started a new job over a year ago, realized pretty early on I was well liked for how I handle myself. Looks like now they want to do something with me to gain skills to grow my development.

One of the things is something my team hated. A senior lady was given direction to basically micromanage us and do the smallest share of the actual workload. NO ONE liked it, and there was a huge deal of toxicity.

I was recently asked to step up and prove I'm capable of directing a team and take over, I explained the situation is replacing the old with something new and shiny and that implementing a better process would not require a ""micromanager"".

I said I'd do it for one day just to prove to them I can, but am against the idea. Anyway, I did. And I did it with the kind of qualities they respected in the first place from me. No sitting back ordering the team around. I was right in the work load as much as the next person.

I had some coaching, where the feedback from it was I did an awesome job and was asked if I can do this more. 

I told my manager no, the team understands their job. We just don't have the right processes in place. Also my workload shot up as I didn't want to drop my efforts. They did not agree is putting it kindly.

Anyway, I like my job and the people here. But am slightly worried they will give up on me for not playing ball. How best to play this out?",bootyholeminer,0,0.5,1,1696935990,2023-10-10 11:06:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/174igok/management_testing_the_waters_with_me_regarding/,10,2023
174hx2l,My employer is forcing me out by making work miserable. I have a job offer - should I take it?,"I need some advice on whether to leave my current job for a new opportunity. Here's the situation:

My company recently got new management who are restructuring my department. My subordinate left 2 months ago, and now they want me to take on her responsibilities in addition to more mundane, thankless support tasks for the team that nobody else wants to do. And if I don't accept their ""offer"", they said I can just stay until the end of the year to get my bonus and then leave. 

It's basically downgrading my role. Plus, they're bringing in someone new (a former subordinate of the new boss) to take over projects I wanted to lead. 

I've been looking around, because I haven't been seeing a future here or any plans to develop me. I got a new job offer, but it has some drawbacks:

1. The pay bump isn't great. Looking just at the base salary, the new offer is a bit more per month than I make now. But my current annual total pay including the yearly bonus, when broken down monthly, is about the same as the new job's monthly amount

2. The location is farther, but work from home (hybrid) flexibility helps. (My current employer also has the same hybrid arrangement)

3. The new job's health insurance doesn't cover kids.

4. Leaving now means losing my year-end bonus in a couple months if I stayed.

5. Since I'd join late in the year, I'd miss the raise and bonus cycle until halfway through next year. 

The new title and growth outlook seems better than my current dead-end job though. The offer isn't ideal, but I'm inclined to take it and escape my current toxic workplace. It just doesn't sit right with me to lose out on that bonus and the small raise.

Maybe I'm just looking for arguments could help convince me I'm doing the right thing...

174gxv2,I just joined a company and want to leave after 4 months - how should I explain this to recruiters/hiring managers?,"Some background about me: 
- 25F
- I started my first job at 20 in a renowned media company, working my way up there for 5 years and have great recommendations & connections
- I got headhunted to join my current job as a senior manager in a digital advertising firm. However, my boss left when i joined. She was a huge reason why I took the offer up in the first place as I wanted a mentor 

Now, getting into it, after 4 months here I desperately want to leave the job for numerous reasons 
- Work from office 9-5 and long commute from home
- I don’t see much I can learn from my new boss as she has been reluctant to teach me. In fact I never had a proper on-boarding but was just thrown into the work and expected to learn on my own. Yet, she complains that my technical knowledge is sub-par 
- They are currently going through a retrenchment and things seem quite uncertain 
- I just don’t like the work environment and culture here (its a norm for bosses to be yelling at staff, expecting you to OT 24/7 with no extra incentives, you get ridiculed for “normal” lunch breaks bcs most people eat in less than 30 mins and get back to work etc) 

All in all, I just can’t see myself here for long. I’m unhappy about the environment, culture and also my lack of mentor. I actually enjoy the job though, so I’ll be applying for jobs within the same scope and industry. With that, how should I explain it in nicer terms to recruiters when they ask why I’m leaving after just 4 months?",nnnly,3,0.800000011920929,3,1696930197,2023-10-10 09:29:57,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/174gxv2/i_just_joined_a_company_and_want_to_leave_after_4/,10,2023

174fdty,Should I take a new job?,"  
I have been working on my this company for 12 years (it was my first and only job), I work on a SAP team (we monitor some systems, we create keys to users and other small things), we work 24x7 basis with 5 guys, (2 guys work on a 12 hour shift each for 2 days then 2 days of rest I.E. I work sunday and monday 12 hours each, than I rest tuesday and wednesday) and the 5th guy works on the 9 to 5 on weekdays, he servers as a backup for the team, (to cover holidays, sick days, and other emergencies).  
  
The thing that I was at a party a couple weeks ago, and I spoke with a former team mate (he quit 2 years ago) and he offer me a space on his team to work on another SAP area, the job would be a weekly 9 to 5, 3 home office days a week and almost the double of my current paygrade but in another town (1 hour and a half from wher I am, it won't even be necessary to change from my town). He said I could message him at any moment if I'm interested in this spot, also he is a very good friend, he moved to this other town, and before that he was always at parties that I made on my house, he knows my family and we both have a great respect for each other. It is a real deal offer, no jokes or traps. for me.  
  
The thing is, my current job is very safe, I won a very good salary for the spot I'm at the moment (for my country standart) way more above average, got some complains here and there but nothing too big, we got home office for half of our days a year, my coordinator is a very nice person and I feel protect here. The problem is, this job is kiiling me.I work at the night shift almost since the beginning of everything, got some daily shift periods that together won't make a year and a half, I gained a lot of weight, my mental health was destroyed, I have a terrible sleeping routine, can't have a weekly routine due to always have diferent work/off days every week. It is a challenge to come to work sometimes, each year seems more difficult.  
  
The question even with all the difficults my currently job has, it is still a very good job and I am really afraid to take this new oportunity, everybody I spoke of it says that I'm qualified to this new challenge  
and deep inside I know that too, but the anxiety cripples me in a way that I simply forget about it at all. What would you guys do in my place?

Hi all - I got a job offer today, yay! I’m meeting with the recruiter tomorrow to go over details. It’s a cool opportunity and a senior-level position with much higher pay so I’m pretty excited.

The thing is, I’m moving to the US next summer with my fiancé (husband by then). This past Friday (after I’d already finished many rounds of interviews) we found out he got his dream job down there to start in August 2024. We’d be moving from Canada.

The offer I received is remote but based in Canada. The company is American with a head office in the city I’ll be moving to next year.

I’m wondering if I should tell the recruiter tomorrow I’ll be moving next summer? I figured if that’s a dealbreaker for them I can just stick with my current job until the move. Or should I not say anything and then let them know sometime early next year that I’ll be moving/ask if a transfer is possible?

174cblc,Good enough to act but denied the actual position?,"I’m in a bit of a unique situation and was hoping that someone can give me advice or where to seek help because I am feeling helpless right now.  will try to keep this on the short end to the point so bear with me. I have been working with the state and my department for years now. My family member also works in the same department and office as me so when I was hired on, I signed a nepotism form, and there was and has been no issues. My family member does not have any managerial or supervisor power over me or anyone in the office . In fact, there was another employee who worked with her family member in the office as well, and again, no issues whatsoever. 

Recently I was asked if I wanted to act in a new position since that employee had quit. I stepped up and agreed, and I was quickly accepted into the role as an “acting” I received out of class pay with no issue. When the time came to apply for the actual job, I was interviewed and chosen and given a tentative offer letter. as I did in the past I signed my nepotism form and this is where my issue is now. I was told that everyone had signed off on me getting the job even the branch chiefs, and I heard through the grapevine that I was initially denied by HR because of this nepotism issue and my office sent in an appeal as to why I deserve the job and I have not heard anything since . This new position that I have been acting in and applied for is in no way related to my family members position . We do not have any power over each other. We report to the same supervisor and they were no way involved in my hiring process. They are in a completely different position that has no employees under them. From my understanding even if you have a family member working in the same office, they can hire you based on your merit. the nepotism form I signed was the same exact one I signed years ago when I first was hired onto the department. I have reached out to the union and labour relations and they basically said that they can’t help me. I’m at a loss. I feel discriminated against because I was good enough to act , but not be hired into the actual position? How can they approve one but not the other? I have been acting in this position for almost a year now and it has been half a year since I interviewed. I was looking into the EEOC office to file a claim of discrimination, but have to wait until I get a second denial I suppose.

174bx6d,Is this good enough for declining a counteroffer?,"Dear \[Employer\],   
Thank you for getting back to me regarding the job offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and value the time and effort you have put into this process. However, after careful consideration, I have decided to decline the offer at this time.   
Once again, thank you again for your consideration and the chance to learn more about your organization. I hope we can keep in touch in the future, and I wish \[company\] continued success in your future endeavours.   
Best regards,

I decided to decline the counteroffer because the overall compensation package is not that great. The salary is below the average in my area and below my expectations even though they were upfront about it. But I expected the benefit to be good since the salary was low but didn't expect that it's also not great.  For context, the salary was they countered was 41k (overtime is already included with that salary so basically I don't get paid overtime) with 5 days of sick leave and 10 days annual vacation. I only get $600 of insurance coverage base on understanding which I think is low compare to other companies.

174bo4x,Laid off… should I take 3 months off to travel?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this but I am looking for some advice. I was recently laid off from my job as a Software Engineer and have had trouble (and lack motivation) finding a new job.

I have travelled alone for work but never for more than a week or internationally (I am in the Midwest USA). I have a desire to travel to SE Asia, specifically Thailand and Indonesia due to its cheapness and having ancestral ties there. I’ve been watching Youtube videos and vlogs of travelers and digital nomads and it seems like such an amazing experience, and I feel this could be the best time for me to go out of my comfort zone and see the world.

I have about $40k saved up and also applied for unemployment. No pets, family, mortgage, and have been single for over a year now. Very little obligations. My lease is also up at the end of November so I could get away from the Midwest winter.

If I end up going, I want to enjoy myself, but also want to refine my programming skills to stay sharp. However, my worry is employers may see this gap as a negative and I could have trouble finding a job when I get back.

I’m curious if anybody here has done a similar trip or has any sort of advice. If feel like if I’m ever gonna travel, now may be the best time to do it. But at the same time, it is a bit scary and if I can’t find a job once I get back I could be screwed.

174a50v,I'm about to be laid off for the 3rd time in the last 12 months. How screwed am I?,"I accepted a contract role beginning in 2022 that last 10 month, for a huge pay increase(40%).

I shouldn't have left, but at the time I was at my company for 3 years, and needed the money.  They countered, but I was pretty worried about taking a counter offer.

I went and completed my 10 month contract, and accepted a new job which ended up lasting 4 months.  I expected to stay 2 years, and was told it would be long term when I was hired, so that stung.  
I'm now back at my original company, but likely to be laid off in the next month or so.

How bad does this look on a resume?  How screwed am I in the future?  Many people I know have managed to get 5+ years at their company, while the longest I've stayed at one is 3.  At this point I'm scared I'll be branded a job hopper even though it wasn't always by choice, and will only receive contract roles.

1748vhz,Been Searching for a Job now for 8 Months and I am Losing Hope. (MBA and Strategic Marketing Degrees.),"Hi ya Reddit. Now, I normally don’t go to the internet to seek advice and/or to complain about my life, but I am honestly am at my wit’s end and have nowhere else to turn to. I am a 24 y/o White Male. I graduated in 2021 with a Bachlors in Strategic Marketing. Because of COVID-19 I decided to stay and extra year and got my Masters in Business Administration in 2022. Ever since I graduated I have been struggling to find work and my last job was an on campus job at my college in 2022, which I lost once I graduated college. Now that the background has been established let me get into the tea. I at this point have applied to over hundreds of jobs. The entry level positions in my fields aren’t actually entry level and all have ridiculous barriers to entry like for example “Must have 2 years marketing experience.”… FOR AN ENTRY LEVEL POSITION. How am I supposed to get the experience if all of the entry level jobs require experience?! Besides that I also tried getting into sales but almost all of the sales jobs were like “Are you okay with 100% commission?” I don’t think any sane person would be okay with their pay being susceptible to the already shitty economy. After too many companies ghosted and ignored my applications, I started applying to jobs outside of my field and jobs that don’t require a degree since those types of jobs were more abundant in my area. Sadly tho this didn’t yield any different results and it was more of the same and this time it was because they didn’t want to pay a livable wage and want to exploit high schoolers for every penny they have. I even started applying to jobs that I never thought to and even then they still denied me and now I’m getting to having been unemployed for over one and a half years and it makes my chances of getting a job even slimer. I feel like I have tried everything at this point. Job Websites (Indeed and ZipRecuiter.), Headhunters, Going Store to Store and asking if they have jobs, etc. They have all let me down and gotten me nowhere. Hell I even tried my hands at a serving job and they let me go since they have two people apply with serving experience and didn’t want to train me anymore and I didn’t meet their expectations. I am just starting to feel so depressed and worthless and my family pressuring me and getting annoyed and angry about my unemployment isn’t helping matters either. It also doesn’t help hat the region of the usa that’s is very much into ethnic and diversity hiring since we have such a small ethnic population and I get it and support it but I feel like now that I am being punished in the job market just because I’m a white male, elements of myself I cannot change. Hell I am even starting to regret going to college and resent my degrees now which I don’t like but I can’t help it it at this point they haven’t been of any help to me so far. So Reddit I come to you to ask what am I doing wrong what can I do differently to get employment? And for anyone who went through a similar experience how did u beat and get out of this cynical cycle? Any input will be appreciated thanks!

1748k9e,Is a masters of education worthless,"without a teacher certification?  
I studied creative writing and went straight into a masters/certification program after graduation. For a variety of reasons, it was a very rough year. Somehow, I managed to get my masters degree but my coach did not feel comfortable signing for me to get my certification.  


  
I felt ashamed and was/am in a lot of debt so I just didn't even pursue anything in the education world and took the first admin job that would take me. A year later, I was laid off, once again scrambling for whatever job I could get which turned out to be a technical writing/documentation job that was temporary. I guess I could've been more active about job searching during the duration of my contract instead of just the last month or so but as it turned out a grant writing position for an engineering firm hired me and had me start the week after my last day so that's what I'm doing now.  


  
It seems the only job would be a curriculum writer but I'm not sure if given the fact all the work experience I have is not education related at all would mean I wouldn't be taken seriously. I did apply to a couple of these and never heard back.I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts or experience that would be relevant? I'd still be interested in working with students especially in small group/tutoring settings.  


  
More personal background:  


  
Both jobs in the STEM fields have been bad fits and I am concerned taking them just takes me further from a job I love. I do feel content and at peace and maybe it was a blessing in disguise that I didn't get the teaching cert and am not a secondary English teacher but I still think I would love to get an MFA and be a creative writing professor (of course, that's a rough job market) or get a master's in counseling but also am hesitant about getting another master's even if I figure out how to swing it financially. I'd also be interested in an editing/publishing job but at the same time would love to not feel like the 40k in debt I'm in over this masters in education was a waste. I still feel passionate about K12 education and want to believe there could be a place for me there.",ivyash85,3,1.0,0,1696900055,2023-10-10 01:07:35,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1748k9e/is_a_masters_of_education_worthless/,10,2023
17482zr,Move to get my old job? Or starting over in my 30s?,"Using a throw away account here.  


I had a very good career working as a contractor and was making good money. I was lucky enough to really enjoy what I did as well. Unfortunately, after the pandemic I lost a lot of work. So when a decent amount of my networked stopped hiring me I decided to take a job in a different city working for a small company and start over so to speak. I didn't want to, but it seemed to be the obvious choice as the job opportunity seemed worth it... Unfortunately a little less then a year after the move, the company that hired me ran into some serious financial trouble and couldn't support my roll any longer. It was fine, as I was doing work that wasn't very fulfilling and I was pretty overqualified for... In retrospect I felt a bit lied to about what the roll entailed... However now I'm in a new city trying to get back into contracting work. But it has been very slow to start as it relies heavily on connections. Something I don't have a lot of in this new city. I'm in my 30s and much of my network is back where I moved from. It's been about five months since I left the disappointing start up and I haven't been meeting my expenses. I've yet to fall in love with this new location too and I fear I'm looking back on my past life in the old city with rose colored glasses... I know I could get most of my old work there if I went back and perhaps rebuild, but my girlfriend would kill me if that's what I wanted to do, we moved here together... I have a decent amount of savings but certainly less then I did five months ago... I am getting a little concerned as things aren't progressing as fast as I was hoping. I'm wondering if it's time to make a pivot.

1747a80,Diversity in HR,"Is it me or is every HR recruiter for companies lack diversity? Every recruiting individual that works for a major company that I’ve applied seem to be a Caucasian female. Seems rare to come across diverse HR professionals with a diverse hiring portfolio for companies. 

The reason why I’m being critical is in my R&D for a role in learning about the recruiter, their bios usually indicate which roles & department they’ve been responsible for recruiting. So based on this, and their time period working there, I review all the hires that’ve happened under their perview, and it always seem to reflect that there is some racial bias in their hiring trend. But this doesn’t just reflect towards Caucasian HR professional, it reflects towards HR professional from different racial background. Human Resources seems to be an industry dominated by Caucasian females, normally in the 25-59 age group.

my weight well, wanting to see me in costumes, wishing i dated co workers, etc. The other has kissed me on the cheek, told me he wanted to kiss me while at work, hugged me around my neck and told me “I want to kill you” Has had my bosses make multiple comments to him, asking him to stay away from my desk, to which is response is “i don’t care they can fire me” He would look at my phone and touch my personal belongings even with me not present and without permission. He would park next to me at work and wait for me to leave. 

Upon reporting it to HR, their solution was to send both of them home WITH pay while the investigation was ongoing. They told me they still expected me to show up to work. When i explained that I didnt think it was fair they were also getting paid even though I was required to work, they responded this was “routine procedure” and they removed them from the premises to make me feel safe and to accommodate me.

1743w59,Underwriter Seeking Change,"need to make a career move relatively quickly. Simply put, I can no longer pay the bills for a family at $60k/year. 

Graduated college in 2016 with a BA in history. Original plan was to go to law school but by sophomore year I decided that starting life $100k or more in debt was bad, so I picked up an econ minor and pivoted my goals to working in financial services. Interned at an insurance company and scored a position in a management training program for a big bank upon graduation. 

Went through the program and came out as an assistant manager at a small branch with the idea that program graduates would be running their own office 12-18 months on. By summer 2019 I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied there. I liked lending but the bank kept pushing sales reps to focus on life insurance products which, given the age and demographics of my client base, was not selling without being a sleazy salesman.

 On top of that I was the last guy in my cohort still not a manager despite being the top performer at my level in my region. All promotions were going to external hires who did not work out. This included my own boss, a girl just older than me who was completely incompetent forcing me to cover for her mistakes and basically train her how to run the office. When I would discuss career progression with leadership, the only feedback id get was ""keep doing what you're doing, your time will come.""

I eventually got fed up. I found a position in state government on their small business lending program. It was in the loan recovery division, but would give me some experience in the underwriting side rather than straight sales. I had always had an interest in working for state government, so I made the move. It was a pay cut at first ($56k to $44k) but went up to $52k after 6 month probationary period. 

Did this for a couple years, eventually we cut our loan delinquencies to near nothing so I got bored and transferred to our grants office. I dont hate the work but, again, its boring and I know I have the capacity to do more. Promotional positions simply do not come up often and, because HR is done out of a central locstion, they may not even pass your resume on to the hiring manager for any kind of arbitrary reason. I just had this happen for what would have been my dream position and didn't even get an interview because I hadn't spent enough time under the right job code. 

Now things are getting urgent thanks to inflation. Bills have doubled since 2020, our union just got us a COL incrwase of 5% which obviously doesn't cover it. I can't feed 3 kids on $60k pay, my wife's part time job is looking more and more full time just to make ends meet. We quickly went from putting $5-600 away monthly to having to draw several hundred from savings just to pay the bills.  It will all be depleted next year at this rate. A part time job for me isn't really an option since she already works evenings and weekends so we don't have to send our kids to daycare. 

So, for those in similar roles, what trainings and credentials can I earn to increase opportunities? I work with lots of people qho have MPAs and they aren't making a dime more than I am, so thst seems like a bad investment of time and money to me. Id rather get technical certifications. Im halfway to a CDFP, but the state won't pay for any additional classes they don't seem immediately relevant to the job I have now. Continuing thst seems to be my first option, but I don't know how much the certification is actually worth since the state itself doesn't seem to put much value in it.

Could always go back to banking, but underwriters are getting laid off left and right. 

Tl;dr: If you had experience in loan sales and underwriting, weren't satisfied with $60k per year, and had the capacity to start earning some certs, what would you do?",Blumpus1234,3,1.0,0,1696887711,2023-10-09 21:41:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1743w59/underwriter_seeking_change/,10,2023

1743tsg,"Should ""My Freelance Colleague"" Showcase Their Full Expertise or Downplay It in Collaborative Software Development Projects?","I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share a situation that one of my ""freelance colleagues"" is currently facing in a software development project and seek your valuable advice and insights on how to handle it.  
  
This particular freelancer possesses a remarkable set of skills and qualifications that set them apart from the norm. They have an eidetic memory, which means they can recall information with incredible precision. They were able to test out of university in one of the majors with the highest dropout rates currently available, showcasing their exceptional intellectual abilities. They are a member of Mensa, demonstrating their high IQ, and have been programming since a very young age, displaying an innate talent for technology.  
  
However, their unique abilities and achievements have often brought them unwanted attention and challenges in the past. People have not always reacted positively when they've shown what they are truly capable of. In fact, they have encountered situations where colleagues acted concerned and worried about their abilities. Some even attempted to betray them out of jealousy and damaged egos, making it a deeply unsettling experience.  
  
Now, in this collaborative software development project, their role primarily involves software development, an area where they excel. However, they also hold certifications in project management, which could significantly contribute to a smoother project execution. They could use their project management skills to streamline processes, optimize workflows, and ensure efficient project delivery.  
  
Because of their past experiences, they've intentionally acted less knowledgeable than they are. They've observed colleagues discussing others who tried to show they were better, and they don't want to create the same feelings of competition and potential negativity among their current colleagues. They've chosen to downplay their abilities to foster a more harmonious working environment.  
  
Herein lies the dilemma: Should they continue to downplay their skills, including their software development and project management expertise, to maintain a collaborative and non-competitive atmosphere, even if it might mean a less efficient project execution? Or should they consider gradually introducing their expertise, making sure not to create negative feelings, and contributing to a more efficient project outcome?  
  
Your insights and experiences are invaluable, and we are eager to learn from your wisdom.

1743l68,I’m conflicted (Job search question),"So, I’ve been working at my current job making $80-90k depending on OT. It is not a glamorous job and I work with a lot of strange and awkward people. I am in the middle of getting divorced and part of our arguments we’re that I need to find a better job. Lately I’ve been job searching into high stress but better paying management positions. I already turned one job offer down that paid $92k because I really didn’t think I was going to enjoy the job. I do have some management experience and know the pros and cons. Here’s my conflict:

I feel I am simply looking for another job not just for better pay but because I somehow feel obligated. Maybe what my wife told me is getting to me or maybe the fact that having a white-collar job is more appealing. I am somewhat happy with my current job and am considering one day to get promoted but is it wrong to be comfortable in a job?  
I know I can do someone of these jobs but I really don’t think the stress and responsibility is worth the higher pay.",Crows_HeadIC,1,1.0,2,1696886951,2023-10-09 21:29:11,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1743l68/im_conflicted_job_search_question/,10,2023

1740z4c,Depressed and anxious. I don't know what to chase.,"Hey everyone.

I'm a male 27yo and have bachelor on IT. n terms of hobbies I don't have a hugely defined one appart from videogames which is my no-brainer but worse than anything, I feel a huge curiosity of everything's inner workings (both human and technological)

I've started working (2nd job) in a small company using AWS services (I have the first-level certification) and I don't know why, my company thinks I can learn anything fast and be good at it quickly. I'm right now working as web-dev (woah, surprise!) and I hate the feeling of not knowing and being expected to know.

I've never worked as such and didn't even know about git, backends or angular, I slightly do now and can work around it, but reeeeeally slowly. And if you ask me: ""Do this from zero"" I would have a mental breakdown crisis.

Anxiety and stress are my best worst friends right now and appear as soon as  I think that the next day I have to go back to work.

I'm lost in life right now. I have huge expectations of things I'd like to do, like buying a house, reforming it, starting a business that I've thought a lot... But right no I'm living in my parents home, and I have a wage that I cannot complain about, but sadly in my country, Spain, isn't something you can survive alone with (1400€/month).

I've been working for 2 months and already feel really depressed about seeing that I'm just wasting my time working on this when I could be developing myself iinto something else that would benefit me and fit me much better... I want to redirect myself to a goal I don't really know, and that's generating a lot of negative feelings on me.

1740jra,Should I lie to negotiate salary better?,"I’ve been in the interview stage with a company I want to join and I know the talk of salary is going to come up soon. I’m trying to think of the best way to negotiate for a higher salary. Would it be wise to lie about my current salary and say it’s higher to get a bigger pay jump?..only issue there is Ik they could ask to see my previous payslips and W2. Or I could lie and say I have a competing offer at another company for leverage…but I also know that’s risky bc companies could always ask to see that offer letter/email. The company I’m interviewing for has the range of 100k-120k on their job listing. I was thinking about lying a bit and saying “I currently make 120k” or “I have a competing offer for 125k” so “I would be expecting 130k to join your company”. I’m also afraid that giving a number that high like that could make them cut me off. Still new to the job interview process so I’m trying to learn the best way to navigate salary negotiation. And I’ve been seeing mixed responses online on when best it is to negotiate salary, some people say during the interview process and others say don’t negotiate until you have a written offer letter. So in that case, when is the most optimal time to negotiate and what should I do to ensure I’m not getting lowballed?",hiya195,5,0.699999988079071,11,1696879496,2023-10-09 19:24:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1740jra/should_i_lie_to_negotiate_salary_better/,10,2023
173zrba,"Feeling very stuck in life, can’t decide on a career","There are thousands of posts like this online, but it’d be nice to talk to others about the problems I’m facing. I (25f) have always struggled to find out what I really want to do for a career. I’ve had tons of unfulfilling jobs in my life, mostly retail and some office work. I do like the structure that work gives me and the feeling of making my own money and being productive is great, but I have absolutely zero interest in most of the jobs I can get at the moment, and have a strong desire to get back into school. 

In 2021, I finally tried college, went for a teaching degree, did very well in school, but ultimately realized that path wasn’t for me. I loved college though, would love to go back, but I’m so stuck in figuring out what I really want. My interests have always been more creative. I love painting and writing, but I’m not that interested in making those my career. I’d prefer something more realistic. I think my biggest problem is the amount of options I have. I’m so afraid of picking something and not liking it, when it seems everyone I know who has a great career knew from the jump what they wanted to do. Or I see a career I’ve never considered before, think ""yeah I could see myself doing that."" I get inspired by it, but the inspiration fizzles out.

Should I just jump the gun and try SOMETHING? I’ve always been interested in something in the medical/dental field, but then I psych myself out.

I have been given a lot and also learnt a lot in a small time duration that I have been here. I applied for a competitor in the field and got a generous offer. 

Which my current employer tried to match. Eventually I rejected current employers offer and decided to serve notice saying I want to join the competitor anyway as a new experience.

My boss has said numerous things like ""I have taught you and improved your skills all for you to  join a competition."" Also he said "" you might regret leaving since this company is going to be big"" also ""good that you are serving a notice period since your team is behind on the schedule"" and "" I hope you remember confidentiality clauses which might put company at risk if you share with the competitor""

I could see that my departure isn't being taken very well, I have loved working here. And seriously wish well for the company. But I really wish to get a new experience since this competitor is a good name in the industry.

2. Will I face problems if by accident any of my skills or secret knowledge that I have gained from previous employer is used for the new employer?

173v7po,"I think I’m doing a great job, but my boss doesn’t. What should I do?","To preface, I’m an accountant. I do a good job at accounting stuff and my boss has no complaints there.

But lately my boss has been considering me for a promotion, and has been giving me some additional work. Most of it is qualitative (drafting emails for high ranking executives, creating presentations, etc). I feel like the work I do is really good, better than what he does, but he doesn’t exactly see it that way.

Today I drafted an email for him, which I thought was excellent. I ran it through grammarly and spent a good amount of time on it.

He came back with a ton of comments saying he wants it to be easier to understand and more informative. So I rewrote the email, spellchecked, the whole deal, and sent it back to him.

Again, he didn’t like it. Instead of commenting again, though, he just typed it up himself and sent it away, clearly frustrated with me.

When I read what he sent, it was literally horrible. There were run on sentences, tons of spelling mistakes, and a lot of bloated, confusing language. Imo it was way worse than what I sent him, I couldn’t even follow what he was trying to say. 

My initial email truly seemed better than what he put together. I wish he’d just taken what I gave him and thanked me for doing a good job. But instead he was convinced I wasn’t doing it right, which obviously reflects badly on me.

I don't know. I dropped out of uni, what I did would have suited me, I like helping people. But that's all on me, I accept and move forward.

173tzx7,Im second guessing my decision to do an MBA program vs MSc...am I jumping to conclusions too quickly?,"Hi all! 

I'm 2 weeks into my MBA program and starting to second guess my decision.

I had done a lot of research and weighed the pros/cons of an MBA vs MSc. Ultimately I decided to do an MBA program as I have almost 10 years of work experience in sales/marketing, but never received a formal education in business/economics in during my undergrad (BA Social science). I really felt that gap in my knowledge when I went freelance last year and I no longer had the resources / team to rely on.  
I thought that having an MBA would help balance out my practical experience / learned knowledge and allow me to be more independent. 

Post degree I would love to continue to work freelance in marketing. I'm hesitant to go back into the corporate world, but would be open to it for the right role/terms/company.  
Granted its only week 2 but the classes are very broad (about leadership and economics) and not really what I imagined. For example, last week we had classes on leadership.  I felt like I was in one of those mandatory corporate HR seminars and left SO irritated.  

  
I am starting to wonder if the MSc in Marketing would have been a better choice to become a ""specialist"".  This seems more desirable in the freelance world, vs an MBA generalist. The tuition for the MSc is way more affordable too.  
I believe I can still withdrawal and get the majority of my tuition back. 

Am I jumping to conclusions too quickly about the program?",DoodlesTheWaffle,1,1.0,0,1696863665,2023-10-09 15:01:05,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/173tzx7/im_second_guessing_my_decision_to_do_an_mba/,10,2023

Current Job pros
-better medical/dental/vision/401k
-education program offering many 100% tuition coverage for certian degrees and certifications 
-a long paid parental leave for a new born which we plan on having early next year

Current job cons
-in office
-20% less pay
-entry level position

-20% pay increase
-wfh
-ive worked with(not for) this colleage/company before and have already built rapport with many employees

Looking to make a change to my current lifestyle, and fully want to know if anyone has any solid advice. 

Current situation is that I currently work offshore as Engineer and living in UK, doing 8 weeks away and home. Salary is equivalent to around £75k a year, before tax.

But the time away is really starting to gripe on me, and I have fully come to terms that money isn’t the be all and end all, need to make a change so I can make the transition to move home permanently and actually enjoy going to work.

I understand that I would probably have to start at the bottom if I make a full industry change but if it’s something I’m enjoying I really do not care, but I have been thinking maybe about electrican or plumber or gas? Even a plasterer! Willing to give any a try, but again I feel that if I commit to one I’m going to make a wrong decision.

Anyone have any advice on this? Probably looking to get into a trade most preferably.

Anyone know what would be the most beneficial and be able to fit around my job now while I make the transition, such as I can do courses and willing to give free labour for experience.

173ldhk,How do you choose between two career paths?,"So long story short, I graduated with my BSc and now I don't know what's next.  
  
I have a Bachelors in physics and during my degree I became really interested in Medical Physics, the idea of hospitals and radiation and machines and cancer seemed so interesting to me that I decided that's what it wanted to do with my working life.  
  
Enter 2020, COVID happens which at the time only reinforced my decision to go into healthcare. Among the popular terms that appeared there was the field Epidemiology, I thought I knew what it was but then one time during a research binge (thank you ADHD) I realised that Epi is mostly just maths, sure there's medicine and biology and social sciences but the core of it is statistics. I can do statistics.  
  
So reading about Epidemiology and the obsessive brain that I have I started to consider Epi as a proper, valid career option for me. I figured the interest would fade, as most of the career paths I was interested in did. But it never really did.  
  
So here I am, I graduated in June, I decided to take some time to work and spend time with my family before grad school but I still need to know what to do, specially since grad school admissions are at the end of this year/beggining of next year.  
  
In my brain, my two options Medical Physics and Epidemiology are virtually identical:  
  
They both require graduate education, possibly all the way up to a doctorate. I'm fine with this.  
  
They're both pretty future proof. I don't see Medical Physics or Epidemiology disapearing any time soon.  
  
They're relatively well paid, sure Medical Physics does pay significantly more but as long as it's livable I don't really care.  
  
I love both of them, simple as that, I can see myself doing either.  
  
The only slight advantage Medical Physics has over Epi is that there is a shortage of Medical Physicists worldwide and that a lot of Epi jobs are government which is well, not great. But I don't know if this is enough to justify choosing one path over the other.  
  
I don't want you guys to chose for me, what I want is for you to tell me if there is something I'm not considering or some advice would be great.",radioactivedisease,2,1.0,0,1696834498,2023-10-09 06:54:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/173ldhk/how_do_you_choose_between_two_career_paths/,10,2023

173ku75,Gave my 2 weeks and employer informed me they were terminating me after 1 week,"I have been a personal trainer at this company for a year and a half, which for this position is a very long time (most end up staying 3-4 months). The job has been great, and I’ve worked with a lot of great people. I put in my two weeks on Friday and told my boss that I had made a list of my clients, their needs, and which colleague I think they’d work best with based on personality and availability, and I told her I was prepared to take care of all of that to make the transition as smooth as possible. 

I just got a text from her today saying that my termination date was now going to be this Friday instead of the following Friday. She said she moved all my clients to other trainers’ schedules for me and that she just wanted me to introduce them to each other this week and make schedule changes as needed.

My boss is still relatively new to the company and doesn’t know much of anything about my clients or their needs or goals. The populations I tend to work with are elderly people and women/moms. Some of the other trainers will be much better suited to certain clients than others will, and I was planning on making those arrangements over the next two weeks. I have quite a few clients who only want to work with a female trainer because they feel more comfortable — my boss said she split all my clients between two trainers, one of them being a male. It’s just frustrating that she didn’t ask my opinion on any of it. I really care about my clients and want them to be happy with whatever happens. 

I also don’t know what to do because I wasn’t supposed to start my other job until after my two weeks was supposed to end, but my boss said the company is “cutting hours” even though they are desperately trying to hire new trainers. So it doesn’t sound like there’s any option to stay and finish out my two weeks even though that’s never been an issue before. 

Is there anything I can do or say to try and stay for the full two weeks? Do I have any rights as an employee? Would it be rude to ask my new employer if I could start a week earlier than I originally planned?

I just don’t know what to do and I’m stressing out that I will be out of a job for a full week.

173haqh,Should I leave my job and join the hotel business?,"Currently i work in the retention department for a credit card company. I make pretty decent money, about $65-80K a year, most of my pay comes from commission. I get great benefits, 5 weeks of PTO, and i can buy more. 2 weeks sick time, and lots of flexibility with the hours i work. Great health insurance, discounts on traveling, overall a pretty great company to work for. I could get paid more if i put in more effort towards the commission side of things. 

The only problem is, i hate my job. Like the actual job if it. I hate taking calls all day and having to handle with why people want to cancel and the constant rejection. I just don’t want to be taking calls all day. Every morning when i wake up, i hate that i have to take these calls. 

Before this, i was a manager at a movie theater and i loved it. The pay was much less, but it was such a fulfilling job. Dealing with people every day, leading a team, i loved every day of it. My ideal job ever since high-school was to become a manager at a really nice hotel.  But the pandemic hit, i left the theater and got into sales and started making lots of money, then got into where I’m at now. 

I want to start working at a hotel, mainly Hilton, but all the pay is so low for starting positions. I love dealing with people in person, i love hospitality.  I know it’s the type of job you have to build up in, but i don’t know if it’s worth making this transition. I have my own place, a wife, and little sister to take care of. I just know if i leave my job to go into a starting position at a hotel, everyone will think I’m crazy. I know I’m in a blessed situation with my job, but it’s not fulfilling for me and i simply hate every minute of it. But at the end of the day, there’s a 99% chance I’ll stay at my job due to the pay and the benefits it provides. I can easily make $90K if i really wanted to, which is good my situation.   

Any tips or advice on what I should do? Or some things to think about?

173dxe3,Advice on what to do Next (Leaving 3D Printing),"TLDR: What should I look into for work after working as a Manager and Technician for a 3D Printing Farm for the last half decade and going?  


Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm leaving my current job as the manager of a 3D Printing lab (formerly the technician for the lab). The place I'm leaving is the only game in town now (look when I started I liked the work and was convinced by my first boss that we'd have a tech bubble here eventually, didn't happen) and I need to figure out new work. I've got some experience I've picked up with some CNC Machinery mostly CNC Routers and Laser Cutters, a technical aptitude for trouble shooting and repairing machinery, some 3D Modelling skills, and then the organization and clerical skills to keep a lab running ship shape and on time.   


However other than the more obvious stuff like other manufacturing jobs and maybe an apprenticeship in a trade I've got no idea where I could go next or what I should look for in terms of other work (before you ask: No Degree so I can't bank on that). So I wanted to ask if there was any advice on fields or jobs that might fit my skill set or I might be able to shimmy into with a bit of training or certification?

I completed my gen courses in the first year and a half, and I have been attempting to get a physics degree. I took calc 1, 2 and 3 each twice because I failed them all on my first attempt. I passed physics 1,2 and 3 on the first attempts. I've taken a couple education courses because I decided I want to be a teacher. I had an internship where I worked with kids in a teaching setting and I really enjoyed it, and I just got a job that I'll be starting in the next week or two where I'll be going from school to school teaching kids about finances, and in the future maybe teaching teachers how to implement this curriculum into the classroom. 

I've been taking my classes basically one course per semester, including summers, for the last 3 years. I'm currently in a high level physics course and I'm really doubting my ability to finish the physics classes as I'm a month into the semester and this course is kicking my ass.

I'm tired of failing a course every year. I think I have to change my major but I dont know where to go. I know I want to teach but you need a degree to do so.

17372g9,"My Job has Changed so much in the last 3 years...Same Title, Unsure if I'm Overreacting","I've been at my company for almost 3 years. I started out in one position and am now also doing work in procurement and project management (field operations) due to a lay off of 50% at my office and at our main office I am now taking over because I'm the only qualified person left to pick up the pieces. 

My job is WFH and my title has been the same the entire time even though people around me have been promoted 2-3 times at this rate. I am officially the only person who have been with the original start up team who hasn't been promoted. Every time I'm promised a promotion the goal posts have been moved with the excuse that we're a ""start-up"" and we are cash strapped.  I've only received a $3k raise in 3 years because my KPIs (I only have them for my original job title) are never met because I do everything. So, I haven't received a bonus, which means I've missed out on about $30k. Meanwhile I have coworkers who have received their bonuses and had pay increases of around $40k and I'm starting to get discouraged. 

My manager is now promising me a promotion and a 10% raise come next year (Julyish) when we have reviews and they acknowledge all the work I've been doing and the extra work I will be doing. Problem is, now my role is steering towards something I don't want to do. My biggest issue is my WFH job is now going to become very travel intense to international countries I'm not comfortable going to and now hybrid since the new roles I'm taking on ""require in person interaction."" Problem is, I live about 100 miles away one direction. I've told them I don't want to do some of the new tasks/roles but I keep getting told it's a great opportunity and they'll be there to help me the entire time. It's also been suggested to me I should move closer to work but it's in an extremely HCOL area. 

I'm torn if I'm just someone not looking at my job correctly as an opportunity or if it really is this toxic. Leadership even after the restructuring are butting heads and every day there seems to be some new bad thing happening. BUT I am remote making six figures and I have friends and family telling me I have no right to complain and I just need to find a way to rise above the toxicity. I've interviewed for a few roles that would put me on track where I want my career to go a pay increase, but they're fully in the office. 

My biggest concern is I'll leave fully remote for an in office with higher pay and regret it, even if I'm completely overwhelmed at work and feel underpaid. I'm worried this is a classic situation of the Grass isn't Always Greener.

1735s1q,Startup career advice needed!,"Hello all, I'm looking for some advices on my career direction in the startup world.

  
I'm working at a Series A startup as a Product Manager. I'm currently the longest standing employee in the company (was the 1st IC hire in the company), having stayed here for over 3 years so far. A few challenges that I'm having now:

  
\- I've had a new manager (product leadership) several months ago, and the relationship is deteriorating quite fast. IMO, she's REALLY good at her job except the people management– Not super transparent about information, doesn't delegate works/projects with trust, and not spending enough time on mentorship and guidance. I've requested some performance feedback a few times so that I can improve myself and the relationship with the manager, but she hasn't really done anything about it and treat me in a very transactional manner. This makes me believe that my manager just doesn't like me/trust me for some reasons, and almost feels impossible to solve this problem.

  
\- The thing is, I've been having a really positive feedback from my peers throughout my whole time in this company, so it's quite embarrassing to deal with this situation. But I also started to feel like I might not be the right profile for this company anymore as this company now wants to grow to Series B with a more mature expertise. (I'm a junior level PM) It doesn't justify the way my manager treats me, but this makes me wonder if it's time to move on and find a new challenge somewhere else.

  
\- Another thing that constantly bothers me is where the business is going. Considering we're in real estate space, the rise of short-term/long-term interest rates is not in our favor. Therefore, the business has been looking for ways to diversify the revenue in so many new avenues, but to me it started to feel like the company is spending a bit too much time on something that we don't have expertise on, rather than really focusing on a few things that we can excel. (Totally personal opinion/feeling)

  
\- Plus, I'm having a baby soon (which is amazing!) and it started to change the way I see a startup career as well. I'm still interested in the startup world, but I think I had my experiences in a super early-stage, pre-market fit company with hard hustles, and it's probably time to find a more established business with a more mature leadership. (Series C+ company or public company) 

  
I think I have a few conclusive options that I can consider, including finding a new job or switching to a new team/position in the company, but look for a more high-level advice about how I should handle the relationship with my manager, plan my career growth in this company + in the future companies. Any advice would be appreciated!",WeakContract4173,3,0.8100000023841858,0,1696788667,2023-10-08 18:11:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1735s1q/startup_career_advice_needed/,10,2023

1733dbx,"My manager was promoted, should I apply for his job?","Hey everyone, I just wanted to bounce some ideas off of you. I'm not sure if I should apply for the manager position in my department. My manager was just promoted and his position is now open. I looked at the qualifications requested for the position, and I have them. Problem is, it's going to be a heavily desired position. Half of the team will be applying for it, as well as other internal employees. I'm the ""newest"" member of the team, but I have been working at this corporation for 1.5 years. One of my best friends was able to get me in the door for this company. He actually works in the same department as me, and will also be applying for the manager position. I expressed to him that I don't want this to interfere with our friendship and he said he wouldn't have a problem because he understands we have different skill-sets. He's very humble and kind but lacks leadership skills/public speaking charisma. He wants us to both apply to up the chances that one of us will get it. I would be totally fine if he got the position because he's a great person and he would definitely treat me well. I'm more worried about the other people in the department. While they do have more years in the company, they lack the skills to be manager (in my opinion).  
I'm just nervous I may actually get the promotion and have people resent me or even possibly resign because they feel they have been overlooked. I REALLY like my current job, but who wouldn't want a nice bump in salary? My mentor (high ranking personnel) within the corporation has been helping me network with other people from different departments, so it's not like this is my only chance for a promotion. In fact, if I apply and don't receive the position, I believe it may fair better for me in future job opportunities because they will see I have always been trying to propel my career within the company.  
Should I apply or am I setting myself up to destabilize the current team/disrupt my ""cushy"" job? I would just hate not to apply and people say ""you would've been a great fit if you had applied"".

1732raf,I was wondering if you anyone of you know someone who could use my help?,"As a copywriter and editor, i'm passionate about connecting people with the natural world. My love for the outdoors and wildlife has inspired me to create engaging and inspiring content that helps others appreciate and connect with nature.  
  
The sights and sounds of the forest have shaped my approach to copywriting and video editing. I strive to create content that evokes the same sense of wonder and connection that I felt on that day. Whether it's writing copy about nature conservation or editing a video about wildlife, I always try to infuse my work with the same sense of awe and respect that I have for the natural world.  
  
And also i help business owners to make it easier to run a thriving practice and spend less time on tedious tasks including managing paperworks, managing emails, looking for a supplier, and follow-ups to clients so they can focus on what matter most.  
  
I'm seeking to work for an organization that's passionate about wildlife conservation, and that prioritizes sustainability and environmental preservation.  
  
If you're interested in working together to create engaging and inspiring content that connects people with the natural world, please don't hesitate to reach out to me and here's a link of my presentation that i made on youtube.

172xxth,"32F, I’m recovery. Should I take over family real estate biz, get 4yr nursing degree and then be able to become LMFT?","Hey, does anyone know of a career coach? I'm 32F, single mom of 13F. My mom owns a brokerage so naturally I'm a realtor and she is grooming me to be a broker. 

I have a deep yearning to go to nursing school, maybe become a NP. Or with a 4yr degree get a masters in counseling and become a LMFT, which I also always picture myself as a therapist meeting with people and engaging in talk therapy to help them.

Real estate is a hustle, it is 24/7 and the people in the industry are brutal. I started using drugs at 14 and am in recovery now. 

My last relapse, I signed up to be a chemical dependency practitioner but was so newly clean that I didn't have the right systems in place to start school and be able to succeed. It's been 3 years now and I can't shove down the desire to go back to school anymore. 

I have an associates in accounting. I also went to school for massage therapy but my school got shut down right before we could graduate.  Would like to get 4yr degree in nursing, starting with an associate then BS and see how life is then. I could get my masters and go direction of NP or counseling, LMFT. I don't want to waste anymore time. I feel like I'm in a good place.

Anyone have thoughts, experience, advice.
I'm very spiritual, also am in process of becoming yoga teacher, a program I signed up for when I got clean and has truly helped me stay in touch with my emotions. | just don't know if I should stick with real estate only. Sometimes the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. I don't want to let my mom down but I have a resentment towards real estate as my mom was always so busy and lacked the support I needed as a kid and found relief in substance.

I think mv first step is going to be sign up for nursing school and see how it goes. Possibly get CNA first. I love caring for and helping people. I feel like my Life experience has brought me here. I also love the idea of having a set schedule with days off and structure in that sense. Am open to hiring a career coach.

172xr5o,Looking for a breath of fresh air,"Hi folks,

I've been in IT for about 8 years now with a background in Software Dev (mainly backend), Technical and Business Consulting. My current job title say Product Owner. But, as many of you may relate to, I'm wearing multiple heads due to my SMB employer is unstructured, has no DevOps culture (or any methodological culture). Most people in my team including me are overworked and basically have no time to work on themselves, their education and certifications. Or even on things like making infrastructure more reliable and sustainable and it feels like the whole company is just disregarding any practical MO because special snowflake.

As you can tell, I am describing a very toxic work environment that I absolutely need to break out of because it really starts hurting my mental health in some capacity. This is why I want a new take on my professional path moving forward. 

I am currently getting my ITILv4 and PO/SM certifications done. But I really want to get more into DevOps on an engineering level with plans of moving into a lead role within the next 2 years.

I am currently working and living in Germany, but I am open to move abroad. For example, I recently employed the thought of working somewhere in the greater Cairo region because I'm fascinated by Egyptian history (Cairo being a special kind of ball game on many levels for sure, that's a different conversation entirely). Having such tremendous landmarks and history right outside my doorstep is an intriguing thing to me. I have not travelled all that much in my 37 years on this planet and I really want to do more of that. I'm German native and fluent in English. Never been the best with other natural languages, but open to learn new things all the time.

All that and probably more made me think of the more basic things I could come up with first, like but not limited to (no particular order):
 
- public security
- public infrastructure (transportation, connectivity, supermarkets, medical, etc.)
- general quality of living (pollution, green spaces, population density, etc)
- general cost of living/financial stuff (renting vs buying, medical care/insurance, taxes, salary, insurances, etc)
- ...

I am hoping to find:
- a company with a great culture and a work environment embracing people, cultural exchange, Agile Methodologies
- an employer that values hands-on mindset
- obviously better pay (currently €60k p.a., aiming for €75k-85k)
- a great and somewhat clean cityscape
- POIs in proximity to do regular road trips, expeditions or just casual exploring
- ...

I've been sitting in the same place for too long and I want to make new experiences professionally as well as personally.

Have you been in a similar spot and needed change? What did you do? For someone looking for a more drastic change, what would you recommend looking into (countries/cities, career path, company-related, whatever you can think of)?

Do you have friends that were stuck and through some change managed to improve their situation a lot? 

I'm interested in your thoughts, ideas, recommendations and advice in any capacity. I'm not specifically looking for job opportunities, but for a new perspective to life and work.

172wp34,What am I doing wrong?,"Hi guys,

I'm in my mid-30s and I'd like to know how I can improve my career. 

I started in retail management for a couple years, I hated it so quit and became an expat and went to Japan via the JET program. This is basically an English teaching job and not a real career job.

After doing that for a few years, I became a recruiter in Tokyo for a couple years. Via that job, I got my current job which is working as a BA in tech company. It's now been 2 years.

The problem is my current company isn't profitable, is on hiring freeze, and its a madhouse inside - I don't see any real learning happening and there is no chance i'll be promoted.

Since I have changed my career a few times, I don't know how to create a throughline for my CV and for recruiters to actually tie in all the things I've learned. I don't want to start over again, so I'd like to commit to my career. I'd like to be able to have learning + upward mobility and increase my salary.

In addition, it feels like I'm so junior basically applying with only 2 years of my most recent job experience. But I really want to use in someway all the experience I have in the past. 

Is this possible or is my career ruined?",CareerFailure1,1,1.0,0,1696763856,2023-10-08 11:17:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/172wp34/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,10,2023

Due to personal reasons, I haven't worked yet. However I need to get a job soon. I still have little bit of savings which I can use for some courses or further education. I live in India.

Unfortunately I don't remember literally anything from my engineering degree as it's been 10 years I haven't used it .....

I had a few programming subjects which I found interesting and easy during my education. Hence thinking about trying to study data science/ analytics.

Is there anyone who actually is working as data scientist or data analytics who can give me some advice regarding this? 

Is it a good field? How is the future scope? Can I get into it after 10 years of gap? Any good courses which might help? 

M.Tech will take a long time as I will first need to study for entrance and then 2 years of actual course. Approx 3 years. I am not sure if I can survive 3 years on my savings and pay for it as well.

However still if that's the best option, I might take that risk. I just need some guidance about how to go about it. How to make a career and not just get a dead end job?

172vco6,When should I tell my boss about my career plans?,"Hey everybody! I am 25 years old and currently live in North Carolina and have a great opportunity available in Washington state. I am familiar with that region of the country because I was born in Canada and lived in Washington for 6 years. I much prefer the climate out there and everything about this job and opportunity overall are telling me to take the jump.

  
There are phases to process. I passed the initial application and now I have to take a civil service test on Tuesday. If I pass that part I will then have to fly back out to Washington another time to complete an oral board interview, polygraph, fingerprinting, etc.

  
Should I tell my boss in-between the phases granted I get to move forward? Should I wait until after that so there is more certainty?

  
I absolutely love where I work and who I work with but what I am doing now does not allow me to grow the way I would like to. Additionally, I am feeling very stressed because I do not have very many friends but I always keep a small, tight circle (you and your dirty minds lol). One of them is a girl that I work with. She knows I have feelings for her and aside from that, she is a genuinely amazing person. We connect and get along on so many levels and I would feel sad about leaving her. We've hung out away from work and are always texting or talking on the phone. I am also one of her only friends which I think this is bothering her too since I told her what I am doing.

172v68q,"Stressed, fed up, overloaded, need advice","Background:

* I have >10 years of professional experience working online, for a very wide variety of businesses in a decent variety of industries.
* In this time, only once have I done business with a company that would make an effort to do things in line with the law. Most companies - at least online - act as if they're in the Wild West, where anything goes.

But none of what I've seen before could have prepared me for the company I am with right now. 

* More than half of our employees are from third world countries (mostly Pakistan, but also India, Philippines, and a few folks from the poorer EU countries - Lithuania, Romania, Estonia).
* All of those are misclassified as contractors, based on IRS criteria.
* Despite them being from outside the US, the company entirely dismisses the legal necessity of abiding by the labor laws of their respective countries.
* Contracts are extremely predatory, outright stating that:
   * the company *does and will* arbitrarily withhold wages that are due,
   * the company can fire anyone at any time for any reason,
   * if the employee quits, they *must* give notice, and they'll only be paid if they fully complete their assigned tasks *and* train their replacement,
* Timesheets are being ""adjusted"", every time without fail, as a matter of both written and unwritten policy. 
   * Written: Wages are only paid for time during which a person is 'clocked in'... not for the day, but for every individual task they've been assigned. And these souls have to *prove* that they spent time working, so the managers can ""justify"" paying them in the first place.
   * Unwritten: If an employee takes too long, doesn't meet KPI's, managers are instructed to directly adjust the timesheets.

There's more, but this is just the most obvious issues. As you can see, the very foundation of the business is criminal.

This is severely affecting my mental health. I know I have to get out as soon as possible but that's where I run into issues. I can't do that until I have something else lined up.

**How do I find a company that will genuinely understand and respect the law?** I'm not even asking for a kind team culture here, just a business that won't have me staying awake at night feeling horrible for contributing to it. 

**Where are these unicorn companies that won't make me feel like I'm selling my soul do the devil?**

172refi,I failed to study electrical engineering formally but somehow still managed to land the career I wanted. Should I go back to school to get a formal degree in engineering?,"
Apologies if this isn’t the right sub.  I’ll save you the long boring story.   The TL;DR is that I failed to get into an electrical engineering program due to GPA not being high enough when I was transferring from community college.  I ended up graduating with a bachelors in math degree from a low ranked school.  This entire college period was 9 years of my life.  I luckily landed a full time job as an embedded software engineer with over 3 years of experience now.  My long and short term goal is to keep working this job.  

Heres the issue with my situation:

Based on conversations with other people and past interviews and interactions with coworkers, I don’t think people like that I don’t have the “right degree/background”.  This is despite the countless hours I’ve spent learning programming and basic electronics on my own and the fact that I am capable enough to keep my job for 3 years and can quickly learn and pick up new information/knowledge/skills , despite not having formally education.  

So, I get the sense that finding the same job at a different company will be very difficult, if not impossible.  The odds are stacked against me because in a situation where my competitors have formal engineering degrees, those people will be picked over me.  So, I don’t know that continuing my current projectory will be fine long term.

I am traumatized by school.  My original failure to get the original degree I wanted really destroyed my self-confidence and esteem and frankly, I’m not sure that I would succeed if i went back to school.  Despite this, I’ve been thinking strongly about trying to pursue a degree in electronics again.  People told me to pursue grad school even though i dont have a relevant bachelors.  Its an uphill struggle due to not having a relevant bachelors, transcripts are a mess, and me having the following stats: 

overall gpa:  3.27/4.0
core gpa:      3.45/4.0
university gpa:   3.65/4.0


What would you recommend given my situation?  Is it possible to get into ECE engineering grad school with my stats?

I don’t expect any responses.  It just sucks to be this disliked/hated that people don’t even want to provide advice.",NoBrightSide,2,1.0,9,1696743874,2023-10-08 05:44:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/172refi/i_failed_to_study_electrical_engineering_formally/,10,2023
172q8r3,Is my gut feeling about UX valid?,"I’m a senior in high school. I like coding type stuff, and I like design and psychology, so naturally that drew me towards wanting to do a career in UX. I would probably major in graphic design. That would be my only reason for doing so. 

However, I keep reading articles on it, and it‘s driving me away from the career.   
1. The way UX is explained through presented in text and graphics makes it seem like a soulless and greedy job. I can’t quite put my finger on it. 

2. There’s so many buzzwords that all mean the same thing, or take something extremely simple and try to make it seem esoteric. ”Personas”, “user flows”, “wireframes”, and god forbid you forget the difference between a UX Designer, Digital Product Designer and Web Designer. Shut up. If they are different, it’s only slightly. 

3. If the article is on the design itself, they always assume the user is a complete idiot, which is part of the reason I feel like social media is shortening our attention spans. They’re always like “the user won’t be able to read this!!!1!” Yes they can. They’re just impatient because they’ve been conditioned into being that way. 

4. Social media literally ruined my life and I no longer post anything (besides here like every month and some weird non-addictive niche websites that look like they were made in 2009) so knowing I might be ruining other people’s lives in the same way makes me want to puke. I already had this concern beforehand but just sort of put it in the back of my mind because “passion” and salary and whatever. 

Also the job is less technical than I imagined, I guess. 

But I also sort of hate software development for the same reasons above. That and the fact I hate robotics team (it’s the subject and the people, who can’t even wash their hair most of the time. They literally give me a migraine with how bad they smell).   
I don’t know what to do since math can literally die and I have eh grades in math (so no engineering) and I’ll never be patient enough with people to do something like healthcare, psych or business. I also like biology but I’m squeamish and I don’t want to spend 10 billion years in school or be a lab tech. Don’t ask me if I want to be a lab tech. The answer is no.   
I have a passion for art and writing but I feel like I have more to offer people (and myself) than that. I’m not majoring in that stuff because they feel more like hobbies that could turn into jobs with luck. 

Sorry. I have literal diagnosed OCD about trying to find the answer to what I’ll do when I’m older, that and my hair. I’m not joking.   
It also feels like I’m somehow wasting potential if I don’t do a job that involves coding, but I have a feeling I will have many reasons to hate that. There’s just so many cons stacked up against it.

172p56x,How do I help my disabled mother find a job?,"I apologize if this is not the right place to ask.  
My mother (49) came to Canada 15 years ago, and since then, she's been working in quality control (labour), for as long as I can remember. She's always been dependent on my father (an asshole), who keeps her under his foot. She's always struggled. Two years ago, she started developing signs of severe arthritis and tendinitis in her leg. In the beginning, she wasn't able to stand for even a second. Over the past two years, she's been trying to rest and recover, but it hasn't gone anywhere. She has had two PRP injections and it's made a difference, but nowhere near what she's required to do for her job. She also has the same condition in her arm. This woman has done absolutely everything for me, and I remember her having a breakdown while cooking not too long ago because she couldn't even stand to make dinner. Her English speaking/writing skills are not the best, she's never used a computer before, can't drive because of complex eye problems, and has always been dependent on my father for LITERALLY everything, always has tendinitis in her arm, and now her legs. Her two-year disability time is almost up (about 3 months remaining), and she is not fit for that job. And at this point, I don't think she's fit for any job at this point. I'm really stuck and have no idea what to do, I really want to help her but I don't know where to start and who to go to. She has a masters in accounting from India, but my understanding is that such education wouldn't be valid here. I can't handle her constantly crying and overthinking anymore, and I need help with this situation. Does anyone have any advice?

I Hope thats clickable :/ 

Quick intro: I’ve worked in a bunch of unrelated jobs in different sectors and I’m finally ready to stick to an industry to grow my career. I feel intensely worried that since I haven’t got any formal titles related to marketing that I won’t be able to land a stable position. Trying not to be discouraged but the rejections with not even a single interview is really not helping.

172nr9o,"This week, I declined a job I really wanted and have reconsidered.","Hello,

TL;DR: I rejected an ambiguous job offer this week from a major institution I would love to work at primarily because of economic fear. I emailed two supervisors this morning asking if the position was still available, and I met someone who worked there who reached out to one on my behalf today. Would it be overkill to reach out to the recruiter who extended the offer through what *may* be her email (found on weird website) and a recruiter who set up the interview by phone as well, or would that be overkill and I should see what happens? For context, the offer came from a no-reply email, but appeared to come from the head recruiter... So no one recieved my ""I am so grateful but have accepted another offer, thank you so much,"" reply. I only realized after I bit the bullet and decided I should at least ask if the position was still available today (I had to inspect the email and go to the info that is hidden to see it was named, but no-reply.)

FULL: 

I graduated with a BS a few months ago. At the time, my dream was to go into research. After hundreds of rejections and interviews where I was subjected to (sometimes illegal,) insults, I got demotivated. I began to apply for another industry. After a few months of searching a stressing out about finances, I got a job in industry B alost immediately. It's not *terrible*, and the office seems great, but I found out the managers lied to me about a few things (including reimbursing me for some things, conditions of salary, and the outside positions policy.) But, I was glad someone offered me a job and seemed to really want me to join the team. I have the chance to make a good salary and buy another home sooner than I may be able to at company A. 

Company A is very large and prestigious. They did not call me to tell me I got the job. They sent out the job offer at 7 pm and I didn't see it until the next night as a result. The deadline to accept or deny was the next day. I was shocked that the offer was extended. Moreover, that the offer letter was ambiguous about the length of my time there, my benefits, hours, and other conditions of my employment. I showed the offer letter to my boyfriend, who had no input, and my grandparent, who was as confused as I was about the terms of the letter. There were no phone numbers on it, and as I said, I did not realize my reply email respectfully and gratefully declining went to a no-reply email because the footer said it was from the head recruiter. I clicked decline in the system, so they were alerted I declined, but not through words and thank-yous. I regretted the decision immediately, but the next day, Wednesday, I really knew I messed up. I tried to swallow that feeling. 

For context, I don't have parents. I share bills with my grandparent and own a home. I'm worried I wouldn't know what my hours were, may not qualify for benefits as the offer letter stated, and would potentially be homeless again in one year if anything happened with my job or grandparent. My extpected termination date on the letter was 2024, but then it said up to four years, and then other ambiguous things that seemed to stretch and cut that one year. Even so, the feeling that I should have made that leap so I could do research ate me up and continues to eat at me. I hate how my decision was fear-based and dictated by the fact that I don't have parents and a childhood bedroom to go back to if anything happened. ( am aware not everyone has that, but everyone who had been able to get a job after college in NYC who got laid off making videos about going home to their parents made a lasting impression on me knowing I don't have that safety net.) I know I have so much to contribute to that field (health research,) and getting into it is time-limited after leaving university. 

I sent an email to the person who interviewed me inquiring if the position was still available and let them know I had reflected and would like the opportunity to accept it again if the role is unfilled. I only have that because it was linked to the Zoom account that owns the link a different recruiter sent me. I also sent an email to the supervisor listed on my offer letter. I just found the phone number of the different recruiter who originally reached out to me and her name. I also found online on a weird website what may be the email of the recruiter who extended the offer letter, but it may not actually be her email. 

In addition, I had some luck today and spoke with someone who knows the supervisor who interviewed me. She sent him a message about me! I am forever grateful for the kind strangers I have met recently. 

My question is if I should email the recruiter who extended the offer (from an email I found on a weird website that may not be hers,) and the recruiter who originally reached out to me for the interview. by phone. I also want to ask what you think my chances are that I may be hired in the future in this position or others given the situation. I feel that I really messed up, but I also recognize that how/when the letter was sent, its ambiguity that scared me, and the contact information I had did not set me up for success.

172m7mh,"37yo single mum wanting to change careers. Australian Border Force, or TA/PA/EA?","Hi Advicees! I need some solid career advice.

I'm 37 years old (f) and have been running my own hairdressing business for 8 years. While the income is good, it's taking a toll on my work-life balance. I work 6 days a week, 7 days during school holidays, which leaves little time for my 7-year-old daughter. As a single mum, I'm seeking a significant career change and would appreciate solid advice.

Considering my strengths and experience in running all aspects of my business, I believe I would excel as a team assistant, personal assistant, and eventually an executive assistant, handling tasks like organizing, data entry, administrative work, and booking meetings and flights. Which I believe I would enjoy with the ability to grow both professionally and personally.

However, I've also applied for a position with the Australian Border Force recruits, which I'm passionate about. I've progressed to the next recruitment round, but I'm concerned about the lower starting wage, beginning at $54,000 in the first year and rising to $61,000. At this rate, I may need to continue hairdressing on weekends, which wouldn't improve my work-life balance. Even at the highest Border Force wage, I'd still need a side income. Why is the Border Force wage so low?

A team assistant's salary might start at $55,000-$60,000, progressing to $65,000-$75,000 as a personal assistant, and ultimately reaching $90,000 as an executive assistant—my long-term goal. In the first year, as an entry-level assistant, I might still need to cut hair on weekends, but as I advance, I could fully quit my business, regaining work-life balance. My aim is to work in the government sector, where I believe there are better incentives and diverse opportunities, potentially offering more income than the private sector.

I'm torn between these two options: Border Force or administrative roles in TA/PA/EA. Any advice or feedback on these roles or my situation would be greatly appreciated. 
This decision will shape my career until retirement. 

If anyone works for the Australian Border Force or as a PA/EA, I'd love to connect with you!",nobraclubb,2,1.0,8,1696727138,2023-10-08 01:05:38,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/172m7mh/37yo_single_mum_wanting_to_change_careers/,10,2023

172kpya,"Laid Off, Out of Money, and Seeking Direction in My Dev Career.","I'm going through a challenging situation. At 21 years old, I am a programmer, and I recently resigned from the company I was working for. Even though I was performing mid-level and senior tasks, I was still classified as a junior. The HR had a complicated policy and was not willing to promote me, so the plan was to keep me as a junior, even with the increasing workload. Even my boss believed I was in a mid-level position. I decided to leave due to feeling undervalued by the company.  
I had some savings, but they've run out. In the interim after my departure, the tech industry experienced a significant downturn in my country, with many professionals being laid off. Although confident in my skills, after three months, I have not found a new position. Currently, I'm without money, unemployed, and with bills to pay.  
During this time, I developed and published a game, which was a study project. This project led me to decide on an indie developer career path. However, I need to find a source of income to survive at the moment. Although I believe I am a skilled professional, I haven't been successful in the interviews I've undergone, and I think my age might be a factor.  
Sadly, I don't have a strong network of contacts, making it even more challenging to find new opportunities.

172jt0y,Not Understanding the Basics as a Naive Introvert,"I guess this is more a warning than anything else. If you're a shy, introverted person, you may feel like you're fighting for your career more than other people. 

  
I didn't know this going into the workforce that promotions and switching teams can be so complicated. I naively thought, hey if I don't get fired and I stay at this entry (more like intern) level position for 3+ years, my manager will eventually promote me out. 

  
But no, that is absolutely not how it works at all. You actually have to have that heart-to-heart discussion with your manager that you don't want to be on a career-limiting team. They won't be the ones mentoring you or caring about your career. I know this sounds obvious maybe to everyone else, but when you're socially stunted, the career rules aren't as obvious. And hey maybe there's some fellow socially stunted people on reddit that need to hear that. 

  
The only way I finally got the opportunity to move to a career growing position was once I put in my two weeks notice. Once I told my managers I quit, they were willing to schedule meetings to discuss my career goals and what I want out of the company. 

  
But at that point, I was scared of the company and the skeleton crews that remained (was often working 9 to 9). So I left without having a job lined up. Now I realize it doesn't matter what projects I contribute to independently, not being actively employed in this market I kind of shot myself in the foot. 

  
Are there any books that help introverted people understand the hidden rules of the workforce? I didn't even know the ""job gaps have to be less than 6 months"" rule until a little while ago. So maybe even the basics would be useful.

172hv2i,Would I be stupid for starting over?,"Hi, I'm in a situation right now that I don't really know how to go forward with. I'm 25 and work as a sewing Machinist in a factory earning a decent wage for what I do, at the start of September my flat flooded and the stress has caused me to have a severe anxiety attack at work and was reprimanded for it, there is basically no understanding of my situation or mental health. Due to the extent of my anxiety and mental issues I haven't been back at work since this incident and when we manage to find a new place to live I plan on getting a new job. This isn't the first time I've had issues at this workplace but I completed my apprenticeship there which I had to fight so hard to finish. Aside from my apprenticeship I have a HNC in Creative digital media (equivalent to  level 4/first year university level qualification), sewing is my true passion though so I left studying media in order to pursue an apprenticeship at a low wage. My problem is there aren't many jobs around that I can access at the pay ai need, most of the jobs require a commute that I can't do since I have no car (they ask for evidence of this) or are paid much lower than my current salary. I knew I would Essen be taking a paycut regardless since I currently work a street away from my workplace and the majority of other jobs would need at least a train or bus journey and I don't drive. My other option is I find work in another area like admin or sales but I would effectively be starting over and abandoning the education I fought so hard for. My girlfriend said she'll support me no matter what but would be disappointed if I gave up my training and what I really wanted just to support her but right now I don't see another way around it without losing some of our already low income.

Disorganized and each team seems to be doing their own thing. This has lead to a lot of gaps in service offerings and I am often found stepping in to satisfy our clients. It seems there are always promises to further develop teams and products to fill these gaps, but nothing has really changed in the past few years. If I could do only the tasks within my job title, I would be completely satisfied - it’s an analytical role. I love my team and what I do. I’ve been on multiple teams at this company with an average raise of 5k a year. 

The other company is offering around 80k for an account management role. The increase in pay would allow me to do many things I’ve been pushing off. Benefits are comparable, fully remote, but I’m unsure of the work life balance which is very important to me. I’d essentially be the liaison for a portfolio of clients, managing all requests, concerns and questions. I’d be wearing a lot of hats and would be building relationships with each account. Similar to what I’m already doing, but without the analytical side of things (which is what I enjoy the most). There is potentially the option to move to another team once I become familiar with the new company’s products/processes, but it could take a year or so.

172h5mh,My boss has resigned.,"I work in IT for a small/medium sized construction company in the UK. The IT department consists of just me and my boss who resigned last week. My boss as well as being the IT manager is also the operations manager and is deeply involved in many parts of the business, particularly in contracts and tenders. My role is software development and providing IT support, I've developed a system that the company now heavily relies on for its day-to-day operations. I've also had a few large pay increases since developing this system, which I think shows that they don't want to lose me.

I've worked at the company for six years now and my manager has been there from the start. I've been happy in my role, but this will mean a big change and I feel worried about what happens next. I'm expecting that they will ask me to take over as IT manager, but I don't want his other role in operations which was the majority of his job. I did basically all of the IT work, he just set the strategy and approved purchases. When other people have resigned in different departments they are often not replaced, other staff take on the work instead.

Im also an independant contractor in digital marketing with one main client who is amazing to me. With some freelancing on the side.

So That main client is also in the same exact industry as my mentor, they're almost competitors but not exactly.

Then next call she says she can do the calander herself and thanked me for my idea. I felt uncomfortable with that.

Then when it came for the coaching design she told me I can create it and it would be a commission/freelance so basically I would create the package for free and ONLY get paid if anyone purchases. That sounds like a waste of time to me. Then I suggested hourly and she kind of stuttered and said ""ok well if you want hourly, I need to see your work and judge based on that"" so she's fine with me doing this for free but wants to see my work to get paid hourly. This bothered because it feels like she just wants to use me for as cheap as possible and also bc of who my other client is .

172d22n,Update 3: Got thrown under the bus by my boss - Happy update!,"He's leaving!!!!!!!!!! 

Thank you so, so, so much to all the advice y'all gave me. Last month was extremely stressful, but I think some of the perspective on here really saved my ass.

Over the past few weeks, my boss's boss has been getting more involved with us, with all 3 of us having like 3-4 status meetings for projects a week. During these meetings my boss would rarely speak. At this time, I was like, ""why isn't he doing anything to improve the communication between us?"" It was extremely stressful and I actually cleaned up my resume because I was like, I can't work with this man.

So last week he started getting even *more* less communicative towards me, ignoring even more emails from me to him and canceling meetings with just him and I. Then last Friday, I don't what happened, but his boss reached out saying that day's status meeting would just be him and I, \[boss\] wasn't able to attend. I was like, ""is something going on??"". I was even thinking maybe he got fired since it was a Friday.

But then we met first thing Monday morning where he told me he was leaving and put in his 2 weeks!!! He was going to take a step back and focus on other endeavors. Then I met with his boss during our status meeting later that day (that my boss didn't show up to), and he told me starting the next week, I was going to report into another director at the company. Based on my convo with him, it seems like my boss did put in his notice, but maybe he got put on a PIP or was going to be demoted? I feel like something was going on.

So this past week even though I was still reporting to him, my boss canceled/didn't show to any meetings. But my new director (who's been with the company and his department is very similar to what I do) has been stepping in and it's been AMAZING. It's literally night and day. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted.

I think the advice here to email my boss's boss showing my accountability really helped. I also got extremely lucky that my boss's boss is competent and helpful. I think in 95% of cases, this could have ended badly for me. But thank you to all here during this stressful saga.

172a9fp,What kind of work can I do?,"I'm a lawyer in a specialised and fairly niche field. I'm currently in a pretty senior role however I am getting burnt out and thinking of quitting. I am still paying off my mortgage so I can't quit without another job lined up. The work itself is fairly mundane, mostly reviewing documents and filling in forms, but dealing with clients and managing their expectations is quite draining. My work involves getting results which will change the course of people's lives so the stakes are pretty high, as is the level of stress. The worst part of the job is the billing target, which is sometimes hard to reach because clients are unpredictable and don't always pay their bills on time. Recently, management have increased the billing target by around 30% which is unfair because we're expected to do more work for the same pay. It's affecting my health and it's not sustainable for me to stay in this role.

I am looking for options for alternative jobs which still pay well but will not cause me stress-related health issues. I'm good at research and analysis, and explaining complex concepts in simple terms. I'm good with hard data. Not so good at dealing with people. I have the ability empathize and have bedside manners, but I'd rather not play therapist or try to save people. It's too exhausting. I'd be happy to research and write reports if I didn't have to answer the phone and people just left me alone to do my work. Also, I hate meetings and I don't like working with other people. I find people draining.

Open to all suggestions. Thank you.",woshixiwangmu,2,1.0,3,1696695778,2023-10-07 16:22:58,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/172a9fp/what_kind_of_work_can_i_do/,10,2023

17298dd,"Am I too old for a bachelor’s degree at 28, and will companies disqualify me for entry-level jobs?","Hi everyone, currently I am 25 years old and back in school post-Covid as a junior in a well-known public business school in the northeast. It took me almost 4 years to get my associate’s degree in community college, and finally in 2020, I was able to pass all my requirements and graduate. I also earned three associate’s degrees in 3 1/2 years there - Political Science, Business, and Liberal Arts. 

After that, I briefly attended a different school that I didn’t like in spring 2021, but it was all online due to Covid and I hated it. So I dropped out and got into Tech sales, but was let go due to performance issues. I had some really crappy experiences in Tech sales with really shitty people, so I took time off for my mental health and that was a year pretty much from 2022- to beginning of 2023. 

Earlier this year 2023, I found out that I had enough credits and grades to transfer to one of the best public business schools in my state. Now I’m a junior, but I’ll probably be around 27 or 28 by the time I finish my bachelor’s. My question is, will top companies and employers in fortune 500’s and other well known companies think I’m too old to be recruited and hired? I’ve heard that before. 

Currently, I’m taking general business core classes while I decide on a major. I’m considering Finance, Management Information Systems, or Supply Chain Management. Unfortunately, I can’t major and minor due to my college’s policies. If I double major it might take me three years or seven semesters. At this point, I just want to get out of college. Any advice would be welcomed.

17294xw,Unhappy with my career and education choices,"I (25f) am extremely unhappy with my career decisions and path. I thought I was going to be ok with my career after my masters, but I have an overwhelming sense of dread thinking about how it will be for the rest of my life, or even just years of working what I do. For background, I have an associates degree in liberal arts, bachelors degree in education (multi subject), and recently graduated with a Masters in MFT. I love helping others, but the fact is, I get paid per client (at most jobs, except the overworked government jobs, which I already know I will get burnt out in very quickly) and if the clients don’t show, or cancel, I lose out on that money (which is not much at all). And at the location I’m at, we’re not getting that many call ins, and the referrals are going to several others in the office as well. Im supposed to be earning hours towards licensure, but I’m barely making that as well. And the hours are bad too (only a couple hours in the afternoon/evening and now im having to work weekends as well). I also HATE teaching large classroom sizes as kids these days are so terrible to authority, especially in group settings. 

What other fields/careers can I look into with this experience/education without having to go back to school. I can’t afford the time or money to do so. I want something that I can support myself on and hopefully be able to save, as I’m barely scraping by now even with roommates. I’m really desperate but I want to make at least more than minimum wage- which I don’t get responses from those jobs as well, due to lack of experience/too high of education.",Personal_Accident295,2,1.0,0,1696692759,2023-10-07 15:32:39,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17294xw/unhappy_with_my_career_and_education_choices/,10,2023

17263k3,Need help negotiating my schedule… hiring manager said one thing and is now saying another!,"Hi everyone! 

I recently applied for a position that was posted as M-F. There was another same position open for a Tues-Sat schedule for weekend coverage but I deliberately did not apply for this one. I’ve been working every weekend for the past 2 years and explained to the manager that I don’t want to do that anymore, and that’s why I applied for the M-F spot. I didn’t want to seem inflexible, so I told her it wasn’t a complete dealbreaker, but something that would heavily sway me in accepting an offer. 

The hiring manager called me extending the offer to me, asking if I still want to work M-F or if I’ve considered the Tues-Sat schedule (comes with a salary incentive). I told her I want M-F as that is what I applied for. 

She tells me that they were hoping to get the Tues-Sat position filled first, and they have a candidate interview scheduled for this upcoming week that is willing to work that schedule. However, if this candidate doesn’t accept/get hired then I will likely have to work tues-sat for a period of time (which she didn’t specify). 

I know they really want to hire me- they talked about how much skill I will bring and that they need me on the team. So, how do I use this to negotiate having my m-f spot without seeming inflexible?! 

TLDR: applied for a m-f position, got the offer, now the manager wants me to work Tuesday-Saturday until they can hire someone who wants to work weekends. How do I negotiate and leverage the fact that they want to hire me to get the schedule I thought I was getting without coming across as inflexible/demanding?

1725npg,Should I quit?,"Should I quit ?

I (27F) am a software engineer at one of the FAANGs in India. I don’t like the work I do and the stack is too internal to be valued outside. And I am stressed a lot. Also I’ve lost the interest in software engineering. I’m not sure if it’s because I’m miserable here.  I used to dream of being an architect . I can’t see myself doing that anymore. Also I don’t think I’m assertive and confident enough to grow into leadership roles. 
 I have always wanted a business of mine. I always assumed I would take that step once I’m financially in better place , probably in late 30s.  I have lately considered doing mba. But again I’m not sure if it’s my brain wanting to run away from the stressful situation which I will encounter everywhere I go. 
My husband is fully supportive of my decision to quit since he doesn’t want me to see me sad and stressed. But I don’t think our parents would be supportive. And I do support my parents financially which husband has agreed to continue. I have another sibling who also supports them so it should be okay. 

But I can’t help but feel it’s gonna be a stupid decision to quit without any other job offer or a college acceptance or anything concrete planned about future. I earn good money in a job most people probably would want.  And I’ve always been independent and love the feeling of doing whatever I want with my money.   Being from middle class the uncertainty with no job is scary, even though I’ve good savings.   And it scares me to make a career change . Also the thought of burdening my husband .

1724nm2,Where do I go from here? (Public Sector),"I need to make a career move relatively quickly. Simply put, I can no longer pay the bills for a family at $60k/year. 

Graduated college in 2016 with a BA in history. Original plan was to go to law school but by sophomore year I decided that starting life $100k or more in debt was bad, so I picked up an econ minor and pivoted my goals to working in financial services. Interned at an insurance company and scored a position in a management training program for a big bank upon graduation. 

Went through the program and came out as an assistant manager at a small branch with the idea that program graduates would be running their own office 12-18 months on. By summer 2019 I was becoming increasingly dissatisfied there. I liked lending but the bank kept pushing sales reps to focus on life insurance products which, given the age and demographics of my client base, was not selling without being a sleazy salesman.

 On top of that I was the last guy in my cohort still not a manager despite being the top performer at my level in my region. All promotions were going to external hires who did not work out. This included my own boss, a girl just older than me who was completely incompetent forcing me to cover for her mistakes and basically train her how to run the office. When I would discuss career progression with leadership, the only feedback id get was ""keep doing what you're doing, your time will come.""

I eventually got fed up. I found a position in state government on their small business lending program. It was in the loan recovery division, but would give me some experience in the underwriting side rather than straight sales. I had always had an interest in working for state government, so I made the move. It was a pay cut at first ($56k to $44k) but went up to $52k after 6 month probationary period. 

Did this for a couple years, eventually we cut our loan delinquencies to near nothing so I got bored and transferred to our grants office. I dont hate the work but, again, its boring and I know I have the capacity to do more. Promotional positions simply do not come up often and, because HR is done out of a central locstion, they may not even pass your resume on to the hiring manager for any kind of arbitrary reason. I just had this happen for what would have been my dream position and didn't even get an interview because I hadn't spent enough time under the right job code. 

Now things are getting urgent thanks to inflation. Bills have doubled since 2020, our union just got us a COL incrwase of 5% which obviously doesn't cover it. I can't feed 3 kids on $60k pay, my wife's part time job is looking more and more full time just to make ends meet. We quickly went from putting $5-600 away monthly to having to draw several hundred from savings just to pay the bills.  It will all be depleted next year at this rate. A part time job for me isn't really an option since she already works evenings and weekends so we don't have to send our kids to daycare. 

So, for those in similar roles, what trainings and credentials can I earn to increase opportunities? I work with lots of people qho have MPAs and they aren't making a dime more than I am, so thst seems like a bad investment of time and money to me. Id rather get technical certifications. Im halfway to a CDFP, but the state won't pay for any additional classes they don't seem immediately relevant to the job I have now. Continuing thst seems to be my first option, but I don't know how much the certification is actually worth since the state itself doesn't seem to put much value in it.

Could always go back to banking, but underwriters are getting laid off left and right. 

Tl;dr: If you had experience in loan sales and underwriting, weren't satisfied with $60k per year, and had the capacity to start earning some certs, what would you do?",Blumpus1234,1,1.0,0,1696679892,2023-10-07 11:58:12,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1724nm2/where_do_i_go_from_here_public_sector/,10,2023

1720za7,Career in Tech vs. Becoming a Lawyer:,"I've been grappling with a major life decision, and I could really use some input from the knowledgeable and diverse group of people here. I'm torn between pursuing a career in Tech/Software Engineering or becoming a lawyer, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on both paths.  
Background:  
I'm currently at a crossroads in my life where I need to make a decision about my career path. I have a strong interest in both technology and law, but I'm having a hard time choosing between them.  
Tech Career:  
On one hand, the tech industry is booming, and there are endless opportunities in areas other than software development, like data science, cybersecurity, and more. The potential for high salaries, remote work, and rapid career advancement is appealing. But I'm concerned about the constant need to keep up with evolving technologies and the demanding work hours that often come with tech roles. As well as rumors surrounding Ageism and Longevity in tech. How older developers seem to age out and get replaced with recent college grads. I also heard the job market in the tech industry is pretty oversaturated as well.  
Law Career:  
On the other hand, becoming a lawyer could also be very lucrative. And allow me to advocate for justice, work on intellectually stimulating cases, and make a positive impact on society. The legal profession offers diverse areas of specialization, such as criminal law, intellectual property, contract law, and more. However, law school can be expensive and time-consuming, and the job market can be competitive. It's also common for Lawyers to work for as long as they want and they don't seem to age out.  
Questions:  
\-Career Stability: How stable is the job market in tech compared to law? Are tech jobs more susceptible to outsourcing or automation? It the tech industry sustainable long-term.  
\-Work-Life Balance: What is the work-life balance like in these fields? Do tech professionals have more flexibility?  
Earnings Potential: Which field generally offers better earning potential in the long run?  
\-Job Satisfaction: Those of you in tech or law, what do you love most about your career, and what are the downsides?  
\-Question for Lawyers: I've heard a lot about lawyers feeling burnt out and losing interest in their career. Which often leads to substance abuse, depression, etc. Given the place you are in your career, Was the juice worth the squeeze? Would you do it again?

171y96n,Slowly giving up on IT,"After many...many tries I'm just losing that motivation especially when I see friends of mine getting into the field with far fewer and/or no knowledge of the IT/CS field it's getting to a point where it's kind of upsetting and demoralizing.

My question is should I continue learning IT maybe someone can give me advice? or just bite the bullet and learn something new?

171vjvj,Expose the dirty secret of job market: Indian consulting companies,"Let me drop some truth on ICC, which, in this case, stands for Indian consulting company. They used to lurk in the tech alleys, but now they’re popping up everywhere. You know those annoying LinkedIn requests? Yeah, they might be from them.  
  
Here’s where it gets juicy: ICC promises to prep you for job interviews and then, hold onto your hats, they deck out your resume with fake experiences! Just graduated? Doesn’t matter! With their touch, you’ll appear like you've been rocking the industry for over 5 years. Sounds like a dream, right?  
  
But wait, there's a snag! Try to walk away, and you'll find yourself trapped with a hefty fee because of some clever contract they roped you into. And they're setting their sights on our young, eager-to-work grads. Once they’ve turned you into a so-called “senior expert,” they strut you in front of clients. The wild thing? Some clients couldn’t care less if that glittering experience is genuine or just glitter, as long as the job's done.  
  
And here’s the kicker: We're now not only battling against those big tech experts who’ve been recently let go but also against our own pals who've been given the ICC Midas touch and a full-on marketing blitz. It’s like stepping into the ring blindfolded!  
  
But no worries! We've got some aces up our sleeves. In this age of AI, tools like ChatGPT and Claude can give our resumes that extra sparkle. And when it's showtime, for those nerve-wracking live interviews? We've got Finalround AI to act as our real-time interview assistant. Game changer!  
  
So, what's your two cents on this ICC saga? Let's stir this pot and share some thoughts! ",Acceptable-Special61,7,0.8999999761581421,3,1696647377,2023-10-07 02:56:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171vjvj/expose_the_dirty_secret_of_job_market_indian/,10,2023

I’ve been struggling to make connections with people in my department. I don’t feel like I fit in. I’ve really tried to be friendly but most of my coworkers have already formed small cliques or I have nothing in common with. For instance, I live a fairly active lifestyle and choose to pack healthy foods for lunch. I’m slimmer than most people there and though I’ve never told anyone that I’m dieting or told others to diet, whenever I eat my lunch in the break room, I’ve had coworkers make comments like “What are you eating” - I tell them - and then they say like oh “I’m eating ramen, probably not the healthiest” and I don’t know what to say because it makes me feel uncomfortable because they must think I’m judging them or by me eating healthy force them in some way to acknowledge their choices in life, and honestly I’m just living my life and I don’t care to judge anyone. But you just know that feeling when someone already has this perceived idea of you and you can’t change it. Also, I never know what to say in those situations other than like a sympathetic “no”. Anyways, I’ve gone the entire day with no one even offering a friendly smile or let alone have anyone spark a conversation with me and one time while leaving at the end of the day,  left my phone at my desk, and went back to retrieve it and startled 3 coworkers who were all by the desk next to me whispering. One coworker in particular I always catch checking on what I’m doing. It’s just a really unfortunate environment considering I had such high hopes for the company and my role. My supervisor and manager of the department I’m in are both females. I asked to speak to HR about a position that opened up and wanted to get feedback if they’d think I’d be a good fit and while in the meeting they asked me is there anything else I wanted to talk about and it just came out like word vomit. I told HR that I feel like I don’t fit in and some things my supervisor did that was rude. Big mistake. There was a whole follow up and I know my supervisor knows it was me that said something and now she’s on me and no one else want to be associated with me. I’ve been applying for other jobs but idk if I can hold out before getting hired somewhere else first. The work environment is toxic and no longer mentally healthy for me.

171rbvf,Advice please on unusual length of suspension and applying for other jobs. **Full details post.**,"
Hello

In EU here.

I am in a very unique situation and don't know where else to turn. 4 years ago I was suspected of committing a criminal act (involving property) at my workplace (a professional regulatory) of which I have worked at for 18 years. I was suspended as a result. I went through a full investigation and cooperated fully; knowing the allegations were false. The case went to court (as I wouldn't admit any wrongdoing as I was innocent ) and I was exonerated after a review of all the 'evidence'. The judge even remarked on my steadfastness and the contrary nature of the prosecution. This was 2 years ago. My employer has continued to suspend me up until present day, as they wish to run an internal process for 'gross misconduct' which to date hasn't materialised. On querying their reasons, I was advised that an exoneration in court doesn't negate an internal investigation and process.

There's always been some form of excuse as to the length of time and delay. Yes I have a lawyer, but it's a union chosen one as I certainly couldn't afford a private. She is very good, however I feel sometimes that I'm just a number (as I'm sure I am).

I feel like I could never return to my previous role now,  I don't actually want to now anyway. When I spoke to HR regarding my potential resignation (as my family/health and my time has suffered enough), I was told that as there is an internal process STILL running, they would have 'no choice' but to advise any potential employers of this. They also pointed out that the internal matter may well progress in any event.

 I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I feel that the length of time this has taken and my suspension over this period has in effect tarnished my name and future prospects. I can't even apply for another job (in my field and experience/qualifications) as a result, and feel like I am a slave awaiting my master's decision as to what to do with me. 

I know you might say 'just wait it out' etc, but I can't and don't want to. I want to move on. It's been long enough and I'm really struggling here. I can't wait around for ever (as I've tried to expedite this and have been told there's no limit on how long an employee can be suspended). I want to move on.

I can't even apply for a job without worrying they will ask about my previous employment, and even then what do I say? 

Sorry for the essay, I just don't know what to do.

Any advice please.",No-Corgi-717,1,1.0,0,1696635310,2023-10-06 23:35:10,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171rbvf/advice_please_on_unusual_length_of_suspension_and/,10,2023

Where you get your degree from DOES matter and you are going to MAKE ALOT MORE MONEY if you go to a top school?,"I posted here repeatedly for the last several weeks to almost two months, making constant burner accounts, raging, venting, and yelling at the void. But I realize that that’s not gonna change anything. It’s not gonna get me the job and the money that I know I deserve. I’m not gonna go to a $70,000 or $80,000 entry-level job offer in a top company or a top internship or co-op in a top Fortune 500 company and supply chain that’s $55,000-$60,000 or more. This is all because I went to a shitty fucking TCNJ - the College of New Jersey. If I would’ve gotten a supply chain degree at Rutgers Business School, I would be working at a top company right now for supply chain, making over $70,000 a year, and probably on my way to making six figures my second year. Everyone here knows that. Honestly, all of my friends who went to Rutgers Business School or Penn State or Michigan State University or MIT, they’re either all making $70-$80,000 entry-level in top companies with just a bachelor’s degree, or they’re making even more, like over six figures a year, $100,000 a year out of college or $120,000. They’re gonna live a very good life. They’re going to have a nice big house. They’re gonna get married. They’re gonna make beautiful babies. And maybe I should just accept that that’s never gonna be my life, just because I have a marketing degree from a fucking bullshit no-name college, because my college is fucking shitty TCNJ. It didn’t even have a supply chain degree or Supply Chain major. Honestly, posting the same thing isn’t going to change anything. Everyone here knows that I’m telling the truth. Like, I don’t want to wait 20 years to finally see $100,000. I want to see $100,000 in two years out of college with a bachelor’s degree, just like people from top schools. And I want to see over $500,000 a year, 20 years into my career, and I want to be wealthy. But I’m not gonna have that because I don’t have a name on my resume. So that’s why the top companies aren’t looking at me or they don’t wanna hire me. It’s pointless, since everyone here just wants to troll me. Like, fuck everyone who went to top schools and who are extremely wealthy right now, making six figures, living in $1 million houses at the age of 29 or younger, or 30.

171nvw7,Seeking Advice on Compensation Structure for Creative Work,"
Hello fellow Redditors,

I have a potential job opportunity, but the payment structure is based on a pay-per-piece model, and I'm seeking some professional advice on how to approach this situation.

The idea is that I'll be creating scenarios and ideas for video advertisements on social media platforms for a company. The company has asked me to submit an offer, and in this offer, I'll outline how many video concepts I can generate, and then propose a price per concept.

At this point, I'm unsure about how to determine the exact euro amount to assign to each individual video idea or if there are alternative compensation methods I should consider. Just to provide some context, the minimum wage in my country is 300 euros, and I am a well-known influencer on social media within my region.

I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or experiences you could share regarding how to structure compensation for creative work in this scenario. Your input will be invaluable in helping me make an informed decision.

171nryv,How screwed am I in Career Trajectory at 20 years old?,"I've been seeing a lot of posts here about income mobility and reaching certain income goals through career advancement and I thought I was in a good spot, but I don't think I am. How can I change that?   


Context:   
I just graduated college in May. Graduated in 3 years so I could start my career early and avoid debt. O graduated from a state (non-target) school.   


I'm now working at a tech company in a sales adjacent non technical role. I interned for this company last year in a similar position and was the first intern in that team and in that part of the company. With this being said, since my department/organization is smaller/less built out, my onboarding experience and job experience has been lack luster and I've been essentially defining my role myself.   


I will start a new role in January, but it will be a lateral move since the current role I have was essentially created for me, so I doubt I will be getting an increase in pay. In my new role, I will be helping manage partners of the company.   


In my current role, I interact with many people that have higher visibility in the company for my projects, so I've been able to network with people that maybe could help uplift me towards a future higher paying role.   


Currently, my stats 60k Base 99k OTE (pooled commission).   


I have a goal of having at least a 100k net worth by 25, I have 34k Net worth and no debt currently...but I don't think I could complete that without reaching at least 100k income as well.   


I also live in a HCOL area (SoCal) and might have to move home next year because I can't afford it here.   


I'm unsure of my career mobility because of the fact that this department is pretty new and there are not direct paths like there might be in Sales for example.   


I also have no technical skills, I essentially relied on my people skills for this role. I like the company and I would like to stay for RSU vesting but I need to know if I will ever even have a good income.   


Especially because I recently read a thread here that it took someone over 12 years to make over 100k when they started out at 60k and that if you don't start out high, you most likely will never make it",jailbreakjock,0,0.3799999952316284,18,1696626427,2023-10-06 21:07:07,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171nryv/how_screwed_am_i_in_career_trajectory_at_20_years/,10,2023

171mh5l,"Feeling Undermined by Colleagues, WWYD?","Hey everyone!

I’ve [F, 24] just graduated from uni and have started my new job in the consulting field a week ago. My company is relatively small but fast growing and we have a small set of new hires who I am currently training with. 

Personality wise, I am quite a chatty and friendly person but I feel like because of my nature, some of the things I say get dismissed or ignored. I fear that I won’t be taken seriously and am even feeling undermined and patronised by comments made by my colleagues. For instance, my colleagues said that I shouldn’t be complaining about something when I merely pointed out that I would need to adjust to a new system that I have no experience with. Additionally, when discussing our leadership team, one of the other colleagues jokingly made very vague, generic but inappropriate comments about me and them. In general, if I make any contribution towards important or normal conversations, they put words in my moutg to change the narrative of what I intend to say to get a reaction from me or the other colleagues. I feel like it’s mostly male dominated and they have a different kind of bond, even though we all joined at the same time. I’m not saying they aren’t nice but I just want to be taken seriously and don’t like feeling small. I do get flustered by situations like this and struggle with being stern or even commanding a certain level of respect in such situations. I feel super conscious and feel a bit isolated when this occurs and that people have formed an opinion about me that isn’t fully reflective of what I am capable of. 

The incidents that have happened have merely been minor and mundane, I can only it getting worse and affecting how I get perceived for my work. I’m very new and would like to establish boundaries and be respected for my work. How can I go about doing that, especially as someone who has just started their career?",iamstan666,3,0.8100000023841858,6,1696623231,2023-10-06 20:13:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171mh5l/feeling_undermined_by_colleagues_wwyd/,10,2023
171l4j5,"I'm 33 with a stunted career, and I'm so lost. What can I do?","Ever since I can remember (which is about age 5, I would say) I have been plagued by self-doubt and anxiety, and I've had the hardest time paying attention to things I am not interested in. If you're thinking that sounds like textbook undiagnosed ADHD, you're right. I fit that burgeoning cliché of the 33-year-old woman who was quiet and well-behaved in school but undisciplined in her studies and would never work to ""live up to her potential."" Like my undiagnosed sisters, I am now an adult who never found a real ""career"" and has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression repeatedly over the years. I did not receive my ADHD diagnosis until about a year ago, and it feels like too little too late.

If my parents had had any interest or investment in me growing up, maybe things would be different now. I was also brutally bullied all through school because I wore outdated clothing from Good Will and I had a childhood autoimmune disease that caused a lot of pain and forced me to walk with a heavy limp. I suppose it's pointless to look back wondering, ""what if..."" I digress.

I barely passed college with a Bachelor's in English (because reading was the only thing I loved - that is, until someone told me I HAD to do it, which always lead to a frustrating paralysis on my part, resulting in many late and mediocre papers). I worked in retail for years. I hated most things about it, but at least I was moving, so it was nearly impossible to be unproductive or ""zone out."" Eventually, I landed a job at a small publishing company, which was part customer service, part data entry and bookkeeping. It was a decent job, but it was so unsatisfying, and once I ""figured it out"" I went from a star employee to constantly making careless mistakes. I just could not apply my entire brain to this dry work. It was like the work and I were two north magnets. I was promoted a couple of times, but I was still constantly worried someone would notice I was lazy and scattered and getting nothing done, so I made a drastic career change. I accepted a new job where I lasted for 2 months before my worst fear finally came true - I was fired.

It's been about six months now, and I haven't been able to find another job. I've been trying to use this time to figure out what I'm passionate about, hoping that one day maybe I can have a job I enjoy... But so many years went by where I was suffocated by self-doubt, crippling Catholic guilt, anxiety, depression, undiagnosed ADHD, and a financial need to prioritize getting my bills paid above any luxuries like enjoying my job. 

I think in circles. I start by making a list of interests. The problem is, it's a list of the wilted interests of my early youth, as I have been too occupied with anxiety and constant self-criticism to find interest in almost anything that may distinguish me or require my full attention since I was about 12. 

So, I go line by line on this list and notice all the ways I can't just go find a job in things like psychology, history, writing, etc. My knowledge and experience took a 20-year break while my mind focused on keeping me absolutely miserable, and I feel like I will never catch up fast enough to become an expert in anything at all. It doesn't help that my unemployed status has me lacking health insurance and therefor access to medication and therapy that may help me.

I am constantly trying to run through neck-deep water, and I'm tired. I don't know how to drain the pool. I wish I knew what straw to pull. Am I meant for anything real at all?

What would you do if you were me? ",DotPuzzleheaded1239,8,0.8500000238418579,4,1696619904,2023-10-06 19:18:24,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171l4j5/im_33_with_a_stunted_career_and_im_so_lost_what/,10,2023

171kbhj,Need help navigating WFH negotiations in a job offer,"I, (F 25) received an opportunity   that I have really really been gunning for the last two years to work  within the defense industry as a financial analyst. During the Interview the hiring manger indicated that there would be some remote work and some in office work. They were unsure of the percentage as they were waiting for direction from upper leadership. They indicated it wouldn't be more than 50% either way. They also kept emphasizing how flexible they are with work schedules and circumstances. I received an offer about a week later and accepted. Days later after accepting the offer I was informed that it was going to be two days on site. 

This is a bit of a problem for me. First of all, I currently live over 50 away from the office (1.5hrs to be exact) and was not offered relocation in my offer. I know the company has offered other employees who live over 50mi away from office an option to stay fully remote or be exempt from the in work requirement. 

My other problem is my partner who is a pilot (a job that offers no remote flexibility) just accepted a new job that he has also worked very hard to earn, and we just found out he is being relocated over 1500miles away.

How do I go about negotiating mostly telework work? I am more than willing to commute in 2-4 times a month as I find in-person work very valuable for developing interpersonal relationships within the organization. I have experience in all my previous roles working mostly remote, only reporting in office 2-4x a month. Further, I completed my graduate degree completely online during covid where I excelled and actually graduated cum laude. I know how to be an effective and efficient team member in a remote environment given my years of prior experience.

My worry: I have already ask for more money and received it, so I just do not want to come off as unpredictable or ungrateful for the oppurtunity as it is one I worked very hard to earn. However, I do not want to sacrifice my long-term relationship (its an awesome one, I really cherish it). But this opportunity is one I really really really do not want to give up or lose as it offers exciting work, 4 day work weeks, and most importantly the opportunity to really flourish and contribute meaningfully to a mission i deeply belive in.

171jn50,Job Counter Offer Advice,"Hey all,

Just wanted some advice on how to approach a counter offer. Background:

Applied for the job in August and the posting had a range of 59 - 119k. I did not have the exact experience they required because of the specialty but did meet the general requirements and experience.

Had 30 min phone interview first with the HR/recruiter. He asked my salary demands and I told him 92k and then he told me their range is 80-95k which made me happy. He did say my demands were on the higher side but since it was in their range I didn't think much of it beyond that.

Then I did two seperate interviews with the direct manager and then with the directors. Both interviews, IMO, were probably one of the best I've ever had. Fast forward a day from my 3rd interview and I get the offer BUT they offered me 75 with 5-6k year bonus.

I told them to send me the paperwork and I would think on it over the weekend. I am 100% going to ask for more but I wanted to ask how I should approach it. Call or email? Stick to my initial figure or go a little lower? I do not consider a bonus part of my salary because it is not guaranteed so in my eyes their offer is 75k right now. I wouldn't deny 88k but I am sort of annoyed at their 75k offer.

Kinda venting, sorry. LONG POST. 

-Rude coworkers who sound angry all the time, and extremley negative. Had interactions like:
Me: ""How was your weekend?""
Coworker: ""I don't need to tell you what I do on my day off"". Im scared to talk to my coworkers cause I do not know if I'm going to get yelled out or if it's going to be light hearted/normal conversation. So I just don't talk or bearly leave my desk (just to do the basics). 

-This also means I'm scared to ask for help, cause again, I dont what sort of answer I might get or ""you should now that already/stop asking questions/figure it out yourself.""

-Some mails are time sensitive, I was told to HOLD MY PEE during that time frame, cause I can't miss them. 

-Since i got here I've been wondering if I have some sort of disability or mental incapacity (I'm not saying this to offend anyone), cause I've been also repremended that I'm not serious or profesional. Example, I made a mistake, and I said ""Oops sorry! l'll correct it now!"" [which i did], I was told I'm not profesional enough. In my limited work experience and education, never have I ever faced any sort of disiplinary action. I do consider myself quite cheerful. 

-These things make me scared to speak on the phone in the name of the buissness (for example talk on the phone with a client), or even write emails that go beyond the copy-paste template, cause I do not know how I'm expected to treat people. If I'm too nice I'm scared I might come off as unprofessional. 

-I'm not allowed to make any mistakes. And I do make a lot, cause I'm hella anxious here. And mistakes are treated as the end of the world, and get yelled at for them. 

I want to quit. I really do. At the same time, im scared I will struggle to find a job. My work experience has been interships and this is my ""first real job"" out of collage. 

Two questions then:
-Is the job toxic or it's just me who is sensitive?
-Should I quit despite not having anything lined up? Money is not an issue at the moment, I just want experience rn.

We have a new Marketing Director starting in two weeks and the VP is still telling me that she wants to change my responsibilities and transform my role.

171fuxv,Struggling to find a career path with your college major? Here’s what to do.,"Hi! There are so many college students and recent college grads that I’ve interacted with through this subreddit who are experiencing challenges either finding work or figuring out what they want to do in their career. 

I was in the same boat when I graduated college. It’s not easy. It’s extremely stressful, and it can very easily make you feel lost, deflated, and depressed.  

So I wanted to share some tips that have helped me and hopefully they can provide some assistance to you too:

**1. Identify your transferable skills:** I know, I know. You’re probably thinking “I don’t have any skills to offer.” That’s not true. Even if you don’t believe it, you did learn some valuable skills in college: project management, communication, writing, decision-making and analytics (quantitative or qualitative) are all very in-demand skills. 

**2. Build a portfolio:** If you don’t have enough work experience, the best thing you can do is build a portfolio to showcase that you can apply your skills to solve real business problems. The projects in your portfolio don’t have to be directly related to the job you are applying for (although if you have some, that definitely helps), but you do need to explain how they might apply. 

**3. Network, network, network.** This is so important, because any seasoned professional will tell you that the best opportunities you’re going to find will come from networking with other professionals in your field. 

**4. Develop a job search strategy:** I completely understand the desperate urge to send out hundreds of resumes to any company that’s hiring. I know many people who have done this. I did it too. It might help you find a job, but it might not be the job you want. Your goal should be to identify your career goal and focus your efforts on finding a job that will help you get there. Your first job is supposed to be a stepping stone, not a brick wall. Don’t allow desperation blind you from seeing the forest for the trees. 

I hope this is at least somewhat helpful to some of you. If you need more help, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

171fp2j,Can’t decide whether I should leave my prestigious job,"Hi Everyone,  
I am having a hard time deciding what to do in my career right now. I currently work at a large, prestigious company where I’ve been for almost 4 years. It was my first serious job and I was promoted after a year and a half. Growth can be quite quick at the company - however the company culture is extremely toxic, the pay is not super great for the size of the business, and there is no work life balance. I was passed over for a promotion 6 months ago for what I think was political reasons and I am up for another one at the end of the year. If I don’t get promoted I will want to leave as I feel that I am far beyond my current role and that the politics of the team is holding me back.

I have had some terrible experiences with management while at the company and had to switch teams due to pyschological abuse from my former boss. Ever since then, I've been dealing with him bad mouthing me to others and have had strained relationships with people on the team. I still have some great relationships with other management but it has really soured my experience at the company and my desire to stay on the team.   
I was reached out to by a smaller, less prestigious company to interview for a job that is a step above me. The title sounds similar but the role is more of a leading one. The pay would be better than my current role, but likely similar to what I’d get if I get the promotion at my current company. Similar benefits, the new company offers bonuses though. The company culture seems much nicer, the people seem more normal and less toxic/competitive, and they’ve emphasized that there is a lot of room for growth (the manager has moved up 4 levels in 4 years).   
The major issue is that the work itself is a lot less prestigious and I currently get to work on a very highly regarded portfolio. I’m worried that optically it might damage my career trajectory if I go somewhere less regarded, especially as my industry is extremely optics oriented. I am interested in the work itself, it’s quite different than the current business I work in and could potentially lead to working at bigger companies with a similar model, but might restrict me from being able to go back to the environment I am currently in, which is more competitive and sought after.  
The other issue is that I am currently working remote and the new job would be hybrid, where Id have to commute from Vancouver Island to the mainland potentially every other week.  
Finally, my current manager has been dropping hints that she really wants me to stay on the team until after I get promoted, I suspect because she gets bonuses or credit towards a future promotion from my development. I’m stressed about the retaliation of potentially leaving even though they haven’t guaranteed 100% that I will be getting the promotion.  
If anyone has any thoughts or advice it would be greatly appreciated!

171fdm3,How to deal with a passive aggressive boss?,"How to deal with a passive aggressive boss?

I’ve been working at this job for over a year now. My boss (Rick the Dick) has made strange comments like “you should strive to be like Ashley and Alyssa, who do incredible and amazing work”. I understand I can do a better job but is it really fair to compare me to other people who have been with the company longer and are at a higher grade/salary than me?

My mom was also hospitalized for over a month this year with full blown sepsis and my friend passed away on Christmas Eve of 2022. It’s been a tough year to say the least, I’m not looking for any sympathy. I know everyone has problems in life and I’m not special. I admit my work performance may have been sub-par but my manager saying these things really has affected my psyche and morale. 

About 5 months ago, a new sub- team has been created under Rick. Rick (director level) will now have another manager, John, under him and technically I am now supposed to be under John. John has one other direct report officially in the system reporting to him and I’m supposed to report to John as well (we’ve been working that way operationally for the last 5 months). 

But for whatever reason, Rick has not released me in the system and moved me to John. Initially he said it was a system thing about my access and then it became a performance review thing (Rick wanted to wait after the yearly review cycle.) Rick informed me during the conversation that I should be reporting to John now. I’ve emailed Rick and pinged him as well this week about making the change in the system, but he seems to be ignoring me. What are my courses of action here? Do I try to bypass Rick and ask his boss why this change hasn’t been made? Ricks boss even said in a meeting to John that why isn’t Business86 reporting to you now in the system. 

I am especially uneasy as I am going through internal interviews (already interviewed for 6 other roles and didn’t get them). It’s a weird conversation when I tell the other hiring managers that I’m supposed to be reporting to John (and that’s who I’ve been working with operationally) but Rick is still listed as my manager in the system. What do I do here? I’m worried Rick is holding me hostage and hijacking my career opportunities.",Business86,0,0.5,1,1696606305,2023-10-06 15:31:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171fdm3/how_to_deal_with_a_passive_aggressive_boss/,10,2023

171f33j,I work in a luxury industry without luxury pay and can’t fit in,"I recently started at an entry level at a luxury business. I was laid off before this position and money was a little tight but I freelanced to supplement.

Now that I’ve been here for a few months I’m realizing how lucky I was to get hired, as many of the people I work with are very connected and come from high society, and are able to reach out to a wealthy family friend to make their sales 

I get paid a VERY entry level salary, and I can’t afford to eat more than one meal a day and live off of coffee and granola bars otherwise. I look very much like I don’t belong because although I try to thrift looking for more quality items, I just can’t look polished and chic like some of my coworkers are able to. We meet with very wealthy clients, which I have noticed look me up and down a few times. This seems like it shouldn’t matter but in my industry it’s very much about the social connections and creating a list of wealthy contacts, so appearance is very important.

Has anyone gone through something similar? How did you deal with it??",Ok_Biscotti_9435,3,1.0,6,1696605617,2023-10-06 15:20:17,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171f33j/i_work_in_a_luxury_industry_without_luxury_pay/,10,2023
171eq3f,Graduate entry medicine or clinical psychology - any advice???,"I wondered whether there was anyone who was in a position of being torn between these two routes, what they ultimately decided on in the end, and why. 

I am studying for the GAMSAT at the moment to get into GEM. However, I have always been torn between doing this or pursuing CP. I have a degree in psychology and 2 years of experience working as a mental health support worker, though recently I got a job working in theatre as an assistant practitioner to gain more of an insight into the NHS and working with medical doctors.   


I am incredibly interested in and passionate about psychology, learning about the brain and mind is my favourite thing and I never get bored of it. Psychiatry interests me as I am fascinated by neuroscientific and pharmacological mechanisms of mental health, however, I highly value psychotherapy, and if I were to do psychiatry, I would want this to be a part of my role. I know the medical model can be very binary and ignorant when it comes to mental health concerns. However, medical psychotherapy is a specialism which seems to address this and sounds amazing. CP interests me as you get a more thorough understanding of the different therapies and more in-depth knowledge of human behaviour and emotion. I am also incredibly interested in the human body as a whole and find biology extremely interesting, so learning about that would also be incredibly fascinating to me and something I would enjoy, so studying medicine doesn't feel like a chore at all to me.

Medicine/psychiatry actually feels less competitive than CP (probably is). The route into it is more straightforward, whereas CP seems to be a lot of jumping through ill-defined hoops, hoping to eventually get an interview / place on the doctorate - people can work for years before being successful. Whereas GEM is a case of performing well enough on the entrance exams, which is obviously tough, but at least it's well-defined, and I know what I need to do. Though tbf the GAMSAT is probably the biggest challenge I have ever faced in my life so there is also that which is offputting.  


Lastly, though this isn't a driving force for me, there also is higher earning potential as a psychiatrist I believe. Moreover, I want to move abroad eventually, and there seem to be more opportunities to do this as an MD. I want to have lots of doors and opportunities, and medicine seems to be more able to provide this.   


I keep going round and round in my head, so any input from someone in either of these professions or in the same boat as me would be amazing.

171e9xo,Investment banking to public policy?,"I am 2 months away from graduating with a bachelor's in earth science and economics. For the past 2 years, I've been working in oil and gas public policy at my country's department of energy and resources. I absolutely love this job - good culture, friendly coworkers, and encouraging managers who care about my development.  
  
Last summer, I did an IB internship in natural resources, and (surprisingly) got a return offer which I had gladly accepted. But now I am second guessing myself. Truth is, I was quite overwhelmed by the internship and that was only a couple of weeks. I knew what I had signed up for and I've heard all the stories about the grueling hours and I had thought I could take it, but turns out it was a lot more difficult than I imagined.  
  
I don't have long term goals of staying in IB, though my exit plan is a bit unconventional - I want to eventually go back to the public sector and work on mining/energy/renewables public policy. I just want to grind my way through IB for 2 years, make $$$, gain a lot of exposure to the mining and renewables industry, then go back to a relatively lower paying career that I actually enjoy.  
  
So I'm looking for some advice around my plan of working in IB for 2 years, then not only leaving IB, but leaving the finance world completely. Is this a stupid plan that's probably not worth it? Will an investment banking background actually help me get further ahead in public policy? Is it naive to think I can even make it through 2 years with my somewhat nonchalant attitude towards this job?",katiescarlett427,2,1.0,0,1696603746,2023-10-06 14:49:06,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171e9xo/investment_banking_to_public_policy/,10,2023
171dz1l,"Loving aspects of new company, but job not as advertised (Sales Manager)","I started with a new company about a month ago that I was recruited to by an agency. The position of Sales Manager is something I have been pursuing for sometime, and I was excited to get into the role as I love sales and coaching people. I have been enjoying working with my new team and they have been very receptive, and the new initiatives/coaching moments I have implemented are taking. Senior management is happy and providing plenty of positive feedback. 

When I received the offer and was described the role, I was told I would be responsible for some of the key accounts to bring my expertise and help grow where we may be lacking. The description also stated that I am responsible for assigning accounts, so I wanted to clarify that this would not be a conflict as I don’t want my team assuming I am just taking the gravy accounts because I can make the decision. I was reassured that the account package would already be predetermined and it will provide around an additional 5-6k a month in commissions. 

When I started they didn’t have the account package in place, which is fine, allows me to focus on some other things, so after a month I finally received the package. Going through it, 80-90% of the accounts are not great with potential, and the remainder will involve a lot of grinding to gain the business. I am not afraid of hard work, but I know this will impact my ability to actually support and be a true sales manager if I am trying to grow these accounts to not only support my family but help the business. 

I am looking for advise on how I should approach this - should I talk to the recruiter, go to my manager, or wait a few months to see how it plays out?",Banditmygoodboy,1,1.0,0,1696603007,2023-10-06 14:36:47,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/171dz1l/loving_aspects_of_new_company_but_job_not_as/,10,2023

I have spoken about this to everyone in my life so I need someone impartial.

Im 30 years old living in a city I don’t love but I have amazingggg friends. I’ve lived here since August 2021.

I moved here after having a mental breakdown from the year of Covid. I had been living in South Korea and I came back to see my family.

I’ve recently been offered an amazing offer from a different school in South Korea to go teach again.

However, I just started a new job that I absolutely love. I’m basically HR, do the marketing and get to learn about sales. I’ve been here for two weeks but I’m excited about the role and the skills I’m gaining.

I don’t know what to do. 
The contract in Korea starts in March but they need me to sign the contract ASAP.

I’m single, don’t own a home and don’t have many bills. If I stay in this city, I have to move and sign a lease.

If I leave, I won’t have to pay rent and I’ll just get to live!

Idk what to do. Idk if I should stay in this job for the long term or leave since I have the freedom to do so. I think about staying and I feel anxious. I think about leaving and feel scared.

For context: I work in the chemical industry in a technical role in the UK. 

I applied for an internal promotion at work and didn’t get the role but was offered the next vacancy on the condition that I did a secondment in another area for an undetermined period of time. This is because I’d done well in a similar role elsewhere. I accepted with the condition that I’d be paid the salary of the role I originally applied for. The company agreed to this. Overall I’m very happy with the situation as I would have applied for the role I’m seconded to if I hadn’t got the first one anyway.

I know what and where my dream job is, and I’ve applied for it twice and got to the final on the last attempt. I want to update my CV / LinkedIn for further applications to show that I’ve had a promotion but I’m unsure how to reflect my current situation- my preferred option is to put both roles on but it feels disingenuous because I’ve not started the role I applied for even though I get paid by and am seconded from that area. For reference the role I applied for is the next step up but the role I’m seconded to is technically the same level despite it being a much larger and important project than my current role and even the one I applied for.

How should I go about this?

I'm currently working at a non profit organization and I used to enjoy it a ton, but ever since my coworker left and I picked up her hours I'm dreading work. 

They were going to hire another person to replace the shift I was working, but they decided not to (they say they can't afford it) and I think it's because they see that I can do the work of 2 people.

He is very close with the boss so I don't see how I can even address this situation without it turning south.

Since I have been working here for a while, I’m quite fast at my job and often only need to work 4h a day to get all nailed down and accomplished. I find myself having a lot of free time. Combined to the fact that I mostly work from home, this is really great. At the company I’m also able to make my own choice and have absolutely no pressure. I’ve been working here almost 4years.

I recently looked for new opportunities mostly to see what’s out there, and to my surprise I got offered a job as an enterprise account manager at a Fortune Top 10 company. Salary would be of about 7000€, but this would entail going to the office almost every day, new work environment, new challenges, and ofcourse the variable in whether I will love the job as much as I love mine now.


I know this sounds like a first world problem, but would you say that you’d give up your comfort to explore new horizons? I’m all about that risk and I’m definitely willing to do it, I don’t want to be blind sided by my ambition and career tho.

And what happens is if I get stressed sometimes I can't hear anything because the things I hear due to my hallucinations get extremely loud. During this i can't hear anyone around me and i might get a slight panic attack. 

And when this happens i might need to step out for like 10 mins so i can calm down but even then the things i hear can stay loud for quite some time. Obviously this is not ideal for an employer and very not ideal for me as now i can't actually do jobs where i interact with people.

And for disability support here it isn't enough to financially support myself and even if i get that and start working the support payment goes down the more you make so again i wouldn't be able to make a living wage.

And to top it all off I can't study either due to it being incredibly hard to focus on assignments. This happened to me in my last year of high school where i had to stop my HSC which really sucked i can't do much about that.

My twist to the question is that I still have 3 years of GI Bill eligibility left. Admittedly, I want to avoid the extra research involved with PhD programs. Additionally, a big reason I want to pursue a doctorate over a master’s is because of the legacy I want to leave behind in life. 

Would love to hear the thoughts, advice and experiences of others who might be able to offer some guidance.",DLN_93,2,1.0,0,1696569688,2023-10-06 05:21:28,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/17141ia/gi_bill_psyd/,10,2023

1713gye,Should I become a therapist?,"I graduated in December with a Bachelor's degree called Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication. My minor was psychology. I have two internships on my resume that were marketing positions. I have applied to 150+ related jobs and have yet to land one. I originally wanted to only do copywriting and editing but learned that that job is diminishing due to AI and had to broaden my search.  
I have been considering a career change because not only does it seem I won't land a marketing job any time soon, but I also don't really like marketing. I liked copyediting, but that isn't really so much of a thing anymore. Marketing itself seems a bit depressing to me, I don't know if I'm making a mistake continuing to pursue it.  
Psychology is probably my greatest interest/passion in life and I loved my minor in it. It's something I find truly interesting, deeply important, and I imagine would be so fulfilling to pursue. I avoid looking into research work because I know it's notoriously low-paying. So I've been discussing (with my own therapist actually) going back to school and getting a Master's degree to go into mental health counseling instead of what I'm currently going for. It's important to me to feel fulfilled in what I do, I feel a lot of dread actively pursuing something I don't care about.  
I just want to make sure this isn't a knee-jerk reaction to not getting a marketing job, and that it's truly a good decision because it's a big time and financial investment. Is becoming a therapist worth it? What should I know before making the leap? What should I consider that maybe I haven't before? I know that simply having an interest in psychology and mental health is VERY different from actually being a therapist.

1712f0t,I have an offer on the table for a fully remote job. I don't want to leave my current job though and would prefer to force their hand.,"I'm pretty content at my current job. I like my coworkers, the work is interesting, and the salary is fine. However, the one thing that no longer suits me is their 2x in-the-office a week policy. Part of this is that I want to move away from where I live for at least part of if not the full year. It's pretty loosely enforced, and typically if I want to take a week or so fully remote here or there my manager will look the other way.

Got an offer from another company. Similar work, basically the same salary but fully remote. Basically, in my ideal world I'd like to just go back to my current job and say ""look, I'd like to stay here. Not asking for a raise, but I'd like to explore remote work options.""

1711jt5,Is it worth taking a paycut for a more steady job/potential opportunity?,"I currently work as a server in a restaurant that isn't doing so hot. I never know how much I'm going to make in a week, and profits have fallen since the economy has worsened. There are SEVERAL other issues, but that is the main problem at hand.

Still, it isn't that bad. I make a net of ~$2600 on a bad month, maybe 3k+ on a good one (though that hasn't happened for quite some time lol). This isn't GREAT since I live a HCOL area, but it pays the bills. I've definitely had to tap into my savings to pay unexpected expenses more as inflation has gotten insane. I also only work ~30 hours a week, which is great, because I'm trying to recover from burnout.

I was recently offered a shift manager position at a casino. It's about a 20 mile trip one way. It's 40 hours a week, 21.90 an hour (though she mentioned I wouldn't clock in/out, so it might be salary?). After taxes, I can expect to net around $2700. So I'd be working about ten hours more, and likely making a bit less. There is also a matter of the commute. It takes about 40 minutes one way, and I drive a 24 year old 4 runner. She is NOT easy on gas, and I'm concerned about wear and tear. 

This new job would come with benefits like dental, medical, and visual insurance, a 401k match, free meals, and paid vacation.

1710r67,I Need Advice for Career Switch from IT to become a Counselor,"Hello, everyone. I am currently a 21-year-old undergraduate majoring in computer science and working as an intern for an online travel agent company in the role of a DevOps Engineer. I will be graduating in 2024. Recently, I have been contemplating a career switch to the field of psychology, particularly as a counselor. However, this transition would require obtaining a master's degree, and I'm wondering if it's worth going back to university and spending four years, from a postgraduate diploma to a master's degree, to pursue something I love.  
  
Initially, my keen interest was always in psychology, but my mother believes it might not be a good investment due to the fact that our country doesn't prioritize mental health, and it's heavily influenced by religion. She advised me to pursue a career in IT instead, which I did. I perform adequately in it, ensuring that I get the job done and maintain an above-average GPA. I've also been successful in my work. However, I find that I've been limiting myself in terms of learning more about the IT field. It's as if I lack the motivation to expand my knowledge, and I only focus on learning what is necessary to complete the current project. At the moment, I don't find my work in IT fulfilling. One of the reasons I entered this field was because of the financial prospects and the ability to work from home.  
  
I have always believed in my ability to market myself based on my interpersonal skills. Recently, a friend approached me to share his personal struggles, which surprisingly mirrored the neglect and challenges I've experienced in my own family. I offered him comfort and shared my methods for coping and focusing on personal growth. Witnessing his positive transformation and hearing his heartfelt thank you, it dawned on me that pursuing a career in counseling could be a deeply fulfilling choice for me. I aspire for this to become my lifelong profession.  
  
Now, if I were to make a career switch into the field of psychology, which would require approximately 4 years to complete a diploma and a master's degree, I would graduate at the age of 28. I'm concerned that starting my career at that age might make me feel left behind financially. However, the university I am considering has an internship program that could potentially help me in this regard. I am planning to go to Australia to study counseling, as they have excellent programs.  
  
I am unsure if I am making the right choice, and this has been weighing heavily on my mind. Initially, if I continue in IT, I may earn a good income, especially since my current company is interested in hiring me after my internship. I have gained valuable experience and knowledge about the workflow, and I have even handled several critical projects, making me the go-to person for maintenance and support. However, it's mentally exhausting to force myself to learn something I don't have a genuine passion for.  
  
On the other hand, pursuing psychology would mean starting from scratch. I worry about whether my family, if I have one in the future, would suffer due to my career choice. To clarify, I don't mean that being a counselor is a poor financial choice, but rather that my value as a counselor may take time to grow. I just can't shake the mindset that I need to achieve financial independence by the age of 30.  
  
TL;DR  
  
I am contemplating a career switch from IT to counseling, as I want to pursue something that truly interests me. There are several questions that I have not been able to answer yet, and I hope this thread can provide some insights:  
  
Is it possible for an undergraduate computer science major to enter a Master of Counseling program without any background in psychology?  
  
Will becoming a counselor in Australia be a disadvantage for an Asian male? I've heard that after obtaining a master's degree, it may only be useful in that specific country. As an Asian with limited knowledge of Australian culture, I'm concerned that clients may not be inclined to seek counseling from me.  
  
Am I making a poor choice by prioritizing my personal interests over financial growth? I come from an Asian family with the motto ""Work hard until you are financially independent, then you can pursue your passions."" I'm currently 21 and unsure about how life works.  
  
What is the minimum salary in Australia that provides a decent standard of living and financial stability?  
  
One of my main concerns about spending four years to become a counselor is not wanting to burden my parents financially. They have already provided me with enough support, and I don't like the idea of still needing financial assistance from them at the age of 28. If I study abroad in Australia, will working part-time be sufficient to cover my tuition and living expenses?  
  
With an undergraduate degree in computer science, certifications in networking, and experience in infrastructure, am I eligible to apply for IT jobs as a side job while studying in Australia as an international student? Do I need a work visa for this?  
  
After I graduate as a counselor, how can I effectively market myself to secure better entry-level positions? Does gaining internship experience before entering the workforce enhance my value?  
  
That is all of my concerns, ill appreciate any insight you have givenl. Thank you for your time",Ok-Height5420,1,1.0,5,1696559179,2023-10-06 02:26:19,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1710r67/i_need_advice_for_career_switch_from_it_to_become/,10,2023

170wi8r,"How to navigate the ""are you willing to relocate for a position"" question?","I feel this is a question I haven't effectively been able to answer from the standpoint of, it never seems to translate consistently when I hear responses back. What I mean by that is when I'm asked the question, I usually answer: ''I'd prefer to stay in the city, but would be open to moving somewhere else in the state or further than that for what I believe to be the right opportunity."" But when the conversation is revisited, I feel like the perspective I've been told is that I'm ""not interested"" in moving, and it sort of grates me. Am I being too narrow minded or miscommunicating? 
My whole thought is if you offer me a promotion for a 10% increase in a city on the other side of the country, I have to figure things in. Giving a blanket answer of yes or no doesn't seem to be fair to myself or the employer in the sense of if offered a job somewhere else and I'm expected to move myself and possibly a higher cost of living, I'm not as keen. But if you moved me to the next city over and it's a similar cost of living, and I can see a path to how it would help the business or my career in the long run, I'm interested.

170wd0x,"I work with Clients and API integrations, what should my promotion title be?","Hi all, 

I'm in a weird position. My company has a REALLY small technical team where it's basically just me and one new guy we're fixing to hire. They basically have no idea what I do and ""don't want to know (jokingly)"". I was hired on as an ""e-commerce specialist"", but I've had amazing client feedback recently and the leadership that's going to come with training the new employee is spurring on questions of ""what do I want my new position to be"". It's like a soft launch raise where they let me decide? It's very weird. 

So basically, for the latest responsibilities, I handle alot of API connections through a few third party integrators (think Celigo, Liaison, Hubspan, etc.), and I'm in charge of setting up these connections into the backend of our CRM environment (Salesforce CC). Since they're through a translator, I'm not really in the actual weeds of the code of these connections, so it's not really straight developer work. 

Additionally, I handle a lot of the client facing meetings and demos and help scope out the project with the client as far as what information they would like automated, where do they see this project going, etc. Then I'll work with THEIR developers/technical teams to get the servers and authentication, mapping setup, etc. 

So the job has technical aspects but there's also the social/project managing aspect I have to do for myself and the various external teams. With the addition of a new person, it'll also be INTERNAL team managing and I'll need to train them, handle task delegation, create training documentation, etc. 

AKA: What am I?????

While they asked me what I wanted to be, I suggested a ""technical project manager"" off handedly, but they seemed reserved about it. They suggested ""e-commerce integration specialist"" which I dont think would seem like an adequate ""promotion"" at all. I know they don't know what I do or the full extents of what these titles mean, but I'd like to have some solid retort to give them.

170v85d,"My parents pulled me out of school to work as a child, how hard would it be to change careers at 26?","When i was 13 my dad decided I wouldn’t be going back to school after the summer break and instead i’d be working for him whilst legally being “homeschooled” - i was never homeschooled, i’ve been working in construction since i left and I’ve never studied for or sat any kind of exam in my life.

Fast forward 13 years and i’m 26 now, and an owner of the company i started working in as a young teenager. However i never chose to do this, i had little say in my future, finding out what I wanted to do with my own life. I’m earning about 24k a year and this isn’t what i want for the rest of my life. I don’t want to own a company I feel too young for this. Feels like my potential got squashed. 

Unfortunately however my options are limited because for one I was a fool in my late teens and early twenties and went off the rails, racking up 15k in credit card and loan debts, which is entirely my own fault. So i’m obliged to stay at work to be able to meet my monthly payments. And for two i have absolutely zero qualifications for anything, nada. So i can’t exactly just go and change jobs over night.

I’d love to learn something like software engineering as I feel it’s always going to be an in demand career choice given the way modern society is advancing, but i have absolutely no idea where to even begin. I’m more than willing to commit the time and effort in my free hours to learning a new craft but i feel like i’d need to go back to school and fill these gaping holes first, before then going on to get a degree? Whilst also working and paying my debts off, which makes me wonder is it even viable? It just makes me feel completely lost and any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",_sativascape,4,0.75,11,1696544322,2023-10-05 22:18:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/170v85d/my_parents_pulled_me_out_of_school_to_work_as_a/,10,2023
170v2yv,"I lived in a low-income, high crime neighborhood for years and was known as the the guy who could ""defuse"" any volatile situation. Is there any way I could turn that skill into a marketable side-hustle?","My personal job history is all over the place. I'm a residential construction sub-contractor with an ex-military background. However, I recently had a sort of ""epiphany"" where I realized one of my main skills was defusing volatile situations. I've successfully prevented break-ins, rapes, and muggings all using psychology without any force. I've been the guy people come up to talk to when they need advice with their personal safety situation. Is there anyway I could transform that skill into a marketable job. For example, could I offer online/in-person safety consultations? Is there a demand for that field?

170uz3s,Good sales training course for beginners,"I used to do customer service, and was only making enough to get by - especially living in NYC.

But I learned so much, the course not only taught me how to sell, but it showed me how to really build a brand for myself. I now make about 105K and it's climbing - and I live in Atlanta now so not only am I making more, what I make goes further lol.

170uege,Thoughts on leaving a job before a full year for an exciting opportunity,"Hello! I am seeking advice from anyone, but particularly those who work in careers where relationships and political relationships are EVERYTHING. I am a 25y (f) who has found success in democratic campaign fundraising. After 3 cycles and 2 US Senate victories, I decided to make a change and try state government lobbying. I wanted to accumulate more skills outside of fundraising. 

The thing is - I turned down a congressional campaign to take my current job that provides a 401k, healthcare, work-life balance and alllll the things that campaigns don’t offer. And now, an amazing congresswoman has reached out to me asking me to lead her re-election. 

I’m reminded that I left campaign work for a reason (the lack of benefits and lack of diversifying skills) but this one seems hard to pass up.

I am worried that I will ruin my political relationships with the lobbying firm and the folks I’ve met through it and they will resent me for taking a job that I had turned down for them. 

Advice about leaving a job before a year, potentially damaging relationships in the process, etc is welcomed.",Beneficial_Desk7713,4,1.0,4,1696542394,2023-10-05 21:46:34,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/170uege/thoughts_on_leaving_a_job_before_a_full_year_for/,10,2023

170ti5q,Am I being too sensitive or think the below is a good reason to quit.,"short version: new job, 3 months in, last 2 months my direct supervisor in accounting been extremely condescending. she doesn't have any other subordinates so just to me. examples (works directly besides me) 

* she will tilt her screen towards me while she's on a meeting (her headset on, mine are not) and before i can immediately drop everything cause i know she wants my attention, 0.5 seconds later she loudly taps the table 5 times to get my attention like a dog. 

* during some training, she is showing me where to click on some software on my screen. if i don't find it immediately, she will tap the monitor HARD with her finger 3 times while sighing. 

* if i ask her a question she deems stupid (all of them), she will look at me like i'm dumb for 3 seconds before answering in the vaguest, shortest way possible. her answer will leave me more confused and i'll be too afraid to ask more, since when I do, it just upsets her more. most of the time, she will realize later what i was actually asking and yes it was a good question and she doesn't know and has to follow up. after i've done the task wrong of course

* lots of general eye rolling, ""i'll do it myself"", furrowed brows with palm up outstreched in a ""wtf"" motion""

* this kinda stuff, big or small, happens several times a day

extra details (possibly relevant) 

* i'm 33 male, she is probably mid 50s, divorced recently

* prior to this, we worked for 2 years together and it was 99% fine. from about 2020-2022. same role, she was my manager. less stressful work environment at the time 

* currently she is very stressed and it is a stressful time for the company in pre production and everyone working OT. but she is only like this to me and i don't really think it's a good reason to be condescending. 

* the first time it happened, i asked her on teams if i have done anything to upset her and she said sorry a lot and she's just stressed and sorry for being short. it's only gotten worse since then.

* i am the first to admit i am overly sensitive, i am the type where if people are laughing nearby, part of me thinks they're laughing at me. so i'm always full of doubt on whether these slights are imagined or real. yet my gf when i was wfh one day, heard my boss talking to me on teams (headphones not in) and was pretty appalled by how she spoke to me. 

* i don't pay rent and have enough in savings to coast for a while, plan is to get my PCP (payroll cert) and get a job in that field specifically

* right now i'm basically a bookkeeper at 33/h (canadian). payroll entry level with cert is probably between 30-35/hour. at the highest. payroll class looks like a few grand at least unfortunately. 

* i could stay for a couple months before quitting to get more experience as they use a payroll software i've never used but companies often like you to have used. but i really really want to teach my supervisor a lesson. 

* it went from ""omg thank you so much, you're such a huge help"" to ""what did you do all day?"" almost overnight. my work efficiency has not changed.

* i'm objectively not slow, i type 140wpm (yes have results). atm i work 2 days a week and they want me 4 days a week with a new contract.

170thme,With my background Software engineering or data science,"Hi, I have a Msc. In environmental science. Read some courses in GIS and statistics. Been working as low level analyst (not the fancy stuff). Know my way around simple ad-hoc python scripts (not so Object oriented), SQL, power bi, some JS etc. And now work as a project manager within IT (mainly AI, IoT and others) mostly as a management consultant but also lead some development projects.

I'm seeking to bridge my background and get more qualified by taking a technical bachelors degree. Either for being more qualified as a project manager but also if I would want to pivot into a full technical role if I one day get tired of being a PM. My first thought was data science as I believe I will end up in that field. My second thought was Software engineering as it seems more technical and 1. Will bridge with my background better where Data Science would be placed in between my previous education and SE and 2. If I end up wanting to get even more developer oriented I don't want to feel I should read a 3rd bachelor's (not saying I would need that).

Anyone have any general suggestions or tips?",qiicken,2,1.0,0,1696540262,2023-10-05 21:11:02,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/170thme/with_my_background_software_engineering_or_data/,10,2023

170teag,Maximum lowball offer,"My current role used to be supplemented by a second job (for the same company). Routinely 60 hours a week total. I worked my way to be able to quit the supplemental job in exchange for consistent overtime at my main position. The income was the same. After 2 years, the company has notified me that they can no longer sustain my income due to a “budgeting crisis”. 

I have finally received a job offer from another company. The position is more complex and likely more work, however they offered me lower than I make with overtime(3$ less an hour, and yes it matters as the bare minimum rate I need allows me to live paycheck to paycheck). I let them know I’m grateful for the offer but unfortunately can’t accept less.  The recruiter let me know this pay offer is the maximum for the role and can’t budge. We decided to call tomorrow for my decision.

My current role has no upward mobility, however it is no longer sustainable without OT.

This job offer is even less sustainable, but has room to grow (recruiter says people use this position to reach greater roles after 1 year). (I applied because the salary met my requirements, but this turned out to be falsely advertised)

My partner and I may be able to barely afford to keep the lights on for a year until I reach a greater role, I’m just not sure if I can mentally deal with essentially being broke for a year just to get to that point.

170t1pz,Medical Schools vs. Yale College,"About a year ago, I started medical school in Germany on a whim. At the same time I applied to some colleges in the US to have a plan B in case I don‘t like medicine. After finishing my first semester, I got an offer from Yale. Although I enjoyed medicine, the offer obviously seemed too tempting to reject, so I at least wanted to try it out, so I would not regret it later on. After putting my medical education on hold after finishing its first year, I am now 6 weeks into my first semester at Yale, studying Computer Science and Economics. Though, it sometimes feels like what I‘m learning is lacking the “substance” or “meaning” that the material in medical school had.
I now basically have a couple of days left to decide if I want to go back to Germany and continue studying medicine where I left off.
I genuinely do not know what to do or where my passions lie, but I do know that I have been starting to miss medicine recently.
The costs are not a factor since medical school is basically free in Germany (which is also why I would not want to study medicine in the US), and I have a full ride for Yale.

I would appreciate any thoughts on this, and what you would have done in my case for some thought-provoking impulse!

170oags,"My boss asked me to order $7,000 equipment on my personal card.","A few weeks ago, my boss asked me to research equipment we need to order and I sent her a detailed email providing numerous options, and she never responded (this is common for her). Today I decided to follow up and ask if she ever had the chance to look at the options I sent her, and she replied “no but you can order it I trust you”. 

To be fair, I will be reimbursed in 1-2 weeks if I place the order using my card, but I cannot afford a $7,000 purchase at this time and am shocked that she would even ask a junior staff member (I’m 23) to make such a large purchase on their personal card. I am also shocked that she gave me the green light to order it without even looking at my initial email to confirm that the equipment meets all of our requirements.

170o4bl,Graduating uni and not sure what’s next,"I am about to graduate from business school (Bachelor’s degree with specialization in international business). I am 22 years old and I live in Canada. I’m considering what to do when I graduate. I don’t have any next steps planned out and no strong inclinations in terms of career direction or passions. I have internship experience in tech sales, a sustainability role, and with a Canadian NGO in SE Asia. I also did an exchange semester in Europe.

I will be graduating with no debt and approx. US$10k in savings. Some things I have considered as a next step: 

-	Gaining work and classroom experience in the construction industry in labour and sales roles with the goal of eventually becoming an estimator. Eventually I would like to get into real estate investment and development and working in construction as opposed to going straight into real estate seems like the best avenue in terms of enjoying the work and making the most money to build up my savings while I’m young. 

-	Taking time off and travelling. I have loved the time I’ve spent abroad and it’s such an amazing experience for personal growth, making memories and meeting new friends. I would love to backpack and travel extensively throughout my life. I could either not work and travel on a budget or try to find odd jobs along the way. (ie restaurant or hospitality work and “slow travel”. 

-	Trying to find work abroad. I’ve always liked the idea of living abroad on a longer-term basis and possibly even immigrating to another country. This could mean looking for contract work (such as teaching English), and not living in a country with the goal of staying there long term. The other option would be to look to start a career abroad and going somewhere with the possibility of staying on a longer-term basis. If I were to leave Canada and live abroad for the majority of my 20s, I would probably consider either France or the US (but I don’t know much and would be open to other options). I am a native English speaker but I speak French quite well.

-	Starting a business. I want to eventually be a business owner. One idea I am considering and could be realistic out of university is to manage vacation rental properties. 

-	Living at home (or perhaps moving to another city in Canada) and looking for internships or full-time entry-level business roles. No entry level roles appeal to me at the moment. I’m not very interested in marketing/ sales, finance or accounting. This is why I’m considering specializing in construction or doing more schooling but I’m also not fully sold on that. 

Some more about me for context: 

-	My most tangible skill at the moment is probably writing, but I wouldn’t really call myself a writer. 

-	I think I would like to start a family around the age of 30 

I feel really excited for whatever lays ahead of me and I’m lucky to have a lot of opportunity.

170nmby,"Continue in underqualified job, or backtrack?","Hello I wondered if I could get some advice from this sub. I'm using a throwaway account because my original account contains enough information to doxx me. I try to be careful about revealing my career preferences to the public.

I've been working in a role for over a year now that I think I was underqualified for, but I'm also trying to move into a different , TDB direction than my previous roles. So ,I'm not sure whether I should stick-it-out in this role and keep using it as an exploratory opportunity (risking burnout), or just backtrack to a more familiar, but boring role in database development. I'm also at a crossroads in my personal life as a single 38/f and really want to settle down in the next few years. So spending a lot of time studying will take away from time in those efforts. Here's the details...

The position was vacant for only 2 months when I was hired. Quickly after starting the job, my immediate manager repeatedly expressed his displeasure with my predecessor. I was turned off, but I thought the job as one that I was qualified for and it offered opportunity to work with data visualisation software, something I've been studying on my own off-and-on for 2 years and wanted experience in. I quickly found out that the predecessor had a lot of skills that I don't have and was pretty good at them (Powershell, C#, Windows server admin). the managers didn't mention this ( they struggle with the truth, I've found). He was the only one on the team with those skills. My manager's complaints quieted down after a few months....Now, one year later, I've heard enough to know that I was hired as a seat-filler for several reasons, and my boss let it slip recently that his boss wasn't 100% on-board to hire me into this role.

I've been spending time and money to upskill to keep afloat in this role- already took one college class. Now, I start studying for the CompTIA A+ and taking another college class. The company has a policy that they won't pay for certs or for one-off classes. I don't even think I want to continue deeper into the IT world (security , windows admin, etc.). I don't want to lose this salary that I have now, and if I move anywhere else in IT, my salary will decrease (but will remain comparable if I stay in the data world.) I miss the familiarity of knowing exactly what I'm doing, and the relevant ""quiet"" of computer programming that I did before, and how I felt accomplished when I finished something, instead of feeling drained from all the talking and newness and learning and occassional embarrassment. My manager repeatedly tells me that I'm doing great (without my expressing any anxiety), but I know that all that matters if what his boss thinks. Which I have no insight into. 

Adding to this - there have been layoffs, and people are going to start retiring. So if I stick around, I may get laid off, or pulled in deeper, and my personal life will suffer as I keep spending time learning things just to keep float.

The alternative is to backtrack to a more familiar role in computer programming with data. I can probably do this now more confidently because I have demonstrated some data visualization experience, which is increasingly desired by employers. Ironically, this is probably the best role for me to keep getting data viz experience because we just started using PowerBI (which is HOT), but it's subject to time constraints and competing against other people on the team who are assigned to it. 

What would you do in my shoes? Continue with this role and learn as much as I can (risking burnout and losing time I could use to find a partner), or backtrack to a more familiar role (risking my resume becoming stale, giving up the data viz opportunities, and being bored) 

I have good money in the bank, but being unemployed or unemployable would make me very anxious.

Thank you for your time.

170ne74,27 and feel like I made all the wrong choices,"Hello,

I’m 27 currently and have an industrial and systems engineering degree from a very well respected university.

After college I went into sales as I’m a very social person. I know engineers can make good sales people by truly figuring out problems for a customer. The opportunity to make substantial amounts of money also caught my eye.

After five years in sales, I just hate it. I don’t like cold calling or a majority of the things required to keep a pipeline going. I will say the company I’m working for now, about 70% of the sales team is below 60% to quota.

In this current job market, what are my options for transitioning careers? I am burnt out from the constant rejection and just want to come into work knowing what my day will consist of (for the most part). I want to have timelines and deadlines to complete things, but feel like I messed up as I’m 5 years removed from doing any actual engineering work.

170n46s,Finance/Banking - Now Where Can I Go?,"Hi folks,  
  
Crossposting this from r/financialcareers \- I've posted in here before about how rancid the vibes are at my current job, but we are back at it again. Here's the situation.  
  
I was a relationship banker in branches at different institutions for about six years. I finally left the position after it became more and more hard-selling and cold calling, but before my job description switched to ""sleazy salesman"" I enjoyed it.  
  
I've since moved to a back office position at a commercial bank. The intention upon hire - and I have this in writing - was to train me on the basics, introduce me to the clients, and then after 12 months move me into the position of ""Commercial Deposit Officer,"" who would work with the relationship managers and credit analysts to help businesses manage cash flow and grow their business, as well as network to bring in new business. Historically these are things I have been very good at, routinely being a top performer at previous jobs, and I jumped at the opportunity.  
  
Eight months in, this has not been what has happened. I am instead in a cubicle doing data entry and clerical work all day, which I'm not good at - I'm a people person, I'm not a ""make sure the data from report 1234-678a from Friday matches the quarterly report 9876-543b from last month, scan pages 1-3 into database A, 4-6 into database B, and then print pages 1-9 and FedEx them to corporate for final review"" person. On top of this, all of my training has been incomplete or incorrect - I'm pretty frequently being reprimanded for doing things wrong, and it's been implied that these continuous ""mistakes"" are putting the aforementioned career progression in jeopardy.  
  
This came to a head yesterday when my manager informed me that we had failed an audit because I'd been filing a particular report incorrectly for all of Q3. I pulled up the written procedures and showed her that I'd been following the procedures. She informed me that those weren't really the procedures, it was more of a set of guidelines, and pointed me to a different document, *also* labeled ""procedures"" but significantly more in depth. This document is not referenced anywhere, there is no indication that this document even existed. I told her politely and professionally that it wasn't reasonable to expect that I would assume that the written procedures, which match how I was trained, would be incorrect, and that I would instead need to look for a secret separate document that *actually* has the correct procedures on it. I also noted that these reports are reviewed monthly, and that two of my colleagues, who have both been here for a minimum of five years, had signed off on them, certifying that they'd been done correctly, in July, August, and September. She changed the subject and dismissed me from her office.  
  
This kind of thing happens regularly, and I'm just done. They're either trying to fuck me or they are all incompetent and either way the vibes are in shambles here.  
  
So here's what I *like* doing. I like helping people and businesses manage their money. I like helping people plan for the future, get out of debt, grow their businesses, that sort of thing. I like building collaborative relationships with clients and co-workers. I like helping people solve problems, from tracking down embezzlement/fraud to helping them budget. I am very good at these things.  
  
I *do not* like teller transactions, tech support, working with the elderly, or clerical work, though I understand there's always going to be paperwork in this business.  
  
What kind of jobs should I be looking for at this point?

170lxnl,Need advice Quit job or find new one ASAP,"Hello,

I have been working at this job since March 2023.

Since starting it has been nothing but stress. 

I am the store manager, they didn’t have one for over half a year and are looking to increase their sales where they were about 2 years ago.

I have 6 years in the field, hence why they hired me. I came in and created a great CSR knowledge base (this is a cannabis store), staff turnover has been rough (getting rid of people who did not pull their weight), I am only now getting a competent team.

Regardless, I don’t get paid enough, about 50k CAD. I also work 50 hours a week. When I complained, they said the other store manager (who is 22 years old, in full time uni and this is his first bloody job) never complains and doesn’t even keep track of his overtime (major red flag).


What’s making this quitting decision hard,

They just got my a brand new car, that I can use for personal use but it is obviously their vehicle. They claim they can’t afford to give me a raise.

I was glad for the car as it cut my commute by over 50% and I can actually see friends and family that live further out of the city /and would have been a 2-5 hour bus ride.

I pay about $185 more than I would be with transit.
With no pay increase I am feeling this pinch. I already don’t make enough.

Now I am driving 8 hours per week between their two locations, trying to move inventory and see what can be done to increase sales.

I have give suggestions, I.e I don’t believe we have enough inventory, as we’re always barren a few days before order date.

It will take at least another two weeks to a month for me to get approval to change the order dates, in that time sales slumping. 

I find any suggestions I say, are met with “we don’t have enough funds right now” or it takes forever to get implemented. By that time I’ve run out of steam.

I ll look at completion and ensure our pricing is as low as we can stand (something my bosses want- but without consistent inventory it doesn’t make sense).

They don’t care to look at the breakdown of numbers, I.e I have a customer making my life hell, he makes us the equivalent in one week of what one ounce purchase would be. Yet they are fighting tooth and nail to keep this customer that doesn’t buy anything but this one product.

Anyway,

I say this all to say I feel very burnt out. I feel alone. I feel like I have no support most of the time. Just me against the world then I have to answer to them once a week.

I am on the verge of quitting, I just need another role lined up. This car is the only thing wanting me to stay, but I’ve realized it’s making me more exhausted and burnt out despite its positives (getting to see my family and friends).

I believe I am undiagnosed ADHD so somethings I believe I take a bit too extreme. I’d like to hear what others have to say about my situation. This would be my third time in the same role in the span of 3 almost 4 years.

170l4k6,"Not enjoying research, and I'm Not sure what to do next","This is probably going to be a rambling mess and I'll probably delete it after a bit but here goes nothing. I graduated college a few months ago with a degree in biotechnology with the hope of doing research on genetics and genetic diseases in the future. I didn't get much biology research experience as an undergrad partially due to covid and partially because my university didn't have biology labs that were taking undergrad students, at least in cell biology stuff that would be relevant to my future career. I did work in a mechanical chemistry lab for a couple years in college which allowed me to meet some great people, but I knew I wanted to do something different for my career. I ended up getting accepted into a postbacc program where I would do research for a year and learn things that would help me get into grad school.

I joined a virology related lab as there weren't too many labs at this institution doing genetic research and the few that were had PIs who were notoriously terrible to work for according to grad students who I talked to during the admissions process. The lab I joined had a really cool PI and nice grad students who I get along with. I've already learned a lot of lab techniques, but the issue is I also learned that I really don't enjoy doing research. Maybe it's the subject matter not being my area of interest, but over the few months I've worked there I've increasingly just wanted to go in, do what I had to do for the day, and get out as quickly as I could. This is obviously not a good mindset for research, especially since I regularly work ten hour days, and often they go for even longer. I'm constantly unhappy and it's gotten to the point where it's affected my sleep, which just makes the whole thing even worse and I feel like I've started slacking on work as a result. Maybe I'm just lazy but I really don't think I can do five years of this to get a PhD, especially if I'm just probably going to then go to a biotech company to do more research.

I've been thinking of doing various career shifts as a result. One that I've always considered and keep getting lead back to is genetic counseling, which is something that I think I would enjoy, but I have the feeling that I wouldn't feel as accomplished if I went into it. For a long time I pictured myself getting a doctorate and doing research into curing genetic diseases and maybe I was looking forward to the prestige of it all. Even though genetic counseling very is important, I feel I wouldn't be living up to my potential since they don't really cure people, or at least the potential that other people see in me. I've heard about bioinformatics and it sounds interesting but I've never been much of a coding person aside from knowing a bit of Python and don't think it would be great to get into a program about that without proper coding experience. I considered becoming a physician but I don't have clinical experience and probably wouldn't be able to handle the dissection stuff that's important there. I feel like I should just get over whatever weird pride stuff I have and get into genetic counseling because I know I'll like it, but every time I feel like I've finalized my decision I get doubts again. I just feel really stuck and it's getting worse since applications are due in a few months for a lot of things and I don't want to miss them and feel like I'm wasting time for a whole year until applications start up again. I don't know if I need advice or just needed to rant about this, but thanks if you read all of this junk.

170juhu,How Do I Quit My Job?,"I (26M) have been working in higher education for around 3 years now, a mix of internships, part time work, and a current full time, salary role. The job pays the bills (barely), but has significantly changed since I was hired on almost 1 year ago. We are under constant scrutiny and receive constant evaluations that feel impossible to perform well on. There are new expectations and duties introduced almost weekly, and it’s become exhausting. 

Before pursuing my professional education, I was in the Marine Corps, working in aviation maintenance. I have been entertaining returning to that field, and to my surprise I have been offered a role that nearly doubles my current salary. I have accepted the position and will start in less than 2 weeks, but haven’t informed my current employer.

My current job is “at-will”, and the problem is I have some vacation approved for next week, when I’ll be starting the new role the following Monday. I don’t want to burn any bridges and quit on the spot, but am fearful that if I give notice, I’ll be let go before I use my vacation time. 

I know this might sound silly to some, but most of my experience is in the military, where there is no quitting or giving a 2 week notice, you just fulfill your contract. I have never left a serious job before, and am looking for advice on how to go about this.

*For context, I am a graduate student and have been working in higher-ed due to the convenience, it has never been fulfilling to me.

170ia5r,Chronically Unemployable!,"Hello everyone,  
  
I think I've become unemployable. Perhaps I've been this way for a long time without realising such a state existed.  
  
I've always believed, if you're good, you're good. But turns out I was very naive.   
  
This will be a very lengthy post. I want to provide you with some context, perhaps to myself too.  
  
I have a stellar Master's degree in architecture, a plethora of diverse hard skills, and I'm an extremely dedicated, hard-working individual.  
  
I graduated at 26 from an architecture school in Italy. If that seems old, remember that architecture is a long and gruesome course. I don't mean to brag, but I was likely one of the best students my school ever had. I graduated with distinction/honours or whatever you might call it in your country (Not that the grade's that big a deal. Others got the same, but while they were good students, I was a good designer).  
  
Post-graduation, the job market in Italy for architects and many professionals was and still is bleak. And I was too broke to even think of moving anywhere in Europe (a full scholarship allowed me to study).  
  
I took on various odd jobs and soon discovered I could earn as a freelancer through my skills in graphic design and 3D graphics. The earnings were moderate, but I could make ends meet. My goal was always to move to a European capital for my dream job, but I needed savings.  
  
After some family struggles and earthquakes wrecking my family home, it took me about 4 years to save up. With 5K of  savings and a strong architecture + 3D portfolio, I moved to London in October 2018, at age 29 and full of drive and enthusiasm.   
  
Here I think I started my  “hero's journey”, except it is a pretty dull one.   
  
Though I hoped for an architecture position, I was open to 3D roles to get myself started. London was busy and full of opportunities as expected, but none for me apparently.  While recruiters noticed my portfolio, and would call me every day,  I couldn't secure a job. Eventually, I accepted a role in a 3D studio in Birmingham and I was fine with it as long as it meant a way to set my foot in. This was probably one of the worst mistakes I have ever made. This place was run by complete amateurs and calling it toxic now that this word is being used all the time,  wouldn't do justice to the level of madness and ignorance and abuse I experienced. Everyone wanted to leave since day one, and so did I! But I had already rented a flat, set the bills, and my newly graduated wife had joined me. I stuck around for a year, but even though I used to consider myself stoic and resilient, it really  wrecked my mental health.  
  
  
When I left the place I decided to return to Italy for a while to recover and decided to learn UX/UI design, considering my background in graphic design and architecture. It was actually pretty smooth and natural transfer, and I produced quite a few meticulous study cases, complete with research and interactive prototypes.   
  
Applying for jobs in London again, no luck in the tech department, even for pretty basic UI design roles.  Then, out of the blue, I got an architecture interview. I really nailed it and they were stunned by my work.  They offered me a position and shitty pay, but I was so happy!  
  
A friend then offered to host me and my wife in London until we could find our own place.  
  
But this was February 2020, and we all know what happened next. My secured position became non-existent and I found myself stuck in London! And if this wasn’t enough, this so-called friend and his partner started behaving weirdly and showed their true colours (despite us being absolutely respectful of the house,  paying for food for all and literally becoming their servants). Luckily and against all odds my wife managed to secure a 0 hour reception job and we managed to escape this nightmare within a month  by  sub-renting a room from a student left out of the UK.  
  
The place turned out to be a beautiful penthouse in E1 where rich kids used to live. And we had this massive room for 'only' £800!  Here I have to admit I had a really good time, despite the lockdown! One of my old 3D clients started supplying me with a good amount of work again, and I had my workstation sent over from Italy. I also regained my belief in architecture and entered quite a few competitions, as well as applied for jobs daily. My fiancé was working just fine despite the unpredictable situation, and we got used to it. We lived in the moment and decided to stay in London until we ran out of money.  
  
We eventually moved to a one-bedroom flat in September 2020, which I managed to secure at a really good price, as landlords were quite desperate at the time.  
  
Flashforward to late 2023, I can say that this flat has become a prison for me.  
  
My wife has done exceptionally well over the last 3 years; she's a war machine. I am incredibly lucky to have her. Starting from a zero-hour receptionist role, she managed to secure a stable reception job at a prestigious law firm. Later, when the managers there recognized her qualifications and capabilities, they offered her a position as a marketing executive. While I personally believe she's overqualified (and far too intelligent and skilled) for this role, at least she has forged a career path. Earning a decent income in a fairly stable job, and being five years younger than me, she has ample room to explore new and better opportunities. I'm extremely proud and happy for her.  
  
  
On the other hand, I feel like I've become somewhat of an underachiever or, let’s call it for what it is, a complete loser,  particularly when compared to others in London with a similar educational background and talent.   
  
The pandemic, which lasted longer than anyone anticipated, left me feeling both disoriented and insidiously depressed.   
  
However, I must emphasise that I've never been idle, except for the occasional days when I felt completely paralyzed. Despite sending out over a thousand job applications in architecture, I've come to the realisation that it might be in vain. I also consistently applied for UI/UI design roles, but to no avail. This prompted me to revisit coding, a field I was quite proficient in during my teenage years.  
  
In theory, this move could make me more versatile and appealing as a designer while also opening doors to opportunities as a front-end developer.  
  
I've built a substantial website portfolio that includes graphic designs, user interfaces, and deployed sites and apps. While I haven't done much commercial work on the development side, the developers I've interacted with have shown appreciation.  
  
My primary source of income has been 3D work with this big client who genuinely respects and values my contributions, in addition to occasional graphic design gigs. Unfortunately, my career situation hasn't notably evolved.  
  
For over a year, I've been applying for design and development roles, which seem abundant despite the recession, yet I've had no luck.  
  
Throughout this period, I've consistently enhanced my skill set, incorporating new technologies and undertaking fresh projects.  
  
I'll be turning 35 this year, and I find myself in a weird limbo. While I'm undoubtedly more skilled and wiser than I was five years ago, my accomplishments are non-existent on paper.  
  
My wife is my pillar of support, and she still believes in me. However, I can't help but feel I'm letting her down. My unpredictable income makes plans for a family impossible, and my earnings barely match the minimum wage anyway. Individuals 10 years younger than me are making 4-5 times more, and often with much less qualifications and skills.   
  
I consider myself fortunate to possess a variety of talents and a sharp mind, and I do my best to non completely lose it. Yet, depression increasingly clouds my perspective now, eroding the optimistic dreamer I once was. I feel like I have been ostracised.  
I often contemplate suicide lately, with a degree of seriousness that is scary,   and the only reason I won’t do it is because there are people here who love me.  The tragic loss of my sister, who took her own life 13 years ago, is a constant reminder of the devastation such decisions bring to a family.  
  
Despite my struggles, I've never ceased to be active. Motivated largely by sheer determination, or simply inertia,  as feelings of emptiness and numbness threaten to consume me.  
  
I wonder if it was a mistake not focusing on my own business instead of looking for permanent employment. Today I might have had many more loyal clients and a far better income!  
   
But I just sought stability, or maybe I viewed it as a precursor to going solo.   
  
I mean, I am clearly being cut out on job screenings no matter my skills, perhaps due to my unconventional journey, non-current experience or my age. This leads me to believe that my only possible way forward may lie in aggressively marketing my services and seeking clients, specifically as a designer + developer, since I don't envision doing 3D visuals indefinitely (but again, depending on the opportunities available at this point).  
  
In summary, I am a top-tier architect (I will never match this talent with anything else I do), proficient graphic designer, adept UX/UI designer, skilled 3D generalist, and an increasingly competent front-end developer with a decent grasp of back-end technologies (JavaScript, Java, Python, React, Node, and Next).   
  
I have never underdelivered, quite the contrary!  While I may lack complete confidence in handling intricate full-stack applications, I'm confident that I can execute design or front-end tasks to the highest standards.  
  
If you've made it this far in this post,  I'd genuinely appreciate any insights or advice. This is the first time I'm opening up about my situation, seeking guidance and understanding.  
  
Note that I don’t intend in any way to look arrogant (or delusional) about my talents or skills, while I will be always learning and improving,  to me it is a simple fact that I am already good at many things and I have worked hard on them. For people who might be sceptical about this, I’ll be happy to show them my work.   
  
Thank you.

1. Go into commercial AV and get into project management maybe above with more time. I would have to move into commercial which is a bit different and it would take a couple of years to get acclimated, then find a PM position. May have to get up at 3 for years. I would likely max pay out at $150k if I were very lucky to find a good spot. 
2. I could go into tech, I do know some code but would have to learn a lot more, take some courses and build some projects, maybe network. My buddy that works for Facebook says I""m better than half the people he works with because I understand shit. Pay is variable but likely could make 150k in 5 years with some luck. 
3. I could go further into construction. My wife works for a construction company she said in 10 years I could be a project manger making 250k. I don't think I'd like the working hours on this one, likely getting up at 3 am for years, maybe more.

Later on, I've worked as a consultant for 5 years. I put all my time and effort in my free time and got stuck into this cycle of (learning to code) trying to master everything and being afraid to actually work.

My starting Salary that I've been offered is at $750 (but on probation). Which was lower than my existing salary, but I accepted it as I explicitly told during my interview I'm looking to start at the position of an entry level, but with hopefully a strong foundation from the projects I've learnt from.  
  
So, on my second day I've finally got accessed to the repository, deployed the project and was assigned to grab data via an API and implement a simple CRUD system. As they used Symfony for their project framework and MySQL, I said upfront if I could take some time to learn how Symfony,API, tokens and Sessions really worked, but my manager said - are you sure you want to be a developer? Why don't you continue being a consultant instead. Said, he would give me 2 days to learn entirely how it works and implement it, as my seniors were working from home, so I did couldn't really asked any of them about this.

170ds69,How should I (43M) handle the 2 year resume gap as I start applying for VP level tech positions again?,"Hello everyone,  
Here is the TL;DR: How should I address a 2-year resume gap for VP roles. Took a break after burnout, extended due to my cat's illness, and worked on blue sky tech projects. Unsure how to present this period since I don't feel there are any tangible achievements.  
For a bit of background, I (43M) have about 13 years of experience in SaaS product management and software engineering (all startups). The most recent three YEO were VP level positions. I left my last job exactly two years ago. Well, technically I was let go, but only because I got sidelined by the CEO about 30 minutes before I was going to hand in my letter of resignation. The year I spend at that company was a terrible experience, which left me feeling pretty burnt out. Luckily I had a bit of a nest egg saved up, which is why I decided to take a year off to regroup and work on some of my own passion projects.   
Well, that one year turned into two years and counting because a family member got sick and required constant emergency trips to the hospital (and also because honestly I just did not feel ready to go back). I've seen other advice that said to just be honest abut taking care of family members. But here is the thing (and I feel a bit embarrassed even saying this here), the sick family member was my cat, who was like a son to me. So I don't think I want to go into that on a resume or I'll just sound like a crazy cat person.  
I also don't know if / how I should present the projects from the last two years. I mostly focused on blue sky projects because my main goal was to brush up on coding, and get up to speed on some of the new technologies that have come around since my days as SE. The thing is that now I mainly have a bunch of half finished prototypes and my personal learnings to show. But since I did not release anything, I am not sure how I could present any of it as tangible achievements. What makes it even more difficult in my head is that the things I worked on are in very different fields, so I am having a hard time building a coherent story around what I did for the last two years. It was a bit like a self-funded incubator, except I feel that I don't have anything to show at the end.  
One thought I had was to just say that I did freelance consulting during that time. I guess in a way I was consulting for my self, but it feels a bit disingenuous. And I'd also be worried about being asked for names of companies I consulted for and/or references.  
So my question is, how would you recommend navigating this situation? How transparent should I be? Any insights or suggestions would be very appreciated.

170a11h,Advice For My Current Role,"Hi guys,

I wanted to see what your thoughts are on my current situation. I just closed up on my first year with one of the biggest semi conductor distributors in the US. 

I’m a sales rep for them, my job is to go into manufacturing companies (medical, aerospace, military) and help them design whatever products they’re working on with electrical components. 

The issue I’m having is that I really don’t have anyone to ask questions on how things work here. It’s been a year, and I feel like I’m always pestering someone for answers on something which I don’t like doing. I’ve had to learn everything pretty much myself so far. I’ve also had no formal training here either which still boggles my mind for such a large company. And even more difficult because it’s a very complex, technical industry. Im not sure if it’s me being impatient, but I like to be comfortable in the product/service I’m selling, and that it takes time to learn.

I’m planning on a scheduling a review with my boss, about expectations, and how I’m doing so far (which also bothers me, why do I have to do this? Shouldn’t my employer be more proactive?)

What throws me off is that I’m the youngest in my office by almost 20 years. All the reps have been there 25+ years. So the company must be good to stay long term, and they seem pretty well off. They babysit 1 or 2 large accounts and just tend to them as needed. I still cant really tell how much they make either. Im more of a work horse, my role is to drive smaller existing business. I do fairly well for an entry level rep (60k base+commision)

So I guess my question is, has any had a similar experience? How did you handle it? We go in the office 1 day a week and work remote the rest, so there’s really no “culture” either.

Unsure how to proceed.","It was painful writing that out and I'm not even sure if this is the best sub for this. I've gone to my campus career advisors who commended me on my resume and cover letter, which while ego boosting hasn't seemed to help.

For three months (all prior to graduating), I've been applying nonstop. I've been on about every job search engine I can think of. I'm applying to places relevant to my education, relevant to my most recent work experience, remote jobs, no experience needed jobs, and minimum wage jobs. The vast majority of jobs haven'r responded. I have gotten some  interviews but no offers. I've asked people who turned me down what disqualified me. Most in ""bigger jobs"" have said I made the top five and thought my cover letter and resume were strong, but that other people just had more in the preferred qualifications category. For context, my masters degree is in environmental science and my work experience has been a mix of being a program coordinator and teaching adult science education (2 years), customer service of ~6 years, working in restoration for 2 years.

My contract with my last job naturally ended and I was thinking I might at least qualify for unemployment but looks like I don't due to it being a student position.

1706dgh,Should I take the offer?,"
Hi all! I’m a 24F who just received an offer for a company in the Southbay. I’m originally from NJ, but the offer is contingent on me moving to the southbay by the end of November. It’s $67k with a 7% bonus. I’ve tried to negotiate, but they won’t budge. I would have to commute 2 days into the office. I do have some savings to keep me afloat (~$30k). Is this a livable wage in the Southbay or is it worth taking it? 

I’m really torn. My gut is telling me no that I should continue interviewing or looking for contract/temp roles, and the other part of me is just telling me to do it that I’ll figure it out, or that I’ve been out of a permanent role for too long and I don’t want it to look bad on my resume. 

For context, I graduated college in 3 years in 2020. I was laid off back in April 2022, and have only been able to secure 1 contract role since then, but that officially ended at the beginning of August.

Ideally, I’d love to pivot to new career path while I’m still young-ish (30M). Is it possible to change up my career without taking a pay cut? 

I have very little preference toward any particular career path - it’s a means to an end. But would love something that:

- Offers 100% remote work
- Builds upon my current skillset while allowing me to develop more technical skills
- Is more intellectually & socially stimulating
- Has better career mobility & potential growth

I am currently working as HVAC control engineer that pays $70k/year. However, I find myself not enjoying engineering as much so I am thinking of trying out accounting and potentially becoming a CPA. I find that I was not been successful in finding an engineering job so far. I would have better job stability as a CPA. 

I am taking pre-requisite courses (CPA PREP program) online part-time to get into the CPA PEP program while I am working full-time as an engineer. I know that I need 2 years of work experience in accounting to become CPA so I would need to make the career switch at one point. I estimate the CPA PREP program would take me about 1.5 years to complete and the CPA PEP program would take me about 2.5 years. So, that's a total of 4 years to become a CPA.

I got an offer letter for the accountant associate position from the company I did my internship while I was in school. The only concern I have is that my salary would be reduced to 48k from 70k. Should I quit my engineering job and become an accountant associate? I know I gotta start somewhere since I have no accounting experience.

At first, I didn’t mind because it was really valuable experience that looks good on my résumé and will serve me when I eventually look to go for a Director role. 

Now, I am frustrated because I have been maintaining this immense workload for 8 months without additional compensation and without any title change. This is frustrating.

But what is even more frustrating is being expected to act like a Director by the companies President because I’m doing the work. But my interim manager expects me to do the work of a director while also not breaking “chain of command” and still act like a manager. My interim manager is a huge micromanager and needs to have complete control of every little detail, to a point where productivity slows for the department.

It took a while for me to come to this conclusion, but I have come to realize that I am completely being taking advantage of, and being shown no respect . Or at least that’s what it feels like when I am getting the workaround and have different expectations by different people for a role that’s not even technically mine yet I’m still doing.

I have a history of job hopping, so I’m trying to stay at this job for minimum of two years if not three years. In the meantime, how can I address the situation?

I’ve interviewed for other Trust & Safety roles here and there, but honestly, I typically am either not selected for more lucrative roles *or* the role pays significantly less than what I’m presently making. It seems to me that my present company overpaid when giving me a raise during the pandemic, because I can never seem to find a role that matches my experience and that will pay me more. I’ve always been a high performer in present role but the role perhaps isn’t all that challenging, so what I’ve accomplished maybe doesn’t mean much to some of the other prospective employers I’ve spoken to. It seems like what we do at my company is a bit minor league compared to some other companies I’ve interviewed with.

I’ve been feeling a little burned out lately and I’m not entirely sure what I want to do next. I’d love to continue earning what I do now (low six figures) or even increase my salary, but I’d like to find something else to do. I’m open to staying in my present field but I also like the idea of taking a similar role in a different industry. My biggest skills are likely organization, communication and my analytical ability. I’m very efficient in my approach to work, can get a lot done. I’ve been wanting to taking some certification programs as a way to “skill up” and increase my earning potential but I’d prefer something I can pay for out of pocket, as opposed to going back to college and dealing with actual tuition costs (*I already have a BA in Political Science and am in no debt, don’t want to go into any significant debt for more school*).

I have generally strived to just work my way into more money through hard work and by taking on increasingly more responsibility, and I have succeeded historically, but I might have hit a ceiling at this company. I don’t know how to take the next step in my career without taking a pay cut and I feel stuck.

TL;DR: Work in Trust & Safety, wondering if anyone has ideas on what a good pivot might be for someone in my position, such as what other roles or industries I might want to look at. Also interested in hearing thoughts on certificate programs or other kinds of training I might want to look into—something I can do while working full time and that isn’t terribly expensive.

1701lvo,Move that hasn't panned out.,"Using a throw away account here.  
It's been a difficult last few years unfortunately. I had a very good career working as a contractor and was making good money. I was lucky enough to really enjoy what I did as well. Unfortunately, and not to be political (I am not a political person,) I lost a lot of work after the mandates started getting rolled out in 2021. So when a decent amount of my networked stopped hiring me I decided to take a job in a different city working for a small company and start over so to speak. I didn't want to, but it seemed to be the obvious choice as the job opportunity seemed worth it... Unfortunately a little less then a year after the move, the company that hired me ran into some serious financial trouble and couldn't support my roll any longer. It was fine, as I was doing work that wasn't very fulfilling and I was pretty overqualified for... In retrospect I felt a bit lied to about what the roll entailed... However now I'm in a new city trying to get back into contracting work. But it has been very slow to start as it relies heavily on connections. Something I don't have a lot of in this new city. It's been about five months and I haven't been meeting my expenses. I've yet to fall in love with this new location too and I fear I'm looking back on my past life in the old city with rose colored glasses... I know I could get most of my old work there if I went back, but my girlfriend would kill me if that's what I wanted to do, we moved here together... I have a decent amount of savings but certainly less then I did five months ago... I am getting a little concerned as things aren't progressing as fast as I was hoping. I'm wondering if it's time to make a pivot.",thrownawayonion123,2,1.0,0,1696460474,2023-10-04 23:01:14,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1701lvo/move_that_hasnt_panned_out/,10,2023

16zyuqp,A**hole Colleague in MY COMPANY,"My father and uncle jointly own a company that they painstakingly established from the ground up, ultimately growing it into a substantial enterprise. My father serves as the company's chairman, while my uncle holds the position of CEO. During my college years, the company employed a sales manager who, despite being highly knowledgeable and well-versed in every product, exhibited a significant flaw. He displayed extreme favoritism towards specific salespeople. He would unfairly redistribute some of the salesmen’s hard-earned projects to other salesmen whom he favored.  
  
The mistreated salespeople hesitated to voice their grievances to the CEO or Chairman, fearing repercussions. Eventually, tensions escalated between the sales manager and an individual I'll refer to as 'Noah.' To avoid further conflict and potential consequences, the sales manager decided to promote Noah to a position focused on studies and analysis of projects. This move temporarily pacified the situation, although numerous complaints continued to pile up.  
  
Eventually, my father, as chairman, took notice of these persistent issues and asked the CEO to confront the sales manager about this. It got bad to the point where the sales manager completely stopped doing his job as an F YOU gesture, and his now ""assistant"", Noah, was forced to take over. Eventually, my dad decided to remove the sales manager from his role. The level of trust had eroded to the point where my father felt no one in that position could be relied upon. Meanwhile, I had recently graduated and was still in the process of acquainting myself with the inner workings of the company.  
  
It was at this stage that my father approached Noah and appointed him as the new sales manager. However, this decision was immediately met with dissatisfaction from many other salespeople, who believed that Noah possessed similar shortcomings and unjustness as the previous sales manager. In response to their concerns, they suggested that I assume the role of sales manager, a proposal to which my father eventually accepted.  
  
Out of the blue, as Noah entered the office on his big day, he discovered me seated at the sales manager's desk. Surprise, bitch! I acknowledge that I have much to learn in this role. However, Noah's envy began gnawing at him, prompting him to take deliberate steps to ensure my exclusion from nearly all company affairs. He does this low-key, however.  
  
Given that Noah has been with the company for a longer duration, all the salesmen had developed a habit of turning to him instead of me. Regrettably, Noah chose not to keep me informed about ongoing matters. This situation escalated to the point where we had several minor conflicts, leading us to completely avoid each other. For example, if a salesman asks him to quote a project, he would do so without telling me. He would submit this project and even tell the CEO about it while I have no idea what’s going on. I'd read the emails just to stay updated with everything, but I feel like I have no say in anything that is happening.

  
One day, a salesman named Andrew called me one day and told me that he wanted to have some coffee with me. I accepted. When we went out for coffee, I felt like he was trying to say things while beating around the bush.. then he finally said it. ""Listen, I don't know how to say this so I'm just gonna fucking say it. You're the worst sales manager we've ever had... and I'm saying this because I love you. I want you to be better than all of them. You are better than them. Your English is better. You're younger. You're smarter. You just need to put the work in so that everyone starts getting back to you instead of Noah.""

  
That night, a salesman named Bryan gave me a call. He was saying the things that Andrew said. The next day, a salesman named Matthew said the same thing. We started forming a bond. We decided to exclude Noah and fully get back to me. In addition to that, I worked my ass off and put in extra effort to increase my product knowledge and study the engineering layouts. I put in a lot of effort to do the work, and I'm still doing it! Andrew, Bryan, Matthew, and even a few others started getting back to me after this added effort which absolutely pissed Noah off. 

  
It pissed Noah off so much, and I was still able to do my work. I learned a lot from just one day of three salesmen getting back to me instead of Noah. However, I really don't know what happened behind the scenes, but two of the three salesmen stopped referring back to me. It's so weird... I feel like Noah talked smack behind my back and got them off my train track. (issa joke but fr they changed on me). One thing you need to know about Noah is that he is sometimes passive-aggressive.  
  
So employees reverted back to their old ways, bypassing me in favor of Noah. This persistent lack of opportunities to prove myself has made it increasingly challenging. Even my uncle, when he needs to get an update, tends to rely on Noah instead of considering me.  
  
Certainly, I acknowledge that Noah possesses significantly more experience than I do. I do not deny that. However, my concern lies in how I can gain valuable experience and expertise when I am consistently excluded from important matters. It's evident that Noah's deliberate actions stem from his envy, making my learning process challenging.  
  
Despite the fact that I'm here to stay due to my familial ties to the company, I've made earnest attempts to set aside my ego and build relationships with my colleagues. I've taken the initiative to stay informed by frequently asking them about ongoing developments. However, it's become exhausting because they only share information with me when I ask for it, and even then, it often leads nowhere.  
  
I've noticed that Noah tends to react in a cocky way if I attempt to engage with him in a friendly manner, often displaying signs of disrespect. It’d be his happiest day if he catches me making a mistake. I've told myself that my primary goal is to learn and grow, so I strive to remain focused on that objective and not let negativity and his behavior affect me too deeply. Unfortunately, the situation has been deteriorating, and today marked a particularly challenging day.  
  
Andrew, who still has a somewhat strained relationship with Noah, reached out to me instead of him. He asked me if we could import a non-stock product. I was more than happy to help (since it's my fucking job)...  
  
I informed Andrew that I needed to review the customs regulations before providing an answer. To ensure a thorough investigation, I instructed my secretary to initiate an inquiry into the matter. I knew exactly what I was doing. It's worth noting that the secretary included Noah in copy.   
  
Upon Noah's discovery of the email, he immediately confronted me with an incredulous statement, asking, ""Why did you initiate this inquiry? In the future, when a salesperson approaches you with such queries, you should direct them to me!"" I couldn't help but be taken aback by his audacity. After all, I am the owner of the company, and it's my resources at stake here.  
  
To clarify, the inquiry I initiated was entirely appropriate and not in error. However, Noah's unwarranted assertion was nothing short of a significant overstep. It left me wondering if his reaction was influenced by my willingness to be friendly and courteous earlier. His behavior clearly exceeds acceptable boundaries. I couldn't speak up at the moment but I did say something along the lines of, ""I told him to sell the client the alternative in-stock brand but the client declined."" As if I was explaining myself to my own fucking employee. I wish I said something like, ""I know what I'm doing. You don't have the authority to question what I'm doing."" I promise you, Reddit, that if he said it in a better way, I would've accepted it. But now he's acting like I'm his employee. I'm starting to break down in front of his very own eyes since it's probably triggering some inner trauma inside me.  
  
HOWEVER, I find it imperative to establish clear boundaries without delay, as the current working environment is becoming increasingly untenable for me. I recognize the need to address this issue directly and assertively.   
  
What is the most effective approach to handle this situation? Should I adopt an assertive stance, or would it be wiser to focus primarily on my own learning and development? Do I get aggressive with him and shut him the fuck up? Should I set boundaries by telling all sales personnel that they should consult with me first before approaching Noah? What do I do?  
Thank you for reading.  
  
Your insights would be greatly appreciated.

I am now scared that if I will start adding my colleagues to LinkedIn that it will start gossip about why I haven’t made an account before or the fact that I will have very little connections.

16zwzfl,Am I being taken advantage of?,"Throwaway account...

I work for a Managed Services Provider in a large city in Kentucky.  I am a Senior Systems Engineer and also play backup to our IT Director when he is out of the office or generally unavailable.  We are a fairly new MSP and are really starting to ramp up.  Each month is busier than the last as we are onboarding new customers at a good rate.  I have been working here for a year, and the amount I've learned while in this role is insane.  I'm very grateful to be gaining the level of exposure that you just don't get from an in house IT position.  I am paid 15% below the Louisville Market average rate for my position.

My main job function is to complete projects for our customers.  That's anywhere from installing a new backup solution in their environment, to building out new virtual infrastructure and migrating the customer to said environment and everything in between.

My secondary role is to work Service Tickets that are escalated up from our Helpdesk and Tier 2.

From my perspective, I do not have to be managed; My boss trusts me in that when he needs something done, he goes to me and knows I will take care of whatever it is, without having to ask me about it.

I am **consistently** at the **top** of the leader board in closed service tickets, even more so than the guys who only work service tickets.  I stay at the top of this board while also completing my projects.  I have never been told anything negative about my job performance.  Even during informal review periods, my boss always states ""I will really have to think hard to find something constructive to give you"".

My projects are always on time, and done well, our customers are happy with the work I do for them, I constantly try to go above and beyond outside of the scope of my role to better advance our growing and young department.

I have been asking my boss about a formal performance review, as well as a salary review for almost two months now.  I was told today that I will have to wait until EOY when everyone else gets a raise.  He stated that ""I am fighting hard for you to get an above average raise"".

Here's what I'm getting to:

1. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of
2. A Junior coworker who has been here 1 month longer than me received a raise about 2 months ago, but I'm told I can't get a raise until end of year.  This does not sit well with me as I have the highest performance metrics in our department, and has been that way month after month.

I told HR the same day I found out about the change I would not be able to work Saturday Sunday or past 6. HR said we will negotiate that come the day of schedule and hour changes. 

Not only that but I feel like the entire office is incredibly disorganized, there is no one to train me, and I have no computer that is mine or job description.

16zt8af,I just can't see me being a dry grocery clerk for another 25 years totally burned out,"I've been working for the same company for 25 years making 16.40 an hour full time. I have no desire to move up and been really depressed for several months after I dropped outa college for the 3rd time.

All I can think about is how many people have come and gone over the years and how my current company has gone downhill over the past 4 years or so.

The main issue I'm having is the fact that I've been the only one in my department for the past 4 years after the size of our store tripled. It went from 18 isles to 35 isles. It is literally just me and my department head in dry grocery. My department head works like 12 hours a day at least but stocks very little and leaves me with everything else.

Another issue is I'm only making 3 dollars an hour more than people starting out as, but that's retail for ya.

The final issue is I'm afraid my back my eventually go out. It gets so stiff moving this 40 count water around everyday. It has even gotten hard stocking the bottom two shelves. I've had pain in my knees lately as well. Water is only a small part of my job.

I really wish I didn't drop outa college again, but my issue is I can't seem to accept change. I don't see how I can continue to live like this. My parents are 73 and 72 now. I still rely on them for everything. Really getting worried about were my life is heading. 

Should I just get over myself and learn to accept what I have and just never move outa my parents house? Or is 25 years experience that I have enough to help me get a different job. Perhaps one that is not as physical?

16zt3vu,Worried being “too nice” has ruined my (28F) reputation with some co workers.,"Recently moved departments at my company that I love. I’m generally a very nice person. I smile a lot, give compliments, and I listen really well. I’m also very good at my job. I have never considered how my friendliness may come across as negative until recently.

I have two co workers who seem annoyed with me when I’m in the office. I’ve tried to be nice to them and ask questions about them, but they seem annoyed and closed off with me. For example, they’re open and friendly to almost everyone else but really quiet with me. When I got married, my company gave me a card and they were the only ones on the team who didn’t sign it.

I can tend to be really “peppy” (it’s a natural thing for me) and sometimes I can over share a tad bit (nothing too personal, just things that don’t need to really be said). I never thought of my positive personality as a negative, but recently I’ve been wondering if being too nice can actually have a negative consequence? I’m sure there may be more than these two people who aren’t fond of me, but they tend to make it quite obvious. 

I guess I’m mainly looking for advice on how to proceed/act, or any similar stories? Thank you for reading.

16zr1zf,Would Like Advice On Degree For Career Interest,"Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the best sub for this question, if it isn't then please feel free to let me know where I should post instead and mods feel free to delete this post. Sorry for the long text.

&#x200B;

I have started college again as a continuing education student but have access to all degrees listed on my school's website. My career goals are to be an Executive in the for-profit music industry, eventually own my own Music Publishing company, and possibly open an event/music equipment rental company with my fiance (who is an audio engineer). 

During this past Spring semester I was majoring in Arts Administration with a concentration in Commercial Music Industries. I took courses like Music Business, Arts Management, Music Publishing, Marketing, and Entertainment Law. In the Spring, I had taken all major courses that dealt with the music industry but starting this Fall semester was going to do work in the major's non-profit side, which I am not interested in. Additionally, the major does not have the business courses I feel are necessary to understand business well. Because of both of these things, and some health issues, I changed to an online Business Administration degree this Fall semester. 

Today I had an advising appointment where I was asked if I knew what I wanted to do as a career. I explained what I wanted to do and was told that Business Administration is a general major and most students go into it because they don't know what they want to do as a career. I was told that by not specializing in a sector of Business Administration, like marketing or finance, I would be competing with all of the undecided students plus the students taking Business Admin. to be well-rounded. That a company would be more inclined to hire me if they saw a specialization versus the general Business Admin. degree. I was then told that a Management major would be best due to my career goals. 

I'm not sure if the Business Admin. statement from the advisor is correct and need some advice on whether it may actually hurt my career prospects if I major in Business Administration as opposed to Management. I'm stuck because if I change to management I would have to stay in school for an extra semester, graduating in Fall of 2025 instead of Spring 2025. However, if I major in Management, I am 2 classes away from having an Entrepreneur minor, which I can fit into the schedule and still graduate in the Fall of 2025. If money wasn't a factor, I wouldn't mind spending an extra semester in school if it means I am a better candidate in my career.

For my career goals, I wanted to enter the for-profit music industry as an assistant or an entry-level position that can eventually get me into publishing or synch licensing. Then work my way up as a manager, then eventually becoming an executive. Once I get enough experience in the field, I'd like to open my own publishing company and then possibly an events/music equipment rental company. I have been working on business plans for these future companies and have also been involved in a few projects/things in relation to Music Business, like being the host and co-founder of a music business podcast and being involved as a Grammy U ambassador (a music program from the Recording Academy for college students), where I will be getting an industry professional to mentor me the entire school year. I am also connected to a few industry professionals who are open to helping me get a job in the field when I graduate.

I just want to know what the best course of action in relation to my career goals are. I just need some opinions to make a better, informed decision.

16zr04k,Annoying interview process - should I post a review on Glassdoor?,"Hi all, 

I interviewed with a company for a position recently. They were extremely enthusiastic about me in the interview (their words), but they told me that they would take a moment to make a final decision because my direct supervisor would be on a business trip. 

After 2 weeks of radio silence, I reached out. They then let me know that they've decided to move the position to their office in a  completely different state, and they asked me if moving would be something I am interested in. Remote work would not be an option. 

I am not willing to move (which I made clear in previous interviews), and I am a bit aggravated by this turn of events. I recognize that disappointment could be clouding my perception, so I wanted to know if this is common practice. If not, is it worth leaving a Glassdoor review?

To me, it seems unprofessional that they would shift the position location so deep in to the interview process, but perhaps that is how these things go?",helloworldhello11,5,0.8600000143051147,9,1696435186,2023-10-04 15:59:46,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16zr04k/annoying_interview_process_should_i_post_a_review/,10,2023
16zqxq5,Where to go from here?,"Hi all, just needing some advice on what I should do.

I joined PwC (large accounting/consulting firm)  in the UK 4 years ago. I joined on a rotational programme as a flexible associate which basically means I was not assigned to a line of service and just basically went wherever the business needed me. I did complete my ACA qualification during this time.

My dilemma is that I've spent 4 years at the big 4 but don't really have anything to show for it experience wise. I've been in teams/projects across the business a few weeks to months at a time and have done relatively standard/routine work that anyone could do. Essentially I haven't really built any technical skills or knowledge due to this. I've done 0 audit, but done stints in tax teams، deals teams and internal firm services. However whenever I was on these teams I would always be given relatively simple/routine work as my managers knew I was only there for a short time and would be moving on. 

Now I feel stuck as I am expected to apply internally to specialise yet no team would really like to take me on as I don't have any specific/sufficient level experience that would be expected from an senior associate joining their team.

I'm also struggling to look elsewhere as what do I apply for? I don't have any special/suffcient accounting and tax experience or knowledge that would be expected from someone whose been at the big 4 for 4 years and has the ACA. I'm not sure what jobs I could get that may not require as much experience or find the experience I have useful without basically starting from scratch again in terms of a junior role.

My boss is a woman also & so is the other person in our team. But, we work with male engineers also. 

Let me preface this, my manager is younger, and she’s told us from the start that anytime we need time off, take it. She will gladly allow us any time. She understand life happens & as long as we don’t take advantage of it, she will be very lenient with our schedule. & she has. We also were given opportunities to work from home if that’s possible for us. My coworker is a single mom of 2. She uses the work from home option to work with her children’s schedule.

Well, for the past two months we took over a new departments work & scheduling them. The boss of this department is an older man, and he is a big bully. It doesn’t matter how we do the work, he complains each way. We can’t please him. & he makes up lies about us & tells the owners. So, as a result, the owners have decided we cannot work from home any longer & that since we are not “tenured employees” like the rest of the office, we are the only ones who don’t have this option.

I studied CS for two years and graduated with a bachelor's degree for game design, and went to work in Software at a firm for 4 years wanting to get more experience. 4 years later I had little to show as I was placed on mundane projects that used little to no coding, at most I was fixing bugs and resolving tickets in an enterprise healthcare application.  
  
I left and joined a new company as an Jr Software Engineer who wanted to take me on and give me the experience I wanted. They gave me a six fig salary due to my past work and salary, and all was great.  
  
Fast forward, its been a year here and our team is small. I learned a good bit of JS but it slowed down when our team got stretched thin on other projects and I was left alone to work on other smaller tasks. I started to struggle on some bigger items and got put on a PIP for 30 days with goals of meeting deadlines for assignments.  
  
After scaring myself with reddit and PIP stories I took a look around to see what other opportunities are out there and I feel like I barely qualify as a mid level developer and most things I see on Indeed are significantly lower salaries than would probably pay the bills.  
  
Im feeling like an imposter developer and want to really improve my skills and understanding when looking around or even at overcoming the PIP. What kind of classes or ways can I improve and better qualify for these work that needs to be done?

Last summer I did an internship on a trading floor at a bank in nyc called Cowen but they got bought by TD bank in the last week of the internship so no return offers. It sucked but I was happy with the experience and definitely thought I wanted to be a cash equities trader. However, during my masters this past year I began to love learning valuation like DCF, LBO, etc. but I knew I had needed an internship in IB to do IB. That being said I found valuing commercial real estate to be just as rewarding.

Right now I am beyond miserable trying to make sure I get this right as I love both career paths but ultimately want to do the one that gives me the chance to become the wealthiest. Which will likely make me more wealthy? 

A. Become a sales and trading analyst, grind for a few years and then try and pivot to the buy side prob as an execution dude 

B. Go the CRE route as an analyst in capital markets at a brokerage then eventually move over to the principal side and be in more of an acquisitions and development type role? 

Currently I have a 6 month internship offer at a mid tier brokerage for CRE in DC but ultimately want to be in NY, Boston, or Florida long term. 

Please help it’s been eating me alive. Also open to other career paths except pls don’t recommend comend reits. Thanks all if u need more info lmk

All I want in life is a house near work then a house on a lake with a wife who doesn’t cheat and some kids. Will I achieve this?

16zntqv,"Is going from a Medical Engineering carrer to a Data/it position a potential ""career ending"" moment if I ever want to go back to Medtech/medical engineering ?","I am 24 yo, with a masters degree in Medical engineering, currently working in a lab devices company that's related to medical research. I studied Medical engineering because I was quite passionate about that subject but also because I considered it a ""future"" type of job (an ever growing industry). I was recently proposed an opportunity as a training lead in a big data engineering company (similar to sales force). I am quite open to the idea of moving to a more IT based environement but I cannot quite weight the pros and cons.  
  
**My question is the following:** moving to an IT/Data engineering position, will I ever have an opportunity to work my way back one way or another into the medical field ? I know there are some equivalents but for guys with experience in those domains, what do you think of that situation ? Should I stick to searching jobs in the medical industry (companies like GE Healthcare, Medtronic...) or could it be a good thing to get some experience in data/it engineering in my early carreer ?

16znt44,"I have a weird feeling about tomorrow's interview, should i just go for the sake of it?","  
I am 37(and a female), its not written on my cv, but i guess someone can figure out im in my 30s from my jobs etc. Age is very important in my country.. People over 28 are usually considered older.. Its a bit of a different culture than western european countries. I work in tech. Im a pentester. I have been working abroad since i was 22 but decided to apply to my home country. I applied for a pentester role, and i had an interview with the hr and the team leader. The first question the team leader asked was how old i was. I didnt answer. Then he asked if im going to be ok working with young people cos im old, and the team and the whole company is made of young people. I laughed and said im not really looking for friends or a groom, so im just applying to work there. They told me its a two step process, an interview with them and one with the CEO. The next day the hr called me and told me that 'we are going to go with a different approach, we want to see you face to face'. And i see the interview thats arranged is with the same team leader and a very junior member of the team. All those years this has never happened to me.. Why did they add a junior member to the interview? This is a southern european country where there is no care about insulting anyone in the interview, we dont really follow the protocols that companies do in Uk or the US.., So im a bit afraid i might say. Why did they invite me for this extra round? Why added a very young person? To see how i interact with younger people? To offer me a junior role?

16znsue,How careful should I be about what I say at work?,"Background: I work at a company that really doesn't fire people. Basically, if you're in and you do the absolute minimum, you're fine. It's not quite a corporate business (it's a scientific nonprofit, mostly full of engineers) but operates that way a lot because of government contracts.

I have been working here 2 years just about and I am not one to keep my mouth shut. I talk to everyone the same, I joke with everyone the same, and it's been fine. Recently, I have not had a lot of work to do. I've let my boss know at our weekly tag up meetings, I've let our systems lead (kinda one under my boss) know I need work, and so now I've just started to complain to others because I don't have anything to do. 

I've gotten into trouble in the past because it's know that I will not be in this job forever. I hate the state I currently live in, and my boyfriend and I are very far from family here. Apparently being honest about your intentions with the job are frowned upon? I have stated many times that while this isn't a forever job for me, I want to make the most of it and be as helpful as I can. 

Now, with my complaining about not having work, I brought up an issue that I truly believe is a country-wide issue: the 40 hour work week. Bane of my existence right now, I have nothing to do and yet I'm forced to stay at work even though there's nothing here. I was complaining to an older guy in my section, and apparently he gave a watered down version of that conversation to someone else (whom I hate) in my section. I am certain this person I hate will have ""words"" with my boss over my ""attitude"" because that's the kind of person she is, and I'm wondering if I should really care or if I'm justified in this? My boss doesn't seem to trust me with any ~real~ engineering work (for comparison, my 4 other close in age coworkers are on 4 different projects each right now, while I have none) and I'm not sure how to change his mind if he never gives me anything to do. I've picked up odd jobs recently editing documents, but all the fun is gone. 

Do other people suffer with this? It seems like a weird thing to beg for more work? Should I really hide my feelings at work to avoid awkward boss conversations or should I be honest?",Granite_Johnson,0,0.5,4,1696427490,2023-10-04 13:51:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16znsue/how_careful_should_i_be_about_what_i_say_at_work/,10,2023

I was about a week into training when I was offered a job at a different company, and I was motivated to accept it due to the fact that it was inline with the degree I am pursuing.

16zjiwe,I got promoted and I feel depressed in the new role. Should I stay/leave?,"Started in this company 8 months ago, as an associate. From the beginning I was helping out in the role where I am now, 2 months went by and I was doing 70% of the tasks of this role. At 4 months, I was doing 100% of the job so my manager decided to not to hire someone else but put me in the role.

I was really happy to take the new role. I knew I didn't know everything perfectly but I hoped I will learn along the way. 4 months went by doing the job fully by myself, and I still feel like this job is too tough for me. A lot of things changed in this role during the 4 months, there were new things which I was not prepared for - so I was really stressed, and still stressed If I am doing the new things right. People want me to figure out things by myself because they also can't help me about this whole new situation.

I go to bed and wake up with anxiety, stress, and I don't want to leave my home. I lost interest in the gym and my friends, I barely have any social life since this role. I feel really ashamed that it is taking so much impact on me and I feel really ashamed to want to leave a job after less than a year.

My question is how bad is it to hand in 2 months notice for a role after 4 months, and a company after 8 months. Should I keep going to have at least 1 year experience overall in this company (4 more months to go) or should I look for another job hoping it wouldn't affect me as bad as this one.",Odd-Presence-4465,3,0.8100000023841858,5,1696415193,2023-10-04 10:26:33,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16zjiwe/i_got_promoted_and_i_feel_depressed_in_the_new/,10,2023

16zhwlb,"After Making Other People Millions, I Am Living In Poverty","So as I embark on this new journey as someone with literally NOTHING to lose, I have finally decided to swallow my proverbial pride and start working towards making myself a lot of thatoney I have spent the better part of two and a half decades earning for other people.  
I have come to this conclusion after:  
1. Losing out on $150,000 in grant money that was pretty much tailor made for folks like me, only to see multiple projects that were funded out of this money get it with far less of a need or even a project as important because I have been in the shadows and not the forefront of my industry for too long.

  
2. I have ghostwritten evergreen content that converted into incredibly high figures for various companies while earning at most, pennies per word. Had I invested even half that time and effort into my own websites, I could be earning six figures by now.

  
3. I watched my home, my life, my career, and my personal self image go down the drain during Covid, leaving me to live in a converted metal storage shed that is in a friend's backyard. My significant other of ten years REFUSES to contribute and my meager income has left us at below the poverty level, and even my equipment to earn more- laptop, printer, etc, was recently stolen from our ""home"" and I am now writing thousands of words per week on a crappy government cell phone.

  
4. I will soon turn 50, and have so little to show for it I am ashamed that I have to start all over, yet I want to do SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO AT LEAST GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO sleep in a real bed, not a mat on the floor. It hasn't been easy and I have admitted this to very few people but this nightmare has to end eventually, and I am certain that my skills, talent, experience, education and connections have to be worth enough to get me through the initial hoops of starting my own small business.

  
5. My idea is nothing new, in fact, it is just a few side hustles combined into what might be a decent e-commerce site. I have done well in the past with thrift store reselling, jewelry that I design, art prints from my collection and friend's work, Tarot card readings, and other types of selling....maybe I can offer the readings with a course and my own e-book/deck? I can also do digital downloads and print on demand products. Affiliate links? Blogs that are marketed via social media to drive traffic to those? I know that there are successful Amazon sellers using my ghostwritten content to STILL generate decent profits, even after years on the market! I have to find out if funding exists for folks like me, despite my circumstances, and if I can use that to start and scale my business, beginning with replacement of my home office. I know that I can surely find a used laptop that is able to handle these tasks. As for the website and hosting? I think if I was able to get even $2k I would be able to make it rain, so to speak.  
My goal is not unachievable, and yet I am overwhelmed with so much thinking I gave yet to figure out how to even begin the first steps. Advice , encouraging words? Anyone been in my situation and gotten to the other side? How long did that take? Should I just forget it and keep doing these stupid freelance assignments for $5 an hour while my content is earning my clients 100x that each day? I am at a loss.  
But right now I appreciate you reading this far. I am not new to Reddit, been here since 2015. But this 8s my fresh new start profile, and I look forward to this chapter in my life.  
Nice to meet you!  
I am Anastasia. I am ready to finally take on the world. Can you help?

The issue is that, since college, I've been all over the map in my career. I've never been anywhere longer than a year. Some of my experience is highly relevant, some of it is me working as a grocery store clerk when I wasn't able to find the right role in marketing/communications. My most recent career-driven role was at a start-up and they fired me after six months. It was such a bad experience that for the past five months I took a break to just work part-time as a barista.  


My resume makes me feel so discouraged. In my day-to-day life I have a decent amount of self-respect and qualities I admire myself for, when it comes to anything to do with my career I start to feel pretty worthless and defeated. When put up against anyone else's for the roles that I'm applying for I know my resume is weak, but I can't go back in time. It's not like I'm looking to apply for the most senior roles at the best companies either.

For the past year, I have been strugling mentally and feeling stress constantly. I talked to my boss about this and at first he was very understanding and told me to take some time off, I took 3 days that time (that was like 2 months ago). 2 weeks ago, I was not feeling well, and was feeling drained, I asked for 5 more days off (I have 14 days off remaining) and this time he told me no, that it was the worst time possible to take time off as we had things to deliver and that he is himself working 18+ hours per day. I told him okay and I did not take the time off. Since that day, I am thinking of quitting everyday.

16zduf6,Does the type of bachelor's degree matter?,"I'm interested in getting a bachelor's degree.  I was working on getting my bachelor's in English when I fell off the wagon back in 2019 when COVID hit.  I've just been generally struggling to really get back into school since becoming a single mom, but I'm planning on changing that soon.

My heart is more with the English degree.  But logically I feel like the HR degree may open more doors for me if I'm planning to go down the HR path for a while.  I just don't know if I'll want to stay in HR long-term.

  
Will getting a bachelor's in English make it harder to fight for higher pay in HR or any other field?  Or will the bachelor's degree itself be enough to be paid more?

16zdq3k,I’ve been doing my boss’s job for years due to her neglecting her responsibilities. Am I wrong for having done so?,"To give a bit of background, I have worked at a public health research company for the past three years in a pharmacy site coordination and subject support role. Starting out, I loved my boss. She was fun and personable, and never took things too seriously. However, I quickly began to notice that on the days of the week she asked me to be in office, she’d often come up with an excuse why she couldn’t come in, or why she had to leave 4 hours early. This was particularly frustrating, as we work in a basement office in a bad part of town, and I was uncomfortable being there alone. 

For the first year as I was learning the ropes of the role, I didn’t have too many responsibilities, so I wasn’t much bothered by the workload or aware of any coming disparities. However, that all changed when our department merged with the call center, and another employee joined our department. I found that during this second year, I had taken on more responsibilities which included training this employee as well as managing them for the most part. It was also during this time that I started to notice my boss not being on calls or being absent until 2 or 3 in the afternoon on any given 8-4 workday. I started to become frustrated that me and this other coworker were doing 90% of the work while my boss was away doing who-knows-what.

These frustrations all came to a head when this additional coworker was laid off, beginning my third year at the company. At this point, I’d been promoted to the highest rank outside of manager within this role, and my boss had expressed multiple times that she didn’t want other departments to take me away from her, ultimately capping me at the highest I was “allowed” to progress in the company. 

I knew how to do all the tasks the department required, and I again noticed a steady decline in the amount of work my boss was contributing to a growing workload, as well as her general availability to me. I’d email her questions and she wouldn’t respond for hours. Urgent Teams messages would go unread for sometimes whole days. I began to feel anxious that other departments would take her silence on task requests as an overall silence from our department, so I began to act as the sounding voice and task rabbit for us both, making sure to respond to tasks without checking in with her, as it began to seem like there was no point. Three months ago, as these issues were at their worst, I was informed by her that she was going to rehab, and would be away.

I assumed her departmental roles during these three months, but honestly, didn’t notice much of a change in workload, as I was already doing most of the work before anyways. However, I mentioned to her boss, who became my boss during this time, that I had extra time on my hands and was eager to explore potential new roles that would help me grow within the company instead of stagnating in this department. While my manager was away, we agreed upon a new job position for me, which would allow me to stay in my current department, but take on other projects with a pay increase.

Upon my manager’s return from rehab, she seemed eager to pick up her old roles (which she hadn’t really been fully participating in for 2 years), and assured me she would be better. For a few days, this seemed to be true, however, two weeks in I was noticing the same patterns. She would often unexpectedly be offline, or wouldn’t respond or check in until late in the afternoon. I want to pause here with a disclaimer—I understand that addiction is terrible and hard to deal with, and rehab and all the emotional trials that come with becoming sober are very serious. This is why I felt it hard to bring up my concerns with her lack of work, I had no real baseline for what she was comfortable with or where she was at emotionally in terms of returning to work.

In my mind, I was being helpful by completing tasks that she’d seemingly not had enough time to complete before the end of the day, or perhaps had forgotten about. Again, the anxiety of having other departmental heads think our department was not doing its job drove me to become obsessive over completing things quickly and responding to messages on our department’s behalf.

Today, she called me and frankly chastised me for doing the tasks that she had said she would get around to, even if they were hours or days past due. She told me that she’d had intense conversations with her boss, who had implied that if I was doing all the work for both of us, then there possibly was no need for her to be with the company anymore. She bluntly told me to back off, which of course I respect, however, put in a biting comment about me changing positions within the company.

I felt terrible. I did genuinely think I was being helpful, and I’m confused and hurt from this situation. I guess my question in all of this is—am I the asshole? Have I, objectively, done anything wrong in this situation, or do I just not need to take this personally? I’m having a bit of career identity crisis, and can’t help but now feeling deeply guilty for asking for a new position that effectively makes her role as manager more complicated at this point (even though that was never my intention). I honestly feel that our working relationship has been irreparably damaged, and I don’t know if I can make her trust me ever again. However, there’s another bitter side of me that feels a bit vindicated that she’s only upset that I’ve been doing her job because her boss has finally taken notice, and she may have to face consequences now. I’m just in a weird spot.

TLDR: Been doing my boss’s job for the past two years and only after she returned from a 3-month stay in rehab is she chastising me for doing so. Why do I feel so guilty, and am I in the wrong for seeking a new job position at the company not in her department while she was away?",Rose-Raven,9,0.7699999809265137,8,1696393942,2023-10-04 04:32:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16zdq3k/ive_been_doing_my_bosss_job_for_years_due_to_her/,10,2023
16zcwsc,33 year old college dropout making 50k a year,"Years ago I sort of decided I was just happy to live my life instead of chasing a career at some company I don't care about, and that doesn't care about me. I have my little 10k 401k, a Porsche worth about 20k, a VW worth about 10k, some designer clothes and shoes, haircuts every 2 weeks, some nice electroinics, and other cool stuff. I have money in the bank, no debt, and I'm neve late paying rent for my 1 bedroom apartment.

Yeah it would be nice earning more money, I just don't feel like  having money leads to happiness. And I don't feel like there would be a significant lifestyle change if I suddenly started earning 10k a year more. 

I'm not talking about being irresponsible, I'm not living beyond my means, but I feel like I have a lot of cool shit and a good lifestyle.

Anyway, I was just Google'ing ""50k a year Reddit"" and it seems like everyone is making significantly more and the people earing around 50k are living in the poor house. I don't get it.

16zbn48,Struggling in school and need career advice?,"
Im almost 21 and i’ve dropped out of school because I’m really lost in what I want to do but mostly because i have really struggled in school and i really need advice on what to do. I’m a very slow learner and it takes me a very long time to grasp material in school (especially with science and math). I’ve also been dealing with some debilitating anxiety that has prevented me from living my life but i’ve been on medication and hopefully it will be easier to deal with. 

Some things about me and what i’m looking for:
I love helping people, and I love being creative. I like animals too, and things like beauty, fashion, crafting, decorating, all that stuff. I really don’t want to work in an office but if i have to i will. I really want freedom in life but i also want some regimen with a routine of having a steady job and income. 

I’ve considered a career in healthcare, especially an associate degree like ultrasound or becoming an OTA because I love helping people, but i don’t think i’ll have the ability to handle it with how difficult the schooling can be and with the stress of going through the schooling. 

I’ve considered becoming a teacher or maybe a specialized health/art teacher, but i’m worried if i go back to school to get my bachelors and masters and end up becoming so stressed out with children and the school system I will regret the choice I made.

I’ve also thought about going for an esthetics program, but my area is so over saturated with them and I just feel like I would not be making on any livable income. 

I’m not trying to sell myself short, I just want to get school over with, but i’m willing to put in work I just don’t think I can handle mentally the stress of it and going for a long period of time too. I would really appreciate any advice on a good career or what to do from anyone who has also struggled, anyone who is or has been in similar fields or any feedback of any kind (and i’m so sorry this is so long thank you for taking the time to read this).",bbqsauceeeee,2,1.0,0,1696387602,2023-10-04 02:46:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16zbn48/struggling_in_school_and_need_career_advice/,10,2023
16zah5s,Hired full-time after internship - my boss is now my coworker - tips?,"I completed a marketing internship this summer and was fortunate to land a full-time role from it. I did May-August as an intern and began my full-time role as a marketing specialist at the end of August. My supervisor from summer is now my coworker (also a marketing specialist). I like her and think that we get along well, however it is kind of strange going from her being my superior to now a coworker.

Over the summer, I would go to her with questions or for projects. We still had our marketing manager, but she was primarily responsible for supervising me. Now that we are coworkers, I report to the marketing manager. In many cases, I feel like it makes more sense to go to my coworker with questions about projects since she is also working on them directly and knows about the tools we use more than our manager (since she uses them daily/weekly and he doesn't). I like our manager, but i don't want to ask him a question that he will ask her if I could just go directly to the source. But I also don't want to ask her questions and increase her workload or have her feel like she is still supervising.

16z8rne,Struggling To Find My Spot,"Hey everyone! This may be a bit long winded so I’ll try to keep it short. 

I’m a 25 year old M. About 5 years ago I started as an OSR with a start up marketing agency. It was my first “big guy job” so it was a really cool just to get the experience and get out of my warehouse job. 

It was during the time of Covid and I was 21 so as you can imagine - not an easy gig. 

When everything shut down I got moved in house to operations where I learned Meta ads, Google ads, SEO, all the standard digital marketing tactics. 

As I progressed in that role over the course of 3 years, I eventually made it to Project Manager (not sure how legit it was as it was a startup so people are hard to come by) 

I learned A LOT in that role. I loved it. I got to meet with clients on their strategy, clients, my supervisors, and my team loved what I did. I got to work with vendors, make hiring decisions, I even pioneered a lot of the processes and service renderings they originally didn’t offer. 

Flash forward about a year later (now 4 years into this company) I started to wonder what else was out there and really wanted to expand my career in other areas. I brought up going back to school which was met by my supervisors at the time with the option to either keep my role and don’t go back to school, go back to school but get demoted, or take a severance and leave the company. 

Scared for finances I ultimately chose option 1 which led to them terminating me about 2 months later (they gave me severance and I got to keep my tech stack which was great) 

I brushed up my resume and got a lot of interviews which led to two offers about a month and a half later. The offer I accepted was 3X what I was making and had benefits. 

About 2 months into that gig I was terminated without warning because they “wanted someone with more technical expertise”

After that, I came came down to the wire at a company locally that went with someone else because they had a role better suited for my strengths in the future. I then landed a contract position for a week which ultimately did not get extended. Their reasoning was “poor role fit.” 

I’m now looking again for another position and I’m at my wits end. I’ve considered that maybe I’m not smart enough for the industry I’m in and I should just shift gears altogether. At the same time, the side gigs that I’ve done with other businesses all highly regard my work and I hear how impressed they are with what I do. I called the CEO at the first company and they mentioned how I’ve definitely been missed and the opportunity to come back is potentially there. 

Do you think I’m smart enough for the industry I’m in? Am I getting screwed over (if this is the case this speaks more to my personal judgement)? Is the problem employers?

Any advice helps! Thanks!",Austin-MMarketing,1,1.0,0,1696379865,2023-10-04 00:37:45,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16z8rne/struggling_to_find_my_spot/,10,2023

I had told him I had previous experience of running a business, and my aim is to do my own business, eventually. He then asked me about any ideas I had currently and I shared a few of them. Having some technical background himself he volunteered to create a website for one of my ideas, and I obviously was thrilled. I gave him a draft web flow and he got back to me about it today (4 days) and told me that he was working on the website and if all goes well we might have investors for it as well. I’m very thrilled about it, cause opportunities don’t come like this. However, I’m still a bit skeptical, during our conversation I did talk about money being an important factor in starting my own business, but never spoke about investors or anything, and for 4 days he didn’t give me any update about anything. I don’t know how to go about this, like he just took my ideas, which was pretty brief and now he says he got investors and some structure for the website? Where do I come into this?

Then I got a scholarship to do a masters in org change management so now I'm doing that. The problem I have now is that my CV is terrible. For various reasons, covid, age, misalignment, whatever, my previous career (in museums) died about four years ago and I supported myself by doing technical jobs I had almost no interest in. It was a survival job. There was very little growth and I wasn't connected to the culture or co-workers in any meaningful way. I became very depressed and recently walked away to prioritise my mental health. 

I feel a lot better now and want to start my new career. However I have only irrelevant jobs on my CV. I can't seem to even get a basic coordinator job. I have thought about interning but those opportunities seem to be largely for young graduates and that would lead to further misalignment. Transferrable CV applications also seem pointless as recruiters can't seem to understand me as a candidate. I have a lot to offer but can't work out how to get people to recognise my value in a regular application process. Maybe I still have a mindset issue from the depression idk.

I'm in the final stages of receiving a job offer. The recruiter and I have verbally agreed on a comp package, which is currently under approval. He told me to expect the formal offer letter within 3-4 days.  
During our comp discussion, the recruiter let me know that he offered the maximum he's authorized to give. While it's a significant increase from my current salary at an early-stage startup (unknown to him FWIW), it's also about $20K less than my target, given the role and the salary research I've done on this company. I tried to negotiate for a higher amount but received little flexibility. He told me that the offer was already carefully reviewed and that the company has thousands of other applicants for the role.  
About 30 minutes after the call, he called to let me know that my counteroffer wasn't approved. So, I verbally accepted the initial offer.  
I'm left with a couple of questions:

1. Did I undermine my position by possibly signaling that I'd probably accept the offer regardless?
2. Is there room to negotiate further without jeopardizing the offer?

16z4sdb,Found out co-workers are making 35% more than me,"I'm currently navigating a situation that's new to me, and I'd really appreciate your insights and advice. I recently started my first professional career as a software developer with a salary of 53k CAD. My colleagues and I are all doing the same job and have the same number of years of experience, having worked as developers during internships.  
  
I've discovered that some colleagues, with identical experience levels, are earning signifcantly more for the exact same work. I accepted my current salary initially, but I'm beginning to feel undervalued, especially considering the complex work I'm handling. It's worth noting that I'm still in the training phase, and it's only been a few weeks since I joined.  
  
Adding to the complexity, iam technically an employee of one company (Company A) but am subcontracted to work for another company (Company B), and they bill the client for my work. When I first inquired about a higher salary, I was told that it wouldn't be considered until I gained a few more years of experience. I never brought it up again after that.  
  
Here are my main concerns:  
  
\- Should I wait until after training to discuss my salary concerns, or is it appropriate to bring it up now, considering the contractor arrangement?  
\- How do I approach my supervisor or HR about feeling undervalued compared to colleagues with the same experience, given the subcontracting situation?  
\- Should I mention my coworkers' salaries, or should I focus on explaining why I believe I'm being underpaid based on industry standards?  
\- Given the circumstances, should I even consider looking for a new job this early in my career, or is it too soon to make such a decision?  
  
Since this is my first professional career job, I'm not sure how to navigate these waters, and I'm feeling a bit lost. Any advice, insights, or personal experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated.

- 37 years-old and live about an hour north of NYC.

-BA in history, associates (+some additional courses, never finished second BA) in visual communication/ graphic design.

-14 years in current job, lead lab technician for an in-house optical lab. In this position, I make glasses, maintain machines, do central purchasing, inventory, lots of paperwork, train new employees, team lead, etc. Dealing with private medical information as well.

-7+ years part-time work for an art marketing company. I maintain their Shopify sites, edit photos, take photos, SEO, data entry on several platforms, contact their clients, coordinate events, maintain social media.

Hello guys,
I am at a bit of a cross roads here. I’ve been working at my current job for almost two years. It’s gotten pretty toxic and highly stressful. We recently had an entire change in upper management all the way up to vice president so a bunch of senior managers got booted and replaced. The new team has started changing behaviors that no longer align with my values.  My manager quit at some point and I was able to apply for the position to hopefully get promoted. Fast forward I didn’t get the job because I’m not there yet. However, the position was given to someone in a lower position and has not been at the company as long as me. Other than that, the regional manager likes to make jokes that are not professional and also hurt me. I am working 3 peoples jobs right now and will continue to do so until the new manager is finished training. And I’ve been alone now in the office for 2 months already. I’m burnt out, angry, and annoyed. 

I’ve been applying to jobs and so far I have 1 offer. It’s for a lower paying job but it pays 2 dollars more and comes with more growth because they know I want to move up in their company. What do I do? Should I take a chance? Will this look bad transitioning to a non management title on a resume?

16z0z0f,Law firm has communicated very little and has not informed me of my job status.(AL),"I work for a small law firm in the US. I work as a Paralegal and I am remote. While I live in the same state, I am 7 hrs away in Northern Alabama while the firm is located in Southern Alabama. Without going over my entire history, I've worked there a year and had a salary contract. The contract was terminated due to financial resources (Small firm taking on big cases and ignoring smaller ones). I was kept on as ""hourly commission"" meaning I didn't get paid a flat rate but paid for the time I did actual work. I reported my hours every pay period. My duties went from doing work for any case and some administrative duties to only doing work under one attorney.

Now apparently there is an issue with the 2 attorneys in charge, the one I directly work for and the owner of the firm. The attorney I'm under has apparently resigned (but his resignation wasn't accepted) which has left my job status in a limbo. 

As of right now I haven't received any communication from the attorney I worked under nor from anyone else in the firm. I am at the point where I am unsure if I have a position there still and unsure what to do.

My question is, while I am aware with Alabama laws I can be terminated with no reason given or prior warning, can a company or the firm fire someone and not communicate it at all?",adrishta96,1,0.6700000166893005,3,1696361183,2023-10-03 19:26:23,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16z0z0f/law_firm_has_communicated_very_little_and_has_not/,10,2023

As the title states.  
  
I started at this company about a year ago, and was hired as a 'technical manual coordinator' where I would write out instructions for our user manuals, and work with an outsourced illustrator to draw our images.  
  
Since starting I realized I could do that, and have been writing and illustrating our manuals completely. On top of that I have been working with marketing to take over datasheets and product labels. Soon we are going to be redoing our product catalog, which I will take lead on.  
  
Anyways, yesterday my supervisor informed me that since I am taking on more responsibilities my job title and pay should be adjusted. She said pick whatever encapsulates my duties, but I'm not quite sure what way to lean. Definitely want to lean more design / marketing related, since that's where my true passion is, but my salary is already higher than the average GD salary for my area.  
  
I guess I'm just not sure since the job is pretty niche, and seems like a mix between technical writing / graphic design / and marketing. I know job titles are not really that important, but I have an opportunity to pick my own, so thought I would reach out for help.

16z0ddd,I don’t like my new job. Help.,"I’ve been at my new job for 2 months now and I really don’t like it. The position seemed interesting and exciting on the posting and during the interview, however, it’s not what I thought it would be. I’m basically a glorified assistant doing administrative tasks for everyone on the team, and I hate admin work. 

My manager is very busy. She’s in meetings all day and sometimes will just send me tasks to do and I’ll have to figure out how to do them on my own. There wasn’t anyone in my role for a year or so - so no one on the team even knows what my responsibilities are supposed to be and what I’m suppose to be doing. My manager also just announced her pregnancy, so she will be going on Mat leave for atleast 12 months early next year. They are only hiring a 6 month replacement for her. 

The team I work with is boring. They are all much older than me and are very “surface level”. Difficult to even have a non work related conversation, questions as simple as “how was your weekend” get diverted back to work related things. 

Pay was suppose to be an increase from my last job, but after benefits and pension deductions, I’m making basically the same as my last job. 

I only go into the office twice a week but have extreme anxiety. I get so nervous and scared and literally will cry the night before because I just don’t want to go. The commute is also very frustrating. My last job was ~20 minute drive, and this time is over an hour sometimes with traffic. The hours are not flexible, you have to be there on the dot.

I am currently a marketing manager and have been at my company for 2 years, so it’s a logical next step. I randomly get a call from my boss, and he shared that the job title was downgraded to marketing manager (my current title), but he still wants me to continue the application process. This role has always been held by a senior, but my boss said because no new innovations/product launches are in the pipeline, the scope of the role has changed. 

The product role I’m applying for better aligns with my career goals and I’d still take it, however it’s a more technical role and it’s a lot bigger/more responsibility. However, since my job title is still technically the same, do I have any leverage to negotiate salary?

I feel like there is a need for a higher level of tech understanding from product managers, especially someone who understands the downstream work associated with a requirement or feature enhancement. I also like talking to people and leaning towards the business side of things. 
 
Just trying to see if anyone else did this and do you regret it?

16yyi89,Keep grinding in my current situation for another year or two or make a change sooner and stop borrowing sorrow for tomorrow?,"I've gone WITHOUT a bachelors degree for 20 years. I am over 40 and find myself...basically stuck at my parents because I can't realistically afford to live on my own. I'm working on an online bachelors degree and I have 2 options...I can get a supply chain degree and it will take me significantly less time...possibly less than 6 months left OR I can continue on the accounting track and I'm looking at a year ...maybe a year and half till I finish.  
I can see the value in either of these degrees, I know accounting is the ""grand pubah"" of business so to speak and I definitely see it's value whether I use it to become an accountant or not but the supply chain degree could put me out on my own and in a good paying job much faster where I will finally be able to be independent.  
In reality, at my age I need good ROI and I realize that every job sucks so I'm not trying to be idealistic...I think I'd like both jobs just the same as I have every other (which is not so much) and having my independence back and finally being able to have my own place, privacy and independence is MOST important so hence why finishing a year faster is much more attractive but I don't know if I'm just being antsy.

16yxt2k,How to make it through the professional world with severe mental health disorders?,"Hi all - I'm a 32 yo with a masters degree and relatively ""prestigious career"". I graduated from high school a year late and it took me 6 years to finish my bachelors. I went straight into my masters degree while struggling with severe mental health issues and alcoholism. I made it through along w an internship during the duration of grad school but it left me burned out to the point of having to take a year off from school and work. 

The past few years have been great for me while I build my career. Im coming up on my 4th year in the spring. I've stabilized myself and been able to manage my health without too many disturbances. 

I've carved my own path and prioritize my health above all. I will never sacrifice my health for my job. I have an ADA exemption for in office requirement. I don't work a traditional 9-5 schedule. I'm not invested in office politics and don't care about work friendships. However in spite of being the weirdo at work I excel. I've overhauled the program I manage completely while also taking on and excelling at special projects all under 40 hours a week typically. 

My performance review this year in July was all 2s and 3s. 2 is typical and getting a 3 is difficult, having gotten nearly as many 3s as the biggest overachievers in the office (working 20+ hours, schmoozing, etc). However my boss' comments alluded to and mentioned some of my issues - ""in spite of his difficulties, he has excelled"". During my performance review meeting in July my boss asked me what my career goals are. I told him ""I've reached them. I'm chilling. I enjoy what I do"". 

He's trying to push me towards a promotion track for a management position that I do not want. Im in a project/program management role where I get to work on a lot of technical projects that I really enjoy. I was promoted last year, same position but higher grade.  I like doing field visits, working late into the night on whatever project so I can chill out over the next few days, etc. I have <5 hours of a meetings a week. That'll easily jump to 20+ in a management role as well as not being able to work the things I enjoy that I went to college for. 

I don't want to make more money. I already make more money than most people and built a healthy retirement portfolio that will allow me to retire in my mid-late 40s completely. My life has been hard enough (childhood sexual and physical abuse) and now that I've made it I just want to enjoy the fruit of my labor. However this is completely at odds to the ethos of the corporate world and it's becoming increasingly clear that I'm at odds with management even though my performance is well reviewed. My therapist and father have suggested looking for a new job but I don't think it'll be different anywhere else. 

I struggle because in spite of all the medication, therapy, experimental trials and managing my health well- I'm still very much an odd ball that doesn't really fit in anywhere.",itsezraj,1,1.0,0,1696353652,2023-10-03 17:20:52,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16yxt2k/how_to_make_it_through_the_professional_world/,10,2023

I graduated in 2022 with a degree in Product Design with Marketing and Innovation. Before that, I managed a fast-food restaurant and worked in a supermarket's fruit and veg aisle.

For the past three years, I've been at a corporate gifting/branding company. This company acts as a middleman, supplying staff gifts, branded items, and personalized event items through various suppliers. During my time there, I've worn many hats.

I've dabbled in web management using WordPress, Elementor, CSS, and HTML. I even completed a CSS & HTML coding course recently. I've managed all of the company's social media and email marketing, handling graphic design for these platforms and various printed materials.

On the tech side, I've managed our CRM, transitioning from Active Campaign to Hubspot and integrating it with our accounting software (Xero) using Zapier. IT troubleshooting, PC fixes, and setting up various tech-related aspects were also part of my role.

I've even dabbled in sales, contacting clients, providing quotes, and ensuring their needs were met.

But now, I'm in a bit of a career dilemma. I'm interested in IT-related fields, but I often don't meet the usual job requirements. I'm also considering graduate programs. On top of that, the idea of starting my own business, similar to my previous employer, utilizing AI, intrigues me.

I've applied for marketing roles, even though I'm not entirely sure if that's where my passion lies. I'm drawn to roles like brand manager or anything involving brand protection and identity management.

Honestly, I'm a bit lost. I haven't found a job that truly excites me and feels like the perfect fit. Your advice and opinions would be greatly appreciated. Please, be candid and expressive.

I currently do some data analysis using basic tools like PowerBI and mostly do administrative work in a business that provides services to schools. In my own words, I’m a big fish in a small pond. 100k/ salary, 6% match 403b. No pto policy, just get work done and take time off when needed. Work from home 2 days a week. Directly report to CEO.
  
My problem is I’m at the top of my business aside from being the literal CEO or CFO. Our CFO and CEO make about 150+k, but the the next ring of leadership is at 100k where I am.  
  
I feel like I have no actual skill set to change jobs and make more money. I don’t have a degree, I haven’t necessarily specialized in anything. I’m just better at tech tools and management than everyone in my office. I highly doubt I’d compete against others in the tech field. Nonetheless, schools need data and the government has compliance requirements, so here I am. For further clarity, I’m the Chief Administrative Officer of this business. My job is just basically get shit done and give people data when they need it.
  
I’m coming up on 3 years and I know in order to increase my salary I need to job hop. The problem is my data analysis skills would get me an entry level data job, but I’ve never done any “real” coding or anything, and the entry level positions pay about 75k. All my admin work is basically managing projects in the realm of grants, annual monitoring compliance, and internal business growth goals.
  
Should I leap into a smaller salary  in data analysis at a corporate place with the hopes of gaining more experience and moving up to higher potential? Do I try and transfer taking advantage of my title even though I know full well my scope doesn’t line up with a CAO in big businesses? I’m just unsure of what I can leverage here in order to land bigger pay somewhere else. I also know my flexibility and benefits are valuable even if not represented in cash, but I’m hesitant to stay with higher potential out there.
  
Any advice is appreciated!

We also lost our director of operations and facilities person and are not replacing. All admin aspects of their jobs have fallen to me. 

It’s a lot. But, I really enjoy my job, my pay has increased along the way (about to request another increase as I just inherited all admin for company vehicle fleet of 20 cars) and the company provides my phone and 75% of my health insurance, so I am not unhappy. Also went 100% WFH about 4 months ago. Company provided all office equipment, etc. but does not contribute anything toward internet, electric, or other expenses that increased due to WFH. 

However, each time a new responsibility falls upon me I am figuring it out on the fly, there is no one to train me, and refining it as I go along. It is stressful and I worry that I could do it better, more efficiently. 

The question: what kinds of classes/trainings can I take that will help me perform in my role more efficiently OR set me up for hire-ability in the future should I need to change my situation. 

Also: just for kicks- what would you assume a position like I’ve described would/should pay?

16ytmae,Employer asking me to resign,"My current employer recently told me they were letting me go. They're stated reasons include the position not being a good fit and budgetary issues. They're being reasonable and giving me some time to hand-off projects and look for a new position before leaving.  
Initially all communications regarding me leaving were kept verbal. I received an email from the office manager yesterday describing the decision for me to leave as mutual (it's not) and asking me to submit a letter of resignation by the end of the week with a final day next month. 

I am trying to decide what my best course of action is. I am currently in an industry where letters of recommendation actually hold weight for future employment so I don't want to burn any bridges on the way out. I feel like my employer is being fairly reasonable in terms of giving me time to transition out of my role, but it's also clear they are trying to make sure I'm not eligible for benefits after I leave.

16ys9d7,Support/Advice Needed; Leaving Job,"I guess I’m not seeking advice as much as support. Looking for someone that’s been in my position before and how they handled it.  I’ve already made my decision I’m just struggling to deal with it.   
  
I’ve been at my current employer for a little over 4 years. I’m going to keep some things vague because while I don’t think my boss is trolling Reddit, I want to be careful. In the beginning, my boss was amazing. The guy went above and beyond for me at every turn. From getting me more money at my first raise to letting me use the company vehicle when my car needed repairs. Helping me locate my current home. Understanding any time I requested off, never gave me shit for it. Personally and even professionally at that point I thought I had hit the mother load of bosses.   
  
Some things happened within the company that caused a need for someone to fill a dual role. This wasn’t anything that was advertised and in fact, since I had the most experience in one of the roles, it was just kind of unceremoniously handed to me to do. So for about 8 months I kicked serious ass. I completed every task thrown my way, and then some.  I was later unceremoniously handed the job to back up any of my counterparts if they are off. So that’s 3…..count them 3 jobs I have to perform, if someone is off. I should note we are a small location with limited employees.   
  
Review time came earlier this year. I had my notes all in order. I had 8 months’ worth of data to present to my boss. I was going to ask him for a couple more dollars an hour to continue to maintain the roles as well as I have been. I didn’t feel this was unfair. Considering how much money the company is saving by not hiring for either of the dual roles, I kind of felt like I was being more unfair to myself than anything, but didn’t want to seem TOO greedy. If my boss had laughed at me instead of saying what he did, I probably would have taken it better. He devalued  everything I did. Everyone has to wear some kind of multiple hats, we’re a small location. The extra work of the 2nd job I took on really only accounts for a very small amount of my time a day (pure bullshit, it’s split about evenly). Asking for a few more dollars an hour for such a small amount of time doesn’t really work out. However, I’m so thankful you do these things, here is an extra 1% on your raise. With that extra 1% my total raise didn’t even amount to a dollar. I even mentioned I had been head hunted for more money but turned it down to give them a chance to make it right. His only response was “I hope you stay.”   To say that I was devastated is a bit of an understatement. I was so confused because if you listen to my boss talk  to anyone, customers, employees, me….he does nothing but sing my praises. Cannot afford to lose me. I’m so smart. I’m a huge part of the wheel that keeps this place going. Words are great and they make you feel good but……….  
I should also mention that after that review it came to light that he made a career choice FOR me, then discussed it with me later. That was kind of the nail in the coffin.   
  
I’ve made it known since then that I’m not actively seeking new employment, however, if the right opportunity drops on me, I’d pursue it. Well, guess what just dropped? An opportunity I’d be a dumbass to pass up. Hybrid schedule to work from home 3 days a week. Company provides EVERYTHING. Insurance is outstanding. Pay is above what I’m making now. The company has a track record of zero turnover and it’s almost impossible to get into because of that. So, I made the difficult decision to pursue this opportunity.   


Has anyone had to make the difficult decision to leave a company that you feel (up until recently) was more than fair to you? Has done so much to help you in your career and personal life? For the majority of the time, liked your boss and got along very well with them?   
  
I feel so much like I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth by leaving after I feel, up until recently, I’ve been treated so well. I just feel that feelings are proven by action, not words, and I don’t think that things are going to get any better here. My boss is a good man, most of the time, but incredibly selfish. Things must benefit him first and if it helps us, all the better.  I believe my interview with the new company went very well, and have very high hopes of a job offer. Putting in my 2 weeks is causing my anxiety to go thru the roof. Any advice on how to weather thru this, if you’ve been thru it before? Most people hate their job and hate their boss and are happy to leave. I care about my co-workers and to a smaller extent my boss. It’s the end result of working in such a small location. I’d not only be leaving them in a lurch….but they’d be royally fucked. For a long while.   
  
Thanks to whomever made it all the way thru this. It’s been weighing so heavily………..

16ypx5j,Bachelors degree or seperate courses?,"Hello everyone!

I am seeking advice for my career as an engineer. Let me give you a short background.  
I am a 20 year old Dutch student currently studying a general form of engineering (associates degree).  I have a passion for anything with a motion system and love tinkering with 3d printers. I have a job at Shapeways (large 3d printing company) and wil soon have an internship in sweden.  In Sweden I will live with my boyfriend and will receive compensation from the eu to make it affordable. After that internship I will graduate and I will receive my associates degree.

My issue is that I want more than just an associates degree. I know I can do more and achieve more and thus I was thinking of doing a bachelors degree. Since education is about 2 grand a year in the Netherlands and the cost of living is impossibly high I was thinking of doing it in Sweden. IThe issue is that I just can't find a suitable bachelors in mechatronics in Sweden.

Do you guys think doing a couple of seperate courses to get caught up to PLC's, Python programming and some other important aspects will do me just as well?

16yonn7,Working to a UK company from Portugal_Will I be able to find a job with my experience? Give me your honest opinion please,"Hi everyone, 

I'm Portuguese and I'm leaving London to return to my country, mainly because of my girlfriend's mental health, she never adapted herself very well to live abroad.
I'm working as Office Administrator/Purchasing Assistant for 1 year and a half, working daily with SAP, creating purchase orders, dealing with suppliers and get confirmation dates for orders. I do the Logistics follow up as well, confirming quotes, tracking shipments, looking for ETD's and ETA's. I do other stuff, but I would say these are my main tasks.
Since I'm working with SAP and Logistics I thought working from home in Portugal to an UK company (or any other country) could be an option.
Let me just make a quick introduction of my professional past. At moment I'm 34 years old. I've a Master's Degree in Public Relations and I did a professional internship after that as Marketing Assistant for 6 months. After that I always struggling to get a job in my field of studies and I ended working in a factory and after that I worked as Freelancer Translator as well. On 2020, I decided to come to UK to see if finally I would have an opportunity. It was toughWith to get a job and I was only able to get one as Manufacturing Assistant. Finally after 1 year I was able to grow in the company and have the job I mentioned initially. I'm fluent in English and I have an advanced level in Spanish and French as well.
I would like your honest and brutal opinion. Realistically, do you think I might be able to get a job for a UK company for example working from Portugal? Do you believe I have the minimum experience to be able to get one job like that? I would like to mention that since I was working from home everytime needed, I asked my employer if working in these conditions in the future would be possible and the answer was no since the company isn't planning to have staff working from abroad.
I really appreciate your time and thank you in afldvance for all your replies.

Kind regards,

I tell about myself in the post, and looking for suggestions.","I (22) am science undergrad (physics and electronics) (from a good college, if it matters), complete about a year ago. I went for it out of interest, but by the end I realized I am not interested in the jobs the field offers, like teaching and research in niche areas.    
  
I don't know what to do now, or how to decide.    
  
.    
    
I don't want to do a job which just gives me money, no knowledge/challenge or anything (maybe for now I can do such a job, but not in long term). It feels like I would just be working to help someone else earn money, which I think is all MBA jobs (YMMV). I have always loved to learn in depth (hence physics). I think stuff like programming, journalism, economics, data security, law, think tanks... are kind of stuff which interest me, probably because these things have some product coming out of them/have real world implications (but don't limit to these, if you are considering to give me some suggestions).    
  
But I don't know how to proceed. I feel like I am late for everything, it would take years for me to make an earning through any of these. I have already wasted a year. I thought pretty late of doing MCA, so only appeared for CUET, and haven't gotten into any decent college. And I have to get into something, either education or job. I feel like I have wasted 4 years of my life. I feel like I have lost, I feel like I won't be able to live a contented life that I am doing something that I like.

\_\_\_  
    
Edit:    
I think I should tell a bit more about me... I get my interest in any subject I decide to do. So, I want to choose a subject/field which can have real implications, that is, the work itself gives contentment, or the skill which is being used can be used to build something. Example for first one is journalism (real one, like some international organizations do), example for second one is programming (which I tried to get into), I can use the skill to work for FOSS. But I don't know what other options are there, or how to get into these. That's why I mentioned above: ""stuff like programming, journalism, economics, data security, law, think tanks...""  
  
Edit 2: I am 22, and have to start earning in 1-2 years, which is another major reason I am not able to choose. (Which is why the last 4 years hurt me more.

16ylc6q,Should you trust your gut feeling with a job offer?,"I recently graduated from university and I've been interviewing with a company and I  have a gut feeling that I'm not going to like it there. I am naturally pretty anxious, but I feel like something is off about this company and I'm struggling to figure out if that's my anxiety or if I should listen to my gut. 

The entire process of interviewing with this company has been long. For this position, I've done 4 interviews and 6 assessments. I've had to follow up with this company regularly throughout the hiring process, and even after following up would have to wait a while before I heard anything back (lack of communication, the first red flag).

A question I tend to ask during interviews is something along the lines of ""What do you enjoy the most about working here?"". The answers I received during my interviews focused on the fact that it is a challenging environment and that there is always something to do. It raised red flags that none of the people I talked to mentioned the culture or work environment in any other way. One interviewer also mentioned that the job was ""demanding"" which raised some more red flags. So I decided to look the company up on Glassdoor and learned that a lot of people seem to have negative things to say about the company (bad work/life balance, turnover rate is supposedly high, bad experience with management/toxic culture from the top). 

There was nothing  wrong with the people I spoke to, they seemed nice enough. The job/benefits/pay are solid, but I can't shake the feeling that this isn't the right environment for me. I just don't know how to go about figuring out if my gut instinct is worth trusting or if I should take the chance with the company and sign the offer.

* Future outlook - college enrollment (at least in my area, but nationwide as far as I know) is dropping like a stone. I need ideas on what field I can transition to in 5-7-10 years if SHTF. I'm 34 so I think I have max 10 years of viability in a new position.

* Side hustle - even if the above isn't going to happen, I'd like to make some side income. I've thought of some things like a consulting business, writing books, etc. but I'd really like to hear everyone's stories about what they do when they don't have work hours. For the record I'm off basically like 15+ weeks of the year and every Friday. I'm willing to learn basically anything as long as it's not going to kill me.

Thanks in advance.",OSP_amorphous,3,0.8100000023841858,0,1696305536,2023-10-03 03:58:56,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16yhxhf/professor_stuck_at_dream_job_need_help_with/,10,2023

However, that same team made a series of bad decisions (most of which I argued against when I was in smaller roles, one of which I'm jointly to blame for) regarding pricing, hiring, capital structure, and overinvestment that have left the company completely out of cash and sitting at over 20X leverage and under 0.5X FCCR.

16yg4bi,Upcoming Vacation right before Hiring,"I've got a one month trip to the middle east booked to meet my partners extended family etc. around the holidays but am entering the (hopefully) closing rounds of a career opportunity that could be huge for my future. I'm only 25 but this position would let me switch from retail management to a more project management track + increase my salary by 50%.

While I understand there's no way to have eat your cake and have it too - I'm wondering what people would recommend I do so that I might still be able to go while still retaining this career move. It's extremely important to my partner so not going is a non-negotiable. 

Should I mention the leave - it's at least partially remote so I'd be more than happy to work from the destination or should I offer to cut it short?

(While unethical - would lying in  few months and saying that my family had an accident and I'm needed to help support them back home be something that a person might get let go over?)

16ye3lj,"Job hopping resume, and a stupid choice... help?","Hello all,

To start off, I (27, M) have a rough job history. I'll shorthand it to start. 

Retail manager (5 years) - 2 month unemployed due to CDL school- local trucking job (1 month) - over the road trucking (2 months)- 4 months unemployed (newborn child, remodeling house due to moving)- commercial truck mechanic apprentice (3 months) - 5 months unemployed ( car fell off a lift and got injured).

Though it was a messy ride, my end goal was to become a diesel mechanic, which my resume kind of shows the story of. The injury threw that way off. 

My savings ran out, and I wasn't healed fully, so I took a job in an office setting, working with individuals with disabilities and helping them enter the work force. Awesome job, rewarding.. and then it went from the company caring about people to profit overnight (new management). I was being told to hold the individuals back in service, as I was ""leaving money on the table"" by putting them through to the next step of service. I came in the last day of employment to find out the basically held back 4 of the individuals I worked with, in order to make more money. Disgusting, and so so wrong. I went to my boss that day, and said I couldn't be a part of milking these individuals in the name of money. They said that's how it is, and I made my departure. Stupid move, but morally I couldn't be involved.

So now I have no job, and my skillset is basically gone thanks to my injury. I can not do labor jobs, and cannot drive commercially anymore due to the injury.  I'm needing an entry level office job to start, long term planning to go to school for computer science. I've made some bad decisions as you all can see, but any recommendations on minimizing the effect of them? Do I say I left this job for moral reasons, or does that make me look horrible? Any job recommendations are appreciated as well, since I'm basically starting over.

16ycmnp,Advice on a potential career path change,"Would changing career paths be a bad choice?

Hi all, I posted in r/careerguidance and got no responses so I'm trying here cos id really like some outside input.

I apologize if this is bit vent-y

I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I don't have anyone irl I can talk to about this and I am in desperate need of some advice/guidance/reassurance.

So up until recently, I was a PhD student in physics. I messed up on the quals and had to switch to the masters program where I wrote a paper with my advisor. It also goes without saying, since I had to switch from PhD to MS, I was not longer getting support from the department so I had to get a job. I ended up getting a job as a chemist at a pretty big company, as It was the first place to get back to me and due to being from a low income family and the job being STEM, I couldn't  hold out for better options.

Now, my advisor is encouraging me to apply to other PhD programs in my field which I definitely am doing, though Its not guaranteed I'll get in this time. But I still want to be prepared for the scenario where I don't get into another program and have to stay with this current job. I'm feeling a bit lost since I'm pretty much learning a whole new discipline from scratch in a field that does not pay very well or have very much crossover with what I researched. Is there anyone that made a similar transition (Physics to Chemistry), and if so how are doing now/how did it go? Am I at a huge disadvantage in the field if I have to stay? Is getting the experience in this role worth it if I can't properly use it without the education other chemists have?

For a more succinct question, assuming I don't get into another PhD program, would sticking in chemistry be poor career choice?

16yb2q5,Law and accounting -> business mastermind ?,"
Hi! I am 22/M who wants to get into business.

In my country I can do undergrad in law and accounting then I can pick if I want to practise law and pass the bar *or* practise accounting and get my cpa
*or* do both, each at his own time.


My main objective is:
starting businesses, software, e-commerce, brick and mortar, small, medium and large. That's what I wanna do in my life, run a business or multiply businesses.

Therefore I will be trying to use to knowledge I get in the university to work my way in the business world and not dive into one profession of what I learned.
My questions are:

Do you think that being proficient in law and accounting will help me navigate the business world easier?

Would you do the same in light of what I just said?


Ps:
A business major is considered worthless and too general in my country, and I can always do a MBA.

16yadwb,"Company acquired, new office is 40 minutes further away","Hi all. I work in a communications role at a company that was just acquired by another company. I work 95% remotely and have no issue getting all my work done remotely. I currently go into the office around once a quarter and my office is 10 mins away (one of the main reason I decided to work here to begin with). My team of three started off fully in office three years ago, then slowly switched to more and more remote to the point where we are now for the past year. 

Now, our new office is 50 mins away. I worry that the new bosses will require us to be more in office (I do communications in finance, which is a more old-fashioned field). Does anyone have any advice for ensuring that I’m able to continue working remotely?

I have already accepted a job offer from the new company. When I asked my boss if our remote working schedule would change (because that would’ve changed whether or not I accepted the position) she said “I don’t know but I don’t think so.” I would absolutely consider leaving if they force me to work in office, especially because it’s so far away. But it kind of feels, based on how the merger has gone so far, that I’m lucky that they even offered me a position in the first place. 

My boss is more willing to work in office than I am, and she lives even further from the office than I do, but im afraid that her indifference will be reflected onto me as well. 

It’s just stressing me out, and it may end up being no problem for them if I want to keep working remotely, but I just need some advice for how to best proceed so I can communicate my needs effectively without sounding like I’m ungrateful for the job offer.",slinkman05,1,1.0,1,1696285170,2023-10-02 22:19:30,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16yadwb/company_acquired_new_office_is_40_minutes_further/,10,2023

Located in Canada, with $100k salary and WFH position plus benefits. I'm in my early 30s and I've been lately thinking about the future. I dont gain any purpose from work and potential promotions are limited in my field. 

So I'm presented with two options:

\- Switch to a tech-related career via masters degree in IT or CS. Masters would cost about 45K-55k and job prospects will depend on the employer but I anticipate it would be somewhere between 90k-130k if I'm lucky. I'd be studying while working so no loss in wages.

or

\- Training to become an Air Traffic Controller . Training for which takes 2 years at reduced salary of $50k/year. however the starting salary afterwards is between 116k-160k/ first year. This salary progresses to $190k-300k/year after 10 years of service. 

&#x200B;

I'm more excited for the ATC path as Ive always been fascinated with Aviation. However I feel I'm making a mistake leaving my ""cushy"" WFH 100k job to essentially start a new career. 

The masters path makes more logic but the ROI is much lower and frankly I'm not as excited for it.

16y53o2,Considering to change employers but need insight," long story. I'm working for a big corporation which regularly conducts informational and Q&A sessions of our well being at work, any career development wishes, offers different trainings  for improvement,  asks whether we're provided all the necessary tools for a good working flow otherwise they'll provide, and where everyone has the option to promote if skilled, knowledgeable, and persistent enough.

In this company I worked the first two years for a client where I got to improve whatever skill I owned and learn lots of new ones which definitely boosted my resume for future employments. Before the client's contract ended, me and all my colleagues got to fill this ""career list"" consisted of about 35 questions where we get to demonstrate our abilities either by knowledge, behaviour, reaction/responses and work results. My score was about 85% at that time.

Now for the past 10 months with the new client I've been miserable and frustrated over work, constantly feeling about my daily tasks as a downgrade slowing me down and this is where I feel stuck. 

I've been informed for the past 3 weeks that I'm qualified for promoting one higher level that will mostly make me more available to general questions within the team, more reports or talks to be responsible (no authority tho) for but overall more general work quantity over about 15% $€£¥ more next to my annual raise that's another 15% in good times also based in what's generally requested for promotion.

I'm currently filling lots of those abilities besides my volume targets and organizational behaviour. I also have a lack of knowledge which I'm trying to tamper as good as I can in the 8 hr that feel like an eternity but is so few done from the whole expectations. 

The whole experience has been very disappointing, impacting my whole performance.

My new coaches have been pretty much honest about my lacks in a friendly but also authoritative way but overall pointing on why I'm suitable for the promotion and how few must I be responsible for to achieve it (I'm already proactive in lots of activties)  Atm my score is only 65% 

I've also been told that despite my wish for promotion I might not be fully able to focus on my career goals while not liking my tasks or be distressed by personal things 🙃  if so I ""might want"" to consider the next promotion period in March 

Another aspect is that I'm able to switch client's ( work activities and management ) as long as they're available making me start proving my  performance there until March.

Bare in mind I have one ""career list"" of 85% and currently a second one of 65% 

I'm given to improve myself and maybe promote maybe not in December (different tests) or change work activities and focus on March promotions.

Now the whole problem is my lack of everything stopping me to put some extra unpaid work in doing much better and at least improve my career list for the next client/activities 

They don't promote spending extra unpaid time but it's ""unsaid"" that extra offline work will make you master or at least improve something and that make sense for me and I would've done it in my good times but I'm just not able now.

I do want to work for this company for its perks which are more than I've ever experiences or ever heard of from relatives from many aspects but I don't want it for its worse. 

I've been recommended by family to find another company but I'm somehow conflicted bc I did had a great professional boost while enjoying the work it's just this experience that makes me low meanwhile wanting to promote.  Also family considers any unpaid worked time as financial or general negative. 

My family also said that the managers will talk about me and my reputation will be forwarded like a negative aspect while this was the exact procedure when I was transferred from one client to the other without an interview but on forwarded feedback which made me be suitable for promotion from only a few people.

16y52mq,Going back to school for CPA education hours: Computer Science?,"Hope this reaches someone since I've posted something similar a few months ago with no success.

I'm an accountant by profession. I started a job as an investment analyst a few months ago after a little more than 2 years of work experience after my undergrad, 5 years if you include experience before graduating. While getting ready to study for the CPA, I realized that it might make more sense for me to just go back to school first and get the additional 30 credits since I'm still on the fence accounting as an indefinite career path and broadening my options might be worth the effort. If I still want to pursue something outside of accounting afterwards, I can put in the effort to leave sooner than later.

However, it would still be nice to study something that would be complemented by my experience as an accountant. Almost all of my work experience has been in financial services/private equity. My ultimate goal is to become a data scientist and I want to believe that my background in finance/accounting would complement any career goals I have in the industry. However, I can't really determine if my background would actually complement any of my goals. I'd like to know before getting into it that way I can adjust my expectations. 

I dabbled in some languages such as R and SQL in college which kinda put me on this path. I'm more interested in the technical aspects of my job than the actual accounting and financial functions of my job and it's also where I seem to be most valuable in my roles. But, that can only get me so far in accounting. I wouldn't mind pivoting out of accounting/finance completely if the right opportunity comes about, but with the way the market looks for CS grads, I'm not expecting much. I believe that my accounting background would definitely give me an edge in this industry, but I could be wrong. Hence why I'm asking here.

Any advice would be helpful.

Thank you!",Obtainable20,1,1.0,1,1696273182,2023-10-02 18:59:42,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16y52mq/going_back_to_school_for_cpa_education_hours/,10,2023

16y36qk,It's time we stop being bosses,"I'm a software engineer at a large tech company, and I've been thinking a lot about the role of the boss lately. I'm not sure if it's just me, but it feels like the traditional boss-subordinate relationship is becoming increasingly outdated and ineffective.

I recently read an article today about [how to be a leader, not a boss](https://lifemili.eu/how-to-be-a-liked-leader-not-a-dreaded-boss-advice-for-new-managers/). The article made a lot of great points, but one of the things that really stuck with me was the idea that leaders empower their team members and help them to reach their full potential.

In the past, bosses were needed to give orders and make decisions, but these days, i think that most employees are highly skilled and educated and they're just capable of making their own decisions. I have seen employees have more expertise than their bosses.

So what's the point of having bosses? it seems to me that the only thing that bosses really do is add another layer of bureaucracy and inefficiency to the workplace. They're also have been a major source of stress for me and i believe, many others.

I think it's time that we start moving away from the traditional boss-subordinate relationship and towards a more collaborative and egalitarian way of working. We need to create workplaces where everyone is empowered to make their own decisions and contribute to the success of the team.",sunkenelephant,14,0.8899999856948853,2,1696268841,2023-10-02 17:47:21,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16y36qk/its_time_we_stop_being_bosses/,10,2023

I currently work for the state government and want to submit a friendly resignation letter that won't burn any bridges. I still like the people here and have no ill will towards anyone, but the job I'm being offered is superior in almost every aspect.

Here's my question: I have what's called Personal Leave, which is leave that can't be denied for any reason. Everyone gets 6 of these days a year and I have about 4.5 remaining. Would it be wrong for me to say in my resignation letter that my last working day will be X and I will be taking PTO until Y?

I want to take a week off in between jobs but don't want a lapse in my health insurance. A week of lost wages won't kill me, but a week of me and my wife missing out on prescriptions and standing medical appointments would probably be disruptive.

16y1yr3,I am feeling lost,"I am 23 M, I with my friend started a design and branding agency 2 years ago in college days thinking about let's start a business earn money and get out of rat race, we had our ups and downs, in inital days I used to design brand identity and all the designs (I was good at logo and design creation) but I didn't have any design studies I learnt brand identity and design from internet/self learning, so for the complex works like motion, illustration photo manipulation ( tool requiring Photoshop, after effects or any other tools except illustrator) I had junior designer with me, I directed them to the best for the brands... going good, we used to have our clients from good SEO, we had our clients but one day the seo got corrupted by one intern we stopped having client from web our best place for clients. Parallelly we were working on one startup(idea stage), one other startup like our own startup. 
Now we are trying to rewamp the website as the seo is already crashed thinking to restart new but I am having second thoughts about continuing it,
We stopped having client, the lifestyle is affected, the emi are pending. I am having second thoughts about myself as designer as I don't much deeper in design too. 
I am making one venture capital firm for one of my friends but it's in idea phase, we are still learning about these things.
See I wanna be in a startup place, I don't wanna do a job, one day I will start my own startup, but now when I am not getting client I am confused about how to get my life together, the relationship with my co-founder (more or less it's some how related to starting my own venture too, I don't wanna work with him anymore, it's not like he is bad or something but I feel I am not my 100% having him around, it's like looking at each other face who is gonna do the work, sure I can to the work but I feel the design are done by me, and this a design agency what is left for his is taking business queries and relationships...) also I am not liking how am getting, I wanna have a independent me time where I can take my own decisions. I wanna explore things, I wanna be independent of this all going on currently, I wanna live my life, I wanna learn more deep.
I am confused what should I do, I am thinking about working with established design agency but I am not sure if I can a job there. I can also work at some VC firm providing them design and marketing but I am again not sure if I can get a job there. Please suggest something, if you can help me, I would be really grateful.

16y14r5,What to do? Leave or Stay?,"I had a job that I loved working in a cardiac cath and EP lab.  There were 10 of us on the team and save for 1 or 2 people it was like going to work with my friends every day.  Granted there were times we would drive each other crazy.  
I’ll preface by saying my assistant manager and I both had goals of going to industry to work eventually. With my current degree and not being an RN there is no vertical job ladder for me which is why I wanted to go to industry.  At this job I was making a little over 80k a year plus they were paying 10k in student loans a year, but that also includes OT and taking call.  
In late June, my assistant manager said she applied for a job but doesn’t think she wants it and said I would be good at it and I should apply.  I briefly read the job description and decided I would be pretty good at the job of Clinical Resource Director. At the time in my old job I was doing a lot more than my job description and I was definitely one of the top performers job wise in the department.  I was feeling pretty down on the fact I wasn’t being recognized monetarily.  For 2 years I have been baited with a title change and pay increase but senior leadership isn’t signing off, so I left.  I think deep down I wanted them to sign off and I would stay but I left.  
I started the new job 5 weeks ago. Day 1 was here is computer and office do these training videos and that was it.  Very little guidance in learning what to do and, in fact, just on Friday I was told I threw someone under the bus because I didn’t clean up an email chain! That being said, the job is 100% more supply chain oriented and focused than anything clinical.  Clinical is about 15% of the job.  It about cost savings and supply management. As I could easily do the job, I find myself just coming to work because I have to.  I absolutely do no enjoy what I am doing.  The best part is that I have my own office.  
My old boss said she would gladly take me back and could do so fairly easily she thinks.  She even offered to try and get me more $ on top of it.  
That leads to my question.  Even without getting more money, do I go back and like what I am doing for work or do I just drudge through not liking or caring about what I do?

Situation: working in a new software department for a new boss. My old group was disbanded. New boss assigned me to a project that’s been going on for years. It’s huge, complex, everything is custom so I can’t Google for help, I only understand parts, I’m the only developer on it. I’m asked to code new features or modify existing code with no knowledge of how it all works. It’s super convoluted, deep, and out of my knowledge zone. I’ve told the boss this, but yet I remain the only one on it. I’m told I need to figure it out. By myself.

To give a bit of context, I am a lawyer by training but I did not pursue this career path as I did not find it ''fun'' enough. After graduating more than 4 years ago I struggled a lot with trying to find something that suits me and my personality and this brought with it a lot of guilt towards my parents who struggled financially to support me during my studies. I finally found a career path that seemed to fit much better and started a master's degree in that abroad. It was not easy as I had to work at the same time but I graduated with distinction and I am very proud of myself. I had certain goals set such as the type of job I would do, getting an internship in a specific international organisation and in a topic I love. 

Since I graduated 2 years ago I've achieved all of that and found myself promoted quickly.  I had a negative experience in one of my previous jobs where, due to staff shortages,  I was given no choice but to work for a client whose business objectives go against my ethical principles. I eventually resigned and I am now working in a very prestigeous company where I have everything I wished for in my job (mentorship, interesting clients and topics, nice colleagues and excellent benefits).

On paper everything is great but I don't feel it like that. When I started on this path 2 years ago I was so excited to wake up in the morning and go to work and now I cannot seem to find this excitement anywhere. I am thinking that maybe the previous negative experience  has  impacted me and I'm trying to regain my motivation but it's been really hard to do so. Or maybe it's not that, maybe it's just that I have achieved my goals and now what? I'm still passionate about the topics I work in and I love discussing and debating but I feel like a car engine that struggles to get started - with the passion for the topics giving the first push but the ignition not being able to stay on...

Have you been in a similar position and if so what did you do to regain motivation?",Squirrel_tiptap,1,1.0,0,1696245022,2023-10-02 11:10:22,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16xtsi7/how_can_i_regain_motivation_at_work/,10,2023
16xtpxq,Im 25F and I’ve been having a really hard time figuring out how I can possibly move out on my own/ afford to live on my own,"It’s always been really hard for me to actually get hired at a job. Every time I apply for jobs or call places when the receptionist answers and I tell them im calling about getting a job and can I talk to the manager, every single time they would say “oh the managers not in I can take your phone number and leave a note and he’ll call you back” and when I would do that I would literally never get a call back from like a dozen places I called. I would even keep calling them days after still trying to talk to the manager and every single day I would call no matter what I would never be able to get in contact with the manager so I would literally just never get jobs and I would end up being unemployed at home doing nothing because of this. And the few times I would get interviews, I would always think I seemingly do everything right… I would wear a nice professional outfit, light conservative job- appropriate makeup, I would act very nice and polite at the job interview, I would bring my resume which I’ve gotten done by someone and was clean and professional looking with all my past jobs with skill points I have from those jobs. The interviews would always seem to go smoothly and they would always act kind of pleased and would go out of their way to tell me I looked nice and professional and I always felt like I should get the job but at the end we would shake hands and they would tell me “ok nice meeting you we will call you back in two weeks to tell you if you got the job or not.” Then I would wait the two weeks and they would never actually call me back then I would have to call them. Then every time I would call I could never get ahold of the manager to talk to them and would have to call multiple times then when I would ask they would tell me no you didn’t get the job. Yes I know when you get no call back it means you didn’t get the job but they told me they would. And the interviews would always go well so I have no idea why none of these places would ever hire me. The only thing I can think of is that maybe I’m not the “trendy, ideal” person they would want to have and one of the other people they interviewed was so they hired them instead. 

The few times I have actually had jobs they always told me I was very slow and bad at my job even when I was trying my best to do everything fast and efficient like everyone else. They would always berate me about literally every little thing I would do. At this one job I was at for two years, for a year and a half that I was there they only scheduled me to work one day a week and would just ignore me whenever I would ask for more hours so it never happened. My most recent job they let me go after a week and a half and said it was because I was too slow and not good at my job. 

Because of this job situation I’ve gone most of my adult life unemployed and stuck at home with my mom all the time who I have a toxic relationship with as mentioned in my other posts and I’m now in my mid 20s and I was never able to get away from my mom and move out on my own and just live my own life independently. Even if I did get a job it would only be minimum wage and even if I was doing that full time it wouldn’t be enough to pay rent anywhere because of how expensive rent is nowadays. Especially plus car insurance and all the other bills when you have your own apartment. I don’t even have my own car so there’s that other expense. I don’t know how I would be able to pay all that especially with just minimum wage. I always wanted to move out and live like in a city independently like how everyone used to be able to do and like you see them doing on tv shows and movies (which is not an unrealistic fantasy I don’t think) but it was never able to happen and at this point I feel like it just literally never will.

A couple years ago I took an Tech job with the understanding I would eventually be taking over my coworkers position. The position is a pretty big step up, think Help Desk to Senior Sys Admin. This coworker has now submitted her last day, which is in a few months. One thing to note about this coworker-they are extremely mean and difficult to work with. There have been numerous complaints filed about them, however since they’re the only one that knows how to run this program they refused to fire them. 

So I’m training and this coworker has told me I’m 100% responsible for their job now and they’re not lifting a finger. They sit there and watch me all day, and literally yell at me if I’m doing something wrong. They’re burning up their sick and vacation, leaving early and coming in late.

16xqd2v,I am unsure about life,"
I am 21 years old and joined the National Guard as a combat medic at the age of 17. I started a biology degree in college at 20 and am currently in my third semester. Initially, my objective was to eventually enroll in medical school, but after my experiences as a combat medic and working in civilian hospitals, I have lost interest. Despite the widely-held belief that college is a vital step, I am of the opinion that my classes are not providing me with any valuable knowledge. This lack of motivation has caused me to feel like a failure and uninterested in college life. I have gained more knowledge from my daily experiences and work than from college thus far. Also, not that it matters, but my morale is further deteriorating as I am scheduled for a combat deployment next year.

I am passionate about learning and educating myself on human remains. I have gained a wealth of knowledge on the subject and feel that I have been able to make a difference with my knowledge. For instance, I have advised individuals on multiple occasions that the bones they have posted pictures of are human and that they should contact the police. Additionally, I have preserved skeletal remains to a museum standard, and even uncovered the names of 300-year-old remains with very limited information. Although my main profile can attest to that, I am hesitant to post this on there because I fear being looked down upon as a 21-year-old without a degree doing such things. (Everything I do is completely legal) I should note that I believe anthropology is off the table because of ethical incompatibiliy. I believe there may be potential in pursuing this avenue further, but I am uncertain. I am considering taking a break from college to explore life, but I am hesitant to make a decision that I may regret later.",Closetofskeletonss,1,1.0,1,1696232331,2023-10-02 07:38:51,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16xqd2v/i_am_unsure_about_life/,10,2023

- Someone has a Master's degree that appears to be in an easier field than their Bachelor's degree. The person maybe did this because the field their Bachelor's degree was in was too hard for them.
- Someone has 2 years of experience in Software Development and then they quit. It's most likely because it was too difficult for them.

16xndkf,changing career mid career. any advice? education and type of opportunities?,"Hey everyone hoping to get some comments and/or advice. I studied chemical engineering in university graduated in 2014, always did enjoy the computer science courses that I took in my engineering degree. Courses such as java, and c I did find interesting. I was also always good at math and enjoyed it, which obviously seems heavy useful with computer science program or degree. Anyways I have been working as a project engineer and process engineer for different companies over 8 to 10 years. Anyways I personally find engineering interesting the technical side however the reality is the industry has ruined it, it’s more about liability and endless paper work. Also I find the people that do the interesting work always end up hogging it or just remain in it. For example I would like to go more on the process side, designing, and doing calculation my current role I’m not doing this and feel more like a project coordinator. Which often happens I get stuck into because of my experience. Anyways I’m thinking engineering would be a great hobby but working in it as a field it just doesn’t do it anymore. Multiple other reasons I could go on as well. Anyways at this point is it too late to switch careers? I realize I would need to go back to school? I’m hoping with my current degree many courses would be credited and it wouldn’t be a hard transition. My options would be to go back to school part time or full time however I feel like I would have no choice full time or it would take too long. Anyways I’m curious what is the difference between computer science, computer engineering, and software engineer. What are the prospects and oppertunties? One thing I should mention I live in Canada and it’s cold I hate the winter how this relates is if I was able to find a remote job that allows me to work anywhere for even 1 to 3 months would make a huge difference.

16xfmge,Dismissed from Job all of a sudden?,"Hello everyone. I was hoping to have some advice? 

All of a sudden I have been dismissed from my work for poor performance and time management. 

I had been at the company for 7 months. It was a high end kitchen, bathroom and bedroom design showroom. I say sudden as I had a meeting with a client that morning and was going to Germany twice this month ( one visit only two days away and the next one at the end of the month) for some training ( which should have been done at the start) and a product launch of a suppliers. 

After the meeting with the client I was handed a letter by my manager from the owner and she said she only found out a day prior. 

I asked about why and how. And she said I had cost the business £14k and not sold much. I am qualified for this job, but they hired me because they had I had experience but not too much to a point where they could mold me.

3 month probationary meeting went well. They said it was quiet at the time but they were happy I was proactive and helping out.

6 month review was meant to happen but manager was busy and business owner never did anything like that. Only showed his face 3 times a week. 

I just don’t understand how I can be dismissed with no prior warning etc or any chance to fight my corner. 

There has been no customers coming through and the ones that did I ended up selling but my colleague took them off me at the final stages to which I said something but no one cared. I did mention in the meeting that they had just hired an apprentice who they are training up that if they couldn’t afford me why have they not let him go. Her response to this was that they don’t expect him to sell and it is cheaper labour ( I do want to mention he plays 8-ball pool, will not answer a phone and just generally does not care about the job). 

The owner did not even tell me himself who I saw the day before and said have a nice weekend too. I brought up that business has been slow but I could have helped in the bathroom design department since they were busy and I have prior experience.

Should I do something about this? 

In short: 
Dismissed from work all of a sudden for poor performance after 7 months but no prior warning.

My background, I am a returning sophomore (after no college for 8 years) pursuing an architecture degree and eventually my license, but that's much further down the road. I am trying to land an internship next week at a major career fair with some major firms I am determined to work for because their work aligns with my personal career goals. I have choppy but a lot of work history and plenty of life experiences and skills. I've managed restaurants, servers, kitchen's, grocery stores. I've held a CDL A since I was 18 and was a supervisor/driver for the local trash company's recycle team.  I have tons of community involvement. My education is a little lacking but not absent. I was able to return as a sophomore instead of a freshman in UNI because I did quite it bit; studied abroad and such. 

All the tutorials and help forums I find end up being more geared toward college students with little to no work history or life experience.

16xcudg,(United States) what places internationally have high rates of employment for desk / office work entry level wise?,"23M here, currently working in a union apprenticeship and almost half way done until I become a journeyman and earn my card. 

Most sincerely though, I don’t really wanna plan on doing this kind of work long term even though the pay / benefits etc; is all amazing. I feel like I’d fit better in a field of work where logical thinking, analysis accuracy, and even repetition is more of my fortay vs working hands on, trying to think outside the box all the time and do anything kinesthetic related for learning. 

I believe quitting my apprenticeship early on before graduation would be a mistake incase if for any reason I ever wanted to go back and it wouldn’t look good on my resume anyways. Either way I do have the epiphany now that somethings gotta change for me soon at some point for the better of my own being and reason to find something that’s more attuned to me or ‘makes sense’.

Currently I live in Michigan, no family / kids or even a partner of my own, no real financial burdens keeping me down or anchored to stay so relocating to a whole new area wouldn’t bother me one bit, clean background with no record of anything whatsoever, high school degree with a 3.0+ GPA, when I was in college I was a dean student the whole way until I dropped out to take the job that pertained to my field I’m in now currently before having to do another year to graduate college, if I had to go back to school it wouldn’t bother me anyways academically. I’m always willing to learn and have been highly motivated to figure out not only what I’m good at but how I can make it beneficial to another company or establishment too where I feel like I’m in a good niche mutually both ways.

If anyone can recommend me ANY good companies, states or areas across the U.S that hire in people for work that pertains to working with your brain more than your body at entry level or is at least willing to teach someone in under their wing whose success driven, much would be obliged to know. 

Note: I have heard data entry is a good place to start at and I’ve been considering something with computers / tech, I’ve heard places like UPS / Fed Ex do half & half sit down work with some desk work, and even some security like occupations that pertain to some systems. I’m open to any other ideas though too!

So, there's a good chance I also get to go to Med school. But I've had so many people tell me Med School is so instantly stressful and so hard. And I looked up the average salaries of a doctor in pharmacy and like a hospital doctor and they're really close to each other. My dad told me If I wanna study pharmacy though I have to get a doctorate's degree and he will force me to do so but I told him i don't wanna study for 10 years, who is right in this scenario? How stressful is it compared to Med school? 

IMPORTANT PSA: I will be studying Bachelor's degree in my country (Jordan, University of Jordan which is the number 1 university here) and then I will work on finishing my studying outside. Now, my parents, and brother, said that Doctors of Pharmacy have a super super super super super super super super hard time getting to study abroad, because it's a rarely asked for job. Also, in my country, they say you're wasting your time if you study it because there's 0 jobs for it. Is this true?

I hope all is well. I would like to ask you if I am chasing a dream here. A little background info: I have been working in the Enterprise IT Storage support for a little over 5 years and I feel this job is taking my soul a piece at a time.

Hey everyone! When I went through college initially four years ago, I wanted to be a choir teacher/director and recieved a Bachelor's of Vocal Music Education. After learning about the about the abysmal teacher pay, and just how bad the world of education has become post-covid, I've discovered I want to switch gears completely and become an engineer - but more specifically an engineer in the entertainment industry. I still love the fine arts and would be thrilled to help construct major theatrical productions, build concert halls, improve acoustics in movie theaters, etc. I have an extensive background in constructing live shows and currently help out a local high school as their technical director. The biggest hiccup I'm encountering is my education credentials.

Aside from the Bachelor's, I also have an Associate of Arts, and have began work on an Assoicate's of Engineering. So far, I have completed all the classes up to Statics and am about to enroll in Mechanics of Materials.

16x82fo,General advice and also resume advice in transitioning from the nonprofit sector to the private sector,"Graduated recently with a mid career degree in public policy. My background is government ethics and reform, as well as some politics.

So tbh my career path is moving me toward government and I am focusing my search on government positions (mostly at the federal level). 

That said, I am also looking at a few private sector positions with interest. 

One very large corporation in particular is putting a ton of investment into environmental sustainability. Which usually doesn’t make me blink because that is the rage now, except that I’ve been following this corporation for years and have noticed that they have a surprisingly ethical approach to lobbying and have consistently put their resources into keeping the public safer (along with profit of course). And they have already allocated a *ton* of money (think hundreds of millions) into the initiative.  

So here is the situation: I do not have anything in my work history relating to environmental sustainability. I have also never worked for a corporation. I do, however, have a background  in public policy and for the hell of it will be taking a credential course this month on ESG, which should help. This corporation so far has only posted jobs in their department for people to help with business contracts, and as of yet have posted no jobs for policy or government affairs folks in their sustainability department. However, they do have postings for government affairs *interns* for the summer of 2024, so my guess is that they will begin staffing that department very soon - because who would those interns be working for otherwise? 

As such, I’ve been trying to sleuth around to get info so maybe when I do apply I have a chance. Again, this is not the only job I am pursuing but I think this whole thing is pretty fucking cool and I like to be a part of the beginning of things. I’d like the option to spend at least a couple of years at a higher salary, too, and build my savings.  Private sector experience would also make me more attractive to certain federal government positions down the line.  

Through LinkedIn, I found a woman who had also made the transition from the nonprofit world to this corporation, who also graduated from the same grad program with me. She agreed to meet me for an informational interview and I learned a ton.  She works in an entirely different department though and her nonprofit experience is relevant the department she’s in now. We had a fun and helpful informational interview, where she talked about how hard she networked (she didn’t have connections either), how much she likes the perks and her new coworkers, etc. She also told me that when I apply to something to let her know, because she’ll probably either directly or indirectly be connected to the hiring folks.  

I also cold Linked In messaged the director of that department who has been speaking at conferences and doing media appearances to talk about the initiative. No response, as expected. 

I had another informational interview with someone who has my degree and also an MBA, and also works there but in a different department. I tried to get information about the program but he was very insistent that I work on my resume, which needs a lot of changes. This surprised me because many people have complimented me and said it’s great, and I have worked with my grad school’s career services to refine it. It’s two pages (I have sixteen years of experience), and touches on the major competencies asked for by government. He think even experienced people should take it down to one page and that this should be punchier and stress more about how motivated I am, and to center my education more. He told me to get rid of columns because that is not “standard” resume format, which is news to me. He said this probably isn’t what I want to hear and I assured him it’s not exactly what I want to hear, because this world is unfamiliar to me. He told me to rewrite my resume and he would give me feedback. 

Anyway, I am working on that now but tbh I am struggling a bit. I know this person isn’t the end all of advice, but I will take his direction for now and try what he suggests because he actually works there. But I also know he’s on the business side, not the policy side, so I will take his advice with a grain of salt. 

I was hoping folks here have advice for me on this endeavor, either generally or specifically, or even talk about their own experiences switching to the private sector mid career.

It has been a bit of a shock to my family’s  lifestyle to say the least, but that is what we do. We roll with the punches. 

I decided I want to become a math teacher. Already having degrees in economics and finance, I worked extremely hard the last few years getting my Masters in Mathematics education. During that time, I got various jobs in the local schools district to start building relationships. I already had a reparation as I have been working with people in the community for most of my life.

It’s absolute chaos sometimes and my emotionally disturbed kids are amazing but in this dark and troubled way. The money is crap, but I have money and it’s not a big deal yet, though I can’t keep this level of income up forever. 

So here is the thing. I have enough fight in me to continue to another masters to actually become a BCBA. I don’t want to sound cocky, but I am extremely experienced with this work given the tens of thousands of hours I have with kids that includes many autistic individuals and troubled youth. The pay in my district will start in the six figures, and only goes up as I know I can end up in a director roll eventually and be able to impact many kids and make huge changes to the field especially in how they approach nutrition and some very bad habits going on with the teachers. I mean I can save lives and keep kids out of prison.

But fuck. It’s stressful. Working with some of these kids that have severe emotional disturbances sits with me all day. I don’t know how healthy it is for me to do this for the next 20 years.

My other option is just to go be a math and science teacher like I had originally planned. The money isn’t great, but I have assets, and I know how to start and run businesses should I choose some side gigs or businesses. I am a little worried about it though because I feel like the economy is catching up with me. I feel like the stress would be far less, but less money. 

I can’t make a decision. I literally waffle back and forth hourly. If I did a workout and feel good I’m ready to go back to grad school and take in the world. If I have a bad day, I just want to teach “normal” kids math. Half the day I think I have a decision, the other half I have switched. Sometimes just if I’m hungry or not my mind will change. I have to make a decision soon that will impact not just my life, by my families’ , and indeed lots of other families. I have been tossing and turning for weeks now. I need help. 

So I’m looking for cloud advice here on Reddit. Math and behaviorist brain is telling me to take data and tap other people’s experience, winsome and thoughts.

16x3hvd,Potential career options,"Hey all!  
  
Just looking for some advice from people with more experience than me - anything is appreciated!  
So for context I work as a consultant in Sydney, Australia for a firm that mainly focuses on public sector consulting. I've realised that this job likely isn't for me in terms of both the public sector and consulting parts of it. I'm thinking of leaving at the two-year mark after I hopefully get a promotion + have stayed long enough. I have done projects in organisation design, strategy work, cost-cutting and some quantitative modelling work like cost-benefit analyses. 

I want to understand what my options are in terms of transitioning into private sector work and what some job options might be for me to explore. Some potential careers I've looked at that seem interesting are VC, derivative or equity trading or quant trading but not sure if these are realistic opportunities for me (any other recommendations to check out would be amazing!). I'm pretty young so am open to re-starting at a grad level if that is required.

16x1u3q,One of my supervisors thinks he can do my job - but he's really bad at it,"Overall, I have a good relationship with all of my supervisors. However, one thing is getting on my nerves. I was hired in a technical role that sometimes overlaps with what the supervisor in question does; he often does better, which is fine and expected - he's quite a bit more experienced overall. So I get that.

However, one area that he's not as talented in is data pipeline development - which is one area explicitly stated in my job description. I feel like his view of my role is pretty much just script-kiddy and tech support. I feel I am being delegated to just writing scripts to automate his terrible pipeline topology.

This supervisor's approach to pipeline design often mistakes ""flexibility"" for ""loosy-goosy"", and requires mountains of documentation to account for the copious number of operational exceptions. The proposed pipeline has many conflicting points and other points of weakness. He sees writing specifications and flow chart graphs exclusively as a ""documentation"" step; there's no actual planning.  I'm not alone, either. One of my coworkers also expressed concern with certain design decisions.

Like I said, I respect the guy - but frankly, he is a terrible pipeline engineer. I've mentioned to him that I feel left out. He's placated my input, but I feel like he's too emotionally attached to the project to take anyone's input, except in areas he's unsure of - which he opens up to a committee-style meeting; which are unproductive and result in even more chaos!

I'm not saying I should do this whole thing by myself. I need his and other's guidance and experience to understand specific requirements. As mentioned, he is much more experienced than I am generally.

Fortunately, he understands that this pipeline is a work in progress, so there is room for improvement, and he's a good guy - not an egomaniac, but he's too invested in this project to see the problems.

My plan right now is to take what he has and ""sanitize"" it a bit, write an actual specification, and present it like it's ""a few suggestions"", perhaps to ""make automation easier"", but maintain that it's his pipeline, and for the most part, it is, with a few topological changes. I am concerned that my suggestions will be shot down without consideration.

How can I effectively justify the changes I'd like to see without stepping on any toes?",Technical_Word_6604,2,1.0,0,1696168489,2023-10-01 13:54:49,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16x1u3q/one_of_my_supervisors_thinks_he_can_do_my_job_but/,10,2023

16wxjkm,Should I leave Smith Industries?,"To keep myself anonymous I'm going to be a little light on some details. I work in a small enough industry that it would be easy to figure out who I am with just a few key facts.

I've been working for my current employer for just under two years. We'll call them Smith Industries.

When I landed my job at Smith Industries I was ecstatic. They have been a dream employer of mine since I graduated from college in 2018. My time at Smith Industries has been very positive too. I was promoted a year after I started which is unusually quick (pay increase and new title, effectively still doing the exact same job). I have a very positive relationship with my manager and my team. The work/life balance is relatively good and there's a very healthy culture around taking time off, especially right before or after our busiest work periods. We also have a union.

I like my job and I'm lucky in many ways to have it. But, my position at Smith Industries has one critical flaw: I've come to realize it's a dead-end and I'm not growing in it as much as I want to be.

I'm in a specialist role and do pretty different work from the rest of my team. While we have some overlap in our day-to-day work and collaborate well, our indicators for success and professional goals are very different. 

My manager is only a few years older than me and I think the world of them. They have advocated for me throughout Smith Industries, highlight my successes and downplay when I fall short. I also feel that I've really learned what I can from them. There aren't many skills left for them to teach me and much of their advice on how to approach projects are things that I've already done or was already planning to do. There's not much that they can show me. 

I want to contrast that with the professional mentoring that my manager gets which comes from regular check-ins with a board member and with their manager who effectively does the exact same work as them at a higher level. Ive seen them grow a lot in a short period and it's great to see.

Very recently a new position opened up at Smith Industries on a different team. I told my manager that I was thinking of applying and they said that they were sad to see me go but encouraged me to look at it.

I've since spoken to several department heads at Smith Industries and learned that somewhere along the way I've built an extremely strong reputation here. A couple of them said directly to me that if I want a position on their team I can have it. Frankly, I never even considered working for most of them but its flattering to be sought after and I would have more professional growth on these teams. I'll be speaking to the CEO of Smith Industries soon to get their advice on what I should do. 

I would expect that it would take many months if not the better part of a year to formally transition to another department. I'm already feeling stagnant and think this will be a long time to feel like I'm spinning my wheels.

There is one department head I spoke to named Jane. When I asked Jane for advice and explained my professional goals to her she said, ""Okay, the rest of this conversation is off the record""

Jane explained to me that she knows someone looking to lead a project in a startup environment and that I would be a tremendous fit for it. I am currently in the interview process with them but my sense is that this position is mine if I want it.

To be clear, this is an opportunity outside of Smith Industries.

The pay would be marginally better than what I make now. The hours would be much worse. The project is a gamble and will finish a bit over a year from now. 

As an added factor, I currently live in a major American city and always have lived in a city environment. Taking on this job would involve moving to a relatively small town about 5 hours away.

If it fails I am completely out of a job. If it succeeds I will be extremely well positioned for very lucrative and very prestigious opportunities in my field.

I am leaning strongly towards the startup and leaving Smith Industries. I do believe that I'd be leaving on good terms and I have seen quite a few people return to Smith Industries after working elsewhere. But of course there are no guarantees in life.

As you may have guessed from all of the above, I am very ambitious and care a lot about my professional growth. I also am not a drone and have a lot of hobbies and things that I like to do when I dont work that would mostly have to be on hold for about a year on a huge gamble.

Does it make sense to leave a place where I've built such a positive reputation to take on a big risk? Am I way overthinking this?

Any advice is welcome.",Weird-Security2308,1,1.0,2,1696155756,2023-10-01 10:22:36,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wxjkm/should_i_leave_smith_industries/,10,2023

16wwxzt,I am torn between doing my Masters in 1 or 2 years?,"I am an international student studying for an MSc. in Econometrics in Rotterdam and living in the Netherlands for the first time in my life. The degree is supposed to be 1-year long, but I came to realize that for many people, especially for Dutch people it takes longer. Some people extend their masters thesis by a few months, while many extend it to 2 full years by taking some courses in the first while some in the second year. For example, I met plenty of people who are only studying 2 courses now, in the first block, instead of the required 3.   
My plan was to graduate in next summer, however, this opportunity makes me wonder. Extending it to two years would allow me to have a more relaxed university experience with much more time to spend on my hobbies, more opportunities to make friends and also by doing fewer courses in a year, chances that I could get better grades. Even though I already have a graduate job starting next September, it is not my dream job and taking one more year would allow me to potentially get another summer internship before I start working full-time.   
My biggest concern is what I would do between late-February and June. My academic year (I'm not sure if that's the same everywhere in the Netherlands) is divided into 5 blocks with blocks 4 and 5 dedicated solely to the Master's thesis. If I extended the degree to two years, I would have nothing to do during that period, at least not within the university. I won't be able to allow travelling which is something that many Dutch students do at that time, from what I heard at least. Obviously, I could get a part-time job in retail and work on useful skills (programming for example) while exploring the Netherlands and the neighbouring countries with the pocket money. The best would be, however, to get some experience in my field. Do you think there are any companies (finance, tech, consulting) willing to hire juniors for such an off-cycle period? From the research I have done, I couldn't find any official job listing between February and June, or for any similar period.   
Obviously, I don't expect Redditors to make the choice instead of me, but I would appreciate some advice, especially from people who have been in similar shoes.

16wwiz0,How to figure out what to do next in my career?,"TL;DR: Stuck in my career and can’t figure out what to do next. What advice would you give me to figure things out?  
I just turned 27 in September. This year is the most challenging year of my life by far, and that’s for a few reasons I will detail next.   
The year started great, I went to Thailand with my girlfriend (of 7 years) for 1 month, where I had a chance to train in Muay Thai and have a fight. The thing is, I have been practicing kickboxing since 2017 and have had amateur fights before, so the purpose of the trip was to train and get 1 fight. I won the fight, which gave me confidence. But, when I started my fighting amateur career in 2021, I started to develop back pain. During Thailand, the back pain was worse than ever, but I do not regret it one bit.  
We arrived back home in February (in Romania) and continued our everyday life, together with our cats (2 cats). Something was not in the right place for me. During our trip to Thailand, I met persons of different cultures, who were encouraged to travel and seemed to have interesting and fulfilling careers. I identified that I had not. I always considered myself a smart woman, capable of learning almost anything, but sadly there was no deep passion that I had developed through childhood and teen years. I have a BSc in Mathematics, which I am not really proud of, because I couldn’t put it to use. That is because the Curriculum was a mess and was focused only on theoretical mathematics, which was not what I was interested in. The only career opportunity I had was to be a professor, and this does not fit my persona. Hence, I did not continue with obtaining an MSc, due to the lack of an Applied Mathematics program in Romania.   
In April, my back pain got much worse, and I was identified with a disc herniation. Fast forward, I cannot train right now in kickboxing, I am about 60% sure that having another fight is not a great idea, but at least I am having treatment for my back and I am doing some strength and conditioning. I will return to kickboxing eventually, but only to practice it recreationally.  
Regarding my career thus far, while I was pursuing my degree in Mathematics, I got employed (in 2017) because of my voluntary work done in the student organization, which was fundraising. So my first job in Romania was as a Sales Assistant, responsible for contacting various businesses in order to gain new leads. It was something out of my competency, but at least I was making some money and I did not rely on my parents entirely. After 10 months, the stakeholders at that company decided to create another company, focused on RPA implementation using UiPath. I saw it as an opportunity to enter the IT field, so I took it and started learning. I had great success as an RPA Dev. I have implemented over 40 projects and every client loved my work. I was really excited when I had projects from the banking area and finance, due to the similarity with mathematics. In 2021, I had the stupid idea to propose that we need a team leader (we began as a startup), and since I was the one proposing it, I became the team leader (more like a manager). And it was the most unsatisfying role I have ever had. I am NOT a people-oriented person and I do NOT care about the development of others. Hence, I was utterly unfit for this role. Although I tried my best not to show it every day (some days were awful and I couldn’t pretend anymore), I created workflows and procedures which were needed in our team. After my trip to Thailand, I decided I would stop pretending. So I announced to my manager that I no longer wanted to be a department manager. It took 7 months for a change to happen and I was dying inside every day. When I said to them that I did not want the management position anymore, the question asked was “Then what do you want to do instead?”. And in this moment, the chaos began. I had no idea what I wanted to do. It felt that in those 2 years as a manager, I lost myself completely. It felt like I was living the life of someone else. It still feels that way. Anyway, after these 7 months, meaning the last week of Sept 2023, I received a project in which I have the role of Sr. developer/consultant for a banking company in the UK. This week was my first week working for them, and it felt quite good being back on the field as an individual contributor. The project has a duration of 6 weeks and I will hopefully manage to extend it by proving to them what can be achieved.  
Although my current assignment feels good, I still believe that I have a lot more potential. It does not seem to me that this job is challenging enough and I don’t see its purpose in society that much. On a salary level, is comfortable and good, thus making it quite hard to give it up. I think I would give it up if I could figure out what I want to actually do in my career.   
All the thoughts I had this year destroyed my self-confidence. I was rejected at some interviews, hence I started to believe that I was not skilled enough as an RPA dev and I had no value on the market. Other people are making much more money than me and I began to feel jealous. Other people have businesses, something I also wish to have one day, and I am jealous of them. Other people my age, with whom I went to high school, have great jobs and know their vocation. I don’t and I feel jealous of them. It has been a long time since I learned something technical or scientific, so I feel a bit incompetent at learning right now. And even if I hadn’t felt that way, I wouldn’t know what to learn. It feels like I have become a bitter woman, full of negativity and pessimistic thoughts. If I view myself from a 3rd party perspective, I would laugh about myself.  
One of my biggest regrets is that I did not pursue a degree in another country. I wanted to go study abroad, but my father told me we had no money to sustain this. So I gave up. And I believe I still regret it. One thing that I decided was that I do not want to live in Romania anymore. I want to move to another country, preferably an LGBT-friendly country, in which I have rights as a normal human being.  
The clock is ticking and I would like by the end of the year to figure out the next steps for my career. Until now, I just took every opportunity that arose, without thinking if it would fit me. Now I want to take over and start creating opportunities for myself. I am not sure if I need a career coach since I believe I can do the work to figure it out. But I would like to ask your advice regarding this: How to figure out what you want to do? What advice do you have for me? I always took the ideas other people had and tried to associate them with me, but I do not know what is right for me. And I want to figure that. Do you think a career coach would help? Or a therapist?  
Sorry for the long post. Any answer would help. Thank you!",Jaded_Fisherman_9274,2,1.0,0,1696152113,2023-10-01 09:21:53,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wwiz0/how_to_figure_out_what_to_do_next_in_my_career/,10,2023
16wvfok,Honda civic 2002 oil pan,"I was replacing my oil pan gasket today(took way longer then expected) and while putting all the bolts and nuts back in around the oil pan one of the postes snapped! I was using a toque wrench but it didn’t click when it was supposed to so I just kept tightening until I heard the snap. So I’m not really sure what to do now, I currently put a c clamp in the area of the broken post hoping it’ll give as much presser as the nut would have, and there’s some silicone in there. So is there a way I could drill the post out without causing any cracks? Or what do I do? Not sure if it’s leaking yet, I put cardboard under the car for the night, I’ll make an update when I find out if it’s leaked at all. I’m planning on going to get some plastic spring clamps so I can get some pressure closer to where the post was, I don’t imagine that could be a long term fix tho.

16wv7ir,Applying to different positions in same company?,"Hey guys I just needed your advice. I’m currently in interview process with a company but I saw another position open up in another department at the same exact company.

Is it ok if I apply to that position as well or is this a red flag for the other position that I already am in interview process with? In general, is it ok to apply to multiple positions within same company? The reason I want to apply to another position within the same company is because I previously worked  in that other department.",kbabqiqja,1,1.0,0,1696147261,2023-10-01 08:01:01,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wv7ir/applying_to_different_positions_in_same_company/,10,2023
16wsu2j,"Hi, this ones for the Indians who've passed out from any of the top MBA colleges.","Its no news that IIMs offer quite a package during their placements and that some students enter into a college solely with the aim of getting that package. I've recently got to know that if you get placed into a good company like bcg and work there then within 8 to 10 years you can become a Partner in the company and that Partners earn 1cr +. This seemed to good to be true since earning 1cr+ before 32 is an idea that sounds too good to be true. I come from a decent household; my parents earn around 30LPA and i am able to lead  a very happy and content life because of them. If someone asked me how much i wanted my realistic aim to be to earn as an adult then I would have said something around 35-40 only since thats what ive been born and brought up with. This amount of 1cr so early in life seems a bit stretched to me.   
When I asked my friend whats the catch he said that you have to sell your time and soul to the company and as per indian standards i believe thats pretty much the norm no matter your level or position in the company.  


Just how true is this statement about earning a cr in 10 years? If anyone could verify or tell me something more about it then that would be of great help. I don't mind if whatever I've been told turns out to be completely false. I just want to know what the reality of the situation is because as it stands it seems that I will have cracked life much sooner and much more easily than I expected. A reality check would be appreciated.  
Thank you.",thevirtualextrovert9,7,0.8899999856948853,0,1696138683,2023-10-01 05:38:03,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wsu2j/hi_this_ones_for_the_indians_whove_passed_out/,10,2023

16wmuk6,How to ask for part time,"How do I ask for part time for my nursing job? I asked for part time in May & was told no. 

I would like to ask again as the hours are to much and I have another per diem job and doing nothing is becoming increasingly difficult. 

For context, I was told no because there is no staff as I was the only staff member as 2 other people quit, it’s also the reason I wanted to go part time to begin with as I like the work but hate the job…. & also they can’t just make a position. 
2ndly, someone who works in the same area at a sister hospital quit, but then asked to go part time and they gave her part time. They never posted a part time spot.

16wmofy,Boss won't let me transfer,"What should I do when boss won't allow me to transfer?

I am a manager at my job. I have a coworker who is also a manager but one step above me but not my boss. 

Since I started 2 years ago the people under me and myself have had issues because this woman is unorganized, lazy and very rude. Yelling and screaming at people over minor things because she gets stressed. 

The reason she gets stressed is because she's always so disorganized she forgets people's breaks, doesn't stay on top of her tasks and then when it's time for her to go, me or whoever else is still there after her has to finish. 

I've brought this up to my boss. I explained how multiple people have told me they want to and now have quit because of her. I've also brought up issues with the scheduling and how certain things don't make sense and I gave my input on suggestions. 

Long story short he brushed it off and did nothing about it. So after that I stopped being so involved and kept more to myself. 

So now I've been asked to temporarily help at another location due to some staffing issues. And honestly it's been very peaceful there. And I go home not as stressed or exhausted as I used to. I've learned more and the way things are structured there the flow works better for me even with their staffing issues. I've developed quite a bit in the short time I've been there and could see myself developing more than at my original spot. 

So I requested a transfer. The manager at the new place also wants me to transfer because she could use my help, she's known me for a long time and I already fit in with the team and have my stuff down. 

My boss is against it and is upset I don't want to go back to his location. I was even scheduled there 1 day this week and I called off to not go there. He's blaming me for ruining his vacation plans etc. 

Without his approval I can't transfer. The DM above him likely won't let me either because honestly I am a great worker. I won Employee of the year 2 years in a row and if I transfer it would be under a different DM so it's not his jurisdiction. 

The manager at the new location also feels caught in between because she really wants me to stay with her but she's good friends with my original boss and he's accusing her of poaching me. 

I feel bad but I'm trying to do what's best for me. If I end up forced at my original spot I'll probably just quit as soon as I can because before I did this helping out situation I was secretly applying and interviewing for jobs daily in order to get out of that place. 

I had a conversation with my boss to let him know all the reasons I want to leave and he basically brushed everything aside and had an answer for everything. 

I'm really trying to be professional but I'm at the point if I get yelled at by this woman or have to deal with more of the nonsense I shouldn't have to I'll probably just walk out whether I have another job or not.",Outside_Attorney_799,5,1.0,2,1696119944,2023-10-01 00:25:44,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/16wmofy/boss_wont_let_me_transfer/,10,2023
16wmkd9,Boss told me not to come in for my last week.,"I put in my 2 week notice. A week later I was told that they did not need me to come in for the last week and that I would still be paid for that week. This conversation happened at the end of my shift (verbally). I know they were interviewing other candidates as soon as they got my notice, so I assume they made an offer already to someone. Anyways, what should I do in order to cover my ass? Should I contact HR or send an email to my boss about the conversation?

16wm872,How do people learn tools their company doesn't use?,"While completing grad school I was really drawn to using data and technology to solve business problems. I found some online courses and heavily studied Tableau, PowerBI, and SQL. 

Unfortunately, when it came time to apply for jobs, everyone wanted years of 'real world experience' with their specific tools. Eventually, I got a management position working with developers and I did get a lot of hands-on time with my company's tools.

However, since then all kinds of tools have popped up that seem to be the new hotness. Everyone is using 'Looker', which is Google's BI tool and I never heard of it before. Salesforce has essentially taken over everything and has like a dozen additional modules now.

So how do I 'keep up' with all this tech that my company isn't using?
